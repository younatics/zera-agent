"Sheffield United have not closed the door on the return of rapist Ched Evans to Bramall Lane. Sources on Saturday night distanced the club from reports suggesting a board-level decision will be taken on Sunday against offering the Wales striker a route back into the game in response to the backlash caused by his plan to resume training with United. Nigel Clough admitted the Ched Evans controversy had affected everybody at the club . Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask for her name to be removed if Ched Evans is offered a deal at Sheffield United . Sheffield athlete Ennis-Hill has her name on a stand at Bramall Lane . An unrepentant Evans, 25, was released from prison last month after serving two and a half years of a five-year sentence. He remains in line to rejoin his former team-mates this week after the Blades answered a plea from the Professional Footballers’ Association. Speaking after Saturday's 1-0 derby win at League One rivals Doncaster, Sheffield United manager Nigel Clough said: ‘It’s been a difficult week and it’s great to finish it with three points after such adversity. ‘It’s not been easy for anybody at the club but all we can do is our bit on the pitch. We’ve not really sat down and discussed things in depth as a squad, but it’s affected everybody at the club.’ Sheffield United supporters remain split after a turbulent week that has seen sponsors threaten to pull out and Olympic golden girl Jessica Ennis-Hill receive Twitter threats after demanding her name be removed from a stand at Bramall Lane if Evens is offered a contract. In the first game since his potential return was announced, chants of ‘Super Ched Evans’ were quickly drowned out by a vocal group among the 4,250 travelling fans clearly against Evans’ return. Ched Evans and his fiancée, Natasha Massey, were seen emerging in exercise clothes near their Cheshire home on Thursday as it was revealed the convicted rapist did not rejoin former team-mates at United .

"Rookie full backs Nathaniel Clyne and Kieran Gibbs offered an encouraging glimpse into the future by playing an important part in breaking down Slovenia at Wembley. With no Leighton Baines, Glen Johnson and Ashley Cole on show, it was left to the newer generation to shine. And they made light of the fact they only had four caps between them before the game – compared to the 180 won in total by the aforementioned trio. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Nathaniel Clyne was comfortable in his own half and a threat going forward for England . England defender Kieran Gibbs also impressed against Slovenia after stepping in for Leighton Baines . Clyne and Gibbs are thoroughly modern full backs; quick, mobile and equally comfortable in either half of the pitch. They didn't lack in confidence either. Clyne, 23, was first to impress on his international debut. During a turgid opening 45 minutes, he was England's brightest attacking hope, one attacking burst left his marker flat-footed down the right-hand side led to a good chance for Raheem Sterling . Gibbs takes exception to a decision from the referee of England looks dejected . Clyne found himself regularly fending off Slovenia's Andraz Kirm (right) Clyne is a cool customer, his development in south London at Crystal Palace was a tough schooling and he has progressed nicely on the south coast at Southampton, who sit second in the Premier League. Given the nod ahead of ex-Southampton youngster Calum Chambers, Clyne took up advanced positions early on, always available to playmaker Jack Wilshere, and there was encouraging inter-play with Danny Welbeck down the right-hand side. Gibbs of Arsenal took longer to settle but can look back on the game with equal satisfaction, despite being England's only player in the book for catching Valter Birsa down the back of the leg as the Slovenian tried to shield the ball. Clyne (right) gets physical with Slovenian midfielder Kirm after getting the nod ahead of Calum Chambers . Clyne clears without fuss under pressure from Slovenia's Andraz Kirm . To show his resolve, Gibbs responded immediately by winning the ball back and forcing a corner that led to Phil Jagielka's header being saved by Samir Handanovic. After England levelled, Gibbs – who will face long-term competition from Baines and Manchester United teenager Luke Shaw for his place – seemed to get forward even more. And he played an important part between Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling to help set up England's best goal of the evening, Danny Welbeck's third in a 3-1 victory. For so long, England were sluggish against Slovenia. If anything it was the energy of the two inexperienced defenders that kept them going through a difficult period. One senses Clyne and Gibbs will be given another chance by Hodgson, maybe in Scotland on Tuesday, though Shaw is also available for that one. Clyne (front row centre) and Gibbs (front row right) take their place in the starting 11's team photo . Leighton Baines was forced out of the side due to an injury picked up in England training . England boss Roy Hodgson was more than satisfied with the young duo's performance. 'I thought Nathaniel was excellent in his first game,' said Hodgson after the 3-1 win. 'He and Kieran Gibbs did well, particularly as Gibbs only got his call to play quite late because Leighton was going to be in the team. 'The two of them played high up the field like we wanted them to and they defended very solidly. 'Nathaniel has to be delighted with his debut and he and Danny Welbeck would have challenged Jack for his man of the match. But I thought Jack was outstanding.'","England defeated Slovenia 3-1 at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night .

"The Congresswoman whose baby survived after a pre-natal diagnosis of an extremely rare and largely fatal condition has opened up about her 'miracle' daughter who was the first known survival story. 'The doctors said, ""It's 100 per cent fatal. She will either be stillborn, you'll miscarry, or she will suffocate in your arms after she's born,""' Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler told People magazine. Her daughter, Abigail, is now nine months old and healthy and crying like other children her age- but the difference in her case is that there was a large chance she was going to be born without lungs. Big steps: Though Abigail is still on dialysis as she awaits a kidney transplant, her happy parents Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Beutler are able to live with her at their home in Washington state . Abigail is one of the 1 in 3,000 children who is afflicted with Potter sequence, wherein the fetus does not have kidneys or lungs. Even though doctors said she would never survive, Mrs Beutler and her husband made the decision not to have an abortion. 'As the doctor is saying these things, I could feel her moving. To me, that was a sign I was not going to be the one that ends this pregnancy,' the 35-year-old new mom told People. After announcing that her then-unborn child had the condition, a parent whose child had a similar disease reached out to Mrs Beutler and suggested she try an experimental treatment that helped save their son. Jessica Bienstock, a doctor at Johns Hopkins Hospital who specializes in high-risk pregnancies, had developed a way to inject a small amount of saline into the womb that acts create substitute amniotic fluid. Growing rapidly: Jaime Herrera Beutler and her husband Dan first publicized their daughter's condition two months after she was born (pictured then) but have now opened up about how she continues to improve dramatically . Miracle: Abigail Beutler is the first known case where a child survived after being diagnosed with Potter's syndrome, which causes babies to be born without lungs or kidneys . Fetuses with Potter's syndrome are not able to produce their own amniotic fluid because they are missing the organs- the kidneys- that are normally tasked with that job. Babies with Potter Sequence typically die within a few days of being born- if not instantly, according to the National Institute of Health. The most dangerous aspect of the condition is that the victims are born without kidneys, which normally produce amniotic fluid. Because the amniotic fluid is not produced, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus, which can lead to abnormal facial and limb development. The condition may also stunt the development of the lungs. The experimental new step that the Beutler's decided to take was to have a small amount of saline injected into the womb which acted as a substitute form of amniotic fluid and helped the baby's lungs form. The amniotic fluid helps allow the lungs to grow, and although an expert in the new procedure, even Dr Bienstock was not confident about the results in the Beutler's case. There were some signs of progress, however, that helped convince the Republican Congresswoman and her law student husband know that they were on the right track. One such instance came when the baby's head, which was at first mishapen, suddenly grew to the normal shape and its little legs were initially clubbed and then corrected themselves. 'The difference between 0 per cent hope and 0.00001 per cent hope is enormous,' Dan Beutler said to the magazine. Abigail, who was born weighing only 2lbs 12oz stayed in intensive care for the first five months of her life before being deemed healthy enough to go home. 'She’s playing. She will scream when her diaper is dirty. She is like any other baby. She has a few challenges, but man, she’s determined,' Mrs Beutler said during a Today Show interview less than two months after the baby was born. The saline injection helped produce lungs for the newborn but she is not fully out of the woods as she still does not have kidneys. Miracle baby: Jamie and Daniel Beutler can now hold their daughter Abigail, who was born with a rare and usually fatal condition . She is being treated with dialysis and will need a transplant but that is expected to come from her father Dan, who is a possible match. Mrs Beutler commutes to Washington D.C. from her home state of Washington in the northwest corner of the country, but her husband has taken time off from school to care for their daughter full time. The ongoing treatment is expensive, and People estimates that it costs about $260,000 but that is a price the couple is happy to pay given the grim prospects they first faced. Abigail's story is already helping others, as a mother in Colorado was given the same diagnosis and she talked to her doctor about 'this Congresswoman doing amnio infusions'. They then underwent the same procedure and the baby was born with a healthy set of lungs. Mr Beutler said that like most parents, they were determined to never give up, and has advised families facing a similar situation to find a doctor willing to help. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (right) is pictured with her husband, Daniel, and House Speaker John Boehner during a mock swearing in. Herrera has announced that her unborn child has Potter Sequence . He added: 'There's no guaranteed solutions and there's no magical cures ... but don't be satisfied with just one opinion because there's a lot of intelligent doctors with different perspectives and experiences. On a Facebook page announcing the baby's birth, the Beutlers revealed how they refused to give up on their baby. 'Multiple doctors explained that based on medical evidence her condition was incompatible with life and that, if she survived to term, she would be unable to breathe and live only moments after birth,' they wrote. 'We were also told that dialysis or transplant were not possible. The options we were offered were termination or “expectant management,” that is, waiting for her to die. Instead, we chose to pray earnestly for a miracle.'","Congresswoman Jaime Herrera Beutler, 35, gave birth to her first daughter Abigail in July and the baby is doing well in spite of a dangerous diagnosis .

"Danny Care blamed England’s lack of discipline for their fifth straight defeat to a southern hemisphere side. Stuart Lancaster’s men lost hooker Dylan Hartley to the sin bin after 61 minutes for a cynical stamp on Duane Vermeulen’s knee while a string of breakdown penalties allowed Springbok Pat Lambie to kick nine points, as well as two conversions. In another incident, an unidentified England player faces being cited after New Zealand referee Steve Walsh was overheard confirming dangerous play in the first half. England captain Chris Robshaw looked devastated after the final whistle as England were beaten again . England scrum half Danny Care is adamant they have 'self-belief' but their discipline 'let them down' Citing commissioner Douglas Hunter was on Saturday night looking for television evidence which could incriminate an England player after Springbok flanker Schalk Burger was left with blood pouring from a head wound following an off-the-ball incident. ‘It was a cheap shot that caused the blood,’ Walsh was heard telling one of his touch judges. ‘It was obviously an illegal clear-out. We’ll look at it afterwards.’ Hartley cannot be cited as he received a yellow card for his stamp on Vermeulen, but Care admitted England’s indiscretions had proved costly. England hooker Dylan Hartley was sin-binned on 61 minutes for a cynical stamp on Duane Vermeulen . ‘Our discipline let us down,’ said Care, who was winning his 50th cap. ‘Perhaps it is because we were trying too hard because we so badly wanted to win. ‘I know people will write us off now but I know the self-belief there is in this side and that we will come back strong and our confidence will not be dented.’ England skipper Chris Robshaw said he and his team-mates failed to show enough aggression early on. South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England . ‘We were a little bit reactive today,’ he said. ‘We allowed them to get ahead of us and then we were playing catch-up. We’ll have to work hard and move forward next week. ‘We didn’t start as strongly as we would’ve liked. We got back into the game, but couldn’t quite finish it.’ Meanwhile, another close encounter saw France hang on with 14 men to beat Australia 29-26. The game looked dead and buried before Remi Tales was given a yellow card for cynically killing the ball at a ruck, but while Australia managed a try to get in reach, they couldn’t quite finish the job.

"You wouldn’t need a big restaurant to organise a lunch for the England teams who have beaten the All Blacks in New Zealand. It has happened just twice — in 1973 and 2003 — but Stuart Lancaster’s side can join those guys on the top table if they play their cards correctly this week. They were very good in Auckland but in Dunedin they must play like world-beaters. This is by a long chalk the biggest week yet for England under Lancaster. He has a large squad of hungry, in-form players to select from — and that is a situation that needs to be managed — but this is the moment to go ruthlessly for a result that would firstly define their own careers and then reverberate around the globe. They mustn’t let this moment pass them by. Proud: England's players fought valiantly but were defeated by New Zealand in Auckland . Close: England skipper Chris Robshaw looks dejected after his team's narrow defeat . This . is when that proud England rugby culture and team ethic which Lancaster . has worked hard to re-establish must come into its own. Some players . who excelled at Eden Park will need to be dropped — sport can be harsh — . but they also need to be valued for their contribution. Meanwhile, . those who were resting in the stands must immediately honour that . performance by their colleagues in Auckland with something very special . of their own. It’s a fascinating dynamic and very rarely seen in New . Zealand, where an All Blacks win in the first Test normally means the . series is dead and buried. New . Zealand are masterly at post-match analysis and ‘working out’ the . opposition but this time  England can set them entirely fresh problems . and challenges. Decisions: England coach Stuart Lancaster will have some selection choices to make in Dunedin . Physical: England went toe to toe with New Zealand on their own back yard in Auckland . Assuming no . injuries, I would bring Danny Care and Owen Farrell in at half-back, . pair Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell  at centre and move Manu . Tuilagi to the left wing. Up front, despite a very fine performance by . Geoff Parling, Courtney Lawes has to play in the second row and I would . bring Tom Wood and Billy Vunipola into the back row. New . Zealand won’t concede so many penalties as they did on Saturday so . England will need to score two or three tries to win. They need the . firepower the incomers can provide and conditions will be perfect at the . indoor Forsyth Bar Stadium and that has to be the focus in training . this week. This scenario . reminds me a lot of the England tour to South Africa in 2000. The team . was developing nicely after the disappointment of the 1999 World Cup . when we lost to New Zeland and South Africa, but we badly needed a . landmark win ‘on the road’ against one of the giants to bolster the . squad’s self-belief and rock the rugby world. Heartbreak: England must bounce back from their loss and keep the series alive with victory in Dunedin . Victories . on their patch count double. We nearly got it in Pretoria, in fact we . should have won at Loftus Versveld and I will go to my grave thinking . that Tim Stimpson should have been awarded a penalty try when he was . taken out trying to dob down his own kick ahead. The TMO decided . otherwise and we finished up losing by five points, the same margin as . Saturday. I remember . vividly Lawence Dallaglio coming off the field that night and being both . very angry and positive. ‘We have to stop playing well and coming . second, it’s about winning these games,’  Lawrence snarled at the TV . cameras. Equally I was very . impressed and heartened to hear Chris Robshaw straight after Saturday’s . game talking about winning the series 2-1. There were no platitudes . about a great performance in defeat and a makeshift team playing bravely . and well — which they did — just an immediate grasping of the fantastic . opportunity ahead. Knock-out blow: All Blacks centre Conrad Smith scored the decisive try with two minutes left to play . Time to shine: If England play their cards right, they can join a small group to have won in England . Back . in 2000 we headed off to the rugby heartland of Bloemfontein and in . terms of rugby fanaticism and atmosphere, Dunedin won’t be far different . this week. Hardcore. We . were expected to make up the numbers. Pretoria was our shot at glory but . we absolutely believed and the result was a dominating performance and a . 27-22 win that took everybody by surprise and set us on our way. Bloemfontein . was a huge momentum changer in that team’s evolution. After that we . didn’t lose to a Southern Hemisphere team for four years — 14 straight . Tests — and England now have a golden chance to do something similar.","England can join the teams from 1973 and 2003 and win in New Zealand .

"She is the A-lister with an addiction to vertiginous heels who rarely steps out in public without a pair of Louboutins on her feet. She even famously said that she 'can't concentrate' in flat shoes - so it comes as no surprise that Victoria Beckham has been crowned the nation's celebrity shoe idol. According to the latest research, the former Spice Girl clinches the title of ‘best celebrity shoe style', narrowly beating Sarah Jessica Parker and Rita Ora to claim the top spot. Sky high: Victoria Beckham loves her heels sky high and is rarely spotted without a pair, so it comes as no surprise that she has been voted celebrity shoe idol . Curious to discover more about whether or not the nation is filled with shoe-obsessed shoppers, the study conducted a poll looking at British women’s preferences and purchasing habits when it comes to footwear. When asked to stipulate how many pairs of shoes they currently owned, the majority of respondents (43 per cent) said between 10 - 50 pairs while a quarter claimed they owned just 5 -10 pairs and 15 per cent admitted that they had simply lost count.

"She could have at least bought of pair of pants that fit . And the bride wore — a thong. Ill-fitting, at that! All those millions in the bank, and you can’t even get a pair of pants to fit you right. Big things were expected from the wedding of heiress Tamara Ecclestone to her boyfriend of five minutes Jay WotsisName. And in the end, the event held in the South of France did not disappoint. Tamara’s all-white beach party was less Gatsbyesque than cr**sbyesque, but I loved the way she thundered around in her thong, drank shots, groin-danced with a pal and threw herself into the sea. It was just like a hen party in Magaluf, only with slightly nicer wine and less vomit. How absolutely lovely. And we must all wish Tamara well. Despite all that loot, the bouffant-haired socialite hasn’t had it easy! She may have found love with Thingy, but think of the humiliation dished out by long-standing boyfriend Omar Khyami. He was filmed having sex with someone else, while wearing love tokens — bracelets and jewellery — that Tamara had given him. So what did she do in revenge? She did what all girls like her do — she got a tattoo. So empowering! That’ll show him. Tamara turned to Marilyn Monroe, another doomed dame who was a disastrous chooser of men, for inspiration. The wedding party looked more like a hen party in Magaluf but with less vomit and nicer wine . On her shoulder, she now has a tattoo of a quote from the Hollywood legend, which reads: ‘Sometimes good things fall apart so better ones can fall together.’ It is what any shallow heiress would deem as profound.

"Gordon Brown is being urged by Labour MPs to make a return to frontline politics and take on Scotland's next First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Senior members of Ed Miliband's inner circle are increasingly alarmed at the performance of 'unimpressive' Scottish leader Johann Lamont and believe Mr Brown could write a 'new ending for his political career' in Holyrood. He could become 'the father of the nation', one insider suggested. Scroll down for video . Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown is being urged to return to frontline politics to take on new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon . The pleas came as Miss Sturgeon made history yesterday after being lined up as the next First Minister - making her the first woman to reach the top of Scottish politics. As nominations for the job of SNP leader closed, it was confirmed that no Nationalist politician had been brave enough to challenge Miss Sturgeon, who will now enjoy an official coronation next month. In a move critics immediately branded 'unstatesmanlike', the leader-elect announced she will embark on a nationwide tour to speak to SNP supporters in the coming days - including an event at Glasgow's SSE Hydro. She also risked infuriating the majority of Scots who voted No in last month's referendum by claiming that Scotland will become independent 'well' within her lifetime. Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday wrote to Miss Sturgeon to congratulate her and said he looked forward to working with her. The three main parties at Holyrood will now be led by women but there are ongoing rumours about Miss Lamont's future. Although Scots strongly backed the Union in last month's referendum, the Yes campaign's triumph in Labour's heartlands of Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire - including in Miss Lamont's own seat of Glasgow Pollok - has alarmed the Westminster party. But Mr Brown is credited with revitalising the No campaign and made the most impressive speech of the referendum campaign on the eve of the poll. The Kirkcaldy and Cowhim. denbeath MP hinted during the referendum campaign that he could stand for the Scottish parliament, although he has since played down the prospects of a return. But a Shadow Cabinet source said: 'Everyone has come back from Scotland shocked by how bad things are in the party there. Johann Lamont is deeply unimpressive - she has got to go. 'My worry is that Nicola Sturgeon could be an even tougher opponent than Alex Salmond was. She has more appeal to women and we are going to find ourselves in real trouble unless we respond.' Miss Sturgeon made history yesterday after being lined up as the next First Minister - making her the first woman to reach the top of Scottish politics . The SNP angrily rejected comparisons between Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher . Nationalist MPs reacted furiously yesterday after Scotland Office Minister David Mundell congratulated Nicola Sturgeon on 'emulating' Margaret Thatcher. Mr Mundell, Scotland's only Tory MP, cheekily told the SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson: 'I join the honourable gentleman in congratulating Nicola Sturgeon on emulating Margaret Thatcher and becoming the first female leader of her party. 'I most certainly look forward to working with her as the first female First Minister of Scotland. My previous experience of Nicola Sturgeon is that she has adopted a constructive approach to discussions with the UK Government.' But, speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Robertson replied: 'There is absolutely no comparison between Nicola Sturgeon and Margaret Thatcher. 'Nicola Sturgeon will be leading the most popular political party in Scotland. 'Margaret Thatcher destroyed the Tory party, and he [Mr Mundell] is the living proof of its having only one seat in Scotland.' Another senior Labour source said: 'Gordon could go to the Scottish parliament for four or five years and become the father of the nation, like Donald Dewar was. We need He is still hugely popular in Scotland. The SNP are running rings round Johann Lamont.' One Scots MP said: 'There is real concern that we don't have leadership in Scotland. It would delight many if Gordon would take control.' The Mail understands there was a 'gloomy' private meeting of Scottish Labour MPs in the Commons on Tuesday evening, in which the fall-out from last month's referendum was discussed. Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt yesterday said there had been a 'fracture in the Labour movement' in Scotland, which the party now needs to move quickly to heal. One insider said the party was 'fearful' of a 'drubbing' by the SNP at next year's General Election, which could force Miss Lamont to stand down. By then, 44-year-old Miss Sturgeon will be Scotland's fifth First Minister after replacing her 'mentor' Alex Salmond, who resigned after last month's humiliating referendum defeat. Miss Sturgeon joined the SNP at the age of 16 and stood - unsuccessfully - to be an MP when she was 21. She stood for the party's leadership in 2004 but was heading for defeat in the battle against Roseanna Cunningham, prompting Mr Salmond to come back on a 'dream ticket' with Miss Sturgeon as his deputy. She has been Deputy First Minister since the SNP's first election victory in 2007, also holding the role of Health Secretary until put in charge of the referendum fight. 'It is a privilege to have been chosen by the SNP to succeed Alex Salmond as party leader,' she said yesterday. 'Alex is a hard act to follow but I am determined to lead the SNP - and the country - from strength to strength. 'I will work to ensure that the Scottish parliament gets the extensive new powers that Scotland was promised before the referendum. 'I will always make the case for Scotland to be an independent country, but with the Westminster parties already backsliding on the delivery of new powers, my immediate job will be to hold them firmly to account - and I am today putting them on notice that I intend to do just that.' Speaking to the BBC News channel, she said: 'I believe Scotland will become an independent country. I believe that's the direction of travel.' Pressed when that would happen, she replied: 'I believe that would be well within my lifetime.' On the rise of women to lead Scotland's political parties, Miss Sturgeon said: 'It is significant - it sends a very powerful message... [but] I don't think we should assume it's job done on gender balance.'","Ex-PM being urged to return to frontline Labour politics in Scotland .

"The pain goes on for England. This was the game they knew they needed to win, but instead it ended with a fifth successive defeat and the prospect of a demoralising autumn campaign. After last week’s fourth straight loss to world champions New Zealand, Stuart Lancaster’s national team were well aware of the urgent need for a result to ease growing pressure. Instead, they were beaten at home once more and their long wait for a victory over South Africa – a feat last achieved in 2006 – goes on. This was a shattering outcome and will leave England to clutch at straws again. Elements of their performance were impressive – particularly their driving maul which yielded two tries, their scrum and the exploits of their ball-carrying No 8s; first Billy Vunipola and then Ben Morgan. Mike Brown also made regular in-roads from full-back. VIDEO Scroll down to see where Stuart Lancaster feels England lost the game .

Just 10 months from now, England will go into a home World Cup and their ambition was to have turned Twickenham into a ‘fortress’ by then. Instead, it is a venue where the southern giants do not arrive with trepidation. While a selection reshuffle and a game against Samoa next week may generate much-needed hope and confidence, the key pointers are the Tests against the SANZAR countries and England are struggling against them. The showdown with Australia on November 29 now looms as a fixture of colossal significance. Lose that one and this will have been a disastrous November series. England had been anticipating good weather for this match, but in fact there was a long spell of pre-match rain which made conditions difficult for handling. There was moisture in the air and also on the emotional face of Billy Vunipola. The Saracens No 8 was in tears during the anthem – signifying the importance of this game to him personally and to the home team as a whole. Lancaster’s men had much to improve from last week, but they made a dazzling start against the All Blacks and they were similarly dynamic from the off this time. An early lineout catch and drive allowed Danny Care and Owen Farrell to release Kyle Eastmond, who made a nimble half-break, only to knock on in the tackle. Farrell was another of the England players who needed to raise his game after an off-colour display against New Zealand. However, the fly-half left his team scrambling desperately in the 10th minute when he attempted to counter-attack from his own 22 and release Anthony Watson, but the Springboks flooded the ruck, won turn-over ball and so nearly scored a try in the left corner. As it was, they were awarded a penalty which Patrick Lambie kicked for a 3-0 lead. Shortly afterwards, the visitors surged further ahead as Care suffered a calamity on his 50th Test appearance. England were patiently probing in the opposition half when the scrum-half had a pass intercepted by Jan Serfontein, who raced clear to score at the posts and Lambie converted. A 10-point deficit represented an English crisis and Mike Brown responded in fine style, with a scorching midfield break from a high kick, but he was stopped by Cobus Reinach on the Boks’ 22 and the move broke down. Then in the 24th minute, England should have had hit back with a try, only to fluff their opportunity. Danny Care seized on a ruck turn-over and broke to the right and the ball was worked to Dave Attwood who galloped clear. But the big Bath lock didn’t release Watson when he had a clear run to the line and by the time he took a tackle and off-loaded, the space had been closed up. Jonny May went close on the other flank, but a glorious opening had been squandered .

For the remainder of the first half, the game became disjointed and attritional, with both captains warned by referee Steve Walsh about deliberately collapsing mauls. England had the advantage in the scrum, but they couldn’t make a dent in South Africa’s imperious lineout and the Springboks were causing problems for the hosts at the breakdown. A penalty by Farrell put his team on the scoreboard and after Lambie had struck back at the other end, the England No 10 added another kick to ensure it was a one-score game going into the break. Any up-turn in optimism among home supporters was shattered seconds after the re-start, as South Africa conjured a sensational try. As England’s defence came up fast, Lambie’s clever kick over the top was taken by Willie Le Roux and the full back burst into the 22 before a brilliant back-hand off-load sent Cobus Reinach away to touch down. Lambie converted comfortably. Three minutes later, just as they were staring down the barrel, England were given renewed hope. Another powerful rolling maul was dragged by down the Boks and Victor Matfield was shown the yellow card. A week earlier, Lancaster’s side had been unable to capitalise when the All Blacks were reduced to 14 men, but this time they rallied strongly. Their driving game was causing chaos and from the penalty they kicked to the corner, took the lineout cleanly and the pack surged in-field, forcing David Wilson over for his maiden Test try. Farrell duly added the extras. The same method created another English try three minutes later, as South Africa’s depleted forwards were marched back through their 22 before Ben Morgan – on for Vunipola – twisted free and pounded through three defenders to score. Again Farrell converted and England were on terms. Victor Matfield was shown a yellow card after collapsing a maul following warnings to both sides by referee Steve Walsh .

England's Ben Morgan twists in the tackle to get the ball down for England's second try . Another try for the England forwards comes from Morgan as the home side make the most of the one-man advantage . Yet, parity was short-lived, as South Africa responded in kind. Their pack had been under the cosh, but they delivered another strong maul from an attacking lineout and Schalk Burger charged down the blindside to strike in the corner. Lambie couldn’t convert from the wide angle, but he added a penalty 13 minutes from time. By then, England had lost Dylan Hartley to the sin-bin, after the hooker was adjudged to have trampled on Duane Vermeulen at the bottom of a maul. They were also hampered by the fact that Farrell was clearly in pain, but the coaches appeared reluctant to remove him. Eventually, George Ford was brought on and his 68th-minute penalty put England in range of their rivals, but they kept succumbing to execution errors and disciplinary lapses, and a Lambie drop goal appeared to put the result beyond doubt. In fact, Brad Barritt’s try at the end of a sustained onslaught revived faint hope, but there was no time left for the hosts to snatch the result they so desperately craved.

"A multi-millionaire football club chairman accused of making anti-Semitic and racist remarks faced calls to quit last night. Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan provoked a storm of criticism by reportedly saying Jews ‘chase money’ and suggesting it was acceptable to call Chinese people ‘chinks’. Yesterday the 77-year-old tried to defend himself by insisting he has ‘hundreds and hundreds of Jewish friends’ – but Jonathan Arkush, of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, branded the alleged comments ‘outrageous and offensive’. Wigan chairman Dave Whelan created a storm of criticism in the wake of Malky Mackay's appointment . Mr Whelan said Jews ‘chase money’ and suggested it was acceptable to call Chinese people ‘chinks’ He added: ‘His half-hearted apology does not go far enough. You cannot insult a whole group of people, and then say, “I would never insult them”, and hope that’s OK.’ Mr Whelan’s comments reportedly came as he tried to defend his appointment of Malky Mackay as the club’s new manager. Mr Mackay is currently the subject of a Football Association investigation following offensive texts he allegedly sent while manager of Cardiff City. However, Mr Whelan is said to have found little offence in messages referring to Cardiff’s Malaysian owner Vincent Tan as a ‘chink’, or others referring to Jewish people pursuing money. Labour MP Ivan Lewis, who is Jewish, told BBC Radio Manchester that both men appeared to share the same ‘abhorrent anti-Semitic and racist views’. Calling for the Wigan chairman to step down, he added: ‘In my view the FA has to now take the toughest possible action against Dave Whelan.’ Yesterday Mr Whelan apologised for causing any offence – but the controversy deepened as he tried to justify his comments, saying: ‘I would never, ever insult a Jewish person. I have got hundreds and hundreds of Jewish friends.’ Mr Whelan’s comments came as he tried to defend his appointment of Mackay as the club’s new manager . Mr Mackay is currently the subject of a Football Association investigation following offensive texts he allegedly sent to Iain Moody, then head of recruitment, while manager of Cardiff City . He had reportedly told The Guardian: ‘The Jews don’t like losing money. Nobody likes losing money.’ He later told the BBC: ‘I don’t think there’s anything wrong in chasing money, because we work for it’. Claiming he also had ‘loads of Chinese friends’, he said: . ‘If somebody says to a Chinaman “You’re a chink”, would he be upset about it? I don’t know really. If he was, I would say “I’m very sorry, I won’t call you that again”.’ Mr Tan reacted angrily to Mr Whelan’s comments, saying: ‘This is a racist chairman hiring a racist manager.’ He said he thought Mr Whelan had ‘insulted the dignity’ of all Jewish and Chinese people. Vincent Tan reacted angrily to Mr Whelan, saying: ‘This is a racist chairman hiring a racist manager' Anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out called for tough action against Mr Whelan, saying: ‘He has brought into question whether he is a fit and proper person who should be running a professional football club.’ However, Hull manager Steve Bruce claimed that words ‘can be misplaced’, while former England manager Graham Taylor described Mr Whelan as ‘good and honest’. The FA has launched an investigation into the matter.","Wigan chairman Dave Whelan caused outrage saying Jews 'chase money'

"James DeGale almost knocked Marco Antonio Periban through the ropes - then branded Carl Froch a coward for not fighting him. DeGale risked his status as mandatory challenger to Froch's IBF title by taking on the tough Mexican, a previous world title challenger.

DeGale said: 'He's never been stopped, Sakio Bika couldn't stop him and I was only getting warmed up. That left hand is my shot at the moment. I hit him and he was stumbling around, he wasn’t in a position to carry on. 'I'll come out and watch George Groves but don't worry about him, I am the mandatory for the IBF title - I want to make history. 'I like Carl but it feels like he doesn't want to fight me, I respect him but I think he's being a bit of a coward not fighting me - fight me or vacate the title.' Froch responded: 'It was a great performance by James, he was landing a lot of big shots and switching and he did the job with what was in front of him. 'Boxing is a business, I have a promoter and if the fight makes financial sense, it will happen. I want to fight in Las Vegas and if anyone has the right to pick and choose where they fight, it's me.' DeGale has long been frustrated in his efforts to secure a fight at the highest level as he bids to become the first Olympic champion from Britain to win a professional world title. Froch has until New Year's Eve to decide whether to face his younger rival or relinquish his title. DeGale is likely to get a title shot in 2015 regardless of whether Froch vacates his title or not . DeGale celebrates with a victory jig in the middle of the ring after an impressive night's work . DeGale looks to the the sky in victory as he celebrates in trademark style . Either way, DeGale should finally get his chance early next year. Victory in that fight could also set him up for a mouthwatering rematch with long-time rival Groves. The pair have been bitter enemies since their amateur days and Groves outpointed DeGale in 2011. They also clashed backstage on Friday after weighing in for their respective fights. Periban, meanwhile, was a pound over the limit after his second attempt to make weight and was much the bigger man in the ring. The 30 year old lost his challenge for Sakio Bika's WBC belt last year and was without a win in his last three contests. And he was on the back foot from the first bell as DeGale dominated the exchanges with the cleaner, crisper work. Then, in the third round, a left hook sent Periban to the deck and referee Howard Foster immediately waved it off despite the floored man's protests.","James DeGale knocked out Marco Antonio Periban in third round of super-middleweight fight in Liverpool .

"You'd forgive Danny Welbeck for feeling a sense of de ja vu on Saturday. Not only was he playing against Manchester United for the first time since leaving on transfer deadline day but, once more, we caught a glimpse of Welbeck the winger. The England international has spent his Arsenal career as the main man; the central striker - playing in the position he so craved during his time at Old Trafford. VIDEO Scroll down to watch  Wenger: We dominated United but weren't efficient defensively . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck played his first game against his former side since his summer move . Welbeck is closed down by Manchester United defender Paddy McNair during the first half . The majority of Welbeck's touches came outside the area - click HERE to see more of our brilliant match zone . So you can only wonder what was going through his mind when he started the clash on the left wing, with Alexis Sanchez starting through the centre. Occupying the left-flank at United was often a frustration for Welbeck, but with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie ahead of him in the pecking order it was the only way he could get a game under Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes. Welbeck had been warned a move wide was coming, Arsene Wenger all but confirmed he would on Friday now Olivier Giroud - who started the match on the bench - is fit again. It wasn't long, though, before we saw Welbeck moved back into his preferred role in the centre. Likewise, it wasn't long before he was shifted back out wide - and then back to a central striker position for the end of first half. Maybe, it was Wenger's way of easing him into a longer stint on the left flank once Giroud is fully match fit. And, almost inevitably, Wenger sent Welbeck back out wide - to the right this time - once Giroud was introduce in the 77th minute. You wonder what Welbeck was thinking when Giroud scored?

"Luke Shaw became Manchester United's 40th injury of the season on Saturday evening, but Louis van Gaal was still able to have the last laugh after a 2-1 victory against Arsenal. United entered the game with five defensive absentees - the inexperienced pair of Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett were part of a back-five - and Shaw made it six when he had to be substituted after just 16 minutes. Despite their problems, the visitors went on to win 2-1, and Van Gaal admitted he was very happy with his first away win as manager of Manchester United.

It's the first away victory, so the players were very excited in the dressing room. But it's only one victory. We have to win two more at home. Then we can say, ""okay, we have the spirit now.""'

"Scott Quigg successfully defended his WBA super-bantamweight world title for the fifth time against Hidenori Ohtake who suffered his first defeat in seven years. Quigg was taken the distance by the Japanese visitor in Liverpool on Saturday night, winning almost every round in what was a workmanlike victory. The 26-year-old from Bury will now hope his promoter Eddie Hearn can deliver a career-defining unification clash against Carl Frampton or Leo Santa Cruz when he returns to the ring in March. Scott Quigg successfully defended his WBA world super bantamweight title with a win over Hidenori Ohtake . Quigg celebrates his victory in Liverpool as he retained his world super bantamweight crown . Ohtake was fighting outside of Japan for the first time in his career but his only defeat came on points over five rounds in 2007. He had also never faced anyone with a losing record. But Quigg looked to take control from the first bell as he targeted the body, looking for one of his trademark finishes. In the second round, a right hook upstairs wobbled Ohtake who stumbled backwards but was able to see out the remainder of the three-minute session. Neither man was prepared to give an each as the fight continued on the inside in the third round with Ohtake matching the champion punch for punch. Ohtake had never fought outside his home country before and was something of an unknown for Quigg . Ohtake suffered a nasty cut above his right eye which had to be checked a few times by the doctor . Quigg continued to land his right hook to the head in rounds three and four but they proved to be brief successes rather than sustained attacks. With limited footage of the visiting Ohtake available, Quigg had gone into the fight slightly hampered but there was little doubt that the Japanese challenger was made of strong stuff. It wasn't until the eighth round that Quigg was able to find the room to let his hands go but Ohtake stood up to the onslaught. Ohtake had suffered a cut above his right eye which the referee had the ringside doctor check in the tenth stanza but she cleared him to continue. Quigg (left) admitted his opponent was tough and very durable as he lasted the full distance . The officials went through the same procedure in the penultimate round but Ohtake soldiered on, despite the blood running down his face and withstood a fierce left hook on the bell. Ohtake rallied in the final session, knowing he needed a knockout to win but was unable to land the telling blow. All three judges gave Quigg the nod, by scores of 119-109 twice and 118-110. Quigg said: 'I tell you what, I know his head is tough, I tried to pour on the gas at the end and landed some great combinations but he wasn't going nowhere and fair play to him, but 12 rounds is never a bad thing to get under your belt.'","Scott Quigg records comfortable points win in Liverpool .

"Ireland laid down a heroic World Cup marker by producing a stunning defensive effort to keep Australia at bay in Dublin. The Aussies fought back from 17-0 down at the Aviva Stadium to take a three-point lead just before half-time. But Joe Schmidt’s men weren’t to be denied their first autumn Test series clean sweep since 2006 and it leaves Australia — who also lost 29-26 to France — desperate to avoid the humiliation of a hat-trick of November defeats when they round off their tour against England at Twickenham on Saturday . Simon Zebo raced onto Jonny Sexton's perfectly judged crossfield kick to give Ireland a dream start after 10 minutes .

Adam Ashley-Cooper (right) managers to track down Bowe but the Ulster flyer manages to touch down for Ireland's second try . Zebo tries to offload in the tackle but Bernard Foley does well to disrupt the Munster winger's pass . Ireland got off to a lightning start thanks to tries from Simon Zebo and Tommy Bowe, while Johnny Sexton booted 16 points. Australia scrum-half Nick Phipps crossed twice, with Bernard Foley claiming a third score for the visitors, but Ireland held firm under huge final-quarter pressure. Captain Paul O’Connell said: ‘It really is a good win. We couldn’t have had a better first 20 minutes and it was frustrating to let them back in in the next 20. Wallabies scrum half Nick Phipps intercepts Zebo's stray pass to race away unopposed and get his side back into the contest . New South Wales Waratahs flyer Israel Folau (left) takes on Ireland fullback Rob Kearney . Peter O'Mahoney gets an offload away under pressure from Wallabies winger Henry Speight . ‘But they are a fast side who put you under pressure and are probably further down the road in terms of match play than we are, so the way we finished off the game was very satisfying.’ Ireland will now go into World Cup year with a spring in their step after atoning for last year’s 32-15 defeat to Australia in combative style. It also provided some relief for coach Schmidt as it was later revealed he had been suffering from the effects of suspected appendicitis all day and had left the ground for medical tests straight after the final whistle. Folau and Kearney collide after contesting for a high ball during what was a frantic first 40 minutes of rugby at the Aviva Stadium . Ireland flanker O'Mahoney takes a high ball supported by hooker Rory Best (right) as Michael Hooper (right) watches on . On the pitch, Sexton kicked an early penalty before teeing up the game’s opening try with a precise kick which allowed Zebo to slide home. Bowe pulled off a keen-eyed interception and galloped over for a second try but Australia clawed one back when Phipps ntercepted Zebo’s pass to hare home. Foley’s conversion cut the deficit to 10 points. The Wallabies then scored a controversial second. Phipps’ scoring pass to Foley appeared forward, but was awarded by French television match official Eric Gauzins. Foley missed the conversion, though Phipps crossed again to level the scores. Foley’s penalty wrestled the visitors into the lead for the first time before Sexton tied the scores with the last kick of a breathless half. Sexton posted his third penalty after the restart before Foley responded, and the teams were still locked at 23-23 on the hour. Rob Kearney launched an ambitious drop-goal attempt from long range after a period of Irish pressure but his effort rebounded off the right-hand post. However, Sexton’s fourth penalty of the night did edge Ireland back into a three-point lead. Australia duly pegged Ireland back into their half for the remaining 16 minutes but, unlike in times past, this gritty group, conquerors of South Africa and Georgia over the last two weekends, bravely held out for a famous win.","Ireland led 17-0 early on thanks to tries from Simon Zebo and Tommy Bowe .

"Manchester United moved back into the top four of the Barclays Premier League with a 2-1 smash-and-grab raid at Arsenal. Antonio Valencia's shot was deflected in off Kieran Gibbs, whose collision with Wojciech Szczesny saw the Arsenal keeper substituted, on 55 minutes before, as the Gunners pressed, Wayne Rooney clipped in a second on the break. Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud marked his return from three months out with a broken ankle by netting a well-struck consolation in stoppage-time. Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel rates all the players' performances. ARSENAL (4-3-2-1) Wojciech Szczesny - 5 . Looked comfortable until his calamitous decision to come for Young's cross that led to United's opener and the Pole injuring a rib. Calum Chambers - 6 . Wasn't daunted by the task of shackling Di Maria. Looked a lot more assured than his last run out against Swansea. Per Mertesacker - 6 . Looked more assured than in previous matches, but still needs to improve. His lack of pace was exposed at times. Manchester United goalkeeper David de Gea made a succession of fine saves . Nacho Monreal - 5.5 . Again asked to play as a makeshift centre-back. Did a job, but the left-back looks so uncomfortable in the heart of defender. Kieran Gibbs - 5.5 . His lack of communication with Szczensy for United's opener cost Arsenal dear. A big blemish on an otherwise decent display. Mikel Arteta - 6.5 . Quietly went about his business in midfield and played a beautiful ball for Giroud's goal. 6.5 . Aaron Ramsey - 5.5 . Where are those dazzling midfield displays of last season? Kept things moving but still lacking last year's excellence. Jack Wilshere of Arsenal has a shot saved by  United goalkeeper De Gea . Jack Wilshere - 7 . It's going to be a restless night for the midfielder as he awaits a diagnosis on the ankle injury that saw him limp off. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain - 7.5 . A major threat down the right for Arsenal. Blackett had no answer to the England man at times. Danny Welbeck - 6.5 . Inter changed from the left wing to the centre throughout Saturday's clash. Missed two decent chances. Alexis Sanchez - 6.5 . Not up to the standard we've become accustomed, perhaps feeling the effects of the international break. Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez put in a lacklustre display after the international break . Subs . Santi Cazorla - 6 . Brought on for the injured Wilshere. Couldn't unlock the door. Emiliano Martinez - 5 . An unexpected substitution following Szczesny's injury. Only thing he really had to do was pick the ball out of the net. Olivier Giroud - 6.5 . Marked his long-awaited return from injury with a goal . Perhaps the only plus point from a miserable day for Arsenal. Subs not used . Rosicky, Podoloski, Giroud, Cazorla, Flamini, Martinez, Bellerin . Manager . Arsene Wenger - 5 . His side are struggling. Big time. Needs to perk his players up for an important Champions League clash against Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday. 5 . Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney holds off former team-mate Danny Welbeck . MANCHESTER UNITED . David De Gea - 8 . Kept his side in the match with vital saves from Welbeck and Wilshere. His team-mates did the rest. Paddy McNair - 7 . The youngster kept his head in the red-hot Emirates Stadium atmosphere. Invaluable experience for the youngster. Chris Smalling - 7 . So often the butt of the joke, but stood strong against Arsenal's attack on Saturday. Big 90 minutes for the defender. Tyler Blackett - 6.5 . Was given a rough ride by Oxlade-Chamberlain at time, but kept plugging away and didn't hide. United youngster Paddy McNair kept his head in red-hot atmosphere . Antonio Valencia - 7 . Tireless work rate down the right and was rewarded as he played a crucial role in United's opener. Luke Shaw - 5 . Lasted less than 20 minutes before being taken off with an injury. Had already been given the run around by Oxlade-Chamberlain. Marouane Fellaini - 6.5 . Brilliant one minute, not very good the next. Can be a key player for Van Gaal if he can find some consistency. Michael Carrick - 7 . Didn't for a minute looked fazed in the heat of battle. Stuck to his passing principles and United looked better for it. Angel Di Maria had late impact by setting up Rooney for United's second goal . Wayne Rooney - 7 . Flitted in and out of the game after his England heroics - but showed utter quality with his finish to kill off Arsenal. Angel Di Maria - 6.5 . Not the most eye-catching of displays but his precision pass set up Rooney's goal. Robin van Persie - 5.5 . Will be pleased with the result, but didn't have the impact he would have liked back at his former club. United starlet James Wilson will have enjoyed Saturday's experience . Subs . Ashley Young - 7 . Played at left wing back and was excellent throughout. Key role in United's opener. James Wilson - 6 . Will have loved playing in Saturday's atmosphere, even if it was only for 20 minutes or so. Darren Fletcher - 6 . Brought on to sure things up. Experience was vital in a kamikaze final few minutes. Subs not used . Mata, Januzaj, Lindegaard, Herrera. Manager . Louis van Gaal - 7.5 . The best 90 minutes for the Dutchman since his arrival. He'll hope this is the start of a new, consistent, United.

"Jamie McDonnell set himself up for a Las Vegas unification clash with Tomoki Kameda next year with a bizarre victory over Javier Chacon. McDonnell, defending his WBA bantamweight world title for the first time, was struggling to impose himself on the fight when his opponent pulled out suddenly in the 10th round citing an injury to his right shoulder. McDonnell will need a much-improved performance if he is to add the undefeated Kameda's WBO belt to his collection in March. Jamie McDonnell retained his WBA world bantamweight title with a victory over Javier Chacon in Liverpool . The Doncaster man won his title at Wembley in May when he stopped Tabtimdaeng Na Rachawat in impressive style. He previously held the IBF strap but was stripped for failing to make a mandatory defence last year. Chacon was a late replacement after McDonnell's initial opponent Walberto Ramos pulled out after failing to get a visa. But the Argentine caused the champion plenty of problems in the opening rounds with his come-forward style. Chacon (left) gave McDonnell an uncomfortable ride, but was forced to retire with an injured shoulder . McDonnell, the taller man by several inches, boxed on the outside but struggled to puncture Chacon's tight guard. And at the halfway stages, his dreams of a lucrative trip to Sin City looked far from certain. The odds-on favourite, fully aware of the consequences of defeat, fought with a greater sense of urgency in round eight. And the Liverpool crowd looked set for a thrilling finish before Chacon retired 30 seconds into the 10th round, claiming he had dislocated his shoulder earlier in the fight. McDonnell said: 'It was tough but I was stepping it up and putting shots together. I felt comfortable and felt I was winning the fight. 'I'm going to be on it for the unification fight and I'll bring another belt back to Britain.'","Jamie McDonnell retains WBA world bantamweight title in Liverpool .

"Callum Smith continued his seemingly inexorable rise with a hard-fought but ultimately comfortably victory over Nikola Sjekloca. Facing by far the toughest opponent of his 15-fight career, Smith controlled the fight from start to finish with only his trademark stoppage missing from an otherwise accomplished performance. In doing so, he took another step towards challenging for a world title, just two years after turning professional after missing out on the Olympics in 2012. Callum Smith recorded a comfortable victory in Liverpool against Nikola Sjekloca . Smith cruised to a unanimous points victory against his Montenegrin opponent . Sjekloca arrived in Liverpool having lost just twice in 30 contests, on points to Sakio Bika and to world champion Arthur Abraham. And, as he promised, the Serbian gave Smith a stern examination in front of his home crowd at the Echo Arena. The opening round was cagey with both men relying on their jabs but Smith gradually began to feel his way into the contest. And by the fourth round, he looked to have Sjekloca's number as he drove a left hook into the challenger's body, wobbling him briefly. Smith extended his unbeaten start in the professional game to 15 victories . Sensing blood, Smith marched forward and had his opponent under severe duress but ran out of time in the session to finish the job. And Sjekloca recovered sufficiently between rounds and continued to frustrate Smith, taking him beyond the sixth stanza for the only the second time in his career. And Smith, one of four boxing brothers, was in uncharted territory by the 11th round but had more than enough in the tank to round off a disciplined performance. The only drama in the final session was an outburst of song from the travelling Welsh contingent in support of Nathan Cleverly ahead of his rematch with Tony Bellew. The Liverpool fighter (right) was awarded a points victory by a wide margin on all three scorecards . The judges were in agreement as to the winner with varying scores of 118-111, 120-108 and 118-110. Smith, whose gran passed away last week, said: 'It's been a hard week for the family but going to the gym has helped. 'I hurt him with a body shot and that proves I can hurt anyone in the world. He was tough but I was hesitant to go for him because I hadn't been past 12 rounds.'","Callum Smith beats Nikola Sjekloca by unanimous decision in Liverpool .
Win was the 15th of Smith's young career and he is still unbeaten ."
"Wales reinforced their reputation as the hopeless romantics of international rugby as they flirted with victory against New Zealand before breaking 74,000 Cardiff hearts. Leigh Halfpenny had kicked his side to the verge of history, but the All Blacks sent out a cold blooded reminder of why they are the world’s best with three tries in the closing stages to end Welsh hopes of a famous upset. It again comes round to the question of belief. Wales have not beaten the All Blacks since 1953 and they have now lost 22 games in a row to the ‘big three’ of the Southern Hemisphere. It was a fitting result for Richie McCaw, who captained the All Blacks for the 100th time, but one that left Wales coach Warren Gatland again scratching his head on how to end his side’s hoodoo.

Referee: Wayne Barnes (ENG) ‘As a player, I remember coming through an era when Auckland, not the All Blacks, were the best team in the world and playing for Waikato it took us five years to beat them,’ said Gatland. ‘We got nearer and nearer and once we did it then it got easier the second and the third time. That is what creates composure and belief going forward.’ The final score-line was as tough on the hosts as it was inevitable. ‘They’re going to blow it, we’ve been here before,’ said one Welsh supporter as his side went into the final exchanges with a one-point lead. His wisdom proved correct but a five tries to one deficit was harsh on Gatland’s side after they went toe-to-toe for the majority of the game. ‘It’s called a Test match because it’s a test of both your physical and mental attributes,’ said All Blacks coach Steve Hansen. ‘I don’t know if we were rattled but we were certainly tested.’ There were some early examinations of the All Blacks defence. Referee Wayne Barnes, who has history with New Zealand after the 2007 World Cup quarter final, penalised McCaw for having hands in the ruck and Halpenny kicked the hosts to a seventh minute lead. McCaw’s parents, Don and Margaret, were less than impressed with the decision after making the 24,000-mile roundtrip to witness their son’s milestone. After shanking a penalty in the 20th minute, All Blacks fly half Beauden Barrett levelled the score with his second attempt three minutes later. Wales enjoyed good territory but failed to capitalise on their openings because New Zealand’s defence was too strong. A mis-firing Welsh scrum stunted their progress and Paul James was fortunate to avoid a yellow card after conceding three scrum penalties within half an hour. Only a hearty Welsh defence kept out a New Zealand onslaught before half time but, after going into the dressing rooms at 3-3, it was not long before McCaw’s side were back deep in enemy territory. Barrett made the initial break and it was only going to end one way when the ball eventually reached the hands of Julian Savea. The winger has drawn comparisons with Jonah Lomu and he showed his power when he crashed through the tackle of Dan Biggar to finish in the corner, before Barrett added the extras from the touchline. Joe Moody of the All Blacks (left) holds up the trophy following the Intenational match between Wales and the New Zealand .

Wales came flying back and within 120 seconds the scores were level again. Biggar crashed the ball into a swarm of Kiwis but it was quickly recycled to Taulupe Faletau, who set free Rhys Webb to touch down under the posts. The Millennium Stadium was rocking. This was the first full house of the series and the game started to boil over when Webb exchanged heated words with All Blacks hooker Dane. Inspired, the hits became harder and the noise louder. Wales were suddenly breathing fire and a 51st minute penalty was converted by Halfpenny to edge his side back in front. But this was going to be McCaw’s night. With North out cold with a head injury, the No 7 made yards down the right and Barrett put up a cross-field kick that was finished by Jerome Kaino. It was a classic contest of wills. Halfpenny held his nerve with another penalty and Wales were back in front. But this was a position they had been in too many times before. Barrett then scored a solo try but McCaw is a man who always demands more. Kieran Reid added a chargedown try and Barrett scored his second to remind everyone why they are the best team in the world.","New Zealand beat Wales 34-16 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday .

"This was a tale of two young talents, Danny Ings of Burnley via Dorset and Bojan Krkic of Stoke via Barcelona. Both cost their clubs somewhere between £1m and £2m. Both shone on Saturday. Ings alone went home happy. The former Bournemouth forward scored the two early goals that gave Burnley their second straight win in the Premier League and their first away win in the top division since April 2010. And Bojan, as he is more routinely known, gave the home supporters something to take away from a disappointing result – entertainment and hope of better things.

The last time Burnley won away in the top division, in their last one-year stay, the hosts were Hull, the score was 4-1 and the victory nowhere near enough to keep the Clarets in the elite division. This triumph, in which Stoke briefly threatened a comeback with a goal from Jon Walters, lifts Burnley off the foot of the table and within sight of safety. ‘We scored two very good goals, high quality goals on the break in the first 15 minutes,’ said Burnley’s manager Sean Dyche. ‘Then Stoke came at us in waves —they never stopped coming at us. But we had the will, desire, respect, honesty and team ethic — all the qualities I think are the marks of a good team.’ On winning two matches on the bounce now, and the belief that it gives in a shot at survival, Dyche added: ‘Everyone tells me that back-to-back wins in the Premier League are massive and I’ll accept that. Survival has been deemed impossible and our job is to make it possible.’ Stoke’s Mark Hughes said: ‘Unfortunately we lost the game in the first 10 or 15 minutes when we didn’t get a grip on what the opposition would do to us. You need to be rock solid in that period.’ Dyche made just one enforced change to the starting XI who sealed the first win of the season last time out, against Hull. Scott Arfield, injured in training, was replaced by former Stoke winger Michael Kightly, who made the most of his chance. Burnley started brightly, careering forward early, albeit without much bite for the first 10 minutes. Then they scored twice in two. For the opener, Ashley Barnes took possession out on the left from Dean Marney and slipped in a low ball. Stoke’s goalkeeper Asmir Begovic, under pressure from Kightly, pushed it into the path of Ings and the 22-year-old forward tapped in.

"Scotland buried the ghost of their first-ever defeat to Tonga two years ago with a hard-earned but comfortable five-try victory in Kilmarnock. It was far from the most convincing display by the Scots in this historic first Test match at Rugby Park, with penalties and handling errors hindering their first half efforts, but set-piece dominance and a return to simple basics in the second half led to three second half scores that proved too much for the Tongans. The first half was a frustrating affair, Scotland seeking to ignite the fast-paced, ambitious attack that new head coach Vern Cotter has sought to inculcate in the side. But a penalty count that rose to nine by half-time and a series of passing and catching errors stymied momentum, and also allowed Tonga to show their threat. Scotland centre Alex Dunbar dives over for his side's second try at Rugby Park in Kilmarnock . Scotland fullback Stuart Hogg crosses for Scotland's third try as the Tongans begin to tire . Scotland and Edinburgh prop Geoff Cross powers over for another touchdown for the home side . The South Sea Islanders had in young stand-off Latiume Fosita, who plays for New Zealand province Northland, an accurate goal-kicker and he punished Scottish failings with four penalties that had Tonga 12-7 ahead by the half-hour mark. The Scots had responded to going behind to Fosita’s first strike after ten minutes, by scoring the game’s first try. It came from a series of lineout drives which provoked the Tongan forwards into illegal darts into the side. It earned skipper Nili Latu a yellow card after two infringements and the tourists did not get the message as they infringed twice more before Scotland made them pay on the scoreboard when Blair Cowan, the openside flanker, crashed over the line after a fourth successive drive.

Tonga hooker Aleki Lutui makes a powerful carry but Scotland flanker Blair Cowan halts his progress . However, though down to 14 men, Tonga responded with two more Fosita penalties as the Scots struggled to hold onto ball and allowed the Tongans to make ground too easily. Centre Alex Dunbar then incurred the wrath of the officials for a tackle then turned Tonga full-back Vungakoto Lilo on his head. Dunbar received a yellow card and while it was not a terrible tackle Lilo’s feet did fly up above his shoulders, and he required treatment, and so was fair. With Dunbar missing, the Scottish back line messed up an attack out of their 22 and duly conceded another penalty as Laidlaw tried to recover the situation, handing Tonga a five-point lead heading into the last ten minutes of the half. Scotland's flanker Rob Harley (right) clatters into Tonga number eight Viliami Ma'afu . However, one thing Scotland have uncovered in the past year is an ability to finish from the sniff of a chance. In the 32nd minute Tonga were pressing the home 22 and looking dangerous when a big tackle forced a loose ball and Stuart Hogg picked it up and took off on an 80-metre run that left the Tongans trailing and hugely deflated, and the full-back celebrating his eighth try in 27 Test matches. Scotland should have been further ahead at half-time but Visser was caught just short after twice catching chips and Laidlaw squandered another golden chance when a clever lineout trick set the scrum-half racing through a gap 15 metres out, but he dropped the pass. Dunbar was guilty of the same error, failing to grasp another slick lineout coming onto the ball at full pelt, and so the sides disappeared with just two points between them. The giving-up of an early penalty maintained the all-too-familiar pattern in the second half. But where it changed was in Fosita pulling this one wide of the uprights and the Scots responding swiftly by taking advantage of two penalty awards to move into Tonga’s 22, and from another lineout platform, Dunbar showed superb strength to hold off two tackles and dive into the right-hand corner. Scotland number eight Johnnie Beattie is brought down by Tonga prop Tevita Mailau . Mistakes continued to puncture Scottish promise, however, with Johnnie Beattie kicking straight out and Russell delaying his pass long enough to squander an overlap, but Scotland maintained the pressure and Laidlaw grasped a penalty chance to extend the lead to a more comfortable ten points 15 minutes in. Scotland’s lineout and scrum began to dominate the Tongans with and without the ball, despite – or perhaps because of - the Islanders replacing their entire front row. Laidlaw eased Scotland further ahead with a penalty with 15 minutes remaining, and big-bearded prop Geoff Cross put it more than two converted tries out of Tonga’s reach with terrific strength to batter between two Tongan front rows and crash over. Laidlaw’s conversion took him to 299 points but he was replaced before reaching the 300-mark by Chris Cusiter and was only able to watch as Russell missed adding the extras to a fifth try by Tommy Seymour. It was Russell who created the chance with a skilful high ball into the dead-ball area, which bounced back off replacement Duncan Taylor into Seymour’s hands for an easy dot-down to allow Scotland to seal a rare 11-try tally over three autumn games that should maintain the growing self-belief in Cotter’s squad.","Tries from flanker Blair Cowan and centre Stuart Hogg helped Scotland to a 14-12 half-time lead .

Player Ratings by LAURIE WHITWELL at the King Power Stadium . They came close to ending their barren spell at times, but the finesse found in moves that opened up the Sunderland defence was lacking when it came to finishing. It seems a long time since Manchester United arrived at the King Power Stadium and left with a defeat and five goals in their against column. Buddhist monks flown over by Leicester’s Thai owner blessed the players before that game back in September but they have not been back until Saturday. Their methods worked to a degree; a draw can be seen as uplift on recent results. At times this encounter became feisty, and Lee Cattermole must count himself fortunate in the extreme to have lasted the full 90 minutes. On the hour mark he launched into a horrible challenge on Esteban Cambiasso that started high and ended with a scissor swipe involving both his legs. Cattermole claimed Cambiasso had gone to stamp but it merely looked like an effort to guard the ball by the Argentine. Cattermole was reckless, but only yellow carded. Leicester shaded the early exchanges. Jamie Vardy pounced on a slack touch by Wes Brown to burst clear but Costel Pantilimon was out quickly to divert the ball behind. The Sunderland goalkeeper then held a shot from distance by Riyad Mahrez. The Algerian winger only returned back from national duty on Friday but was Leicester’s liveliest presence. He produced a wonderful pass that gave Jeff Schlupp an excellent chance to open the scoring, slipping the ball between three Sunderland defenders. But Schlupp, from the left of the area, slashed his shot into the side-netting. Eventually Sunderland roused themselves and crafted a slick move that saw Kasper Schmeichel pull off a superb save to deny Steven Fletcher in the 23rd minute. The ball travelled quickly from Jordi Gomez to Adam Johnson and his flick set Fletcher clear. But Schmeichel spread his frame and touched Fletcher’s finish just enough to send it wide.

The ball swerved and dipped and was heading in uintil Schmeichel sprang to his right to palm it past the post. Mahrez had a cross that almost went all the way in and another Brown error led to a Leicester attack that presented Leonardo Ulloa and Cambiasso with openings, but both were too shy to shoot, much to the frustration of the home crowd. At the pother end Larsson was set up by Fletcher’s pull back but Wes Morgan flung his large frame in the way of the Swede’s goal-bound strike. The interval came at a good time for Leicester, who emerged afterwards renewed with energy. Matty James burst clear and fired a strong shot that was well saved by Pantillimon, then a smart flighted pass from Cambiasso gave Mahrez room to bamboozle Brown, who ended up on the floor, and hit a shot that was narrowly deflected wide.

"World class strikes from Jordon Ibe and Craig Bryson kept Derby County top of the Championship as Watford’s unbeaten home record was left in tatters. Ibe, on loan from Liverpool, curled the ball home magnificently to give the Rams the lead six minutes before half time, the 18-year-old underlining his indisputable quality. Watford levelled through substitute Gianni Munari mid-way through the second-half after a neat move that unlocked the Derby defence and at that point looked decent value to win it.

Referee: Keith Stroud (Hampshire) Attendance: 17,421 (2,004 away) But Bryson settled an engrossing contest when he fired into the top corner with 10 minutes remaining. The result - and the impressive performance - was a real statement from Steve McClaren’s men, who are fancied to put last season’s play-off final heartache behind them and return to the Premier League via the automatic route. Watford have recorded some eye-catching results at home this season and are very much promotion candidates themselves but despite plenty of endeavour were unable to match their visitors. Slavisa Jokanovic, hoping back-to-back defeats prior to the international fortnight had been worked out the system, restored Odion Ighalo to the forward line with Munari dropping to the bench. McClaren, whose Rams side thrashed Wolves 5-0 to assume top spot a fortnight ago, brought in Ibe for Simon Dawkins. The visitors started confidently, stroking the ball around and pressurising Watford’s back line into some early errors. Jeff Hendrick’s deflected shot from the edge of the box on five minutes was pushed onto the post by Bond as Derby showed their table-topping quality. Watford were forced to play on the counter-attack early on but they were dangerous when in advanced areas. Jordan Ibe of Derby County scores the opening goal for the Championship leaders on Saturday . Ibe runs away in celebration after giving Derby the lead against Watford in the Championship match . Ibe and his team-mates celebrate going 1-0 up against Watford as they look to extend their lead at the top . Lloyd Dyer was played in by Keith Andrews but Jack Butland, whose loan from Stoke was extended by a week so he could feature here, was equal to it. Ryan Shotton made a crucial slide challenge to deny Ighalo as he prepared to pull the trigger and Troy Deeney shrugged off the attentions of Hendrick to fire towards the bottom corner. Butland, who was unsighted, did brilliantly to turn it away one-handed. Another gilt-edged chance fell to Forestieri on the half-hour. Deeney’s diagonal pass found him in plenty of space but the Italian hesitated and Craig Forsyth nipped in to dispossess him. Derby reasserted themselves again as the half wore on and Chris Martin’s clever touch took him beyond Joel Ekstrand, only for Bond to push his shot round the post. It needed a moment of magic to illuminate a dreary afternoon in Hertfordshire and Ibe obliged. With Juan Carlos Paredes hopelessly out of position, the teenager got the better of Forestieri and bent the ball into the far corner. Ibe, a south London lad who was signed by Liverpool two years ago, is regarded as a bright prospect and has represented England up to Under 20 level. This was the fourth goal of his season-long loan at Pride Park. Gianni Munari shoots and scores to equalise for Watford in the 67th minute of the match . Substitute Munari gave Watford hope of a point against the Championship leaders on Saturday . It was a deserved lead for Derby and they could easily have doubled it when Omar Mascarell’s free-kick was flicked towards goal by Lloyd Doyley under pressure from Martin and Bond tipped it over. Jokanovic introduced seven-goal top scorer Matej Vydra at half-time to try and provide some forward thrust and Deeney tested Butland after Paredes had beaten Ibe down the right. A couple of minutes later, Forestieri made space on the edge of the box but curled a shot wide. At the opposite end, Martin was left kicking himself after finding himself clean through only to take the long way round Bond rather than aiming for the far corner. The keeper gratefully grabbed the ball from him. Watford gradually took a stranglehold on proceedings, with Munari also introduced and the man on loan from Parma drew them level after a lovely one-touch move on 67 minutes. Munari smashed the ball home after Vydra played him through, the two substitutes combining to good effect. Derby manager Steve McClaren applauds the fans after securing the 2-1 win over Watford . Moments later, Vydra could have given Watford the lead but he fired just off target from 20 yards and suddenly the hosts looked the most likely winner. However, Derby still had plenty going forward when they got the chance and Russell’s strong run led to Forsyth being denied by Bond at point-blank range. But they didn’t have to wait much longer for their moment. Craig Bryson, who had replaced Will Hughes, drove inside from the left and leathered the ball into the top corner from 25 yards. Should Derby gain promotion, that goal will be looked back upon for many years to come. It sparked delirious scenes among the 2,000 travelling fans, who increasingly believe this is their season.

"Jason Holt sent Hearts on their way to a 2-0 victory and nine-point lead over 10-man Rangers in the Scottish Championship. The recalled Holt swept an excellent shot home following a half-cleared cross in the 56th minute to continue his side's perfect home record following a brutal contest in front of a sell-out 17,004 crowd at Tynecastle.

Jason Holt fires Rangers in front in the 56th minute to continue his side's perfect home record . Holt celebrates in front of the ecstatic home fans after he broke the deadlock early in the second half . There were nine yellow cards but it was a 21st-minute red for Rangers midfielder Steven Smith that defined the contest as his unnecessarily robust challenge on Callum Paterson deep inside the Hearts half put his team under pressure following a positive start for the visitors. Manager Ally McCoist is also up against it as he bids to get Rangers' faltering title challenge back on track. The club's record goalscorer was subjected to cries of 'Ally, Ally, get to f***' by a significant section of the away support although they were soon drowned out by chants of 'Super Ally' from other Rangers fans, mockingly backed by the home supporters. Jamie Walker made sure of the result for Hearts by converting an 88th-minute penalty . McCoist's team selection gave an indication of the impending physical contest with Jon Daly coming in for Kris Boyd up front and Bilel Mohsni restored to central defence. The fit-again Lee Wallace also came in. The first 30 seconds further signalled the battle to come as the game had to stop with Paterson and Wallace both on the deck following separate challenges. Rangers started the better side, forcing Hearts back and making them defend. Hearts, who were again without skipper Danny Wilson and main striker Osman Sow, could not get forward-thinking midfielders Jason Holt, Jamie Walker and Billy King on the ball. Rangers were edging the battle and right-back Darren McGregor saw a close-range shot diverted wide after a corner. Hearts goalkeeper Neil Alexander punches clear under pressure in the home side's penalty area . But Smith was overly physical when he threw himself into a challenge with studs showing. Paterson got the ball away and Smith caught him on his foot with Craig Thomson quickly producing the red card. The dismissal did not immediately change the game though and Mohsni and Wallace fired off target following free-kicks into the box with Paterson and Morgaro Gomis booked as the hosts struggled to get a grip. Both goalkeepers were called into action to push away free-kicks from Nicky Law and Alim Ozturk and Hearts improved in the closing stages of the half. Rangers manager Ally McCoist watches on as his side struggle at Tynecastle . Gomis fired a left-footed strike just wide from 25 yards before Steve Simonsen leapt to touch Brad McKay's looping header from 15 yards on to the bar following a deflected cross from Miguel Pallardo. And Kevin McHattie curled not far wide with his right foot after a good passing move down the left. Ozturk came close from 40 yards just after the interval before the next flashpoint which saw Kenny Miller booked for a late sliding tackle that forced McHattie off on a stretcher. Miller was subsequently taken off, much to his visible disappointment, to huge jeers and Richard Foster came on. Souffian El Hassnoaui soon followed, having never looked properly mobile following an early foul by Ian Black, but his replacement James Keatings was quickly involved in the opener. The forward's attempt to throw a leg at Paterson's cross forced Lee McCulloch into a half-clearance which fell perfectly for Holt 18 yards out. The midfielder swept a first-time effort into the corner of the net. Rangers almost hit back instantly but Neil Alexander blocked Law's volley and Foster's attempt to follow up was deflected on to the bar. Law soon appealed strongly for a penalty after Paterson slid but Thomson was unconvinced and booked Black for his remonstrations. There were further bookings for Hearts substitute Adam Eckersley, Daly, Pallardo and McGregor as the home side defended their lead with increasing comfort. King fired just wide from long range before the introduction of Boyd for Lewis Macleod, with 10 minutes remaining, sparked the decidedly mixed reaction for McCoist. Hearts survived without further scare and Walker missed a chance on the break before he won the penalty as Black barged into the back of him on another counter-attack. Boyd rounded off the booking count with a poor challenge on McKay borne from sheer frustration.","Hearts increase their lead to nine points .

"Steven Finn is not keen to dwell on the past. But less than a year after being branded ‘unselectable’ during England’s disastrous Ashes tour, he can at least put his technical meltdown in perspective. What didn’t kill him has definitely made him stronger. With Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad both sitting out England’s one-day tour of Sri Lanka because of injury, Finn has been thrust into the role of attack leader. And, during Friday’s warm-up game in Colombo, he responded with a wicket in his second over. It bore the hallmarks of the old Finn: bounce and movement off a good length, a nick to the keeper. Steven Finn celebrates the wicket of Perera as England made a promising start to their one-day series . It was no more than a start, and there was rust: Finn also sent down four wides.

Before I experienced what happened in the last 12 months I didn’t really have an understanding: I just ran up and bowled. ‘Now I have a far better understanding, so if it is going wrong or I’m halfway through a game and it doesn’t quite feel right, I can pinpoint what’s going on.’ His travails can be traced back to the summer of 2012, when South Africa captain Graeme Smith opportunistically drew the umpires’ attention to Finn’s habit of knocking over the stumps with his right knee during his delivery stride. As a result, he changed his run-up – and everything unravelled. Aged just 25, it is as if Finn has already gone through his midlife crisis in recent times . Finn prepares to bowl during the first Test match in last summer's Ashes series . In Australia, Ashley Giles – then the one-day coach – came out with the ‘unselectable’ line. Like a broken record, it stuck. ‘I think it was fair enough,’ said Finn. ‘Unselectable is a harsh and frank way to put it. But if I’m being honest I couldn’t have gone out there and done myself justice in an England shirt. ‘But it spurred me on and motivated me to become selectable again. That was my dream when I left Australia.’ Some hard work with Middlesex bowling coach Richard Johnson and a summer on the county circuit, where he claimed a respectable 48 championship wickets at 30 apiece, earned him a recall to England’s one-day side against India. It felt like the start of a career – yet this was a bowler with 90 Test wickets to his name. Finn (left) speaks with coach Peter Moores during a practice session at the Sinhalese Sports Club . Finn is impatient to turn that youthful promise into something more tangible: ‘I don’t want to feel my way back in – I want to hit the ground running when I get into an international game. ‘There’s room for improvement with my pace to get back to where I was 18 months, two years ago. But I’m in a far better place now than I was 12 months ago, and that’s going to stand me in good stead for the rest of my career.’ The good news is that, unlike some fast bowlers, Finn regards Asian pitches as an opportunity, not an obstacle. There was some rust during the warm up game in Colombo: Finn also sent down four wides . Ten one-day internationals in India have brought him 15 wickets and the respect of the local batsmen, and in the UAE against Pakistan at the start of 2012, he picked up 13 wickets at an average of 10. ‘I really enjoy bowling in subcontinental conditions,’ he said. ‘I can control a reverse-swinging ball quite well, which plays a big part out here. And these wickets will be more seamer-friendly than in India.’ These are early days in the second phase of his England career. Yet the signs are promising. Whisper it, but Steven Finn may be on the verge of becoming very selectable indeed.","Steven Finn is looking to return to his best over the winter period .

"Dave Whelan has warned he will resign as chairman of Wigan if the Football Association punishes him for the controversy which has seen him labelled 'a racist' by Cardiff owner Vincent Tan. The FA has said its investigation into Whelan's comments about Jewish and Chinese people will be treated 'as a priority'. They have written to the 77-year-old - who cried when Wigan fans sang his name on Saturday - to seek his take on events. Whelan spoke out in a newspaper interview where he was defending his decision to hire former Cardiff boss Malky Mackay and has since apologised. Dave Whelan was seen crying as Wigan fans sang his name before they faced Middlesbrough on Saturday . One Wigan fan, Mass Mashayekhy, offers his support to Whelan before the match with Middlesbrough . Mackay was recruited by Wigan despite being under investigation by the FA for allegedly sending racist and anti-semitic texts, and Whelan responded to criticism by telling The Guardian: 'I think Jewish people do chase money more than everybody else.' He also said he did not view the word 'chink' - the term by which Mackay allegedly referred to Tan in a text message - as offensive. Whelan told ITV News: 'If the FA look into my affairs - and they were to find me guilty, which I hope they don't and I don't see anything like that happening because I'm absolutely anti-racist, always have been, always will be - however, if they have any questions I'm willing to answer it and, should they even suggest I'm guilty I would immediately resign from my position as chairman of Wigan Athletic.'

Whelan pictured in 2013 with the FA Cup after Wigan stunned Manchester City at Wembley to win the trophy . Wigan Athletic owner Dave Whelan (left) says he will quit his position if found guilty by the FA . During Saturday's match with Middlesbrough at the DW Stadium, Whelan was seen to break down in tears as he was widely applauded by the Wigan supporters, with the crowd signing: 'There's only one Dave Whelan'. David Cameron has been urged by a Labour MP to give Whelan's donation to the Conservative Party of £1.5million to charity in light of the Wigan owner's 'anti-Semitic and racist' remarks. Labour MP Karl Turner has written to the prime minister to suggest it would be more fitting the money Whelan has given to the Tories since 2007 be distributed to charities. Turner calls on Cameron to 'personally condone or condemn' the 77-year-old's comments, with Whelan's most recent contribution £100,000 in August 2014. Whelan, 77, caused a stir over his appointment of Mackay as the new Wigan manager earlier this week . Whelan risks ostracising himself from football after his outburst about Jews . He says: 'Given his status as a significant contributor to your re-election efforts you must now make it clear if you personally condone or condemn these comments. 'I hope that you agree with me that these anti-Semitic and racist comments have no place in modern British society, and as such I hope that you also agree with me that you must now give up any money that you have received from Mr Whelan and consider which charitable groups would be better recipients of it. 'Failure to act swiftly in this matter will show a lack of leadership. It will not be possible for you to simultaneously condemn offensive remarks while accepting large sums of money from those responsible for them.' Wigan have lost their back-of-shirt sponsor Premier Range following the controversial appointment of Mackay.

"The Ministry of Justice have said it would be 'difficult or impossible' for Ched Evans to work abroad, meaning the convicted rapist may never play professional football again. The 25-year-old is looking to return to football after being released from prison in October, but the striker's former club Sheffield United bowed to pressure on Thursday and withdrew their offer to allow Evans to train with them. No other clubs in the Football League have expressed an interest in signing Evans, and the Ministry of Justice have confirmed it is unlikely the ex-Wales international can rebuild his career abroad. Ched Evans, pictured in Wilmslow, Cheshire on Wednesday, will not be allowed to train at his old club . Evans, pictured at his home on Monday, was originally given the opportunity to train with Sheffield United . Evans, with fiancee Natasha Massey, will find it 'difficult or impossible' to play professional football abroad . 'In general terms, a sex offender on licence would have to have regular meetings with their offender manager and that is difficult or impossible to do if they are living abroad,' a spokesman told MailOnline. Evans, who plans to appeal his 2012 conviction for raping a teenage waitress in a hotel in Rhyl, served half of his five-year sentence. The remainder of the sentence will be completed on licence, meaning he must regularly check in with an offender manager until 2016. Evans will be 27 by the time that has been fulfilled, and he will remain on the Sex Offenders Register for life. He was initially told he could train with his former team in Sheffield after his release from Wymott Prison on October 17, but the League One club performed a U-turn following high profile criticism. Evans released a statement protesting his innocence against the conviction with Massey by his side . Among those was Olympic champion Jessica Ennis-Hill, who vowed to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane if Evans was re-signed, and TV presenter Charlie Webster, who quit as a patron of the club. A petition gathered more than 150,000 signatures against Evans re-joining the Blades, and the club released a statement severing their relationship with the convicted rapist. ‘Following the statement dated 11th November and after ongoing and extensive deliberation, Sheffield United Football Club has decided to retract the opportunity for its former player, Ched Evans, to use the club’s facilities for training purposes, as was previously intended,' it read. 'The club initially accepted a request from The PFA (Professional Footballers' Association) for Ched Evans to be able to train. The reaction to this has been at an intensity that could not have been anticipated when first announced. Charlie Webster (left) and Jessica Ennis-Hill both voiced opposition to Evans returning to the club . Evans was released from prison in October after serving two-and-a-half years of a five-year rape sentence . 'The club condemns rape and violence of any kind against women in the strongest possible terms.' The PFA accepted the club's decision but added it hopes Evans will find a club. 'It may ultimately be of benefit to both parties to move on and for Ched to look for a fresh start at a different club,' a statement on Friday read. 'It is hoped that Ched will be given an opportunity at another club to return to the job he is trained to do.' 2011 - May 30: Ched Evans arrested on suspicion of sexual assault at a Premier Inn near Rhyl, North Wales. July 26: Evans and fellow footballer Clayton McDonald are charged with rape. 2012 - April 20: Evans is jailed for five years for rape and McDonald is acquitted. Evans maintains his innocence with his lawyer saying: 'Mr Evans firmly maintains his innocence in this matter and is being advised regarding an appeal of the decision.' April 23: The Professional Footballers Association is forced to defend itself after Evans is named in the League One team of the year with chief executive Gordon Taylor stating: 'That was a football judgement by his fellow professionals, it was not a moral judgement and in no way does the PFA condone the offence for which he was convicted.' Evans is released by Sheffield United at the end of the season. April 24: Evans' lawyers announce he is to appeal against his conviction. August 21: The first stage of Evans' appeal is rejected after a judge had refuses his application for leave to appeal against his conviction. November 5: Nine people plead guilty to revealing the identity of Evans' victim online with some of the comments calling her names like 'money grabbing whore' and 'poor little victim'. November 6: Evans loses his appeal after his case is rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in London. 2014 - April 18: An online petition is launched urging United not to re-sign Evans and gains over 165,000 signatures. October 17: Evans is released from prison after serving half his sentence and a statement is released on his website stating he will continue to fight to clear his name. October 18: United release a statement saying that they are 'continuing to deliberate on any long-term decision' after media reports emerge that they have offered Evans a contract. October 19: The Criminal Cases Review Commission confirm they are to fast-track Evans' case to investigate whether his conviction will be referred to the Court of Appeal. October 22: Evans releases a statement stating his desire to return to football and says: 'Even though I have been released from prison, I am determined to continue the fight to clear my name and it is public knowledge that an application to refer my case back to the Court of Appeal has recently been submitted to the Criminal Case Review Commission by my lawyers.' November 11: Sheffield United confirm Evans will return to train with the club with immediate effect following a request from the Professional Footballers' Association but state they are 'not prepared at this time' to make a decision on whether to re-sign the striker. Television presenter Charlie Webster announces that she has stood down as a patron of Sheffield United. November 12: Sheffield Central MP Paul Blomfield urges United to change their decision, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says the club must 'think really long and hard' before deciding whether to allow Evans to play for them again, while singer Dave Berry and businesswoman Lindsay Graham join Webster in resigning as club patrons. November 13: Olympic heptathlon champion and Blades fan Jessica Ennis-Hill issues a statement announcing that she has told United she would want her name removed from the Bramall Lane stand should Evans be offered a contract to play for the club. November 14: Police begin an investigation into rape threat tweets directed at Ennis-Hill after her statement over Evans. November 15: Sheffield United release a statement saying they are 'appalled' at the abuse levelled at those who spoke out about the club's decision and promising to work with South Yorkshire police to help identify those responsible. November 17: Former Beautiful South frontman Paul Heaton resigns as a patron of United's Community Foundation over the Evans affair.

"You probably have to go back to that unforgettable back nine meltdown at the Masters in 2011 to find the last time Rory McIlroy had a 30 minute collapse to rival the one he suffered at the DP World Tour Championship on Saturday. One minute he was making birdies for fun to be tied for the lead with defending champion Henrik Stenson. This brilliant European Tour season looked for all the world like it would get the Sunday showdown between the pair it deserved. Then came that half-hour of madness, as almost unbelievably the world number one followed one double bogey with another. In 30 minutes he had gone from co-leader to outside the top ten. Seeing him get one double bogey – his first in 220 holes at the Earth Course – was shocking enough but two in a row was positively jaw-dropping. VIDEO Scroll down to watch DP World Tour Championship day 3 highlights . Rory McIlroy plays his tee shot on the fourth hole during 2014 DP World Tour Championship in Dubai . McIlroy tees off at the ninth hole during the final round of the EPGA Tour at the Jumeirah Golf Estates . McIlroy and his caddie JP Fitzgerald (left) make their way across a footbridge to the 17th green . At the 12th, he three-putted and then short-sided himself badly with a wild tee shot at the 13th. Trust McIlroy to bounce back from those four dropped shots at the 12th and 13th with a birdie at the 14th and another at the 18th. But those costly lapses have left him with an awful lot to do if he is to end this amazing campaign with one more victory. The 25-year-old had to settle for a 70 and, on another day of low scoring, that’s left him four shots adrift of the co-leaders, Stenson and Rafa Cabrera-Bello. McIlroy made up seven strokes to win the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth in May and spark his remarkable summer. But it will be some feat to make up such a sizable deficit against an opponent as formidable as the Swede on a course that suits him to a tee. Henrik Stenson plays his second shot of the ninth hole from the bunker on day three . Stenson recovered from his troubles in the bunker to lead the course at the end of the third round . ‘I’m obviously a bit frustrated at the minute about those double bogeys but at least the late birdies mean I’m not out of it,’ said McIlroy. ‘The idea on Sunday will be to play aggressively and go at the pins and try to post a low score.’ As for Stenson, he said: ‘At the end of the year we always look at trophies and it would mean an awful lot to me to defend this title for my first win this season.’ The one thing that will give McIlroy encouragement is there are only three players ahead of him. Stenson and Cabrera-Bello are three shots ahead of Justin Rose on eleven under – and then comes McIlroy on ten under, alongside three other players in Frenchman Victor Dubuisson, Dane Thorbjorn Olesen and rising English rookie Tyrrell Hatton. Stenson hits a shot on the 18th hole against the glorious backdrop of the Dubai course . England’s Tyrrell Hatton reacts following a missed putt on the 18th green . Stenson will start as clear favourite given he’s ranked number four in the world and loves this Earth course. But Spaniard Cabrera-Bello deserves high credit for a stunning comeback from an opening round of 73 that appeared to rule out any chance of winning. How he has responded, following a 64 on Friday with a 65 on Saturday. Similarly, Rose has bounced back from being four over par after 10 holes on Thursday to give himself an opportunity to clinch his third victory of the year. Dubuisson was third in this event last season and again showed his liking for the course with a 67. Scotland’s Richie Ramsay plays a shot on the 17th hole . And how about Hatton? The 23 year old Englishman appears to have been pipped for the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year prize by exciting American Brooks Koepka, who won the Turkish Airlines Open last week. But that could all change if he can piece together the best round of his career on Sunday. ‘I think I would have to win the event to win the rookie race as well but who knows what might happen if I can hole a few putts on the back nine,’ said Hatton. ‘It’s still a bit weird for me seeing my name next to the likes of Rory and Henrik, so I’ll have to make sure I keep my emotions in check.’ Scot Marc Warren and Danny Willett from England will start the final round five in arrears after rounds of 65 and 71 respectively.","Rory McIlroy is four shots behind leaders Henrik Stenson and Rafael Cabrera-Bello after third round of DP World Tour Championship .

"Shamed Cheltenham Festival winning trainer Philip Fenton has been banned from the sport for three years by the Irish Turf Club. The exclusion follows the Co Tipperary trainer's conviction and 6,000 euro fine after illegal medications, including anabolic steroids, were found at his stable during a Ministry Of Agriculture raid in January 2012. Fenton's ban will start on midnight on Friday when all his Irish licences will be suspended. Shamed Cheltenham Festival winning trainer Philip Fenton has been banned from the sport for three years . But the Irish Turf Club will allow him to be an 'attendee' at race meetings until March 1 in order to allow him to 'wind down his business affairs in an orderly fashion'. The case has cast a black cloud over Irish racing since it became public just before the Cheltenham Festival. Fenton was allowed to run three horses at that meeting in March – Dunguib, Last Instalment and Value At Risk – but only after the British Horse Authority had taken the unprecedented action of drug testing the horses and inspecting the Irish Turf Club's testing record of Fenton-trained horses. Fenton pleaded guilty to three charges at Saturday's hearing which included bringing the sport into disrepute. His legal team urged the panel to issue a financial penalty but Turf Club chief executive Denis Egan said the gravity of the case warranted a ban. Last year Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni was given an eight-year ban by the BHA after admitting he had given some of his horses anabolic steroids. Irish Turf Club will allow trainer Fenton to be an 'attendee' at race meetings until March 1 . But Egan disputed suggestions that Fenton's three-year ban could be considered lenient. He said: 'I think it is a very significant punishment. Apart from the fact his livelihood has gone for three years, he has suffered a lot of reputational damage. He had lost a lot of his good horses before today and he has lost a lot of his owners. 'He was not in a good place even before the three-year penalty was imposed. 'The panel took into account he pleaded guilty to the three charges and the reputational damage to the sport and came up with what they perceived to be a fair penalty.' A cardboard box packed with illegal remedies was found when the stable owned by Fenton, 49, a former champion amateur jockey, was raided. The substances included one kilo of the anabolic steroid Nitrotain and a 20ml bottle of a second performance-enhancing anabolic steroid Ilium Stanabolic. Fenton, who has seven days to appeal, is best known in Britain for winning the 2009 Cheltenham Festival Bumper with Dunguib. Horses already moved from Fenton include talented The Tullow Tank, who is now with Sandra Hughes.

"The FA want Wigan owner Dave Whelan to name the two influential people at the top of their organisation who told him ‘nothing would come’ from the ongoing investigation of new club manager Malky Mackay.

The FA are already investigating Mackay, who is accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic texts. There is considerable annoyance at Wembley about Whelan’s alleged knowledge about the outcome of that inquiry, especially as none of the executive team, nor FA board members, is said to have spoken with Wigan’s owner.

Several senior FA officials, including Heather Rabbatts, the independent director and FA inclusion board chair, have been pushing for Mackay to be charged. Jonathan Hall, the FA’s director of football services, is leading the Mackay investigation, which has been complicated by the issue of whether the texts were private or not. There is no question Whelan’s comments are public but Mackay’s remarks emerged from a private text exchange with his Cardiff director of football Iain Moody, as were Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore‘s sexist exchanges with PL lawyer Nick West. And Scudamore escaped FA censure. Neither Wigan nor Whelan would comment about the ‘FA assurances’ but club insiders say 77-year-old Whelan is prone to forgetfulness. He has until Wednesday to respond to a ‘very concerned’ FA. Malky Mackay was appointed Wigan manager this week, despite the text and email scandal we revealed .

Four other county officials have also stepped down after the secret ballot verdict that no further local disciplinary measures needed to be taken against Cummings.

"Gavin Henson booted an 18-point haul as Bath moved up to second in the Premiership with a 33-23 win over struggling London Irish at the Madejski Stadium. The visitors' pack was the dominant force throughout as Irish conceded numerous penalties, especially when under pressure in the scrums. However behind the scrum, Bath were poor with none of their England candidates furthering their cause for inclusion in next week's game against Australia. Bath scored three tries from Henry Thomas, Chris Cook and a penalty try award, with Henson kicking four penalties and three conversions. For the battling Irish, David Paice and James Short scored tries with Shane Geraghty kicking three penalties and two conversions. Gavin Henson scored 18 points as Bath defeated London Irish 33-23 . The victory takes Bath up to second place in the Aviva Premiership . Kyle Eastmond and Semesi Rokoduguni were both released by England to be included in the Bath line-up. Eastmond partnered fellow England hopeful, Jonathan Joseph in the centre whilst former Irish flanker, Matt Garvey, was selected for his first start of the season. After last week's heavy defeat at Sale, Irish recalled Geraghty, Scott Steele and Conor Gilsenan to start but they suffered a big blow when skipper, George Skivington, was a late withdrawal with a minor shoulder injury. Dave Lyons replaced him with Geraghty taking over the captaincy. Irish briefly overcame this setback by taking a third minute lead when Geraghty fired over an excellent long-range penalty before Henson responded with a similar effort for the visitors. The first 15 minutes were poor as both sides bombarded each other with kicks, with no attempt being made to create anything. Not surprisingly, the next two scoring opportunities came from penalty kicks with both Geraghty and Henson missing their chance. An Irish scrum infringement saw Henson kick Bath into the lead before Eastmond was penalised for not releasing. To compound his error he argued with the referee and conceded a further 10 metres, but despite making Geraghty's kick easier, it was still off target. Kyle Eastmond (left) was released by England to turn out for Bath . Chris Cook (right) sprints in to score a try for Bath against London Irish . Cook (front)  somersaults in for a try as Shane Geraghty tries to intercept . Bath almost scored the first try of the game when a clever kick ahead from Henson saw Joseph denied as the centre failed to scoop up the ball when only five metres away from the home line. It was 6-3 to Bath at the end of the first quarter and it was they who were becoming increasingly dominant. Irish were conceding regularly penalties and went further behind when Henson kicked his third penalty after home prop, Halani Aulika was sin-binned for coming into the side of a ruck. Bath suffered an injury blow when their prop, Nathan Catt, was led off with an arm injury to be replaced by Nick Auterac. Auterac joined the scrum and immediately helped his side secure a penalty try award which Henson converted. Aulika returned from the bin in time to see Geraghty kick his second penalty leaving Irish trailing 16-6 at the interval. Within two minutes of the restart, Bath looked to have sealed the game when Thomas brushed aside some terrible Irish tackling to run over 25 metres to score an excellent solo try which Henson converted. However a spirited Irish responded with 10 points of their own when Paice forced his way over from close range for a try, which Geraghty converted before adding a penalty.

Irish had much the better of the third quarter as Bath made a number of unenforced errors but it was the visitors who picked up the next score when Henson kicked his fourth penalty after another scrummage offence. When Irish conceded another scrum penalty, Bath declined a kickable penalty in favour of an attacking line-out but it proved to be the wrong option as it was easily defended by the hosts. With 11 minutes remaining, Bath replacement, Cook, saw a gap to run 25 metres for the crucial try, which Henson converted. Dominic Day was sin-binned for Bath which allowed Irish to stage a late rally with Short picking up their second try for Geraghty to convert to bring his tally to 13 points.","Bath moved into second place in the Aviva Premiership with victory over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium .

Liverpool ended two points behind winners Manchester City last season, though manager Brendan Rodgers secured the consolation of Champions League football after a five-year absence. The Reds are languishing in the bottom half of the table - 18 points adrift of Premier League pacesetters Chelsea - and Lallana feels a top-four finish is now their priority.

'But we don't want to look that far and we want to get back to winning ways.' Rodgers has overseen just four wins in 11 games this season, and the Reds travel to Selhurst Park to face Crystal Palace on Sunday.

'With a game against Crystal Palace it's a great chance for us to get three points and start a run,' the 26-year-old said. '(Silverware) should be the target for us. We want to pick up a trophy and the manager said that he felt that since he's come in the team has improved but still without winning a trophy. That's definitely the target.'

"Ryan Babel's time at Liverpool wasn't particularly memorable, but Anfield still seems to hold a place in his heart after the Dutch winger released a clothing range branded 'YNWA'. The 27-year-old was signed by Rafa Benitez in 2007 and spent four uninspiring seasons on Merseyside - where arguably his most remarkable act was receiving a £10,000 fine for posting a picture of then referee Howard Webb wearing a Manchester United shirt on his Twitter account. The former Holland international, who is now plying his trade for mid-table Kasimpasa in the Turkish Super Lig, returned to social media to reveal his fashion range bearing the acronym of Liverpool's famous 'You'll Never Walk Alone' anthem.

"Arsene Wenger is considering offering an Arsenal coaching role to Thierry Henry who is ready to tackle the next stage of his glittering career. Henry’s contract with New York Red Bulls expires next month at the end of the MLS season and although he is yet to announce his retirement, many believe he will finish as a player. ‘It’s not impossible,’ said Wenger, when asked if the 37-year-old former Arsenal captain could return to coach. ‘I welcome people who have played for us to come back but not (for just) an honorary job. VIDEO Scroll down to watch a nostalgic Thierry Henry talk about Arsenal . Arsene Wenger says it is 'not impossible' for Thierry Henry to return to Arsenal in a coaching role . Wenger speaks with Alexis Sanchez during training ahead of Arsenal's clash with Manchester United . Henry is expected to retire once his contract with New York Red Bulls expires at the end of the MLS season . ‘It has to be a job that is available and one where you get up in the morning and do something.’ Henry has said he would like to manage Arsenal, where he played for eight years, won two League titles and became club leading scorer before joining Barcelona in 2007. He returned briefly on loan from New York in January 2012 and has a total of 228 goals for the north London club. Wenger said: ‘Has he the quality to be a manager? Yes... but he has to decide to sacrifice his life. When you’re a player, you think it’s so simple to be a manager. When you are a manager, you think it’s so complicated suddenly and if you’re not prepared for that you cannot survive. ‘One quality that you need is resistance to criticism when you feel it’s not justified.

"Master trainer Freddie Roach is torn between urging Manny Pacquiao to land the first-round knock-out which both believe is possible here or taking his time so as not to scare off Floyd Mayweather. Either way Roach expects the PacMan to stop New York’s Chris Algieri but there is more at stake in Macau’s sold-out Cotai Arena than the world welterweight title. Pacquiao has to win to keep alive the chance of finally meeting Mayweather in what could become a billion dollar super-fight. But if he does so in devastating fashion then Floyd the Money man might shy away from jeopardising his unbeaten record. Freddie Roach (left) wants Manny Pacquiao to set up a showdown with Floyd Mayweather . Pacquiao (centre) poses ahead of his world welterweight bout with Chris Algieri in Macau . Roach wants Pacquiao to eventually take on Floyd Mayweather (left) in what would be a mouthwatering clash . Roach says: ‘Manny tells me he can KO this guy in one round and I believe him. He is back to his best of a few years ago. But if he looks sensational we may frighten Floyd out of fighting us.’ To complicate matters even further, Pacquiao is overdue a knock-out to reinforce his counter-claim against Mayweather for the mythical title of best pound-for-pound boxer on earth. The Philippines Congressman has not stopped an opponent since he sent Ricky Hatton to hospital in Las Vegas with sudden, scary ferocity. The confidence that he can do so now is not only based on Algieri’s comparative inexperience as a late-comer to the prize-ring following a successful kick-boxing career. That barren spell as far as KOs are concerned has coincided with Pacquio’s rediscovery of God and Roach was concerned at times by his star pupil’s apparent reluctance to risk inflicting serious harm upon another human being. But now Roach says: ‘The old Manny is back.’ Pacquiao (right) walks away after knocking down Ricky Hatton in Las Vegas in 2009 . Pacquiao's last knock out was  Hatton in 2009 - leaving the Brit needing hospital treatment . Freddie Roach is unsure if Pacquiao (second right) should go for a first-round knock against Chris Algieri . Pacquiao (right) has impressed veteran trainer Roach, who believes he will have too much for Algieri . Pacquiao (left) and Chris Algieri (right) of the United States pose ahead of their world welterweight fight . Here are the stats ahead of the bout in Macau on Saturday (Pacquiao first): . Age: 35/30 . Weight (probable): 10st 4lbs/10st 4lbs . Height: 5ft 5in/5ft 10in . Reach: 67in/72in . Chest normal: 38in/40½n . Chest expanded: 41in/44in . Biceps: 13in/14in . Forearm: 12in/11in . Waist: 30in/31in . Thigh: 20in/21in . Calf: 13in/13½in . Neck: 15½in/16in . Wrist: 8in; 6½in . Fist: 10in/12in . Record: W56, K0s 38, L5, D2/W20, K0s 8, L0, D0 . Supporting evidence for that has come in their final work-outs in the gym at the Venetian Hotel and Casino. Pacquiao has looked even faster than in his recent fights. Most significantly, his punches seem to have regained their former snap and power. At coming up 36, he says: ‘I feel young, like I did in my 20s. I feel stronger. I’m hitting harder and, yes, the old aggression is back.’ If he is right then for Algieri, a 30-year-old medical graduate who plans to become a doctor when he quits the ring, it may be a case on Sunday morning of physician, heal thyself. Pacquiao has agreed to come down three pounds from the welterweight limit for this fight against a light-welter world champion. Yet, curiously, the undefeated Algieri is the bigger man. Most intriguingly he is five inches the taller at 5ft 10in and has a four-inch reach advantage. If he stays at a distance behind his left jab it may take Pacquiao time to catch up with him. Pacquiao would prefer him to trade punches - ‘to simplify my job’ - but does not expect him to do so. Algieri (right) is five inches taller than Pacquiao and also has a four-inch reach advantage . Nor does Roach, at least not for long. He says: ‘The first time Manny hits him with a left he’ll run. The second time Manny hits him with a left, it will be over.’ Algieri sounds ready to heed the warnings saying: ‘Why should I exchange with one of the greatest fighters of all time? If I can keep away from his punches while scoring with my job, why not?’ There speaks a man as sensible as his academic achievements suggest. But Roach says: ‘Unfortunately for this boy he’s in over his head. And not even the best men Manny has fought have been able to stop him getting inside for long. His college degrees will not help him here.’ Pacquiao has said his 'old aggression' is back ahead of his bout with Algieri at the weekend . Pacquiao celebrates his victory over Timothy Bradley in Las Vegas in April . Algieri has the courage to put up a fight, as he proved when rising from two first down knock-downs against Russian hard-man Ruslan Provodnikov to win his world title over 12 tough rounds. But Roach points out: ‘Although Provodnikov can hit, Algieri has never been hit by anyone with Manny’s power. As for his own punching, he can’t crack an egg.’ Algieri, with his blue-eyed good looks of a male model, has the Chinese girls swooning over him in their thousands here. But for my money, shortly after midday Sunday local time in the world’s busiest casino, he is the one likely to fall faint, in the fifth or sixth round.

"Gareth Bale has hailed Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo as the 'best player in the world' but says the best piece of advice he has given him during their time together isn't football-related. Bale joined the Spanish giants in a world record £86million transfer from Tottenham in September 2013 as he embarked upon life in a new country and culture. And Bale revealed it was Ronaldo who told him where to live in the Spanish capital - something the Wales superstar is eternally grateful for. Gareth Bale (left) says Cristiano Ronaldo helped him find a house when he moved to Real Madrid . Asked what is the best thing Ronaldo has taught him, Bale laughed in an interview with the Telegraph: ‘Where to find a house in Madrid, actually.'

"Brendan Rodgers' persistence with Mario Balotelli as a lone striker has failed to pay off and the Liverpool manager has finally admitted it may be time for a change. In Daniel Sturridge's absence, which is likely to stretch from August 31 into the new year, the Italy international has managed just two goals in 13 appearances and has yet to hit the mark in the Premier League. There has been much criticism of the tactic of playing the 24-year-old on his own in a front three as it is generally accepted he plays better in tandem with someone else. Rickie Lambert (centre) might replace Mario Balotelli (right) in the Liverpool starting team in coming weeks . Striker Daniel Sturridge has had yet another injury setback after picking up another thigh injury . That was expected to be Sturridge at Crystal Palace on Sunday, but a new thigh injury this week has ended hopes the pair could reinstate their partnership which was so effective in Balotelli's - and the team's - best performance of the season in the 3-0 win at Tottenham in Sturridge's last game for the club. With that option now unavailable to Rodgers, he has hinted he may now need to tinker with his set-up. That could either mean good or bad news for the £16million summer signing from AC Milan. Rodgers had confirmed Rickie Lambert, another close-season arrival, will play a greater role in the coming weeks and he could opt to play the former Southampton man, who has yet to open his account, in a two up front or even replace Balotelli outright. Either way it suggests a change in tactics from the Reds boss, who also has Fabio Borini at his disposal. 'You have to find the solutions when you are not winning games,' said Rodgers, whose side have won just once in their last six matches in all competitions and taken only one point from their last three league matches. 'You have to assess where you can be better and that is something I will always do. 'I am not dogmatic. I have shown in my time here we have played in various systems: possession and fast football, counter-attacking football. Balotelli has only scored twice since signing for Liverpool from AC Milan and still has not scored a league goal . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has vowed to find ways to improve his team's woeful form . 'There are other possibilities for us and we will always explore that. 'That was one of the reasons we brought in the likes of Rickie. He is a talented footballer but he gives you a different option of playing in a different way. 'When he is in the team you have to ensure you get crosses into the box and get service for him, but it is the job of the manager to analyse that and pick what is the best structure in the game to get you a result.' Shorn of the goals of Sturridge and summer departure Luis Suarez, Liverpool have not come remotely close to replicating the sort of form which saw them finish runners-up last season. The Balotelli conundrum has very much tested Rodgers, as has working out how to integrate the numerous summer signings he made with the proceeds of the £75million sale of Suarez to Barcelona and get them up to speed. 'Very much so. It is the beauty of the game at the leading edge,' said the Northern Irishman, when asked whether it had been a tough challenge for him as manager. Liverpool have struggled to replace the goals scored by Luis Suarez, who left for Barcelona in the summer . 'That week before the international break (when they lost to Newcastle, Real Madrid and Chelsea) was tough in terms of results. 'Of course when you are a club the size of Liverpool the spotlight you come under is huge. 'But I can't complain. It is a wonderful life and the adverse moments always provide you with the opportunity to fight even harder, and that is what we all aim to do here. 'The club is very much together. It hasn't been a great start for us but we know we are only a short distance away from getting a few results which will push us back up, we are in the quarter-finals of a cup competition and the Champions League is still in our own hands. 'We just have to focus and really concentrate on moving on from a difficult period and looking to win games of football, which always changes the outcome.' In terms of looking to the future, Rodgers said a return to Crystal Palace would not hold any traumatic memories for them after their late collapse from 3-0 up to draw 3-3 last season, which put the final nail in their title dream. Rodgers (centre) takes his team to Crystal Palace on Sunday, where they lost 3-0 lead to draw 3-3 last season . 'For me it wasn't the game that cost us,' he said, referring to the home defeat by Chelsea the previous week which took the destiny out of their own hands. 'It is a new season, we have a new motivation to go there and get a result. 'It was a disappointment that night but we are very determined to kick-start our season.'","Brendan Rodgers admitted it is time for a change after poor Liverpool start .

"Exeter Chiefs went to the top of the Aviva Premiership for at least 24 hours after a richly deserved 31-15 victory that left Wasps still in pursuit of a first win at Sandy Park. Two tries for England wing Jack Nowell plus one from number eight Tom Waldrom, and 10 points from the boot of fly-half Gareth Steenson, steered Exeter Chiefs to a 25-8 half-time lead, and two more Steenson penalties after the break sealed the success. Wasps initially matched their hosts with a penalty from fly-half Andy Goode, but against a strong Chiefs defence the visitors could manage just the one try before the break through former England Under-20 full-back Rob Miller. Exeter Chiefs fly half kicked four penalties and two conversions to help his side to a 31-15 victory . Despite five scrum penalties five metres from the Chiefs line, they were not awarded a penalty try after the break. A Tom Lindsay try which was converted by Alex Lozowski proved insufficient to give Wasps a foothold. The Chiefs made two changes from the side that beat league leaders Northampton Saints 24-18 at Franklin's Gardens last weekend with Dave Ewers at blindside flanker and Ian Whitten at inside centre. There were three changes to the Wasps side as Sam Jones came in at openside flanker, after international duty, and Wales lock Bradley Davies and Italian prop Lorenzo Cittadini returned. Exeter winger Jack Nowell (left) scored two tries in an impressive display at Sandy Park . Full-back Phil Dollman, who this week agreed a new two-year deal with the Chiefs, was making his 100th league appearance for the team which was matched by Wasps' England-capped scrum-half Joe Simpson. Exeter made the perfect start when scrum-half Will Chudley perfectly timed his offload for Nowell to score out wide, with fly-half Steenson's conversion squeezing just inside the far upright. Wasps were quickly back up the other end where they won a penalty in front of the posts which England international Andy Goode slotted between the uprights, however Steenson soon countered that for Exeter. Chiefs centre Henry Slade (left) can only watch as Wasps full back Rob Miller crashes over for Wasps . A quick tap penalty allowed the visitors to spread the ball wide with an overlap available as full-back Miller came into the line to touch down. Goode was unable to convert but Steenson then found the target with a penalty. Wasps tested the Chiefs defence, which stood firm, and the home side reacted with Nowell scoring a second try as he shrugged off a couple of defenders to cross the line. The visitors then lost wing Christian Wade with an ankle injury to be replaced by Tom Varndell. A Chiefs catch and drive led to Tom Varndell getting the try which Steenson converted to ensure the 17-point gap between the sides at the interval. Exeter's Matt Jess bursts past Elliot Daly as the Chiefs chased a bonus point in the second half . Wasps started the second half the stronger and caused the Chiefs problems at the scrum close to the line where they were awarded three penalties, but on the fourth occasion tighthead prop Varndell was sent to the sin bin. The next two scrums saw both front rows stood up before reinforcements were sent in to continue the battle five metres from the Chiefs line, only for Wasps to be awarded another penalty. Referee Ian Tempest seemed unwilling to award the visitors a penalty try but instead Chiefs gained the next scrum penalty and were able to clear their line as they remained down to 14 men. Wasps were left scratching their heads wondering as to why they gained nothing for the efforts which would have got them back in the game. When the Chiefs finally got out of their own territory, Steenson landed his third penalty. Wasps replacements Varndell and Lozowski saw a break from deep in their own half and replacement hooker Lindsay crossed from short range. Lozowski converted but Steenson slotted another penalty. The home side went in search of a try-scoring bonus point and Wasps had to play the final two minutes with centre Elliot Daly in the sin bin.","England winger Jack Nowell scored a brace for the home side .

Hamilton was unable to match the supremacy of his Mercedes team-mate, but will take some comfort from the fact he starts directly alongside his rival for tomorrow’s race.

'I was hoping for a Williams to be between us, it didn't happen, but hopefully that can be the case tomorrow.

"Sheffield Wednesday striker Stevie May and Huddersfield substitute Nahki Wells went closest to breaking the deadlock as the lunchtime Sky Bet Championship Yorkshire derby ended goalless at the John Smith's Stadium. May, who won his first full Scotland cap against England on Tuesday, fired in a 74th-minute shot which struck both crossbar and post, while Wells twice forced Wednesday goalkeeper Keiren Westwood into excellent saves after stepping off the bench in the 68th minute. Huddersfield goalkeeper Joe Murphy pulled off the save of the game to deny Wednesday winger Royston Drenthe a last-minute winner, shortly after Wednesday could have been awarded a penalty. Sean Scannell (left) was unable to mark his two-year contract extension with Huddersfield with a goal . Stevie May (left) made his Scotland debut midweek against England and went closest for Sheffield Wednesday . Huddersfield: Murphy, Smith, Hudson, Lynch, Dixon, Coady (Ward 67), Poyet, Butterfield, Scannell, Holt, Bunn (Wells 67). Subs not used: Hogg, Wallace, Robinson, Allinson, Peltier. Booked: Poyet. Sheff Wed: Westwood, Palmer, Lees, Loovens, Helan, Drenthe, Semedo, McGugan (Lee 86),Maghoma, (Maguire 77), Taylor-Fletcher (Nuhiu 77), May. Subs not used: Dawson, Lavery, McCabe, Dielna. Booked: Drenthe, May, Loovens, Maguire. Att: 14,389 . The West Yorkshire club extended their unbeaten home record to six matches, while Wednesday have drawn seven of their last 11 fixtures. Diego Poyet, for Huddersfield, and Sheffield Wednesday's new loan signing Lewis McGugan both made their debuts for their respective clubs, while Murphy started in goal for the home side after Alex Smithies suffered a back spasm. Winger Royston Drenthe returned from suspension for the visitors. McGugan fired a shot over the crossbar and Gary Taylor-Fletcher failed to connect properly with Jacques Maghoma's cut-back as Wednesday created the better early chances, while Huddersfield winger Sean Scannell sent two low crosses fizzing across the six-yard box at the other end. Jacob Butterfield's slide-rule pass then carved open Wednesday's defence midway through the first half, setting Tommy Smith free on the overlap, and the right-back's raking cross was snuffed out by visiting centre-half Tom Lees' last-ditch near-post lunge. Scannell turned neatly in the box to clip another inviting pass across the face of goal shortly before half-time as Town gained the upper hand, but a blue shirt failed to get on the end of it. Wednesday left-back Jeremy Helan thwarted the charging Scannell with a timely challenge and on-loan centre-forward Grant Holt headed left-back Paul Dixon's cross over soon after the restart. Butterfield dragged his shot off target after Harry Bunn's backheel on the edge of the box and Scannell again threatened to break the deadlock when he raced into shooting range and blazed an angled drive over the crossbar. Tom Lees (left) of Sheffield Wednesday gets across to block a shot from Harry Bunn of Huddersfield . It needed something more incisive against a Wednesday defence that has kept 10 clean sheets this season and in the 68th minute Town boss Powell sent on striker Nahki Wells for Conor Coady. Wells' response was almost instantaneous as he darted through on goal, only to see his shot parried by Wednesday goalkeeper Keiren Westwood. But Wednesday went closest to scoring the game's opening goal in the 74th minute when May pounced in the box and lashed a rising shot which beat Murphy and struck the crossbar and then post before bouncing clear. Wells then wasted a free-kick when he curled his effort high and wide after being hauled down by Wednesday skipper Glenn Loovens and blasted a shot straight at Westwood after finding himself in the clear with six minutes remaining. Wednesday were denied a late spot-kick when substitute Chris Maguire went over Joel Lynch's challenge but was harshly booked for simulation. Drenthe then sprang the offside trap in time added on, but his well-struck curling shot was brilliantly turned away by Murphy to ensure the spoils were shared .","Sean Scannell missed best chance  in a quiet first half for Huddersfield .

"Lewis Hamilton has said he will not cheat his way to the Formula One title in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. The Mercedes driver, who is aiming to win his second world title ahead of fierce rival Nico Rosberg, promised not to sully the season finale with a scurrilous act. Asked if he would stage a crash, he said: ‘Have I crashed all year? I’m pretty good at what I do. Why would I crash?’ The pair will have the freedom to race without orders from Mercedes. So, with a 17-point lead over Rosberg, Hamilton would potentially benefit if he took him out. But he said of crashing: ‘That’s not me. I want to win by winning. I’ve never raced that way.’ Hamilton completed a practice double on Friday as his bid to win a second Formula One world championship got off to the best-possible start. Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets in both practice sessions at the Yas Marina Circuit on Friday . Hamilton is 17 points ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg with just one race of the season remaining . 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix , even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. After topping the timesheets in the opening session, Hamilton was against fastest under the lights in Abu Dhabi. Hamilton was only 0.083 seconds ahead of title rival Nico Rosberg, who knows he must win this weekend to stand any chance of snatching the title from his Mercedes team-mate. 'I got the whole session which was great, but there is still time to find,' said Hamilton. 'It's the same programme as each weekend and we are just chipping away at it. The team has done an awesome job. This is the best car I have had to drive round here. 'I am going to do the best I can and so far I am making the right steps.' A top-two finish, regardless of the controversial double points on offer this weekend, will guarantee Hamilton the title. Given Mercedes have scored one-twos in the last six races it would appear all that can stop Hamilton is either an accident or technical issue.

Will Stevens Caterham 1:47.057 . 20. Fernando Alonso Ferrari . In practice, Hamilton did all that was asked with  Rosberg naturally second best, as not for the first time this campaign no-one could hold a candle to the dominant duo. At the conclusion of the first 90-minute session, in particular, the margin from Hamilton to Ferrari's Fernando Alonso in third was a staggering 1.7secs following soft-compound tyre runs. Even McLaren's Jenson Button, potentially competing in the last race of his 15-season career as his future remains in limbo with McLaren not deciding on their driver line-up until after December 1, found the situation amusing. With his car in the garage due to a technical fault, watching from the sidelines, Button tweeted: 'Great to see @MercedesAMGF1 have got a lot of competition here in Abu Dhabi!! 1.7second gap!' With Pirelli's supersoft rubber given an outing in the second session the margin of dominance was at least narrowed. Hamilton finished a slender 0.083secs clear of Rosberg, with Kevin Magnussen in his McLaren the best of the rest at nearly three quarters of a second off the pace. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, now confirmed as a Ferrari driver for next season, and Williams' Valtteri Bottas, also managed to finish within a second of Hamilton. Rosberg speaks to his wife Vivian ahead of Friday practice for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . Bottas and team-mate Felipe Massa had earlier sat out most of FP1 after the sidepod bodywork on the Finn's car had ripped off early in the session, whilst that on the Brazilian's car was found to be loose. Bottas and Massa made up for lost time in FP2, with each completing 34 laps, although the latter was only 10th and 1.445secs off the pace. In between the pair were Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, Kimi Raikkonen in his Ferrari, with Jenson Button eighth at least, albeit late on track given his earlier woes and managing only 23 laps, with Toro Rosso's Daniil Kvyat ninth. Fernando Alonso's Ferrari is towed back to the paddock after he stopped on track with an electrical issue . The Spaniard, who will join McLaren next season, watches from the sidelines after his Ferrari stopped on track . For Alonso, from the relative high of third, the departing star who will return to McLaren for next season, slumped to the low of 20th and last without a time to his name. Due to an electrical problem with his car, Alonso was forced to pull up in front of the Yas Viceroy hotel that straddles the circuit. Ahead of him were the Caterham duo of Kamui Kobayashi and debutant Will Stevens in 18th and 19th respectively, the latter nearly five seconds behind fellow Briton Hamilton. The Leafield-based team are back on the grid after being allowed to miss the last two races due to falling into administration. With the team in the shop window, 23-year-old Essex racer Stevens had to wait until 15 minutes from the end of FP1 before finally savouring his first taste of F1 after encountering technical issues. FP2 was more productive as he also completed 34 laps, and despite finishing 1.6secs behind team-mate Kobayashi, can at least be relatively satisfied with his first day as a F1 driver.

"Where do England go from here? Stuart Lancaster’s team still face unanswered questions less than 10 months out from the World Cup and defeat next week against Australia would complete a hat-trick of losses to the Southern Hemisphere super powers. Clive Woodward’s team began their World Cup countdown with famous wins over New Zealand, Australia and South Africa on successive weekends but Lancaster’s team appear miles behind. Here Sam Peters speaks to series of former players and coaches to get their take on where England must learn and improve if they want to be contenders at next year’s tournament. England’s 2003 winning flanker, former captain Lewis Moody, 71 England caps, 3 Lions caps . Take the chances presented to you . England’s driving maul and set-piece play has been very effective but they are not using that ball anywhere near wisely enough. The frustrating thing is that England have created chances against South Africa and New Zealand, but have not taken them. I’m thinking of Mike Brown’s dropped pass against New Zealand and Dave Attwood not straightening and giving a pass against South Africa. Those moments make or break you at the highest level. England failed to take their big chances against South Africa and New Zealand . Attack the gainline . If you watch New Zealand closely then you’ll see how many times a forward carries the ball up at first receiver before off-loading out of the tackle to a second runner on their shoulder. It may only take them two or three metres past the gainline but it means they always have quick ball. At the moment England’s runners are on their own and getting isolated. That means slow ball. They have to work on that area because if we can generate quick ball there are exciting runners who can thrive on it. Back-row needs competition . I would have liked to have seen a different player at No 7 against Samoa because we need to know what someone like Matt Kvesic, Luke Wallace or Will Fraser can do in that key position. If Chris Robshaw gets injured then there is no obvious replacement in that position. Steffon Armitage is also a player I’d be pulling all the stops out to get involved ahead of the World Cup. At the moment England’s back row feels a bit predictable and I’d like to see some other players being given an opportunity in that area. Ultimately we know what players like James Haskell can do. I understand why they’ve picked him but there are other players out there England need to learn about. England should pull out all the stops to get Steffon Armitage in the team . Beat Australia . It’s not all doom and gloom with this England team. Lancaster will have learned a lot about his players in this series — not all of it good — and will have a clearer idea about which players can survive at the highest level. But they have to start winning soon, starting with Australia next week, because otherwise the rot can set in very quickly. EX-England scrum-half, Sky commentator Dewi Morris, 26 England caps, 3 Lions caps . Build on the set piece . England will always produce yeomen for the team to build a platform off, but at the moment England are wasting their hard-earned set-piece possession. Despite injuries to guys like Dan Cole and Joe Launchbury, the pack is still rock solid so why on earth aren’t the backs doing anything when they have it? England have one of the best openside flankers in the world in Armitage . Breakdown — bring back Armitage . I watched the South Africa game alongside Zinzan Brooke and Neil Back and I can tell you they were tearing their hair out at the lack of balance in England’s back row. Robshaw is a fine workhorse but he is out of position at No 7 and England’s breakdown work is suffering as a result. In Armitage England have one of the best openside flankers in the world, but he’s kicking his heels in France because of this selection ruling. Stuart Lancaster — who I’m a big admirer of by the way — has to change his policy on this or England will never produce the quick ball they crave. The Farrell conundrum . I’m sorry but it really does seem to be one rule for one and one rule for another in terms of selection at the moment. Danny Care has a couple of bad games and is booted out of the squad while Owen Farrell — who is patently not fit — is just as bad but gets shifted to inside centre. Am I missing something here? For me, Farrell is not even the best attacking fly-half at his club, where Charlie Hodgson is superb, and he is very fortunate to get another go at inside centre. I hope that midfield combination works, but I fear Farrell is just too functional where England need creativity and world-class distribution. Owen Farrell was very fortunate to get another go at inside centre . The need for speed . If England are going to pick Farrell they have to have speed everywhere around him and at the moment that is not the case. Brad Barritt is another trusted workhorse but where is the searing pace that England’s midfield and wingers should provide. I don’t understand why Jonathan Joseph doesn’t get a look in. I’d have picked Bath’s midfield of Ford, Joseph and Kyle Eastmond for last night’s clash. England’s 2003 World Cup winning coach Sir Clive Woodward, 21 England caps, 2 Lions caps . Width . England are simply not getting enough width on the ball and that is largely down to them not having played a ball-playing 12. I believe Farrell can do that job and I’m excited England have finally gone down that path of two playmakers in the midfield. Look at every great team in the world, they all play that way, and England must stick with that combination going forward. Breakdown . I’m a huge advocate of Steffon Armitage and I find it utterly baffling the RFU won’t make an exception for such a world-class talent. England’s back-row balance is not right at the moment, with the excellent Robshaw much better suited to the blindside flank, and yet they have this world-class talent across the channel who is ready and willing to play. Question marks over Farrell's fitness means England should pick Danny Cipriani . Go for broke: pick Cipriani . Danny Cipriani is such a talented fly-half who has produced consistent performances for Sale for more than a year now. I’m a big fan of Farrell when he’s fit and firing while Ford has huge potential with his quick feet and good hands. But for me, Cipriani is a cut above any other fly-half in England and he now has experience to add to undoubted quality. Why won’t England pick him? Pace at 13 . If England are going to play Farrell at No 12, they simply must pick a flyer at 13. Barritt is not that man. When fit, Manu Tuilagi has all the credentials in terms of pace and size, but if he is not in the side, England need to discover a 13 with pace to burn. England’s 2003 World Cup winner and former captain Phil Vickery, 73 England caps, 5 Lions caps . Come in No 7 . The openside spot still bothers me but that will be a constant dialogue until the World Cup. If Robshaw falls over on the eve of the tournament then Lancaster will have to throw in a rookie. Even New Zealand rotate Richie McCaw with Sam Cane and if he is unavailable, then they have a ready-made re-placement. Saturday's game against Samoa should have been an occasion for Lancaster to look at another option whether that be Fraser, Kvesic or... Armitage. Find the extra edge . The difficulty at that level is to work out where you can find that extra couple of per cent from, either within yourself or the team. You are the best man in the country in your position, that is why you have been picked, but you have a duty to look at your game and mindset and work out where you can get those marginal gains from. Under Clive Woodward we had the constant message of trying to find those extra ‘one percenters’, the England players must adopt that mindset and find the belief.","Lewis Moody says England need Steffon Armitage in the back row .

"By Sunday evening, Abu Dhabi time, Formula One will have a new champion. Whether it will have a credible future is another matter entirely. Ideally, Lewis Hamilton will have driven first, or second, through the flag at the Yas Marina circuit just moments before. If Hamilton finishes top two — as he has done in the last six races — order will reign and the integrity of the event will be maintained. If Hamilton finishes lower — or worst-case scenario, not at all — a sport already beleaguered by courtroom battles and economic crisis will plunge towards its greatest controversy yet. Fans will tolerate financial scandal, and complex legal battles leave them cold. Fair play is a different matter. On occasions when Formula One has attracted greatest negativity, a miscarriage of justice, an assault on basic fairness, has invariably been responsible. Nelson Piquet Jnr crashed deliberately at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to trigger the safety car and a win for his Renault team-mate Fernando Alonso; Rubens Barrichello was told to let Ferrari team-mate and No 1 driver Michael Schumacher pass to win the Austrian Grand Prix in 2002. One act was close to fraudulent — but neither sat well with the public. Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg will go head to head for the F1 Drivers' Championship this weekend . Rosberg is 17 points behind Hamilton, but still stands a good chance thanks to the double points on offer . The Mercedes pair have been nip and tuck all season long in their title battle . Title contender Nico Rosberg enjoys a spot of keepy-up ahead of the season finale in Abu Dhabi . 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. Motor sport, we are told, is a team game, and Ferrari’s desire to keep Schumacher on top was no different in essence to a football manager picking one player and dropping another for a big match. Yet something about the instruction struck at the heart of ethical racing and team orders that directly influenced race positions were subsequently outlawed. If anything, Sunday’s grand finale represents an even greater threat to the status of Formula One. This time it is not an individual race that may be artificially adjusted but an entire season. There is a chance that Hamilton — who has 10 wins in 2014, double that of any rival prior to Abu Dhabi — might not claim the drivers’ championship. The reason? Last race double points. For one day only, 25 first-place points become 50, 18 second place points hike to 36. You get the idea. No decision on next year has been announced, but the practice is almost certain to be abandoned after this single season experiment. Like all bad ideas, double points is an orphan. Nobody is willing to take responsibility for it; nobody claims to have brought it into the world. It was born, and will die, in this season. With luck it will not take the reputation of the sport with it. The Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi will host the final round of the 2014 season this weekend . Hamilton signs autographs for spectators at the circuit in the Middle East on Thursday . ‘Double the points, double the action,’ is the sell here, but only half of that claim is true. Abu Dhabi has double points, but the action is just the same. It is not as if the drivers go around twice for their bonus. If they did, it might make sense. As it is, double points is a rule change designed to thwart a man whose time was up anyway. Sebastian Vettel was dominating the sport when it was first mooted. Bizarrely, this success was presumed to continue and double points was considered a way of slowing his procession while creating the potential for intrigue on the last day. It was hasty and an over-reaction. Vettel is a distant fourth this year. He is so out of contention he is quitting Red Bull for Ferrari in time for 2015. The F1 bonus round is therefore akin to the Premier League changing the points system to put the brakes on Manchester United — and introducing the measure to coincide with the arrival of David Moyes. Grand prix racing has always had a cavalier approach to scoring. Relations between the pair have been strained this season due to a number of racing incidents . Hamilton and Rosberg make contact at the Belgian Grand Prix at Spa in August . It was not so long ago that teams were allowed to discount their worst race in the first half of the season. There also used to be smaller margins, as little as two points, between first and second. Bernie Ecclestone claims his initial idea for double points involved three races carrying the incentive, not one, which would make more sense. Bonus points for marquee events — the last race of the season, the Monaco Grand Prix and one other (Silverstone or Monza if influenced by history, Spa or Suzuka if judged on the test, Singapore for the spectacle, Bahrain or Sochi if Bernie just farmed it out to the highest bidder) — would not be a calamity. After all, not all tennis and golf tournaments are created equal, with bigger prize-money and prestige attached to events that bring the greatest pressure and athletic challenge. Had there been three occasions this season when Formula One had recognised a test of increased significance, this might have been hailed as a visionary move. Instead, it looked like another Ecclestone-inspired gimmick. Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone at the Yas Marina circuit on Thursday . Hamilton and Rosberg have been friends ever since their karting days . Race winner Hamilton on the podium with Rosberg at the 2008 Australian Grand Prix . VIDEO Stewart backs Hamilton to clinch title . Sport does not always have to be fair. Indeed, one of its challenges is the way an individual or team reacts to the adversity of an official’s lousy decision, a run of injuries or a technical failure. Yet it cannot be wantonly unjust. And if Hamilton — without doubt the driver of the season — ends up trailing his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg by some final-race fluke, it will be regarded as one of sport’s great travesties. Maybe this accounted for the tension in the room as the men sat on the top tier for Thursday’s pre-race press conference. They were separated by Nico Hulkenberg of Force India and looked straight ahead, barely acknowledging each other save for a forced handshake for photographers. Rosberg initiated it, Hamilton responded, with barely a flicker of recognition. The interviews had been going roughly 23 minutes before he allowed even a half-smile. Asked about driver etiquette with so much at stake, Hamilton’s replies were clipped and the sentiments pointed. If Hamilton took Rosberg out at the first corner, the title would be his. He insisted he was not that type of driver; Rosberg hardly offered confirmation of this statement. A young Hamilton and Rosberg riding unicycles together . Even without double points, the motivation for Hamilton to fight dirty would not change — yet the warped scoring system has given the whole event an unreal air. After 17 races, here comes a leap into the unknown. And Formula One could do without another scandal. It occupies an awkward position in the modern psyche as it is — such conspicuous consumption against the backdrop of global recession. The Yas Marina complex is a billionaire’s playground. Yachts bob in the harbour, the five-star hotel straddling the circuit is a design classic, the work of Hani Rashid and Lisa Anne Couture of Asymptote Architecture in New York. Meanwhile, in what resembled a deserted lot at the end of the paddock, the crowd-funded Caterham team announced the recruitment of Will Stevens, a 23-year-old making his F1 debut in this final race. Caterham entered administration in October and the man now in charge, Finbarr O’Connell, said they had come to Abu Dhabi only as a showcase for potential buyers. It is an irony that those at the far end of the leaderboard fight to be noticed. Despite the predicted double action, what Formula One could most do with this weekend is no alarms, no surprises and the natural order maintained.","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg will go head to head for title on Sunday .

"Paul O’Connell fears Australia might be a step ahead of Ireland heading into Saturday's Guinness Series finale due to their greater consistency in selection. Ireland, who are gunning for a first November clean sweep since 2006, field a side containing 13 of the team that started in the win a fortnight ago over South Africa. However, the skipper is concerned that last Sunday’s wholesale changes — just two players who started against the Boks were retained to start against Georgia — could give Australia an edge.

O'Connell (left) with Richard Strauss during a training session ahead of Saturday's clash with the Wallabies . O'Connell said that Ireland coach Joe Schmidt has set out a mantra which is easy to execute . ‘I like playing week on week,’ said O’Connell. ‘Some guys, maybe the power athletes, like having a week off between games, but I like playing week on week. ‘It’s down to personal choice but, for me, I’d rather be in the position that the Australians are in. ‘They have rested one or two guys (after last weekend’s loss to France), but by and large have a continuity of selection, they’re playing really high intensity games week on week.’ O’Connell also quashed speculation linking him to a possible post-World Cup switch to Pau. ‘I don’t know anything about it,’ he said. ‘There has been nothing done on my behalf or nothing done on Pau’s behalf anyway. ‘I’m contracted until the summer of 2016, so I just don’t know where it (the story) came from.’","Paul O'Connell will lead Ireland out against Australia on Saturday .

"Looking back, George Ford gave a telling clue about the precocious talent and mental strength that England hope to harness on Saturday, when he scored eight tries in a junior rugby league match – at the age of nine. He was playing against older boys. That didn’t faze him. He was playing against bigger boys. That didn’t faze him either. Such a scenario would become the norm in his fast-track rise to the heights. But back then, he also had to deal with good-natured banter from members of Wigan’s famous Farrell clan, which he duly made a mockery of. George’s brother, Sale fly-half Joe Ford, recalled their formative years in both codes and told Sportsmail: ‘The biggest game that stands out for me was when George played for Saddleworth Rangers against Wigan St Pat’s, which is the team Owen Farrell used to play for. They are the biggest rugby league amateur club and George was in an age-group above himself. George Ford is set to take England's No 10 shirt for the first time against Samoa on Saturday . Ford trains with his team-mates ahead of England's Autumn International Test at Twickenham . Ford practices with Owen Farrell (left) who he has played with since his childhood . The Bath fly-half releases the ball as England are put through their paces at the Pennyhill Park Hotel . ‘At the time, my dad was coaching Oldham and Andy Farrell’s twin brothers played for Oldham. They were giving George a lot of stick before the game, saying that they were going to get smashed. The next day he scored eight tries.’ The prodigious playmaker who will wear England’s No 10 shirt for the first time on Saturday, against Samoa at Twickenham, grew up in a rugby household, but league was the code of choice. He and Joe would watch their father, Mike, play for Castleford Tigers and then act as player-coach at Oldham. From the age of four, George and his older brother would come along to training, watch the team in action and try to emulate them. Keith Brennan was an Oldham player at the time and he went on to coach George at Waterhead RLFC. He said: ‘George and Joe used to come to training with Mike and you would see the pair of them with a rugby ball in their hands constantly. They were always practising their passing and kicking. For however long we were training, they would be doing exactly the same with the ball.’ Over the years that followed, the chosen practice location would be Churchill playing fields, up on the hills of Saddleworth, just outside Oldham. That is where Mike would take them to hone their kicking. When he was away, their mum, Sally-Ann, drove them there to train and train. Former England coach Mike Ford (left) poses with his sons George (centre), 14, and Joe (right), 17 . As a youngster, Ford took inspiration from rugby league star Paul 'Scully' Sculthorpe (centre) Brother Joe Ford, who plays for Sale Sharks, insists George has to conviction to own the England No 10 shirt . It helped that there was inspiration at close quarters. Paul Sculthorpe, ‘Scully’, was our next-door neighbour and he treated us really well, like sons,’ said Joe. ‘He was always out the front, throwing balls around with us. He was George’s favourite player. ‘George and I always played a lot of one-on-one, so there was always a bit of competition. George always had a Saints shirt on with ‘Scully’ on the back. He never took that off. I was more mixed; I went round the houses a bit, but George was always loyal to Scully!’ When Mike’s coaching career took him from Oldham to a role with Ireland in union, his sons relished the opportunity for some informal tuition from Test players. As a surreal twist, years later George finds himself forming a half-back partnership at Bath with one of the players – Peter Stringer – who made him and his brother feel so welcome on their visit. ‘We went into Ireland camp with my dad,’ said Joe. ‘We spent a week with him, which was good. We got to work on our kicking with Ronan O’Gara and David Humphreys, which was great. It was just before the 2003 World Cup and we spent a week with them in Limerick. Peter Stringer was in camp then and he took us out for an ice cream!’ Ford (left) switched codes from rugby league to start his union career with Leicester Tigers . Ford (centre) joined Bath Rugby after the 2013 season having won two trophies with Leicester . The Bath star now plays alongside Peter Stringer - who bought the young brothers ice cream as children . At school, George made a profound impression with his dedication and work ethic, in the class room as well as on the rugby pitch. Aside from a spell down in Hertfordshire – at the same school as Owen Farrell – while Mike was coaching at Saracens, most of his education took place at Rishworth School near Halifax. The head of sport, Andrew Thomas, recalls how he quickly made his mark. ‘He came to us as a rugby league lad,’ he said. ‘He was a phenomenal player, but I don’t think he had played rugby union at that stage. He had obviously watched it and he knew about it, but all his skills were from league. ‘My first memory of George playing rugby union was a game on our pitches here; on the junior, Under 12-sized pitch. We were playing Woodhouse Grove, who are a decent rugby school. I was refereeing and it was the first time I had seen George play. ‘Their No 8 picked the ball up off the back of a scrum and someone had obviously taught him to run straight at the 10, to see what they were made of. So he ran straight at George and George just nicked the ball off him. He didn’t even bother tackling him, he just nicked the ball, ran to the other end and scored. No-one could believe what happened. I just stood there and thought, “Wow”.’ Ford (left) played with Farrell (right) for England at the Junior World Cup in 2011 . The pair are now set to star for England seniors when they try and reverse a losing streak against Samoa . England skills coach Mike Catt (left) talks to Farrell and Ford during training in Bagshot .

Lost 33-22 to New Zealand in U20 World Cup final. 2014 . Ford made senior debut off the bench at Twickenham as a replacement for Farrell against Wales in the Six Nations. The gifted tyro possessed all the technical attributes required, but what struck Thomas was the mind-set he had, which set him apart. ‘George was a role model here,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t just in his rugby. He had a full timetable but his work was always first in. ‘He was a grafter and well organised – all with a view to the rugby. From a very young age, he was exceptionally driven, knew what he wanted to do and appreciated the sacrifices that had to be made. At 13 and 14, he knew what he would have to give up and how to get the best out of himself. ‘It was clear that he would make it, not so much because of his skills-set, but because of his personality. More than anyone I’ve come into contact with, not just in an educational sphere but in all walks of life, there was no doubt he would succeed because he was so driven.’ That drive would ultimately propel George Ford into professional rugby union, where he became the youngest debutant in the history of the sport in this country – aged 16 years and 237 days – and was voted the IRB’s world Young Player of the Year in 2011. It also led to him switching from Leicester to Bath, in the belief that he was ready to play week after week, and run the show. Ford takes a penalty kick during England's narrow defeat by South Africa last Saturday . England are still searching for a first win this autumn after losing to New Zealand and South Africa . Brennan saw that trait in him too, when he was at Waterhead. ‘The thing with George is that he always stood out,’ he said. ‘He was a year below the other lads, but he was still the stand-out player. It wasn’t always because of the way he played rugby, it was also about the way he approached the game; his attitude. That’s probably the most impressive thing about him. ‘From a young age, everyone could see that George had a special talent, from the way he came across and the way he did things over and over again until he was good at them. He always seemed to be destined for great things. He will cope with it on Saturday, without a doubt. This is what he has always wanted to do. It’s like this was destined to be.’ Joe Ford has similarly strong conviction that his brother can handle the magnitude of what awaits him. ‘There are a lot of good 10s around but, speaking to him, he is quite determined to take this chance and keep the shirt,’ he said.’ The kind of character he is, I wouldn’t be surprised if he did it.’ Starting XV: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Anthony Watson (Bath), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester), George Ford (Bath), Ben Youngs (Leicester), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Rob Webber (Bath), David Wilson (Bath), Dave Attwood (Bath), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), James Haskell (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), Ben Morgan (Gloucester).

"South Africa followed up their win over England with a 22-6 success against Italy, though they were made to work harder than expected in Padova. Tries from Coenie Oosthuizen in the first half and Cobus Reinach in the second took the Springboks out of reach of an Italy side who competed well in the scrum and battled until the end but could not break down the visiting defence. Bryan Habana added a third score in the last minute, his 57th in 105 Tests, to ease any nerves and ensure his side head to Wales next weekend in winning form.

Italy fly-half Kelly Haimona left his opening penalty attempt just short from long range but opened the scoring in the 12th minute after strong scrummaging forced another opportunity from the tee. Pat Lambie levelled, play having been brought back for the penalty after an excellent move ended with Habana held up short of the line.

A South African penalty in kicking range was instead knocked to the corner by Lambie, but the line-out went awry. But another Haimona penalty failed to reach and South Africa quickly went 15-6 up, Reinach finishing a move involving good work by Du Plessis and Carr before Handre Pollard converted . An Italian response was thwarted when the Boks stole line-out ball and the hosts' desperation was clear. As they tried to attack through the phases late on, Duane Vermeulen nicked the ball and sent Pollard racing upfield.

"Manchester United will pay a staggering £785,000 this week to players currently out injured or doubtful for Saturday's trip to Arsenal. Louis van Gaal's team has been decimated by a succession of injury blows and will be well below strength for the teatime clash at the Emirates. But whether they're in training or on the treatment table, United are still shelling out a fortune in wages. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Louis van Gaal faces an injury crisis as Manchester United head to Arsenal for a Saturday teatime showdown . A website has been set up that calculates how much Radamel Falcao has earned since signing for United . Radamel Falcao at Craven Cottage to watch Colombia in their international friendly with the United States . The most high-profile absentee is Colombian striker Radamel Falcao, with Van Gaal confirming he'll be out for another two weeks with the calf injury that has already kept him on the sidelines for a month. Falcao, who is on loan from Monaco, earns £280,000-a-week at Old Trafford and a mickey-taking website has sprung up that calculates how much he has earned since joining on Deadline Day. The tally was creeping towards the £4m mark on Friday morning but he has only featured in five matches for United, scoring one goal. Daley Blind will be out for several months with a knee ligament injury sustained in Holland's Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia but will still coin in £75,000-a-week. There had been confusion over the extent of Blind's injury setback, with United's official Twitter account inadvertently saying he could be out for six months. Manchester United currently sit seventh in the Premier League table, a place behind Arsenal . Daley Blind suffered a knee ligament injury in Holland's Euro qualifier with Latvia and could miss months . Blind posted this picture of his heavily-strapped knee on Twitter this week . VIDEO Blind's injury exaggerated - Van Gaal . But Van Gaal said: 'First he needs to rest for 10 days, then we will have a better idea. I can't say it will be six to eight weeks. 'I can't even say it will be 10 to 12 weeks. But it is definitely not six months.' Defender Marcos Rojo, who also arrived in the summer, earns £70,000-a-week but suffered a dislocated shoulder in the 1-0 defeat to Manchester City earlier this month. He will be out for a few more weeks. His injury is to merely scratch the surface of United's defensive woes, with Rafael Da Silva, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans also out at the minute. Marcos Rojo dislocated his shoulder during United's derby defeat to Manchester City earlier this month . Phil Jones has been out with calf and shin injuries but should be able to return in the next week or two . Jonny Evans has not played since United's 5-3 defeat at Leicester City back in September . Rafael, who is on £50,000-a-week, has a muscular problem, Jones (£50,000-a-week) has a calf and shin problem, while Evans (£65,000-a-week) has an ankle injury. Luke Shaw had an injury scare in England's friendly win over Scotland on Wednesday and was taken off as a precaution after feeling his hamstring tighten but should be fine for Arsenal. In midfield, Ashley Young, who brings home £115,000-a-week, is absent with a groin and pelvis injury. He is believed to be close to a return. Michael Carrick, who earns £80,000-a-week, has been suffering from a similar problem but may return this weekend subject to a late fitness test. It all adds up to a very expensive bill for players who aren't actually available for selection. Luke Shaw suffered a hamstring injury scare in England's midweek friendly with Scotland . Ashley Young is close to a return but the match at Arsenal is believed to come too soon . Michael Carrick will be subject to a late fitness test before the Arsenal game, according to Van Gaal . At least Van Gaal received some good news ahead of the trip to London with goalkeeper David De Gea and playmaker Angel Di Maria fine after injury scares over the international fortnight. The injury epidemic partly explains why United, despite spending £150m over the summer, are seventh ahead of the weekend's action. Van Gaal will be praying there are no further setbacks as United try and challenge for the Champions League places.","Manchester United will be without key personnel for Arsenal trip .

"Leigh Halfpenny has stressed the need for relentless self-belief when Wales target a rare victory over world champions New Zealand on Saturday. Wales last toppled the All Blacks 61 years ago, since when they have suffered 25 successive defeats against them and conceded more than 800 points in the process. New Zealand end their European tour at the Millennium Stadium this weekend, in what will be a final appearance on British and Irish shores until next year's World Cup. Wales full-back Leigh Halfpenny knows his team will have to be at their best to defeat New Zealand . They are firm favourites to beat Wales once again, but a home team that contains 10 British and Irish Lions Test players - including full-back Halfpenny - should not be dismissed lightly. 'It's a huge challenge, but one that we are very excited about,' Halfpenny said. 'We will have to be at the top of our game to be in with a shout of winning. 'We need to play for the 80 minutes and cannot afford to have a lapse of concentration against a side as good as the All Blacks. Halfpenny offloads the ball in training as Wales prepare for Saturday's showdown in Cardiff . 'We have to believe that we can win, right from the first minute. There is respect for them, but we have to treat them exactly the same as other opponents. 'There is a buzz and excitement and the fact that we haven't beaten the All Blacks for so long means there is an opportunity for us. 'There have been some great victories during my career in a Welsh shirt, but to beat the All Blacks would be at the top of them.' Shaun Edwards, meanwhile, has hailed Wales' back-row of 'model professionals' as they prepare to make Welsh rugby history. The breakaway trio of Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton and Taulupe Faletau will start their 19th Test match together in Saturday's All Blacks Test. And that means they remove a revered back-row that played during Wales' so-called 1970s golden era - Dai Morris, John Taylor and Mervyn Davies - from the record books. Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards has hailed the back row as 'model professionals' Wales captain Warburton and Lydiate both made their international debuts in 2009, while number eight Faletau followed two years later. But they have already collected more than 120 caps between them, and all three are Lions Test players. 'They all came through together, basically,' Wales defence coach Edwards said. 'They have been very, very good and proficient for us over the years, and hopefully a lot more years to come. 'They are all model professionals, they work hard at their game and their lifestyles are excellent. We are lucky to have them.'","Wales full-back Halfpenny calls All Blacks contest 'a huge challenge'

"Manuel Pellegrini's decision to play David Silva in a relatively meaningless Capital One Cup tie continues to haunt him as the Manchester City playmaker is still unable to kick a football because of knee trouble. Silva hurt his knee in the 2-1 defeat at home to Newcastle at the end of last month and has been unable to help City as they have continued to struggle in the Barclays Premier League and the Champions League. Now City manager Pellegrini has revealed the Spaniard will miss the league visit of Swansea and the midweek visit of Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Manchester City playmaker David Silva has been ruled out of the games against Swansea and Bayern Munich . Silva has not played since injuring his knee in a Capital One Cup clash with Newcastle in October . He said: ‘We don’t know when he will be back because David still feels some pain in his knee, so he’s not able to kick the ball. We’ll see if next week he can be ready at the end of the week. It will depend on the way he improves in the next few days. ‘He still feels a little pain, but not very hard so I hope in the next week we have good news about David.’ City have won only one of their last six games and face tough Premier League away trips to Southampton and Sunderland after the visit of Bayern on Tuesday.

"Ben Youngs is out of his rut, back in the England team, and the way he managed to relocate his missing spark may serve as a useful message for the entire national squad. The Leicester scrum-half worked out that he was thinking too much, fretting too much, analysing and training and playing with tension. He decided to go back to basics; to just play and not worry so much. The results have been encouraging, as he prepares to start against Samoa on Saturday. Ben Youngs has recovered from his loss of form and is set to start for England against Samoa . The scrum-half blames over analysing his game as part of the reason for losing his place . Youngs (centre) looks dejected following England's 31-28 defeat at the hands of South Africa last week . He said: ‘Last year, when I wasn’t involved in the Six Nations, the biggest thing was to go back to my club and find that spark again; find that thing that got me there in the first place, which was just playing rugby and enjoying it. 'I was struggling for form and I didn’t know how to get out of that rut because I hadn’t been in that situation before. I found myself training longer, kicking longer. I found myself passing longer, doing more weights — whatever it may be to find a way through. And in fact the best thing I could have done was to have done nothing.

Liverpool were prepared to offer more money if there was a chance of securing Origi's release from Lille in January and the Belgium international, who signed for Liverpool for £10million earlier this year, had indicated he would be prepared to move to the Premier League if a deal could be arranged. Rodgers, though, believes the chances of getting Origi are virtually non-existent and has insisted he will channel his energies into the players he has who are fit and available.

"Amid the warm waters of the Blue Lagoon spa in a lava field in south-west Iceland, Lee Cattermole relaxes and reflects with his girlfriend. Three years ago, it was he who was erupting, the then Sunderland captain arrested and later accepting a police caution for damaging five vehicles in Newcastle during a night out with team-mates. Earlier that day, Martin O’Neill had been confirmed as his new manager; it was hardly Cattermole’s wisest move and merely served to vandalise his own character. Sunderland midfielder Lee Cattermole insists he has calmed down from the unpredictable player he once was . Gus Poyet readily admits Cattermole is among the first names on his Sunderland team sheet . Current Sunderland boss Gus Poyet was certainly sceptical upon his arrival one year ago. ‘If somebody tells me this guy is a b*****d and I need to be careful, then I will be. I was told he was impossible to control, that he will get sent off a hundred times and he will let you down,’ says Poyet. ‘I was told he could not play football like I want to. I was told he was training on his own away from everybody else. I thought I’d meet Lee and he’d have a gun and he’d shoot me in the head.’ Twelve months on and Poyet readily admits that Cattermole is the first name on his team sheet. The 26-year-old has just been voted North East Football Writers’ Player of 2014 and the manager is backing his on-field lieutenant for an England call-up — ‘In Uruguay, he would be the hero, the captain,’ he says. The respect is mutual. Cattermole says he has come a long way in 12 months under Poyet. ‘In the last year I have learned a hell of a lot,’ says the anchorman. Poyet took over as manager of Sunderland in October 2013 and continues to work with Cattermole . ‘Gus coming in has been a massive factor in winning the award, which I’m chuffed about. Gus is very much my kind of person, very English minded. ‘It is totally different playing under Gus than any other manager. I think he played street football a lot more. He almost taught himself, which is why he was a very natural player. ‘And he has told me in no uncertain terms that, in the position I play, if I don’t do what he wants then I won’t play. On and off the pitch this is as good as I have ever felt. The manager has stuck with me.’ As Cattermole suggests, off the pitch was a big issue — there was a three-year ban from pubs in his hometown of Stockton in 2008. ‘I have calmed down off the pitch as well as on it,’ he says. ‘I had a couple of incidents during my career which people have read too much into. ‘I have just matured and I even have a girlfriend now. When anyone is 26 they look back to when they were 18 and there is a world of difference — and I am no different.’ Indeed, pubs have made way for geothermal spas and romantic getaways in Nordic lava land. Cattermole — and Poyet — will be hoping his days of boiling over are a thing of the past. Cattermole says he has 'matured' at Sunderland and puts it in no small way down to Poyet's management .","Gus Poyet took over as Sunderland manager in October 2013 .

"Moeen Ali provided a one-man retort to criticism of England’s selection policy with a 21-ball half-century as the tourists completed a facile victory over Sri Lanka A in Colombo. With Alex Hales left out of England’s tour opener at the Sinhalese Sports Club, the coach/captain axis of Peter Moores and Alastair Cook appeared to have provided fresh ammunition to those who feel their top-order batting in one-day cricket is too pedestrian to challenge the world’s best. Instead, Ali hammered all six legitimate deliveries of seamer Vishwa Fernando’s second over for four on his way to a 37-ball 56. Since Cook himself made 54 off 58 deliveries, the big-hitting Hales was hardly missed at all. England opener Moeen Ali justified his selection with three wickets and a stunning half century . Ali hit all six legitimate deliveries of seamer Vishwa Fernando’s second over for four to eventually reach 56 . Off-spin bowler Ali celebrates with his England team-mates after making an impressive start with the ball . Not all the Sri Lankan bowling was of the highest quality, but that is to take nothing away from the cleanliness of Ali’s strokeplay. Chasing 199 in 43 overs, England began their innings with Cook playing out a maiden. Then came Ali. Four times in the next over he deposited Fernando through or over extra cover; once he produced a lovely on-drive; and he rounded things off with a flick off his legs. Throw in a leg-side wide, and the over cost 25. Ali was up and running. His fifty came up in the grand style, courtesy of a six launched over long-on off the off-spin of Ramith Rambukwalla which pierced a hole in an advertising banner on the top tier of the stand. If he slowed down after that, then he had proved his point: on slow Asian pitches, Ali has the game to succeed. Captain Alastair Cook was also amongst the runs as the opener hit a composed half century to match Ali . Cook, watching his shot, hit seven boundaries to reach 54 as England cruised to victory in Sri Lanka . Ian Bell, knocking another shot to safety, finished on 16 guiding England to the win alongside Joe Root . Cook had his moments, too – especially when he was late-cutting the spinners. One slog-sweep for six was a reminder that rope-clearing is not just something other opening batsmen do. Together, the pair added 94 in 13.1 overs. Tougher challenges lie in wait, but this was a good start. Bad light stopped play after 25 overs, with England cruising at 145 for 2, and Ian Bell and Joe Root enjoying a gentle net. When the umpires decided to call it a day, the tourists led by 56 runs on Duckworth/Lewis. Earlier Ali had taken three wickets as England restricted Sri Lanka A to 198 for 6 in their 43 overs, after drizzle had delayed the start for an hour. With Cook’s team looking for the best way to balance their attack in spin-friendly conditions, this contribution was almost as significant as his tearaway half-century. Ali is congratulated by Eoin Morgan having taken three early wickets to put England on top in Sri Lanka . Opener Kusal Perera hit a half century to put Sri Lanka in control but fell to Steven Finn for 56 . Ali struck twice in his third over, first persuading Niroshan Dickwella to top-edge a sweep to a diving James Tredwell at short fine leg, then having Sri Lanka’s former Twenty20 captain Dinesh Chandimal caught at leg slip by Cook second ball. That left the Sri Lankans 49 for 3 after they had batted first, and Ali had a hand in the next two wickets as well – though not before Kusal Perera and Ashan Priyanjan had put on 55 for the fourth wicket. The dangerous Perera uppercut Steven Finn to third man, where Ali clung on, before Ali removed Thilina Kandamby in the next over, playing too soon and driving straight to Eoin Morgan at short extra cover. Finn celebrates the wicket of Perera as England made a promising start to their one-day series in Sri Lanka . It had been a mixed bag from England’s bowlers. Chris Woakes looked sharp during an opening burst of six over for eight runs, while Finn produced a beauty to get rid of Kaushal Silva in the game’s third over, but also sent down four wides. In that, he was hardly alone. Woakes also bowled four wides, as did the erratic Chris Jordan, whose five overs leaked 48 and who looks an increasingly luxury in this one-day side. Tredwell was tidy, and three lively overs from Ben Stokes produced the wicket of Priyanjan, caught behind by Jos Buttler. England will also be disappointed that they failed to finish Sri Lanka A off after reducing them to 122 for 6. But, with only two warm-up games scheduled before Wednesday’s first one-day international in Colombo, Cook’s side would have settled for this. And, for the time being, they have quietened the debate about their top order. Captain Alastair Cook nearly tripped on a kit bag as he led the side out in Sri Lanka .","Off-spin bowler Moeen Ali took three wickets including Dinesh Chandimal .

"Michael Owen believes Mario Balotelli will soften the blow of Daniel Sturridge's injury by reviving Liverpool's season during the hectic Christmas period. Owen, who himself made over 200 appearances for the Reds in an eight-year spell, admitted that the timing of Sturridge's injury was disappointing, but that Balotelli can be the man to propel Liverpool up the league. 'The timing of Daniel Sturridge's latest muscle injury couldn't be worse for Liverpool with plenty of big games between now and the January transfer window,' Owen wrote on Sportlobster.com. Mario Balotelli is the man to revive Liverpool's season, according to Reds legend Michael Owen . Owen knows exactly what it feels like to lead the line for Liverpool, after a successful eight years at Anfield . 'The only obvious solution is for Brendan Rodgers to get the most out of Balotelli.

"Christian Horner believes the time was right for Sebastian Vettel to leave Red Bull. One of Formula One's worst-kept secrets finally came to light on Thursday when Ferrari confirmed Vettel would be joining them on a three-year contract as replacement for Fernando Alonso. It means this weekend's season-ending grand prix in Abu Dhabi is the last race for both men with their current employers. The Red Bull team delivered this message on the floor of their garage to thank Sebastian Vettel for his service . Vettel (left) is leaving Red Bull to join Ferrari and he will replace Fernando Alonso (right) Red Bull Racing Team Principal Christian Horner believes the time is right for Vettel to leave . For Vettel, after six years driving for Red Bull, and 14 years overall since he was taken on as a junior, team principal Horner feels the four-times champion's defection to one of their bitter rivals was on the cards. Horner, though, admits the 26-year-old German will still be missed as he said: 'Obviously we've had a wonderful relationship with Sebastian. 'He's been with the Red Bull family since he was 12 years of age, and he's grown through the junior programme, the junior categories. 'He was not much more than a boy when he arrived, and now he leaves us a young man, as a father. 'He had his opportunity in Formula One with Toro Rosso, winning a grand prix with them before coming to Red Bull Racing. 'Four world championships and 38 grand prix victories later I think we can look back with a huge amount of pride. We've grown together. Vettel has been driving for Red Bull for six years but will leave to join Ferrari at the end of the season . 26-year-old Vettel is a four-time world champion and has signed for Ferrari on a three-year deal . 'When he came to the team we were still a young team at the time, and together we've grown into a race-winning and championship-winning combination. 'But as in life all things move on and evolve, and obviously this opportunity has come up for Seb. 'He's felt it's the right time for him, and probably in reality it's the right time for the team too. 'Whilst we'll be very sorry to see him go and close his career with Red Bull on Sunday evening, we'll wish him the very best of luck. 'He'll be a good friend of the team for life, but as of the first of January he'll be a competitor. 'He can be incredibly proud of what he's achieved, he's been a tremendous ambassador for the sport and we'll certainly miss him.' Vettel's final race for Red Bull will come at the Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi on Sunday . Vettel, however, has struggled this season, failing to even win a race in a year dominated by Mercedes, albeit with team-mate Daniel Ricciardo standing on the top step of the podium on three occasions. The new regulations for this season, with the switch to the 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units, have not aided Vettel's cause. Ferrari team principal Marco Mattiacci, however, is convinced Vettel can help the Maranello marque win again. Ferrari principal Marco Mattiacci (right) believes Vettel will bring victories to the team when he arrives . Mattiacci said: 'With Sebastian we get one of the youngest world champions ever, four championships. 'I met him personally in the last few months and he is an extremely hard-working guy, humble, disciplined. 'I'm sure he will bring the phenomenal experience he went through at Red Bull, and the enthusiasm needed to go through certain difficult moments that are waiting for us. But sharing the overall project, which is to go back to the top.'","Sebastian Vettel announced Thursday he is leaving Red Bull for Ferrari .

"Rory Clegg booted 15 points as Newcastle claimed a 20-10 Aviva Premiership victory over Gloucester at a wet and windy Kingston Park. Clegg overcame a difficult start, when he gifted the visitors a try in the opening minute, to find the target with five penalties while Sinoti Sinoti crossed the whitewash for the Falcons. John Afoa scored Gloucester's try, which was converted by Bill Burns, but they struggled in the miserable conditions thereafter.

Clegg contributed to a dream Gloucester start when skipper Matt Kvesic charged down his attempted clearance kick after just 38 seconds and prop Afoa followed up to score, with Burns' conversion making it 7-0. There was a long delay early on when Charlie Sharples took a heavy blow to the head and fortunately he was able to walk off and was replaced by Tom Isaacs. Clegg clipped the post with a 45-metre penalty in the eighth minute but did find his range almost immediately afterwards when Gloucester went off their feet again. And when the visitors dropped the scrum in the 16th minute, he slotted in between the sticks again. Mike Blair's darting run drew yet another penalty for offside and Clegg edged the Falcons ahead 9-7 at half-time but Gloucester must have fancied their chances with the wind and rain at their backs in the second half.

And Newcastle then took a real grip on the game when Juan Pablo Socino cut through, Ally Hogg rumbled on and then Clegg and Alex Tait set up Sinoti for a try in the 45th minute . Burns was short with a 50-metre shot but gave Gloucester a boost with a 56th-minute penalty for offside to make it 17-10. But when former Falcons skipper James Hudson was sin-binned for an off the ball tackle, Clegg kicked his fifth penalty in the 63rd minute. Burns hit the post with a penalty shortly afterwards and then Gloucester declined two kickable penalties in there last six minutes to go for the corner. It proved the wrong option in the face of some determined Newcastle resistance.","John Afoa scored a Gloucester try after just one minute .

"Steven Smith struck a superb century as Australia fought back from the brink to beat South Africa by three wickets in Melbourne and in the process clinch the one-day international series 3-1. South Africa had looked well on course to set up a winner-takes-all decider in Sydney this weekend when, after making 267 for eight, they reduced Australia to 98 for five in the 25th over. However, Smith had other ideas and his 104 off 112 balls - his second ODI hundred - turned the match on its head and took Australia to within touching distance of victory. Australia's Steven Smith hit a second century of the series to complete a comeback victory . Australia players congratulate Pat Cummins after his single run secured a 3-1 ODI series win over S Africa . Australian batsmen James Faulkner (L) and Cummins celebrate the victory on home soil . Smith was unable to see the job through, bowled by Robin Peterson in the penultimate over with the scores level, but new batsman Pat Cummins got the single Australia needed to claim the match - and series - off the next ball, although not without more drama. South Africa thought they had claimed two wickets in two balls when David Miller appeared to take a stunning one-handed catch off Peterson to snare Cummins. But, after checking replays, it was confirmed the ball had not carried on the full and Cummins and James Faulkner were able to celebrate victory, with the pair having crossed. Faulkner's 34 not out off 19 balls was another significant reason for Australia's recovery, as was the 52 from Matthew Wade - the wicketkeeper putting on 121 for the sixth wicket with Smith. That came after South Africa's bowlers had ripped out half of Australia's side for less than 100 as the visitors looked certain to level up the series at 2-2. Smith (L) was bowled out in the penultimate over after hitting 104 runs from 112 balls for Australia . David Miller (L) is comforted by Hashim Amla after his catch off Cummins was ruled out to concede defeat . Earlier,  captain AB de Villiers had come close to a 20th ODI century to give South Africa a commanding lead . Earlier, it was another fine batting display from AB de Villiers that guided South Africa to a challenging total after winning the toss. The Proteas skipper made it to within nine runs of a 20th ODI ton when he was caught by Smith looking to hit a Cummins slower ball. Aside from De Villiers, Miller contributed 45 and Faf du Plessis 28, with South Africa's total ultimately proving just not enough thanks to Smith's determined century.","Australia defeated South Africa 3-1 in their one-day international series .

"Ben Flower has been found guilty of gross misconduct by his club Wigan after his attack on St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia during October's Super League Grand Final. The Warriors prop has escaped dismissal though, and has instead been fined 50 per cent of his wages for three months. The Super League club added that a 50 per cent wages fine for a further three months had been suspended, on the proviso that he could 'return....to his previous good (disciplinary) record'. Ben Flower (top) of Wigan attacked Lance Hohaia (lower) of St Helens in October's Super League Grand Final . Flower was sent off after twice punching Hohaia in the face during the domestic showpiece match at Old Trafford and was later banned by the Rugby Football League for six months. Flower's punishment from the RFL amounts to a 13-game ban, comprising two pre-season trials, Wigan's World Club Challenge meeting with Brisbane Broncos on February 21 and the first 10 games of the 2015 Super League season. It is the second heaviest ban of the Super League era. Terry Newton, the late former Great Britain hooker, was suspended for 10 matches for knocking out Lee Gilmour and breaking the cheekbone of Sean Long while playing for Wigan against St Helens in 2005 but the ban was extended to seven months when his appeal was rejected. Wigan have now concluded their own disciplinary process and said in a statement: 'Flower has been found guilty of gross misconduct due to violent conduct bringing into disrepute the Wigan club and the game of rugby league. 'In view of the player's previous record and his remorse, the Wigan club has decided that he be fined 50 per cent of his wages for a period of six months and must undergo a rehabilitation programme involving service with young people in the community during his banned period as he prepares to rebuild his career. Flower walks from the field after being shown a red card for the incident . 'Three months of the fine will be suspended and subject to return during the next 12 months to his previous good record. This judgement was decided appropriate rather than summary dismissal which was possible from a gross misconduct verdict.' Flower stunned the 70,000 crowd and millions watching on television when he landed a right hook on Hohaia while he was motionless on the ground just two minutes into the match. The Wales international had moments earlier reacted to an off-the-ball forearm strike from Hohaia by knocking him to the ground. Hohaia had earlier accepted a one-match ban after being charged with a grade B offence of striking which normally carries a suspension of one or two matches. Flower apologised for his actions the day after the final, saying: 'There is no defence for my actions. It was something that happened in the heat of the moment when our emotions and adrenaline were running high. I instantly regretted it and am devastated that I allowed myself to punch someone like this. Flower has been fined 50 per cent of his wages for three months by Wigan . 'At Wigan we are known for being aggressive but we are constantly told to do this within the rules of the game and that punching isn't tough. We may aim to dominate teams, but we don't aim to hurt people.' He added after being punished by his club: 'I fully accept this decision taken by Wigan. I deeply regret my actions and I am grateful for the support that my club has given me throughout this process. 'It is a relief to reach closure on the incident and I hope to move forward now and rebuild the trust of my club, team-mates and the Wigan fans.'","Ben Flower found guilty of gross misconduct by Wigan and has been fined .

"Sale Sharks recorded their first Aviva Premiership win at the Stoop since May 2008 as Danny Cipriani kicked his team to a 16-12 victory at Harlequins. The England hopeful knocked over 11 points while captain Dan Braid's late try proved the turning point in the game. Nick Evans contributed 12 points from the boot in a faultless kicking display for Quins, but the former New Zealand fly-half's efforts was not enough for the Londoners. Sale's Will Cliff (right) is put under pressure by Harlequins' Matt Cooper . Sale's inside centre Sam Tuitupou is challenged by Tom Casson (right) and Matt Hopper (left) Cliff breaks free and drives at the Harlequins' defence with the support of Sale backs . Harlequins, buoyed by their first league win at Kingsholm since 1999, made one change to the starting line-up which defeated Gloucester 22-15 last Friday with Tom Casson replacing George Lowe at inside centre. Danny Care, who was released back to Quins from England during the week, was named among the replacements. Sale boss Steve Diamond selected an unchanged squad for the trip to the Stoop after his side's impressive 36-8 victory over London Irish last weekend. The visitors have had minimal disruption to their playing squad during the autumn internationals with the exception of powerful centre Johnny Leota, who is on duty with Samoa for Saturday's Test against England. Cipriani gave the Sharks an early lead when he fired over a penalty in the second minute after scrum-half Will Cliff made a searing break through the Quins defence. Evans levelled matters up soon after when a powerful scrum from the home side forced a penalty. The Quins front row of Mark Lambert, Dave Ward and promising young tighthead Kyle Sinckler were enjoying a dominant night in the scrum and squeezed another penalty out of the Sharks pack in the 16th minute. Evans made no mistake from the tee to give his side a 6-3 lead. Harlequins' Nick Evans' four successful penalties was not enough to prevent defeat . Sharks' Magnus Lund (right) grapples with Harlequins' George Robson as tensions rise . Cliff makes a pass as the Sharks went on to record their first victory at the Stoop since 2008 . The first half was a tight affair with some bone-shuddering hits going in from both sides. Quins lock George Robson's hit on opposite number Michael Paterson drew gasps from the 13,051-strong crowd. Cipriani levelled the scores once more after a great spell of pressure from Sale, with Sam Tuitupou, Tom Arscott and Jonathan Mills making strong carries into the Quins defence. The Sharks pack recovered from their earlier scrum troubles and were awarded a penalty by referee Tom Foley just before half-time. Cipriani's long-range effort fell short, however, as both sides headed to the sheds with the scores locked at 6-6. Care entered the fray to a huge reception in the 51st minute after a turbulent week in which the Quins scrum-half was left out of England coach Stuart Lancaster's matchday 23 for the clash with the Samoans at Twickenham. Evans pushed Quins out to 9-6 when the Sharks pack were penalised for pulling down a rampant maul from the home forwards. The ding-dong battle continued though, as Luke Wallace was pinged for holding on and Cipriani duly stepped up to square matters again. Another powerful rolling maul afforded Evans the chance to give Quins the lead yet again and the Kiwi's three-pointer nudged his side into a 12-9 advantage. However, Sale made the breakthrough in the 69th minute when skipper Braid powered over from close range after replacement Andy Forsyth's break sparked the visitors into life. Cipriani tagged on the extras to put the Sharks 16-12 ahead. Quins then threw everything at Sale in the final 10 minutes but Diamond's troops held out for a hard-fought win.","Harlequins' fly-half Nick Evans penalties gave the home side the lead .

"Tony Bellew just cannot believe he is here. Not perched on the ring apron in a Rotherham gym, drenched in sweat with just a motorway hotel to look forward to after a 90-minute training session. But here he is, preparing to fight in front of a sell-out crowd at Liverpool’s Echo Arena in Saturday’s rematch with Nathan Cleverly at cruiserweight in one of the most eagerly-awaited bouts of the year. ‘I was never meant to get this far,’ says Bellew. ‘This wasn’t a life that I could have envisaged when I was younger. I was the fat kid who was going nowhere. I had teachers who told me I wasn’t going to do anything with my life. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's exclusive interview with Tony Bellew . Tony Bellew is focused on Saturday’s rematch with Nathan Cleverly at Liverpool’s Echo Arena . ‘Before I put an England vest on and boxed for my country, people said I had no chance of doing it. I was always doubted. ‘I remember my own mother saying, “Son, give up this boxing game. You’re not the kind of person who does it”. ‘When your own mother doesn’t think you should box, it doesn’t look good. No mother wants to see their son punched in the face but I’ve got a dad who loves me just as much and he always believed I would be world champion. Bellew has chance for revenge after Cleverly claimed a controversial majority points victory in 2011 . Cleverly retained his WBO light-heavyweight  title by beating Bellew three years ago . ‘I am driven. Nothing is ever enough. I could win £100million on the lottery and it wouldn’t be enough. If I make these next few fights work for me, it could be massive.’ Bellew, 31, feels boxing found him, rather than the other way around. Born and raised in Liverpool, he identified with Mike Tyson and Nigel Benn but dreamed of pulling on Everton’s No 9 shirt rather than lacing up the gloves. ‘I played around with boxing at 15 or 16,’ he says. ‘I didn’t take it seriously. I still had dreams of playing for Everton but I was too fat. Bellew says he loves boxing and identifies with the likes of Mike Tyson and Nigel Benn . ‘I was always fascinated with Mike Tyson and Nigel Benn, people who came from backgrounds like I did. ‘I’m from an unforgiving neighbourhood but it’s great. I grew up with loving people. I’ve got the same friends I had when I was 10. Some would say it’s a dump but to me, it’s a palace.’ By his late teens, Bellew was taking two buses across the city to reach the Rotunda gym where, by night, he was moulded into a three-time national amateur champion. By day, Bellew was finding his feet in the world of work. Bellew remains adamant he has the measure of Cleverly, who is almost five years his junior at 27 . ‘I’ve been a labourer, I’ve worked security, I’ve worked the door at nightclubs, been a lifeguard, worked in retail. I even worked in a pillow factory,’ he recalls. ‘Getting £150 a week to stuff pillows makes you appreciate the good things. ‘I worked from seven till four and then it was straight to the gym. I won my first title during the 12 months I was there and that made me realise how hard I had to work to go further.’ After fewer than 50 amateur fights, Bellew turned professional. Sixteen victories later he was thrust into a fight with then world champion Cleverly. Bellew and trainer Dave Coldwell work out in the gym in Rotherham . Bellew says his hatred for Cleverly stems from the Welshman telling him in the ring that it had been his toughest fight but later, in front of the press, claiming he had sailed through in second gear. Cleverly, 27, says Bellew is bitter and jealous of his success. ‘There is nothing in his career I could possibly want,’ counters Bellew. ‘I tried to win a world title at light-heavyweight and I fought the best in the division. If I die tomorrow, I’d die a happy man. Bellew turned up the heat on Cleverly by branding the Welshman 'a fraud' ‘We’re from completely different environments. I was working nightclub security when he was in school. He doesn’t love boxing because he doesn’t know anything about boxing. I probably know more about his career than he does. I’ve studied boxing since I was a kid. He boxes for a living, I do it because I love it. I’d do it for free. ‘He (Cleverly) has this thing about being world champion, but was he really? It was a joke that our fight was for a world title. He came up against me after 16 fights; I’m a completely different fighter now. ‘The one thing we do have in common is that we come to fight but I just have more evil intentions, I’m a different breed.’ Throughout his career, Bellew has made almost as many headlines out of the ring as in it. Last year, his claim that he was ‘willing to die in the ring’ sparked outrage. He is unrepentant. ‘It’s like saying you know the risks when you get on a plane,’ he says. ‘There’s a 99 per cent chance it won’t happen but it could. Getting in the ring is 100 times as bad. I’m not saying I want to die. I’m saying I’d rather die than quit. ‘That’s why I’m different. It would kill me to quit. I don’t glorify it, it’s the horrible side of boxing. Leaving my kids is what frightens me more than anything but it’s the only way I can provide a living for them. Bellew is ready to fight in front of a sell-out crowd at Liverpool’s Echo Arena on Saturday . ‘I’ve come out of fights and (been) p****** blood...my face black and blue and both hands broken. ‘I’ve been in brutal fights. I’ve dragged myself off the floor. I can say I’m willing to die in the ring because that’s what I’m about. ‘I’m too honest for my own good. I’m just telling them what I think. Sometimes that is bad, sometimes it’s good. Sometimes I let people in too much but that’s just me. ‘Do I want to kill anyone? Of course not. It’s a brutal sport but I don’t get paid to kill anyone.

"Wayne Rooney is now only three short of Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record after his double in England's 3-1 victory over Scotland on Tuesday night. Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher says he is an England ‘great’, but former Liverpool and Scotland captain Graeme Souness claims his two-goal salvo was only ‘against Championship players, so don’t get carried away’. So, is a Rooney ‘a great’ - and what constitutes a ‘great’ England player? We asked our team of reporters for their verdict. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wayne Rooney's debuts for U17s and senior team . Wayne Rooney celebrates his second strike in England's 3-1 victory against Scotland on Tuesday night . Rooney's two-goal salvo against Scotland has taken him to within three of Sir Bobby Charlton's record . LEE CLAYTON, HEAD OF SPORT . Yes he is! These days we live in a world where everyone likes to take a sledgehammer to anything positive and everyone has a platform to be nasty. If Twitter was around in the 1960s, Bobby Charlton would be ‘too slow’, Jimmy Greaves wouldn’t be able to play as a lone striker in a 4-5-1, Bobby Moore wouldn’t be strong enough in the air… . Rooney is the greatest England player of his generation and has been let down by poor team-mates. He’s scored 46 goals, we will miss him when he is gone. Kevin Keegan was the best England player I saw in the flesh. He was a ‘great’, a double European Footballer of the Year - and Rooney is as good as Keegan (and has scored a lot more goals). Rooney scores England's third goal of a pulsating encounter at Celtic Park on Tuesday evening . The Manchester United ace must now be considered an England great, according to Head of Sport Lee Clayton . MATT LAWTON . Rooney is the best English player of a generation and has won numerous honours with Manchester United, but as an England player will he stand shoulder to shoulder with Bobby Charlton and Gary Lineker when he overtakes them in the goalscoring charts? For me, I'm afraid it's a no at the moment. IAN LADYMAN . I’m an enduring fan of Rooney and he has played a central role in achieving great things during his 10 years at Old Trafford. Sadly, he has never really had the platform to do the same with England and – largely because of injury – has never really been able to make a consistent impact at major tournaments. For me, great England players are those who have given me great England memories. Rooney hasn’t given me enough of these, so he falls short I am afraid. Gary Lineker celebrates scoring one of his two penalties against Cameroon at the 1990 World Cup . Rooney lit up Euro 2004, pictured scoring against Croatia before being mobbed by his England team-mates . DOMINIC KING . Let's use Sir Bobby Charlton as the barometer for greatness. He was in four World Cup squads, has more than 100 caps and 49 England goals. Rooney has been to three World Cups, has more than 100 caps and now has 46 goals. He will become the country's leading scorer, he could play in a fourth World Cup and his place in the squad is beyond doubt at the moment, so he will go on winning caps. We can become too dewy-eyed looking back at former players in comparison with what those of the present are achieving. Rooney might not have become the player everyone expected when he was 18 but he has still been outstanding. He ticks all the boxes needed to be classed as an England great. Rooney is presented with his golden cap by Sir Bobby Charlton ahead of his 100th game for England . Chartlon, in action for England in 1970, holds the England goalscoring record with 49 strikes for his country . JAMIE CARRAGHER: He will become the greatest goalscorer for England, there is no doubt about that. He’ll possibly beat the caps record as well. All week we have been saying, 'Is he an England great?' 'Where does he rank?' Of course he is an England great, he is going to be our greatest goalscorer. Is he a world great? Is he Messi, Ronaldo? No, he’s not, but over these last 12-18 months there have been questions asked about Wayne Rooney. You go back to the World Cup and people didn’t even want him in the team. Absolute nonsense. He should always be in the England team. GRAEME SOUNESS: I would not get carried away with Rooney. He is just scoring goals against Championship players tonight. I agree with your first part where you say Rooney has been a great player for England, but what adjective do you use to describe Rooney if you are using ‘great'? Messi and Ronaldo are on different planets. Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness were speaking on Sky Sports . ROB DRAPER . Jamie Carragher nailed it: of course he is an England 'great'. But is he one of the 'great' players of this generation? No. It's a tough era in which to shine, what with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo but Luis Suarez, Neymar, Sergio Aguero, Zlatan Ibrahimovic are also better in his position. And that's before you start adding in great defenders and midfielders. But he is a very good player, world class and the dominant force for England. We should be grateful to have him. MATT BARLOW . Yes he is an England great. I don't think that can be debated. Youngest goalscorer, 101 caps and only serious injury can stop him passing Sir Bobby Charlton's long standing 49-goal record. Levels of greatness? Well, he has not conquered the world. He will not go down as a world great with Pele, Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Zinedine Zidane et al. There's no shame in that. He has not won anything with England but only one team ever has, nearly 50 years ago. In the modern world of intense professional scrutiny, you might question if his lifestyle prevented him from maximising his full potential but he has been the best of his generation by some distance. Rooney celebrates with a cartwheel after scoring his 46th goal for England against Scotland on Tuesday . SAMI MOKBEL . Is Wayne Rooney an England great? I can't believe we are even having this debate. Of course he is. Just look at his goal record; 46 in 101 caps. What else does he have to do? That's almost one in two for England - that goal ratio is excellent in anyone's book. His failure, so far, to produce for England in a major tournament since Euro 2004 is perhaps the main reason why the jury's still out for some people. But, for me, there's no argument. CRAIG HOPE . The fact we’re having this debate – given his brilliant caps and goals record – proves there is something which just doesn’t sit right with Rooney. For me, the source of this unease is his failure to develop himself into the world ‘great’ we all thought he would be – we’re talking Ronaldo and Messi territory. And that, too, seems a source of frustration for the player - he is, after all, the perennial angry man. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi ahead of Portugal's game against Argentina at Old Trafford on Tuesday . In an England shirt his record at major tournaments – barring Euro 2004 – is well documented and there has been no real magic memory in the best part of a decade for his country. And look at his goals record – he has scored four times against what you would call the very best international teams (Brazil twice, Argentina and Holland) but they were all in friendlies. Sadly, I just can’t have him as an England great. MARTHA KELNER . Rooney is a great player, a great servant to Manchester United and increasingly a great figure in the game. He has approached the possibility of breaking Sir Bobby Charlton's record with real class. But he is not an England great because - often for reasons beyond his control - he has not delivered consistently at major tournaments. Maybe, as Roy Hodgson believes, we have not seen the best of Rooney yet and he might go on to legitimately become an England great. But he's not there yet. Rooney has scored once in three World Cup tournaments - he's pictured here celebrating against Uruguay . SAM CUNNINGHAM . Rooney will undoubtedly go on to become England's top scorer, but so far only six of those have come at major tournaments – five in European Championships and a meagre one at a World Cup. Scroll through his list of England goals and I can pick out just five that have been scored against what would be considered the real big guns – one versus Argentina, Holland and two against Brazil, all in friendlies, and one against Uruguay at this summer's World Cup. His trophy cabinet is crammed full of club silverware, but at present he is an exceptional player who is far from the realms of greatness. JOE BERNSTEIN . I wouldn't put him anywhere near an all-time England XI. He can't compare with Geoff Hurst (hat-trick in a World Cup final), Gary Lineker (World Cup golden boot), Alan Shearer (leading scorer at Euro 96) or even had a similar impact to Jimmy Greaves or Michael Owen. So in that respect he's not really a great. His longevity is impressive, a lot of players who start young burn out. But he's got to do it in a big match to cement his place among the pantheons; a free-kick against Estonia, penalty against Slovenia and a couple of goals in a friendly against Scotland don't really cut it when you think of Owen sprinting past Argentina defenders to score a World Cup classic in a match that mattered.

"With battery life consistently voted as the most important feature when upgrading a phone, handsets, chip makers and networks are working on ways to squeeze as much energy out of them as possible. And now Nokia Networks believes it has made a significant breakthrough – boosting battery life by up to 49 per cent. The Finnish-based firm saw the results during its first live trial of a software known as High Speed Cell FACH on a 3G network. Nokia Networks has completed its first live testing of High Speed Cell FACH technology. When using apps, phones send and receive small amounts of data, and Nokia's technology is designed to handle these so-called 'data packets' more efficiently. This increases browsing speeds, power savings and response times . When running applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as browsing the web, sending emails and using services such as FaceTime, phones often send and receive small amounts of data, known as packets, of just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes. High Speed Cell FACH is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software. The software is designed to help operators handle data sent over 3G networks. When running applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as browsing the web, sending emails and using services such as FaceTime, phones often send and receive small amounts of data. These are known as packets, and are typically just a few hundreds of bytes or a few kbytes. High Speed Cell FACH is designed to handle these small data packets more efficiently than other software. This makes apps run faster, and also means they use less energy over the course of a day, for example. The technology also means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services, and support a higher number of phones on their networks. More technical details can be found on Nokia's original white paper. This makes apps run faster, and also means they use less energy over the course of a day, for example. The technology additionally means operators can boost the speed and quality of their services, and support a higher number of phones on their networks. According to the recent Nokia tests, the 3G software boosts speeds and network response times by up to 65 per cent, and leads to up to 20 per cent faster browsing. Users also saw power savings of up to 49 per cent, which meant their battery life lasted almost twice as long - depending on which applications were being used. The lowest power saving was nine per cent. The tests were run on the commercial 3G/HSPA network of a major European operator - although Nokia did not reveal which operator it was. Testers also used devices fitted with Qualcomm Snapdragon processors that already support High Speed Cell FACH. MailOnline has contacted both companies for more specific information. ‘Smartphones already outsell feature phones and by 2018, smartphone penetration in some developed markets is expected to exceed 90 per cent,’ said Thorsten Robrecht, vice president, mobile broadband portfolio management at Nokia Networks. The tests were run on a commercial 3G/HSPA network using devices fitted with Qualcomm Snapdragon processors. Results revealed 50% power savings, when certain apps were used, 65% faster response times, and 21% faster browsing. Ping relates to networks sending signals to a web-enabled device . ‘With virtually all these smartphones being 3G-enabled, it's important to be able to improve network efficiency.’ High Speed Cell FACH is a capability that Qualcomm Technologies already supports on its latest Snapdragon processors. These processors are seen in high-end, flagship phones including the Nexus 6, Samsung Galaxy Note Edge and Note 4, and Amazon Fire HDX 8.9 (2014). Nokia said the live network tests ‘produced substantial performance gains that exceeded Qualcomm's expectations’, including beating previous laboratory test results. But it is not known when it will be widely available to networks and customers.","Nokia Networks' software boosts battery life by up to 40 per cent .

"Some scientists think that robots  such as Pepper (pictured) could become our friends and relieve loneliness because they can read human emotions . Robots may often be depicted as lowly mechanical servants in sci-fi films, but experts believe they could become our friends and even provide enjoyable company. Japanese scientists are trying to create eerily human-like machines with a ‘presence’, while others think that looks don't matter. The race is on to build bots that can adeptly read human emotions and respond appropriately - with an 'affordable' plastic robotic companion launching in February. Pepper is about to enter homes and act a useful companion. It has flashing lights and wheels, but asks humans questions about their feelings, such as whether they are stressed, to act like a concerned friend. Launched by Japan’s biggest phone mobile carrier, softbank, it is intended to be a member of the family and the first ‘affordable’ humanoid, costing 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900) when it goes on sale in February. The humanoid is designed to read nonverbal social cues by scanning human faces and listening for strain in voices. This data is run through an algorithm to calculate a person’s mental state and it learns to please them. By spending time with a human and learning what they like, the robot can make someone feel as if they are accepted and understood, its makers claim, even if the machine doesn't resemble a human. Many scientists are exploring whether robots could help look after isolated people. The potential is great for intelligent machines as the number of elderly requiring care is expected to soar in rapidly-aging Japan in coming years and companion bots, such as Sony's Aibo pet dog have already been accepted in homes. Hiroshi Ishiguro, a renowned robot designer at Osaka University in western Japan has created Geminoid F – a realistic life-size female robot, which costs $110,000 (pictured). He thinks that robots with a human-like presence could relieve loneliness because humans will be able to build relationships with them . Robotics are already used to check on the elderly and monitor their health and safety, but they might also play a role in reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation. Recently, scientists have been creating increasingly sociable machines that interact in a more human way. They argue that these sociable droids make it easier for humans to work with machines and that a mechanical companion could improve a human’s quality of life. Hitoshi Matsubara, a roboticist at the Future University Hakodate, concedes that human company is preferable to a robot, but a robotic companion could be helpful and easy. ‘We understand robots are machines. But we can create harmony between the two, robot and human, he told PopSci. His view is shared by others such as Minoru Asada, a professor of Adaptive Machine Systems at Osaka University, who has created a baby-faced robot called Affetto. He is interested in how people use nonverbal forms of communication to form a relationship with each other and thinks that understanding it more would lead to more 'natural' human-robot relations. Mobile carrier, Softbank, said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900).  Softbank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is shown interacting with the robot, which is designed to read human emotion by scanning people's faces and analysing their voices . The prospect of robot overlords, friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years. But according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, emotional machines will never exist. This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, one expert claims. A mathematical framework for consciousness, developed over the last decade by Giulio Tononi at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shows that computers cannot handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly. This means. if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information, computers can’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans. Professor Asada has developed a new brain-scanning technique that lets him track the emotional bonds that form between a mother and child in real-time. It involves placing both participants in a machine and showing them each other’s facial expressions on a computer screen. He hopes to learn whether the pair’s brainwaves become synchronised. ‘These kinds of findings will be very helpful for us in designing a robot that can synchronise or create artificial empathy,’ he said, explaining that such information could help a robot decide which actions to copy and how it should react. If this happens, these robots may make excellent teachers or companions that can effectively show empathy. Hiroshi Ishiguro, a renowned robot designer at Osaka University in western Japan places emphasis on looks - as well as a humanoid's intelligence. He has created Geminoid F – a realistic life-size female robot, which cost $110,000 (£68,671) to make. She wears human clothes, has realistic-looking hair and eyelashes and moves as naturally as technology currently allows. Dr Ishiguro is known for his detailed creations and is fascinated by ‘the uncanny valley,’ which is the sense of dread caused by a robot that comes close to human likeness but fails to fully achieve it, perhaps through jerky movement, or lack of eye contact. He believes it is a matter of time before the problem is eliminated, with the help of better actuators to make movements smoother, for example. He said: ‘My goal is not just to create a humanoid but to understand the feeling of a presence. What is that? I want to understand what is a human, and what is a human likeness.’ Tokyo-based mobile carrier Softbank has unveiled Pepper the robot, which can read human emotions. Pepper uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to study gestures, expressions and human speech tones. The robot is designed to be a friend to humans. The 48 inch (121 cm) (48 inch) tall, 62lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. The machine has gesticulating hands, but cannot be said to be realistic. Besides featuring the latest voice recognition, Pepper is loaded with more than a dozen sensors, including two touch sensors in its hands, three touch sensors on its head, and six laser sensors and three bumper sensors in its base. It also has two cameras and four microphones on its head and has Wi-Fi and ethernet networking capabilities. The robot can even dance and tell jokes. It will go on sale in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). Academics have partnered with Google in a bid to bring human-like robots closer to reality. Google developed a system, that helps computers distinguish between individual objects (pictured) and aims to improve visual recognition systems using deep learning, as well as help machines understand humans more easily . Google has teamed up with Oxford University's artificial intelligence (AI) teams to help machines better understand users, and improve visual recognition systems using deep learning. This partnership follows reports Google is also developing superfast ‘quantum’ chips modelled on the human brain, to make searches and software more intuitive. Google DeepMind will be working with two of Oxford’s AI research teams - one to help machines better understand what humans are saying to them and another to improve image recognition systems. And he thinks when this presence, or sonzai-kan is created, they can be used to relieve loneliness and become our friends. Dr Ishiguro believes that such robots could be used as a medium through which distant friends and family could communicate, or even as an extension of the self. At the other end of the scale, Matthias Scheutz, of Tufts University Human-Robot Interaction Laboratory in Massachusetts, says human resemblance is unimportant in robots and people can develop feelings about their cars and vacuum cleaner, for example. Experts say they have seen cases where people want to give their robotic hoover a break from work, or ask for repairs to bomb disposal bots that have saved their lives, because they feel emotionally attached to them. While this might make robots natural companions for some people, Sherry Turkle, director of MIT’s Initiative on Technology and the Self, warns that they merely provide an illusion of a relationship, which could lead to some vulnerable people becoming more depressed or isolated, due to failed interactions.","Japanese expert is trying to create  human-like machines with a ‘presence’

"Speeding driver: Shiad Mahmoon, 24, was clocked doing an average speed of up to 165mph . A driver sentenced to a three-year ban after speeding at 165mph told a court: ‘I’m still going to drive – catch me if you can.’ Shiad Mahmoon, 24, was hurtling down a motorway in a high-performance rented Audi R8 Spyder when he was caught. A police helicopter spotted the car racing down the middle lane at 5am and followed it as it veered off at a junction and on to another motorway. Officers filmed the car from above and worked out Mahmoon was travelling at an average speed of between 144mph and 165mph – though police believe he could have been travelling faster at one point. A patrol car was radioed and a chase culminated with Mahmoon pulling over on the M62 near a service station. It is believed 165mph is the second-highest speed ever recorded by police in the UK. Appearing before magistrates in Liverpool, Mahmoon pleaded guilty to driving at excess speed on the motorway. Defending himself, he claimed he had no recollection of the early morning incident because he had suffered a brain injury which affected his memory. The court heard Mahmoon, of Oldham, had previous convictions for driving while disqualified and driving without due care and attention. He was also previously found guilty of possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Magistrate Christina Clarke told him: ‘We recognise the serious risk of danger you put yourself and other road users in and we are informed that this is the highest recorded speed by Merseyside Police.’ Magistrates banned Mahmoon from driving for three years and ordered him to take a driving test before he is allowed back on the road. He was also told to pay fines and costs of £515. When asked if he could pay the full amount immediately, he put his hand in his pocket and replied sarcastically: ‘I’m about £10 short.’ Watch the chase below... Clocked: Shiad Mahmoon is filmed by a police helicopter speeding on the M57 in Merseyside . Clocked: The helicopter spotted the car hurtling down the M57 towards the junction with the M62 at around 5am on June 26, 2011 . Unemployed Mahmoon shrugged off the road ban as he stepped down from the dock, saying: ‘I’m still going to drive – catch me if  you can.’ Last night anti-crime campaigners slammed magistrates for failing to punish the driver for contempt of court for the comment. Ellen Booth, of charity Brake, said: Driving at 165mph down a motorway is incredibly dangerous and potentially deadly at any time of the day or night. A driver travelling at that speed cannot pre-empt what hazards may be just around the corner and it is a very irresponsible act.’ ‘His boast about continuing to drive is shocking and shows the contempt he has for the law and police need to ensure this is followed up on so he is not allowed to wilfully flout his driving ban.’ A spokesman for Families Against Crime . said: ‘He should have been hauled over the coals for a comment like that . and charged with contempt of court. Overtake: The driver is seen going past two cars as he speed in his hire car in the early hours of the morning . Stopped: The driver eventually pulled over after a high-speed police pursuit, Liverpool Magistrates' Court was told . ‘The driver is a disgrace and I only hope he doesn’t get behind the wheel of a car again because he is a bomb waiting to go off.’ The incident happened in Merseyside in June 2011 when Mahmoon was spotted speeding in the lease car on the M57. Sergeant Mike Clarey, who later pulled him over on the M62, said: ‘Travelling at such a high speed put Mahmoon in danger and also could have put other drivers in danger. Mahmoon showed a blatant disregard for the law even after he was sentenced. ‘Our message to anyone who flouts the law to such a degree is that we will use all the technology we have available to bring you to justice.’ In 2007 Timothy Brady, 33, of  Harrow, was jailed for ten weeks after pleading guilty at Oxford Crown Court to speeding at 172mph in a Porsche 911 Turbo in a 70mph zone on the A420. Supercar: Mahmoon, 24, was speeding in a hired Audi R8 Spyder . The driver was caught doing one of the highest speeds ever recorded on Britain's road. An average speed of between 144mph and 165mph raises the possibility that he was going even faster for a short distance. Daniel . Nicks, then 34, became Britain's fastest ever driver when he was caught . doing 175mph on a Honda Fireblade motorbike in Hertfordshire in 2000. And Porsche 911 driver Timothy Brady, 33, was clocked doing 172mph on an A-road in Oxfordshire in January 2007.

Pacquiao flexes his muscles ahead of the world title fight in his homeland on Sunday . But even then, he was still two ounces over and was given two hours to remove that slight surplus. There was little doubt that he would make the weight, but it was a strange lapse for a man who holds the world light-welterweight title, and asked questions of his allegedly rigorous training regime. Pacquiao, ever the ultimate professional, was half a pound inside the limit. Several hundred fans had queued from five in the morning to see the weigh-in at the Cotai Arena at 8 am Saturday morning Macau time. Many were from among the more than 5,000 Filipinons who have made the 90 minute trip by plane to support Pacquiao. Algieri returned to the scales after a 50-minute interval and had trimmed down to two ounces lighter than Pacquiao at 10st 3lb 6oz. When asked if Algieri had trained properly, Pacquiao’s fabled trainer Freddie Roach replied: ‘No.’ Pacquiao trains ahead of the fight at the Cotai Arena Gym of the Venetian Resort and Casino .

Algieri blamed his problem on the scales, sayng: 'I had my usual breakfast of oats and eggs over medium and was under the limit on these same scales at a try-out before the official weigh-in. 'Somethng must have happened to them as they were moved to the arena.' Roach was unimpressed, saying: 'So Manny came in exactly as we planned and told you, at half a pound under. But the scales were off for Algieri?' He added, with irony: 'And this is they guy who has a master degree in nutrition as part of his medical studies?'

"His last stunt saw him perform a tightrope walk across the French Alps. But French thrill-seeker Tancrede Melet has now carried out an even more daring feat. The 31-year-old adrenaline junkie has filmed himself leaping off a 3,400 meter-high peak in the Mont Blanc massif mountain range wearing a wing suit. Filmed on a GoPro camera attached to a helmet, the incredible footage shows Mr Melet standing on a tiny platform at the top of the Aiguille de la Republique - the Needle of the Republique -11,200ft high in the air before bracing himself for the jump. The Frenchman spent eight hours climbing the peak before making the journey down in around a mere three minutes. After scaling the Aiguille de la Republique, a location that has never previously been jumped from before, the extreme athlete is then seen soaring through the air at speeds of up top to 100mph. Kitted out with a state-of-the-art, made-to-measure wing suit, Mr Melet has made over 200 previous jumps. He performed his latest jump in September this year. He said: ‘I was definitely scared, it was the first time somebody had jumped from this place and I climbed the needle entirely on my own. ‘Before I jump I try to clear my mind, take deep breaths and concentrate. Tancrede Melet begins his ascent up the Aiguille de la Republique - the Needles of the Republique in the Apls . The Frenchman spent eight hours climbing the3,400 meter-high peak in the Mont Blanc massif mountain range . The footage shows Mr Melet standing on a tiny platform at the top of the Aiguille de la Republique, 11,200ft high in the air, before bracing himself for the jump . ‘When you jump you feel as if you are flying, it is like being in a fast aircraft but it is your body that is travelling, you can feel the speed on your face. ‘The Mont Blanc mountain range is stunning, it is a crazy landscape. ‘I was not planning to fly all the way down to Chamonix but the more I flew, the closer is got, I couldn't believe I had made it so far down. ‘With that particular jump you have a glide ratio of 2.5 which means if you have 1000 metres of verticality, you fly 2,500 metres across the air. The extreme athlete is then seen soaring through the air at speeds of up top to 100mph . Kitted out with a state-of-the-art, made-to-measure wing suit, Mr Melet has made over 200 previous jumps . It took Mr Melet three minutes to make the journey down from the top the Needles of the Republique. It is the first time that anyone has jumped off the top of the peak . Mr Melet opens his parachute as he prepares to land following his spectacular stunt in September this year . ‘There is a feeling of relief when you land but also of joy and happiness, when you realise it took about three minutes to fly down when it takes eight hours by feet, it is an extraordinary feeling.’ It was in June this year that Mr Melet was seen attempting the first-ever tightrope walk  - or highline walk -across a crevasse in Chamonix's famous Vallée Blanche. A highline is a type of tightrope walk which is done on a slack line strung between two points. The stunt was filmed as part of a series of videos for Nivea Men, who recruited Mr Melet to help promote their sensitive skin care range. During filming above the Geant glacier, he is seen losing his balance and slipping, before managing to catch hold of the wire and dangle above the crevasse. He is then shown turning himself upside down and hanging by his feet until he regains his composure. In December 2013 he performed another walk 1,200ft above the Alps. He was shown walking across a two-inch wide wire suspended between two cable cars in front of Mount Blanc. The heartstopping walk across the 196ft gap was carried out to mark the tenth anniversary of the Paradaski ski area. The record of the longest highline walk is held by Jerry Misewski who completed a 704ft walk in America this October. Mr Melet has also created a documentary called I Believe I Can Fly which details his amazing exploits on tightropes – or highlines - across the world.","Tancrede Melet, 31, is the first person to jump off the spectacular peak .

"They are the must-see landmarks in cities across the world. So the likes of the Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building and Big Ben have to look good all year round - and the clean-up mission for each of these huge structures is on a massive scale. At 1,000ft high, The Shard in London boasts 11,000 glass panels, which take four weeks to clean - and costs £130,000 each year, according to a new infographic. The mammoth task of cleaning the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France, requires 105 gallons of metal cleaning solution . In the US, the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC gets blasted with a power washer twice a year, while Paris's Eiffel Tower gets a bath once a year - requiring 105 gallons of metal cleaning solution, four tonnes of wipes and 25,000 bin bags. Compiled by hassle.com, the graph - entitled The World's Biggest Clean-Ups - also reveals how cleaners hang from harnesses to clean the 1,450ft-high Empire State Building in New York, and how the 312 pieces of opal glass on Big Ben's four clocks in London get a rinse every five years. The Taj Mahal in India gets a mud wash every seven years; The Gherkin in London takes 10 days to clean; 40 different cleaning methods were tested on the Acropolis in Athens, Greece, before finding the best one; and 90C water is used to blast 50 years of dirt and bird droppings from the Space Needle in Seattle. And then spare a thought for the cleaning teams who have to  tidy after the famous La Tomatina 'tomato-pelting' festival in Valencia or the UK's legendary Glastonbury Festival. Music festivals are enjoyed by thousands who get a chance to let their hair down - and their rubbish. After the 2014 Glastonbury Festival a team of 800 litter-pickers were used across the 1,200-acre site - and it took six weeks to clean. And it's a similar story for V Festival where 90,000 music lovers drop 150 tonnes of litter. Despite recycling bags being handed out, the clean up is an enormous task. Over the water, the Uranium mine clean-up in Navajo, New Mexico, US, is a shuddering challenge. Two piles radioactive dirt remain after the kine has served its purpose, and estimates are that it will cost £50m to clean and take 100 years.","The Coloseum in Rome is cleaned using just toothbrushes and water .

"Royal method: Catherine Duchess Of Cambridge is reportedly considering hypnosis as a way of managing the pain of child birth without additional anesthetics . The Duchess of Cambridge is reportedly considering hypnosis to deal with the pain of childbirth. The ‘hypno-birth’ would mean that her labour pains are lessened without using drugs, according to Grazia magazine. Advocates of the technique say that it . helps women use their mind to seize control of the birthing process and . learn techniques that allow the production of oxytocin, a pain . relieving hormone which stimulates the uterus. Women undergoing a hypno-birth may . still use pain relief - such as an epidural, a pain-killing injection, . many women find that they don’t need any additional anaesthesia. Grazia quoted a source who said: ‘Kate . has researched various birthing methods. 'She wants it to be naturalso . hypno-birthing is one option that appealed and she ahd been reading up . on it and listening to CDs to get into the right frame of mind. 'Some of . her friends have used this method and swear by it. kate wants to do it . her way and be relaxed.’ A royal spokeswoman said she was aware of the report, but declined to confirm or deny it. ‘We appreciate it’s a happy occasion...but there are some matters which should remain private to the duchess.’ If the story is true, Kate’s tendency to set trends could lead many other women to follow her example. It is understood that the Duchess is . due to give birth in the private Lindo wing at St Mary’s Hospital in . Paddington, where Prince William was born. The Duchess is believed to be taking . prenatal yoga classes which focus on strengthening and increasing the . flexibility of the muscles used during childbirth. She is also said to be keeping her fitness up with regular swimming sessions at Buckingham Palace. The Blissful Birth website which deal . with hypno-birthing  said in a blog that a number of hypno-birthing . practitioners had ‘spun’ the news ‘into a suggestion that the Duchess is . considering their particular approach.’ Bump-in-waiting: The Duchess, pictured last week shopping in London's Chelsea, is said to have been inspired to go for a hypno-birth by her friends who have used the method . But it added: ‘Regardless of the . ultimate decision on natural birth techniques, I am grateful to the . Duchess for her willingness to explore options for a natural birth – . especially as it was Queen Victoria who led the way for women to use . drugs in labour. Hypno-birthing encourages the father . to become directly involved in the birth, something which is not . exactly  a traditional role for a royal father. The Hypnobirth Association says that the father acts as an ‘anchor’ throughout the birth. Speaking on the website, Katherine Graves, a specialist, says the word ‘hypno’ actually does the technique a disservice. She adds: ‘Hypnobirthing helps you . release the fears and gives you the tool so that your body can give . birth efficiently and comfortably in the way it is designed to do.’ ‘To have serious consideration from a . well-educated, intelligent and progressive couple like William and Kat . shows how far towards mainstream our profession has come over the last . decade.’","Kate believed to be considering a 'hypno birth' for royal baby .

"For most skiers, it is hard enough to try and complete a jump, but this professional managed to pull-off the ultimate stunt... and captured it on film. Nineteen-year-old Norwegian skier Johan Berg showed off serious skills in a recent Instagram video, by high-fiving a fellow skier while completing a jump. In the footage, Berg, a free-skier who works with brands Völkl and O'Neill, launches himself upside down to give an epic high-five to his friend and Sochi Olympian, Aleks Aurdal. 19-year-old Norwegian free-skier, Johan Berg, performed an epic high-five stunt to record for Instagram .

An Oslo native, Berg first began his career at the age of 11. In 2010 and 2011, he went on to claim the title of Norwegian Champion, and since, has competed on an international level. The 'proper high-five' as Berg refers to it on Instagram was filmed at the Stubai Glacier Prime Park Sessions in Austria, though he's known to frequent the tiny ski village of Vierli when he has the time. Recently, it seems that Berg and Aurdal have been recording a series of stunt videos, along with the hashtag #AleksVsJohan, where they show off their adventurous tricks.","19-year-old Norwegian skier Johan Berg high-fived his friend while mid-air .

"More than Raheem Sterling’s form, Daniel Sturridge’s fitness or the future of Steven Gerrard, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will ultimately be judged on the nine players he signed last summer at a cost of £117 million. The early signs are not good. As they return to Crystal Palace, the scene of Luis Suarez’s tears when the title was conceded in May, only full back Alberto Moreno could be labelled a success. Others like Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Dejan Lovren — total spend £65m — have fallen far short of expectations. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Enjoy Emre Can's best flicks, tricks and goals . Reds boss Brendan Rodgers will be disappointed with Liverpool's slow start to the season . Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert are yet to score a Premier League goal since joining Liverpool . Adam Lallana English, 26, M, £25m . Verdict: Jury out. Way off his Southampton form. Only six Premier League appearances, average less than 70 minutes each. Dejan Lovren Croat, 25, D, £20m . Verdict: Hit. Played every minute of every top-flight game but can’t defend alone. Lazar Markovic Serb, 20, M, £20m . Verdict: Miss. Failed to adapt to the English game so far, isn’t playing regularly and low on confidence. Mario Balotelli Italian, 24, F, £16m . Verdict: Miss. Has not lived up to his truculent reputation and has yet to score in the PL so far this season. Alberto Moreno Spanish, 22, D, £12m . Verdict: Decent. Has played full 90 minutes in nine of 11 Premier League games. Settling in well. Emre Can German, 20, M, £10m . Verdict: Middling. A spectacular goal against Chelsea showed his talent. Rickie Lambert English, 32, F, £4m . Verdict: Miss. No goals and averaging 19 minutes over nine PL games. Bit-part player. Javier Manquillo (Spanish, 20, D, loan Verdict: Settling) & Divock Origi (Belgian, 19, F, £10m) Manquillo taking time to adapt to a much-rotated squad. Origi on loan at Lille. It was not meant to be like this. Rodgers was aware of the dangers of replacing superstar Suarez with an assortment of inferior players because he had seen how Tottenham squandered their Gareth Bale revenue 12 months earlier after he was sold to Real Madrid for a world record fee in excess of £85m. Yet so far, Rodgers seems to have fallen into the same trap. Balotelli and Lambert have failed to score a Premier League goal, while Lovren has looked shaky at the back. Emre Can, a £10m buy from Bayer Leverkusen, strained a calf muscle on his debut in a pre-season friendly at Preston and then suffered an ankle injury on duty for the German Under-21s which kept him out for several weeks. It was not until his goal against Chelsea that Liverpool fans caught a glimpse of why Rodgers went for the midfielder, whose gifts are technical rather than athletic. Can, a German of Turkish family origin, acknowledges that the new recruits have taken time to settle. And he knows it is time for them to show their potential and lift Liverpool from a mid-table position towards a top-four spot. ‘We’ve had a lot of players coming in and it will take a little bit of time to adapt, but I am certain there will be better results,’ he said, speaking on a visit to the Liverpool Academy where he and other first-team players met and talked to the next generation of Anfield stars. ‘I struggled in the beginning because I was injured in my first game and couldn’t get back to 100 per cent fitness. I haven’t played many games yet, but the season is long so there is time for people to improve and come in and show what they have been bought for. ‘I see every day in training that we have a great team working together really well. We have been unlucky at certain points, but we know it’s about time that we got results, and I’m confident we can do that.’ Emre Can has been hampered by injuries since sealing a summer move from Bayer Leverkusen . Having sold Suarez to Barcelona, for £75m, Rodgers could have done without Sturridge suffering a series of injuries which will keep him out at least until the New Year. Three players — Jordan Henderson, Sterling and Gerrard — are in contract negotiations and none of the trio are playing at their peak. Club captain Gerrard has been dismayed at the length of time it has taken to approach him over a deal and he knows there are clubs like New York Red Bulls who want him. So, from being on the brink of a new era last season, Liverpool appear to be back in decline. Which is why it makes sense for owner John W Henry and chairman Tom Werner to look for added investment, and why the chatter around Dubai will not go away. It is two weeks since Henry was joined by former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry in Dubai to meet Marwan Abedin, a prominent businessman in the emirate. The club insist it was a private meeting unrelated to football and it is true that Henry and Abedin do share an interest in healthcare, the latter being the chief executive of Dubai Healthcare City while Henry and his wife, Linda, fund health research as part of their charitable foundation in Boston. Liverpool sold star striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million in the summer . Owner John W Henry was joined by former chief executive Rick Parry in Dubai to meet Marwan Abedin . But Marwan is also on the board of Emaar, a real estate company which built the world’s largest skyscraper, the Burj Khalifa. And he has close links to Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the vice-president and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and monarch of Dubai. In addition, he sits on the Emaar board with Fadel Al Ali, the chairman of Dubai International Capital, the Sheik’s personal wealth fund, which agreed to buy the club in 2007 but lost out to Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Liverpool lost £48.85m last season and £40.52m the year before. # . If UEFA use the figures provided by the club’s holding company, UKSV Holdings, the prognosis is even worse: £69.67m loss recorded in 2013 and £54.68m in 2012. The club are on notice from UEFA for being in potential breach of the Financial Fair Play regulations and will submit their latest figures this month. Under UEFA rules, a Dubai investor could not wipe out the debts but Liverpool could increase their sponsorship and commercial income through Middle Eastern links. The rebuild of the main stand — the £75m investment would be exempt from UEFA rules — could be funded by Dubai. A naming rights sponsor would ease expenditure and a new club sponsor needs to be negotiated because the Standard Chartered deal expires in 2016. It looks as though work will begin in the New Year and Liverpool have requested that their final game of the season is away in order to squeeze in an extra week of work. That will lift stadium capacity to 55,000 and the Anfield Road expansion will then take it up to 60,000. Parry, with contacts in the Middle East and a direct line to Henry, might be the man to broker the deals to build the stadium. First, though, they must exorcise the ghosts of Selhurst Park. With top-four hopes fading and their Champions League bid resting on a midweek trip to Ludogorets, it is time for Rodgers’ new buys to start showing their true worth.","Brendan Rodgers will be judged on the nine players he signed in summer .

"Louis van Gaal admitted that this Manchester United side will have to make significant improvements if they are to challenge at the top of the table despite a morale-boosting 2-1 victory at Arsenal which lifted them into the top four. The Manchester United manager hailed his make-shift team, which included a back three of Tyler Blackett, Paddy McNair and Chris Smalling, but said that the opening 25 minutes, in which United looked as though they would be swept aside by Arsenal, was an indication of how much ground they had to make up. United secured the victory secured through a Kieran Gibbs own goal and a Wayne Rooney strike, but van Gaal said: ‘I was not pleased with the way we had played in the first half so I don’t think it’s my best victory with United. Of course, it’s an away game against a top team and we have won. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal speaking after 2-1 victory over Arsenal .

'But I have to say the first 25 minutes we gave the ball so easily away, it’s not possible for a top team. Arsenal created a lot of chances but fortunately we have a very good goalkeeper in David De Gea and after the first 25 minutes you saw we were coming back in the game. ‘That’s what I said at half time: when we keep the ball, when we show confidence then we shall create many, many chances. And we created at last three big chances. And twice the pass was easy to give to Di Maria and Rooney and the passes, which were not difficult, were not right. And we have to improve that.’ United keeper David De Gea was man of the match, keeping United in the game at times but even he was urged to improve by van Gaal. ‘His quality is on the goal-line but he has to improve also in their aspects of the game. When I say that you think that I’m crazy but I’m not crazy, believe me. ‘And if Arsenal had score in the first 20 minutes, it would have been another game and then maybe I would have had to respond to all the questions because I had chosen three defenders – but now I can laugh. ‘I was convinced before the match I had made the right decision – but making the decision before the match is a quality decision, I can say that now. But I can’t do anything else as I don’t have so many players. I think the players have done fantastically and Blackett, McNair and Shaw – how old are they?

"New radar images have shown that British colonists may have settled in a remote part of what is now North Carolina more than 400 years ago - potentially solving a centuries-old mystery. It was never fully known where a group of 120 settlers from England ended up after they left Europe and headed to the 'New World'. Historians have debated the fate of the so-called 'Lost Colony' for years - having been left with no more evidence than the word 'Croatoan' carved into a tree near the abandoned settlement. Researchers may have now taken a large step towards settling the debate after enlisting the help of magnetometers and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). And, in the stuff of a schoolboy's dreams, the researchers have backed up the glittering technology's findings with 'secret' evidence from a 400-year-old map drawn by one of the settlement's founders. Location, location, location: Roanoke Island is located just off what is now the state of North Carolina (seen in this 16th century map in red). The area of recent interest is the section at the left centre of the map where the two rivers meet . Modern version: A satellite map of the Albemarle Sound area of Noprth Carolina shows how accurate White's map is. The area of interest is just above Swan Bay in Bertie County . Last year the map - drawn in 1585 by John White, an artist and friend of famed explorer Sir Walter Raleigh - rekindled interest in the fate of the lost colonists. Tests found a hidden section of the map, drawn in a style of invisible ink and covered with paper, which provided a tantalising hint at the possible . location of what may have been intended as the colony's capital near . Roanoke Island. Around 70 miles away from the island, at the end of Albemarle Sound, the covered section of the map disguises what appears to be diamond-shaped drawing that was often used to mark a defensive postion of fort. The latest images are far from the handsome maps of yore, however, as the GPR photos are difficult for the untrained eye to decipher. They display magnetomer-produced images that show anomalies in the ground distribution in the area. Markings: Experts say the black spots on the image above show ditches that are distinctly different from Native American design. The image above right is a ground penetrating radar (GPR) image of the same area . Tanya Basu from National Geographic reports . that Malcolm LeCompte, a research associate at Elizabeth City State . University in North Carolina, came up with the idea to use GPR alongside White's map. Analysts believe the differences in surface structure could indicate the creation of ditches that are different from those created by Native Americans. A green and brown imagery photo examines the varying levels of sub-surface features. Curved anomaly patterns are considered to be the work of Native Americans, while straight-line patterns are thought to be made be colonial settlers. The location of the colonial ground patterns in the modern images is the same as White's hidden fort on the 1585 map. It is a classic 'X-marks-the-spot' map that could yet lead to historical treasure. Riddle in invisible ink: The map (left) of . Roanoke Island in North America drawn by John White during an attempt to . create England's first colony reveals a hidden possible location for . the settlement when it was illuminated from underneath (right) in recent . tests. The colony disappeared in mysterious circumstances in the 1580s . Shedding new light: In this close-up of the patch at the centre of the map, a diamond or 'lozenge', the symbol for a fort, can clearly be seen. The symbol was drawn in invisible ink and further concealed with a piece of paper glued on top . The 'invisible ink' - a likely combination of milk, citrus . juice or urine - was a common feature of maps at the time, often hiding places of strategic or military importance. For added security, the fort symbol was covered by another piece of paper glued over the top. Researchers undertook a satellite survey of the site and looked for similarities between the old map and the current geography of the area. They are currently identifying where the spots on the map match today's landscape, before systematically searching the site with their GPR. Step back in time: A graphic of the North Carolina coast shows the possible location of the 'Lost Colony' in relation to Roanoke Island, where British settlers established a colony in the 1580s . Hunting for historical answers: Clay Swindell uses the magnetometer at left while Malcolm le Compte at right teaches student Patrina Bly how the GPR machine measures and backdates disturbances underground . 1584: Sir Walter Raleigh's men first land on Roanoke Island and find it suitable for settlement. 1585: 108 soldiers come to Roanoke to establish first colony. 1586: Colonists and Native Americans at 'war', and colony abandoned. 1587: Second group of 117 colonists come to Roanoke . 1590: Captain White returns to Roanoke to find the colony gone. 1602: Raleigh makes another attempt to locate the colony. 1940s: Professional archaeology begins at Roanoke. 2012: Experts identify a tantalising clue hidden in a map drawn by settlement founder John White. 2013 - Researchers study the site with the help of magnetometers and GPR. GPR works by sending a tiny pulse of energy into a material via an antenna. A computer then records the strength and time required for the return of any reflected signals. Sub-surface variations from objects - such as wooden structures, iron cannons or coffins - will create reflections that are picked up by the system. Using this technique, Professor LeCompte and his colleagues found a previously undetected pattern that they claim may indicate the presence of one or more wooden structures under about a metre of soil. Researchers claim the presence of the buried structure may indicate that there was some sort of colonial presence in the area. The Museum of the Albemarle suggested the use of a proton magnetometer to enable the researchers to double-check their GPR findings, which can find objects buried about 13ft (four metres) underground. Researchers are hopeful that it will only be a matter of time before they stumble on further clues to help explain what happened to the Roanoke Colony. Seeing an opportunity: Queen Elizabeth wanted to use a colony in the 'New World' to launch raids against the Spanish . The Roanoke Colony was an attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent British presence in the New World, and comprises two unsuccessful attempts at settlement. Elizabeth's intention was to exlpoit the natural riches of the enexplored country, as well as using the colony as a base from which to launch privateering raids on Spanish ships. The enterprise was originally financed and planned by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, but was later headed by Sir Humphrey's half brother Sir Walter Raleigh. An exploration mission led by Philip Amadas and Arthur Barlowe landed at Roanoke Island on July 4, 1584, and established good relations with the Secotan and Croatan tribes. Barlowe returned to England with members of the tribes, who told Sir Walter about the local customs and geography. Sir Walter ordered another mission in 1585, led by his distant cousin Sir Richard Grenville. The expedition also included Sir Walter's artist friend John White, who was to provide invaluable coastal mapping of the region. Sir Richard left 107 men to establish a fort and settlement on Roanoke Island, but within a year the colonists had managed to anger the local tribes, leading to open hostilities. When Sir Francis Drake stopped there in 1586, after a successful raiding expedition to the Caribbean, he offered to provide passage for anyone who wanted to return to England. Everyone accepted. When Sir Richard returned with supplies to find the settlement abandoned, he left a small group to retain and English presence. Sir Walter sent another expedition of 150 people in 1587, let by White. The only evidence they found of the small group left behind was a single skeleton. Relations with the tribes had not improved and, after a settler was killed in Albemarle Sound, White returned to England to ask for help and reinforcements. 'Croatoan': The return of John White in 1590 found none of the 117 settlers of Roanoke Island. The name of a local tribe was carved into a nearby tree - and there is no other evidence of where they went, or why. Before he could return, England was plunged into the Anglo-Spanish War and all vessels were comandeered to repel the coming Spanish Armada. White was not able to return until 1590. His men could not find any trace of the 90 men, 17 women, and 11 children of the colony, nor was there any sign of a struggle or battle. Before he left for England, White had arranged a code with the colonists. If they were under attack or forced to flee - a sensible arrangement considering relations with the locals - the colonists were to carve a Maltese cross into a tree. There was no evidence of such a carved cross, but White's men found two trees. One was carved with the word 'Croatoan' and the other simply with 'Cro'. Whether this was a reference to the settlement's assailants, or a indicator that the colonists had gone to live with the Croatans on nearby Hatteras Island, remains unclear. Poor weather and his shipmates' desire to leave Roanoke forced White to abandon his search for the colonists. He never returned. A voyage by Sir Walter Raleigh 12 years later in 1602 also ended when bad weather forced the expedition to return to England. Sir Walter's arrest for treason prevented him from making any other expeditions.","A satellite survey of area around Albemarle Sound has identified key areas of interest .

"Shamed Cheltenham Festival winning trainer Philip Fenton has been banned from the sport for three years by the Irish Turf Club. The exclusion follows the Co Tipperary trainer’s conviction and 6,000 euro fine after illegal medications, including anabolic steroids, were found at his stable during a Ministry Of Agriculture raid in January 2012. Fenton’s ban will start on midnight on Friday when all his Irish licences will be suspended. Horse trainer Philip Fenton (left) and solicitor Ken Molan arrive at Carrick-on-Suir District Court on Saturday . Fenton pleaded guilty to three charges, including bringing the sport into disreute . But the Irish Turf Club will allow him to be an ‘attendee’ at race meetings until March 1 in order to allow him to ‘wind down his business affairs in an orderly fashion’. The case has cast a black cloud over Irish racing since it became public just before the Cheltenham Festival. Fenton was allowed to run three horses at that meeting in March – Dunguib, Last Instalment and Value At Risk – but only after the British Horse Authority had taken the unprecedented action of drug testing the horses and inspecting the Irish Turf Club’s testing record of Fenton-trained horses. Fenton pleaded guilty to three charges at Saturday's hearing which included bringing the sport into disrepute. Fenton’s ban will start on midnight on Friday when all his Irish licences will be suspended . His legal team urged the panel to issue a financial penalty but Turf Club chief executive Denis Egan said the gravity of the case warranted a ban. Last year Godolphin trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni was given an eight-year ban by the BHA after admitting he had given some of his horses anabolic steroids. But Egan disputed suggestions that Fenton’s three-year ban could be considered lenient. He said: ‘I think it is a very significant punishment. ‘Apart from the fact his livelihood has gone for three years, he has suffered a lot of reputational damage. He had lost a lot of his good horses before today and he has lost a lot of his owners. ‘He was not in a good place even before the three-year penalty was imposed. ‘The panel took into account he pleaded guilty to the three charges and the reputational damage to the sport and came up with what they perceived to be a fair penalty.’","Philip Fenton was fined £4,748 after illegal medications, including anabolic steroids were found at his stable .

Spurs have recalled winger Kenny McEvoy from his season-long loan with Peterborough United, the League One club have confirmed. The 20-year-old is a dead-ringer for Bale and plays on the wing too like the former White Hart Lane favourite.

"World Cup-winning Germany forward Andre Schurrle has dismissed suggestions that he could be on his way out of Chelsea. The 24-year-old, signed from Bayer Leverkusen 18 months ago, has been underwhelming for Chelsea since returning from Brazil 2014 with a winners' medal, sparking suggestions he could be offloaded in January. Schurrle, though, has taken to social networking site Instagram to show his allegiance. Andre Schurrle underlined his commitment to Chelsea with this message on his instagram account . 'To the top:)) £behappy £blues,' Schurrle posted on Instagram, alongside a photo of him in a Chelsea shirt, pointing to the skies. Schurrle has completed 90 minutes only twice this term under Jose Mourinho, each time in the Capital One Cup, and the Portuguese has often demanded more of the pacey forward. Mourinho hinted at his frustrations with Schurrle in early October, after the German had missed a host of chances against Bolton and a key opportunity in the Champions League clash at Sporting Lisbon. Mourinho said on October 3: 'Sometimes he plays phenomenal. Other times plays so-so. But when he plays phenomenal, he is phenomenal.' The 24-year-old Germany international has been underwhelming since his return from the World Cup . Schurrle was hitting back after being linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge this week . Didier Drogba (shaking hands with Gianfranco Zola) has hinted this season could be his last . Schurrle will be hoping Mourinho, who substituted him at half-time of the Champions League draw at Maribor last week, can help him to overcome what he will hope is merely a post-World Cup lull. Mourinho is always seeking more from the Blues, who lead the Barclays Premier League after an unbeaten 11-game start and are eight points clear of defending champions Manchester City. Like Schurrle, Didier Drogba has had a bit-part role this term. Drogba, who is 37 in March, has hinted this season could be his last, after returning to Chelsea following a two-year absence and stints in China and Turkey. The striker was always a stop-gap solution for Mourinho, who views Drogba's influence off the field as significant as the role the Ivorian plays on it. 'This year, the key for me is to enjoy my football and to be with my team-mates and to win trophies,' Drogba told Chelsea TV. 'There is one more year to go so let's do it, let's win more trophies, let's make history again.' Drogba will always be remembered by Chelsea fans, having struck the decisive penalty in the 2012 Champions League defeat of Bayern Munich which earned Chelsea a first European Cup. He has made 13 appearances this season, the majority off the substitutes' bench, and netted three goals, to take his overall Chelsea tally to 160.","Andre Schurrle posted a committed message on his instagram account .

They want to tell you we will take him to Europe so the club has to pay us less compensation. ‘Fair enough, we know who we are dealing with. You know who you are dealing with for the rest of your life, not just one deal. It’s not a problem, everyone has a reputation. ‘Here we are talking about players, agents, family. Last time I was talking about Connor, the father was quick to reply. Now we’ll see who is going to make the decision about staying at the football club or going to play abroad. ‘My advice is to make the decision yourself. If he makes the decision I will respect it, good or bad.’ Wickham is not agitating for a move but has been played out of his preferred central position . Sportsmail understands that Wickham is not agitating for a move away from the Stadium of Light and remains in discussions over a new deal with sporting director Lee Congerton and chief executive Margaret Byrne. However, the £8million striker – signed by Steve Bruce in 2011 – has been used in a wide-left position of late rather than his preferred central role, from where he scored four goals to help keep Sunderland in the Premier League during the closing weeks of last season.","Connor Wickham is out of contract  at the end of the season .

"Click here to read Sportsmail's interview with Blackpool president Valeri Belokon . Lee Clark has returned to management having been named Blackpool's new boss just 10 days after parting ways with fellow Sky Bet Championship strugglers Birmingham. The Seasiders confirmed that the 42-year-old had been appointed to the post on a one-year rolling contract. The position had been vacant since Jose Riga was sacked on Monday following a turbulent 15-game spell at the helm. Lee Clark has been named as the new Blackpool manager on a one-year rolling contract . Chairman Karl Oyston had stressed the need for the club to quickly appoint a successor with Championship experience and Clark certainly fits the bill having managed for two seasons in the division at Blues, with whom he finished 12th and 21st. However, the midlands outfit moved on from Clark last week following a poor run of results that had seen them win just twice this season, only one more victory than Riga managed in his short stint. Clark told the club's official website: 'I am absolutely delighted. The main objective is to try and keep the club in the Championship and build from there. It is a big challenge because of our position in the league but it's a challenge that can be overcome. 'It's one that if we achieve what we set out to achieve, which is to stay in the league, it will be a tremendous feat by the whole group. I'm very confident with the players I've got here, in what we can do going forward, that we can achieve those goals.' Clark replaces Jose Riga who was sacked as Blackpool boss on Monday following a turbulent spell at the club . Clark takes over a club bottom of the Championship, seven points adrift of safety already, and with a mere four wins to their credit since last November. He managed to save Birmingham from relegation in dramatic circumstances last season, when two goals in the final 12 minutes at Bolton prevented them from slipping into the third tier. Riga's status as Blackpool's manager had looked highly precarious well before Oyston eventually pulled the plug on his time in charge this Monday. Rumblings of discontent had been circulating for months with the two clashing over player recruitment following a summer of inexplicable inactivity at Bloomfield Road, and the point of no return appeared to be reached when then-Burton boss Gary Rowett was openly offered the job in September. Rowett turned down the opportunity, though, and was this week confirmed as Birmingham's new manager following Clark's exit. Clark was sacked as Birmingham City boss earlier in October after winning just two games this season . August 10: Mark Robins (Huddersfield) August 15: Tony Pulis (Crystal Palace) August 28: David Hockaday (Leeds) August 31: Beppe Sannino (Watford) September 1: Graham Kavanagh (Carlisle), Joe Dunne (Colchester) September 12: James Beattie (Accrington) September 18: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (Cardiff), Felix Magath (Fulham), Micky Adams (Port Vale) September 24: Russell Slade (Leyton Orient) September 29: Oscar Garcia (Watford) October 3: Dougie Freedman (Bolton) October 4: Colin Cooper (Hartlepool) October 7: Billy McKinlay (Watford) October 8: Russ Wilcox (Scunthorpe) October 13: Nigel Worthington (York), Rob Edwards (Tranmere) October 20: Lee Clark (Birmingham) October 25: Darko Milanic (Leeds) October 27: Jose Riga (Blackpool) Total: 21 .","Blackpool have named Lee Clark as their next  successor to Jose Riga .

"Liverpool are interested in bringing in a new goalkeeper, and Fiorentina stopper Neto looks to be top of Brendan Rodgers' list. The 25-year-old Brazilian, who played twice in the Olympics for his country in 2012, would most likely be competition for current No 1 Simon Mignolet, rather than a straight replacement. Neto's contract runs out in June 2015, and Liverpool would prefer a free move in the summer window, but may talk to him in January. Brazilian goalkeeper Neto is being eyed up by Liverpool either in January or the summer . Brendan Rodgers wants competition for current No 1 Simon Mignolet after a poor start to the season . Neto has been linked with league leaders Juventus after a string of fine performances, claiming five clean sheets with Fiorentina in 11th place but with the fourth-best defensive record.

"The word at Tottenham’s state-of-the-art Enfield training complex is that the club will make a concerted effort to sign Southampton striker Jay Rodriguez in January. What is for sure is manager Mauricio Pochettino needs to inject some life into his misfiring forward line sooner rather than later. Wednesday night's Capital One Cup clash against Brighton merely underlined the White Hart Lane club’s need for a new striker once the transfer window re-opens. Jay Rodriguez is currently out with a long-term cruciate ligament injury, but scored 15 goals last term . Rodriguez has one England cap, coming in the 2-0 defeat to Chile at Wembley last November . Between them, Spurs’ strike trio of Emmanuel Adebayor, Roberto Soldado and Harry Kane have scored five domestic goals this season. Adebayor and Kane have two each; Soldado has one. In short: not good enough. Certainly not good enough for a team with aspirations of breaking into the Champions League qualification places. It was Soldado and Kane’s turn to improve upon that dismal record on Wednesday night. But, once more, chance after chance was squandered before Kane tapped in late on to put the result beyond doubt. Mauricio Pochettino may raid Southampton, with the likes of Emmanuel Adebayor (right) underperforming . Roberto Soldado has been disappointing since his move to England last summer from Valencia . Pochettino, upon his arrival from Southampton in the summer, insisted he wanted to give those at the club a chance to ink themselves into his blueprint. But the Argentine knows now he’ll have to buy a new striker in January. His interest in Rodriguez, a player he worked with and helped nurture at St Mary’s, is no secret. There was a willingness, certainly from Pochettino, to strike a deal with the Saints for the England international, whose long-term knee injury meant that Tottenham’s interest cooled. Tottenham striker Harry Kane (left) stretches to beat Aaron Hughes (right) to the ball to score for Spurs . Yet Pochettino inherited this Spurs forward line, and until he is able to stamp his mark on it via the transfer market, he cannot truly call this his side. Those in the corridors of power at White Hart Lane know that, too, and are prepared to fund his move for Rodriguez at the turn of the year. The Spurs boss feels Rodriguez’s pace and movement can help transform his forward line for the final months of the season. Persuading Rodriguez to leave upwardly-mobile Southampton for Spurs might be harder than it sounds, though, and Pochettino will hope his relationship with the striker will lure him to London.","Jay Rodriguez is currently out with a long-term cruciate ligament injury .

"So, Lewis Hamilton or Nico Rosberg? That is the question that will be dominating those casting their eyes towards Abu Dhabi for Sunday's Grand Prix. Hamilton is agonisingly close to clinching the title, though Rosberg is lurking behind the Brit. But who do the big names think will win it and why? Sportsmail gather their thoughts... Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg (right) go head to head on Sunday in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . SIR JACKIE STEWART . Hamilton will almost certainly win the championship. However, there is a chance Valtteri Bottas or Felipe Massa could finish second in the race. If that was to happen and Rosberg wins, that would put Hamilton in third and he would lose the title. Any mechanical failure would have an enormous effect, too. Hamilton is agonisingly close to winning the title but mechanical failures can have a big effect . DAMON HILL . I think Hamilton will win the championship. He shouldn’t have anything to worry about if he’s prepared, as he is better than Rosberg. Hamilton only needs to keep cool to clinch the title over Mercedes team-mate and rival  Rosberg . MARTIN KEOWN . I hope it’s Hamilton but the way the script is written it could be Rosberg. Talk of a new contract could be a distraction for Lewis, and the double points system makes things so different. We all want Lewis but I think there will be a final twist in the tail... Martin Keown says he wants Hamilton to win the title but that there could be a final twist in the tail . MARTIN BRUNDLE . Hamilton should win the championship. I’m pretty sure he’ll want to take it with a big win to underline his talent and achievement, even though he only has to coast to second in a dominant car. Rosberg’s win in Brazil, however, ensures that with significant contact or mechanical issues for Hamilton, the double points handout would clinch the title for him. Hamilton goes into Sunday's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix looking to seal the title over Rosberg . JAMIE REDKNAPP . Obviously I want Hamilton to win but it should be an amazing last race. It reminds me of 1989 when Liverpool played Arsenal in that title decider. As for double points, I think a lot of managers at the bottom of the league would like that at the end of the season! The pressure’s on Lewis but hopefully he’ll do it. Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp believes it will be an amazing final race and hopes Hamilton can clinch the title . JOHN WATSON . Lewis is the favourite because he has more wins and points. The only way it could go wrong is a reliability gremlin or if the pair get silly on the track like in Bahrain and Belgium. Rosberg has called for a clean, fair race and I hope he gets it. Toto Wolff, the head of Mercedes, has told Hamilton and Rosberg that they can simply go all out and race .

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has defended his decision to let Danny Welbeck join Arsenal in the summer because he never saw the England striker as anything more than a reserve player. Welbeck joined Arsenal from United for £16million on transfer deadline day in September, and will be looking to prove a point when he faces his former side for the first time in Saturday's late Barclays Premier League encounter at the Emirates Stadium. Welbeck has scored five goals for Arsenal and the same amount for England since he left Old Trafford but, although United's attacking triumvirate of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao have failed to sparkle so far this season, Van Gaal insists he made the right decision to let the United Academy product go. Danny Welbeck (centre) trains with his new team-mates ahead of Arsenal's clash with former club United . United manager Louis van Gaal could regret his decision to let Welbeck leave Manchester United . Welbeck was not always trusted at United where he had to compete with  Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie . 'I don't have to prove that [I was right],' Van Gaal said. 'Why do I have to prove that? 'Here, Danny Welbeck did not play every match. He was not a line-up player; he was more substitute than line-up,' the Dutchman said. 'With different coaches not a line-up player, then came Mr van Gaal and the world is changing? No, the world is not changing - the facts are not my facts, they're the facts of Danny Welbeck.' Van Gaal added: 'We have Van Persie and (James) Wilson, and when you keep Welbeck, you don't give any chances to youngsters. That's also our philosophy, to give opportunities to youngsters. 'And then also we could buy Falcao. So (if) that is not enough reason, then I don't know - I'm not a very good manager. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was interested in signing Rademel Falcao but may have got the better deal . Welbeck was forced out of Old Trafford by the arrival of Colombia international Falcao (right) 'For him it was a very good decision because as a line-up player he develops himself much more. 'If it was right for Manchester United is dependable on how they play, how they score and in what position we shall finish in the league.' Van Gaal went on to reveal that he has delayed his decision on whether to buy Falcao because of the latest injury to the Colombian striker. Falcao has endured a difficult start to his life at Manchester United since his deadline day arrival from Monaco, scoring just one goal in five appearances. The striker has struggled for fitness and is yet to complete a full game for the Red Devils. Arsenal fans held reservations over Welbeck's finishing after he first arrived in north London . The former Porto and Atletico Madrid star has been unavailable for the last month because of a calf injury he sustained in training and it will take at least another fortnight for him to return to action. United are yet to take up the option to buy Falcao because of his latest injury, which comes 10 months after he damaged cruciate ligaments playing for Monaco. 'Do you think we expected he'd be injured for so many weeks? Because of that (injury setback) maybe we didn't buy him,' the United manager said. Van Gaal speaks to his injury-ravaged side as they prepare for the trip to the Emirates . Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke is baffled that Welbeck was allowed to sign for a rival club for what he believes is such little money. 'It would not have happened in Sir Alex's time,' Yorke told the Daily Express. 'The only time players were allowed to leave the club was when they were in decline. 'He would never have taken a young up-and-coming player like Danny Welbeck coming through and sold him for peanuts.

"Mystery: This prolific cat burglar, pictured on CCTV with a torch in his mouth, has made off with thousands of pounds' worth of women's clothes . A prolific cat burglar stalking one of Britain’s wealthiest neighbourhoods has made off with thousands of pounds’ worth of designer women’s clothes. The thief has stolen a mink coat, Prada shoes and designer dresses as well as jewellery and cash while prowling the homes of the rich and famous. One theory being worked on by police is that the meticulous intruder – who targets sprawling multi-million-pound mansions in Wimbledon Village – could be a fetishist. He never steals electrical equipment and only takes a portion of any money he finds, which led many wealthy homeowners to believe employees had stolen from them. In fact, police said 20 cleaners had been wrongly sacked by victims who did not realise they had been burgled. Officers suspect the thief may be behind up to 400 crimes and is getting a thrill from outwitting detectives. One homeowner installed hidden CCTV cameras in a bid to prove that their cleaner was pocketing money and valuables. But they were shocked to capture the burglar casually wandering around their home in the middle of the night and rifling through drawers. Among the victims is tennis star Boris Becker, whose wife Lilly said she was living in fear. The Daily Mail can reveal that he has also twice targeted former Chelsea player Nicolas Anelka, who chased the thief across his garden only to be outrun by him. Caught on camera: The thief has stolen a mink coat, Prada shoes and designer dresses as well as jewellery and cash while prowling the homes of the rich and famous. One theory is that the thief could be a fetishist . He was sleeping on the sofa when he was . woken by the suspect and gave chase, but the man escaped over a high . wall. The footballer told police: ‘This guy was fast.’ Other victims include other sports . stars, the chief executives of several large companies and a string of . wealthy foreign businessmen. The case has perplexed Met bosses, whose records revealed that he began targeting the area as early as 2006 and is responsible for at least 152 crimes, though investigators suspect the true figure could be as high as 400 because of his unusual tactics. Victim: Among the victims is tennis star Boris Becker, pictured with his wife Lilly, who says she is living in fear . They believe he spends days watching . homes before climbing walls and sneaking in through open doors, windows . and skylights in the early hours before stealing keys and returning up . to ten times to search the property. In the vast majority of cases, he has only stolen cash and jewellery. He has ignored up to six iPads in some homes, but taken a £6,000 mink coat and a pair of £400 Prada shoes in others. In one burglary, he used a key stolen in an earlier raid to open a safe from which he stole one earring from every single pair he found. Thrill: Officers suspect the thief may be behind up to 400 crimes and is getting a thrill from outwitting police . The theft was discovered weeks after he had replaced the jewellery boxes in their original positions. Police . have recovered CCTV images showing the thief muttering into a . Dictaphone, presumably to record security weaknesses for his next . ‘visit’. Despite his prolific record, he has not left any forensic traces, possibly helped by wearing an all-in-one waterproof suit and distinctive fishing hat. Targeted: The intruder has also twice targeted former Chelsea player Nicolas Anelka . Last week, Lilly Becker told Crimewatch she has been forced to turn her home into ‘almost a fort’ with alarms and lights left on all night. ‘He can’t make this his profession he cannot just get away with this and take people’s stuff,’ the Dutch model said. As a result of her appeal police received more than 50 calls with information, including the names of several potential suspects. Det Chief Insp Dan O’Sullivan, who is leading a specialist team hunting the burglar, said it is only a matter of time before he is caught. He said: ‘I have visited every single victim. Many have suspected their cleaner or au pair. 20 people have been sacked and lots of family members have been accused. ‘He is someone who is prepared to return to a venue up to 10 times. He is in no rush. He takes £200 from a purse and leaves £50 - and frankly that is pocket money. He added: ‘These are massively wealthy people, they have £500 go missing overnight. The intruder always leaves cash behind. ‘This fellow has never stolen one electrical item. These are people with six iPads. He will always leave cash in their wallet. ‘He is very meticulous. To go undetected for this amount of time is remarkable. But everyone makes mistakes, even the most highly trained professionals.’","Thief has made off with thousands of pounds' worth of designer clothes .

"Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has turned to Spain to rebuild his managerial career, as the Scot takes his Real Sociedad side to Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday evening. Moyes, who endured a torrid season at the helm at Old Trafford is quoted in Spanish paper Marca: 'I'm nervous and emotional about my first game.' He has certainly taken up a tough challenge in La Liga, with Real Sociedad struggling for form and just out of the relegation zone on goal difference in 15th place. The Real Madrid squad will wear custom shorts in support of their colleague Luka Modric at Eibar on Saturday . Marca leads with the headline 'Modric spirit' after the Croatian midfielder left the clinic that treated Rafael Nadal's persistent knee troubles on Friday after he was ruled out for three months having torn a tendon in his thigh. The Spanish paper also reveals the Real Madrid squad will wear special shorts supporting their team-mate Modric against Eibar on Saturday as Los Blancos aim for a 14th consecutive victory. Sami Khedira is set to replace Modric in the heart of Madrid's midfield, perhaps scuppering a January move to the Premier League for the German, who has been heavily linked with Arsenal and Chelsea since the summer. However Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti said: 'We will solve the problem because we have Kroos and Khedira as a World Cup-winning pairing and Isco can also play there.' La Gazzetta dello Sport is building up to the Milan derby which is Roberto Mancini's first game back at Inter . La Gazzetta dello Sport have asked Andriy Shevchenko and Diego Milito for their say ahead of the Milan derby on Sunday. AC and Inter are placed seventh and ninth respectively in Serie A but the bitter rivalry has greater significance with Roberto Mancini's first game back in charge at Inter. Rossonero legend Shevchenko has signaled out Chelsea's on-loan striker Fernando Torres for praise despite only scoring once since arriving at the San Siro this summer. 'Inzaghi is enthusiastic and fired up, just like when he was playing. Fernando Torres is great and I expect Milan to push forward,' said Shevchenko. Meanwhile Milito, who won the treble at Inter in 2010, has backed former Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini to be a success again back at Inter, where he previously won three Serie A titles. 'Mancini is preparing another great Inter, just like before Mou (Jose Mourinho). I am betting on Rodrigo Palacio to score the winner.'

In Corriere dello Sport Ferrero claims: 'I will win the Scudetto with Sampdoria. Who said a big club has to get the title?' After the Thohir incident Ferrero, the paper claims, jokes with Filipino fans who send in messages: 'Okaka stays. He will sign a new contract and I'll only sell to Real Madrid... I love Mihajlovic. He deserves a big club, but he'll be my Boskov.'

"Crisis? What crisis? That memorable slogan from the Winter of Discontent 35 years ago has been England’s defiant mantra this week as they have grappled with autumn angst. In 1979, the crisis in question involved political unrest that ultimately brought down a government. Even in a rugby context, five defeats on the bounce will not lead to protests in the streets, let alone a change of regime, but Stuart Lancaster needs his team to turn a corner, to add substance to their insistence that the wheels are not coming off the Sweet Chariot. The head coach, his assistants and players have been indignant in the face of escalating criticism that has come their way following narrow defeats by New Zealand and South Africa in the first two fixtures of this QBE series at Twickenham. Lancaster emphatically dismissed the notion that England are in crisis, but that will be the state of affairs if there is an almighty upset at HQ on Saturday. England captain Chris Robshaw shows what the South Africa loss, their fifth successive, means to the players . Joe Marler (left) and the rest of the England squad were put through their paces ahead of hosting Samoa . A match with Samoa that was supposed to offer the chance for experimentation from a position of strength instead looms as a game in which the bottom line is all that matters. Granted, the hosts could do with a barnstorming performance, but ‘result’ is the box that absolutely has to be ticked. From an English perspective, the prospect of a shock at the hands of Saturday’s Pacific island visitors doesn’t bear thinking about. These teams have met only six times —three at Twickenham and three during World Cups. The last contest, four years ago, yielded an unconvincing 26-13 win for an England team managed by Martin Johnson, while the side whom the former lock led to World Cup glory in 2003 could only trump Samoa by the same modest margin. Based on relative playing numbers and resources, this should be a colossal mismatch, but it is likely to be no such thing. The hosts are low on confidence and cohesion, with a reshuffled line-up, while their opponents will be fuelled by the desire to make a big statement on the grand stage. They had considered boycotting the game in protest at mismanagement by their union, but instead they will wear black armbands to make their point. A groundswell of support from fellow players in other countries —including England — will surely serve to galvanise the Samoans, making them especially dangerous. Having been pilloried by their own prime minister and threatened for taking a stand, they are playing for their livelihoods and the prospects of future generations of Polynesian talent. It is a potent driving force. Yet, there is motivation and desperation in the home camp, too. England are grumpy, determined and focused. They know that trouble on Saturday would equate to a potentially terminal jolt to their hopes of building momentum ahead of the World Cup. They must win, with a degree of conviction, in order to lift the siege and push on towards the pivotal autumn finale against Australia in good heart. James Haskell has been recalled to the back row as England aim to end a run of five successive defeats . Owen Farrell has been displaced by George Ford (left) to inside centre for the Samoa Test . Ford will be under the spotlight as the Bath fly-half comes into the starting line-up at Twickenham . SIX - The number of times Samoa have played against, and lost to, England . 216 - Points scored by England against Samoa — an average of 36 per game . 14 - The number of England-based players in Samoa’s squad . 11 - Samoa’s world ranking — one place behind Japan and six behind England . 10 - Samoa have never lost by fewer than 10 points when facing England . 26 - England have never scored fewer than 26 points in this fixture . THREE - Since November 2012, Samoa have beaten three Six Nations sides — Wales, Scotland and Italy twice . There was commendable honesty from forwards coach Graham Rowntree on Friday as he assessed the state of the national team. ‘Our performances have been well documented — we have a lot of things to put right,’ he said. ‘It’s been a tough week, one of the hardest I’ve experienced. There have been some very frank discussions. We’re really unhappy with our two defeats. Although they’re by a total of six points, we know we’re under-performing and that hurts. There were plenty of harsh words from everyone.’ Asked where the two defeats have left England, Rowntree added: ‘Thoroughly p***ed off. We spent two-and-a-half days sulking as players and coaches and then you have to move on, saying we’re not that bad. The lads are desperate to fulfil what ability they have.’ In Rowntree’s area of influence, the rejigged home pack will expect to gain a degree of supremacy. For all their failings, England have been able to rely on a strong set-piece game and an effective rolling maul. Those weapons are bound to hurt the Samoans, although the likes of prop Census Johnston and flankers Maurie Fa’asavalu and Jack Lam are equipped to give the hosts some trouble up front. There will be a heavy focus on the work of Lancaster’s altered back row. James Haskell can provide an energising influence and assist Chris Robshaw in solving the perennial breakdown problems, while Ben Morgan has earned the right to lead the cavalry charge of English ball-carriers, which must be much more productive than of late. Further back, England have shifted their resources to create space for George Ford’s first start at 10. However, former Test players have led loud protests about the midfield balance, with the rookie fly-half expected to supply predatory wide runners in tandem with the Saracens duo, Owen Farrell and Brad Barritt. England coach Stuart Lancaster instructs his squad in training ahead of hosting Samoa on Saturday . The Samoans in training this week ahead of an important match against England at Twickenham . Samoa coach Stephen Betham is expecting a backlash from England after their five straight defeats . Those two were Lancaster’s first centre pair in February 2012, but the concern is that they are adept at holding the line rather than unleashing it. The coaches’ decision to entrust goal-kicking duties to Ford is a correct one, designed to expose him to the full scope of a Test conductor’s remit. Yet they have been damned for their refusal to demote Farrell, who has been short of form and match-fitness. Having been moved one place to inside centre, the man whose recent performances have prompted such debate and concern appeared relaxed about his predicament, saying: ‘The main thing is the team. We’ve not worked as well as we did in the Six Nations but we will get back to that quickly. I’ve got to cut out a couple of clear errors and then I think we’ll be all right.’ It sounds simple. In truth, for Farrell and for England, a tricky and tense occasion is in prospect. Defeat would mean the crisis is horribly, undeniably real.","There is talk of England being in a crisis as they prepare to face Samoa .
England have only met Saturday's opponents six times in the past .
The Samoans had considered boycotting the match in protest at mismanagement from their union, but will wear black armbands instead .

'We are going to play eight games of the Premier League, we are going to finish the first round (of fixtures) at the end of December. We have 24 more points to try to win. 'We have to try to do it, I think that is the only way. I think maybe not to be top of the table, because Chelsea are in a very good moment, but I think it is important to have a good first round.

"Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud is confident he will return stronger from his three-month injury lay-off and can forge a dynamic strike partnership with England forward Danny Welbeck. Giroud, 28, has recovered more quickly than expected since suffering a freak broken leg when challenging for the ball in the closing stages of the 2-2 draw against Everton on August 23. Manager Arsene Wenger revealed the France international could even be in contention for Saturday's Barclays Premier League showdown against Manchester United, although next weekend's trip to West Brom is perhaps a more realistic target given the player's lengthy absence. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Premier League preview: Arsenal vs Man United . Olivier Giroud (left) believes he can form a clinical partnership with Danny Welbeck (centre) for Arsenal . Giroud has had a lengthy period on the sidelines after breaking a leg against Everton in August . Arsene Wenger (left) brought Welbeck to Arsenal from Manchester United in the summer for £16million . The recruitment of Welbeck from United on transfer deadline day has looked a sound investment, with the 23-year-old having scored five goals in 12 appearances while Giroud continued his recovery. Giroud, though, believes rather than be in direct competition, the pair have the technical ability to develop a clinical partnership. 'After an injury of three months, you need to have a good rhythm back - you think you are fit, but the competition is everything. I will need a couple of games to be 100 per cent, but mentally and physically I am close,' Giroud said. 'It was the first time for me I have been out for three months, but it was good for my mentality, because I feel I will be back stronger, with more determination - and the doctor told me even my bone will be stronger.' Giroud, who plundered 22 goals last season, added: 'I think we needed (to buy) another striker, especially when my injury came. 'Danny has done really well up to now, but I am not worried that we have bought Danny. 'I think we will have a good understanding on the pitch and can play together, that is the main thing, we are quite complementary. 'It is a plus for us, and it will be good for the competition within the group, we will give our best every week. Welbeck celebrates scoring against Arsenal (right) in 2012 before making the move to London this summer . Welbeck  challenges Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for the ball in Arsenal's training session . 'We have our best years in front of us as a team, with the quality we have in the squad, now we have the quantity also, that is why I cannot wait to come back.' Giroud has been a frustrated spectator from the sidelines, unable to help his team-mates as Arsenal struggled to deliver regular results, despite the impressive form of summer signing Alexis Sanchez. The France forward, who is helping promote the new 4K Microtising campaign from Sony, believes Arsenal must learn to rediscover their composure once the hard work of getting control of a game has been done. 'We need consistency, but we also need to know how to close out the game after winning it, like against Anderlecht and Swansea away,' said Giroud. 'I could not believe what I was watching (against Anderlecht), that is one of our weaknesses, we don't know how to close the game when we are winning. 'We must just stay at the back and not take too much risk, I don't know where it comes from, but we need to improve ourselves in this way. 'Tactically, we all defend together, we are all attacking together, so it is all about the balance of our team, you cannot just target the defenders. 'Maybe we need more support for the defence when you are winning the game, just stay and don't go (forward) any more.' Arsenal sit sixth ahead of Saturday's showdown with Manchester United, but Giroud has not given up yet on mounting a title challenge through 2015. 'It is only November, there are still a lot of games left to play, the main thing is to take maximum points against the big teams,' he said. 'Chelsea have got a good advantage, but you never know.'

"It has never been easy to fathom the inner workings of Lewis Hamilton’s mind, yet it has rarely been harder, or more pertinent, to do so than here in the dry heat of the desert. There was a growing consensus among us amateur paddock psychologists that almost the only man who can beat Hamilton in the title-deciding Abu Dhabi Grand Prix is Hamilton himself. Of course, Nico Rosberg, his Mercedes team-mate, must play his part. He must finish fifth to stand any chance at all of closing the 17-point gap to Hamilton. Even if Rosberg were to win, second would be enough for Hamilton to take the title. If Rosberg were second, Hamilton would need to be fifth etc, etc. Lewis Hamilton faces the Formula One equivalent of defending a 1-0 lead in football for 90 minutes on Sunday . The Mercedes driver can become the first British double world champion since Jackie Stewart in 1971 . Hamilton during practice ahead of the Abu Dhabi  Grand Prix on Sunday against Nico Rosberg and Co . The permutations are extensive, and that is at the root of the fear some of us feel for the British driver as he goes into the biggest weekend of his life — since the last one. That was in 2008, when he fought a tactical race and emerged victorious, a touch fortuitously by passing Timo Glock on the last lap to finish fifth and clinch the title. Again, his task is less clear than that of his opponent — Felipe Massa six years ago and Rosberg here. Hamilton is facing Formula One’s equivalent of defending a 1-0 lead in football for 90 minutes, the approximate duration of Sunday’s race that starts at dusk and finishes in the dark. Hamilton is a super-accomplished driver, of course, but part of his brilliance is binary: everything or nothing, win at all costs, high-risk overtaking without a care in the world. The dynamics of Sunday mean the psychological advantage has shifted quite markedly. Rosberg, the impressive winner of the last race in Interlagos, realised this sooner than anyone and arrived in his press briefing, his shoulders back and his head up, talking about piling pressure on Hamilton. That strain is all the greater for the Briton because of the extraordinary expectations he and the watching public bestowed upon him when he arrived in F1 as a rookie of dazzling gifts. If he should flunk it on Sunday — or his Mercedes car betrays him — the script he wrote for himself would be ripped up. Mercedes driver Hamilton (pictured) is agonisingly close to sealing the title over team-mate and rival Rosberg . Hamilton (pictured) and Rosberg have been instructed by Toto Wolff, the head of Mercedes, to simply race . If he wins he will become the first British double world champion since Jackie Stewart in 1971, and who is to say what more records may not fall to him. The dichotomy between success and failure is chilling. It is said that this is Rosberg’s only chance of the title his father, Keke, won in 1982. That is not necessarily so, but, still, being so close to a lifetime’s dream carries a burden that must, however fleetingly, interrupt his customarily long hours of sleep. The task of managing the two protagonists has fallen to Toto Wolff, the head of Mercedes. He will not issue his men with any team orders. They will be free to race. Wolff was relaxed in the paddock of this £800million confection of Yas Marina, but his insight was illuminating. ‘Neither is an easy individual,’ he said, approvingly. ‘They are both complex characters.’ I suggested that Rosberg, despite the polished demeanour of a blue-chip company’s dream, has a bit of menace in him. ‘Ruthless, ruthless,’ said Wolff. ‘That boy, Nico, knows what he wants. Sometimes you say you need a difficult upbringing in order to be competitive. He had it all: son of a world champion, raised in Monaco, went to the international school. You can’t imagine a better family environment than that, and still, against the odds, he is an extremely competitive person.’ Rosberg has been labelled 'ruthless' and 'an extremely competitive person' by Wolff, the head of Mercedes . Wolff on Hamilton's title competitor Rosberg: ‘Ruthless, ruthless. That boy, Nico, knows what he wants' Rosberg will look to be breathing down Hamilton's neck during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday . And Hamilton? ‘I have been almost blown away by Lewis’s development in the last year-and-a-half, as a personality. He came from this McLaren environment which had two sides to it. ‘On one side he had a very long relationship with a father figure in Ron Dennis, being raised in the team, and owing it all to them. And on the other side he felt he needed to emancipate himself. ‘He came to us and it was all new. Over the course of time, his trust in the team grew, relationships started to be established. ‘He has a solid private life. For a couple of months he has been almost invulnerable. Not unbeatable on track, but as a person. He has a bad session and, because he wears his heart on his sleeve, he’s down. But you see him half an hour later and he is back. He wasn’t like this before.’ There is a persuasive argument that Hamilton, who was so marginally quicker than Rosberg in practice on Friday that it was hardly material, deserves the title more than his rival because he has won the majority of races — 10 wins to five so far — and is the purer racer. But if Rosberg holds his nerve and Hamilton wobbles in the final character examination here on Sunday who could begrudge him the title? Two final thoughts. First, let’s hope — putting sporting fairness ahead of patriotism — that the arbitrary double scoring that has been introduced for this race does not distort the championship. Secondly, what chance a Jean-Louis Schlesser having an impact on the title? The Frenchman was a hopeless backmarker who took out Ayrton Senna at Monza in 1988, spoiling McLaren’s 100 per cent winning record. Dennis said Schlesser ruined his life. So Lewis, our British hope, beware slow-moving vehicles, don’t be frozen by tactical cul-de sacs, be blessed with technical reliability, and the title will be yours. If Hamilton wobbles and Rosberg holds his nerve, then the title could go to the latter instead of the Brit .

"David Moyes has brought a new level of intensity and ambition to Real Sociedad since the former Manchester United and Everton manager took over as coach, defender Inigo Martinez said on Thursday. Moyes replaced the sacked Jagoba Arrasate at the Basque club, who are struggling in 15th place in La Liga, and they play their first game under the Scot's orders at Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday. Martinez said Moyes has transformed training sessions since arriving in San Sebastian last week and it was up to the players now to translate his orders into success on the pitch. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Moyes takes his first training session at Real Sociedad . David Moyes was appointed Real Sociedad manager earlier in November . 'Above all it is the intensity he brings to training, in the aggression he demands,' Martinez told a news conference when asked how things had changed since Moyes took over. 'He is really on top of everything, he pressures you constantly from the side of the pitch and this is something that motivates players,' added the centre back. 'The intensity we are seeing now was not there before and we need to learn everything he knows and then put it to use at the weekend.' Saturday's match against Depor at the Riazor is a good chance for Moyes to begin his career in Spain with a win to follow up the 2-1 victory at home to champions Atletico Madrid in their last outing. Moyes' training methods have impressed captain Inigo Martinez who describes him as 'enriching' Depor are a shadow of the team that won La Liga in 2000 and blazed a trail in Europe over the following several seasons and are 17th after 11 matches, one of five clubs including Sociedad on nine points. 'He (Moyes) is a coach who demands every player give their all and commit 100 percent in every duel and every tackle,' Martinez told reporters. 'The important thing is that we keep learning because he is a coach who has experience in different clubs and it is enriching for everyone. 'For a defender to see that he is concerned with every aspect of the game is very encouraging and the boss wants to improve a lot of things because there are a lot of things that can be improved.'

"Neil Ashton revealed in October that Arsene Wenger had tried to sign Messi . Arsene Wenger has confirmed that Lionel Messi could have joined Arsenal from Barcelona as a teenager along with Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique, as revealed by Sportsmail last month.

Messi has won the Champions League twice with Barcelona and has won the Ballon d'Or four times . Messi trains alongside Barcelona team-mate Gerard Pique (left) on Friday . A recent biography suggests the potential deal broke down because Arsenal were unable to purchase accommodation for Messi's family, who were keen to join him in London, although the South American would still have needed to secure a work permit. Despite all of their efforts, Arsenal boss Wenger - who also scouted the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Didier Drogba when they were raw talents - believes the player just felt settled in Spain rather than take a chance on a switch to England. Arsene Wenger - seen here at Arsenal training on Friday - has admitted he tried to sign Messi . Arsenal manager Wenger admitted: 'I think in the end, he was not so keen to move, because it was at a period where Fabregas came, and Fabregas and Messi played together in the same team (at Barcelona academy). We wanted to take Fabregas, Messi and Pique. It worked only for Fabregas. 'It was not completely down to a flat in the end.

"Forget La Masia, welcome to La Moyesia. David Moyes might not be at one of the world’s biggest clubs anymore but he has moved to the one with the sixth-best youth academy in Europe. He made his name at Everton for developing young talent and according to The International Centre for Sports Studies (CIES) there are only five better youth systems in Europe than Real Sociedad’s talent factory at ‘Zubieta’. Here Sportmail looks at the famed academy; at three of the players Moyes now inherits; and at three of its all-time greats.

The new Sociedad boss was in high spirits as he oversaw his first training session in San Sebastian last week . THREE FROM THE PAST . Xabi Alonso . The Bayern Munich midfielder’s father Periko Alonso also came through the club’s youth system although by the time Zubieta’s current seven pitch facility was built in 1982 he was already in the first team helping the side win the league. Like father like son, Xabi and his brother Mikel learned their trade in the youth categories of Real Sociedad. Xabi almost emulated his father’s title win but the team finished second in 2003 and he left for Liverpool at the end of the following season. He went on to win the European Cup twice as well as the World Cup and the European Championship. Adored by fans of La Real they still hope he will choose to finish his career at Anoeta when his German adventure comes to an end. Xabi Alonso came through the youth system at Real Sociedad and made his La Liga debut in 2001 . The 32-year-old currently plies his trade in Germany with Bayern Munich (left) after leaving Real Madrid (right) The midfielder, who has featured for Spain (left) 114 times, joined Liverpool from Real Sociedad in 2004 . Luis Arconada . Northern Ireland fans will remember Arconada best for palming Billy Hamilton’s cross straight into the path of Gerry Armstrong who scored to give them their greatest ever World Cup finals result. That shock, in the 1982 World Cup, was all the bigger for having come against one of the best goalkeepers in the world at the time. Arconada came through the Zubieta academy and played in both of Real Sociedad’s League winning campaigns in 81 and 82. He was the keeper who conceded fewest goals in La Liga for three seasons running from 1980 to 1982 and won 68 caps for his country appearing in two World Cups and two European Championships. He also played 551 games for Real Sociedad. His son, also called Luis, works in the media department of the club and helped David Moyes through his first few days in San Sebastian last week. Luis Arconada played in both Real Sociedad's league title-winning seasons in 1981 and 1982 . The goalkeeper conceded thefewest goals in La Liga for three seasons running between 1980 and 1982 . Antoine Griezmann . The latest gem to come from Zubieta left last summer moving to Atletico Madrid for a record £23.8million fee. After a superb season at Anoeta and a fine World Cup for France the young French-Basque winger could no longer be expected to play his football outside of the Champions League and Real Sociedad cashed in. Griezmann was signed aged 13 after the club’s chief scout in France Eric Olhats spotted him and managed to make him switch to Spain before Lyon could grab him. He was at Zubieta for five years before he made it to La Real’s B-team and then, in 2009, he debuted in the first team. Last season he scored 20 goals in 50 games and carried the team through what was a troubled campaign before he became the club’s most expensive transfer ever. Antoine Griezmann scored 20 goals for Real Sociedad last season, his final one with the club . Following that successful season Griezmann moved to Spanish champions Atletico Madrid for £23.8m . Moyes’s Masia . CIES ranked Zubieta sixth in the world in 2014 according to the number of homegrown players at the club or currently playing at another big-5 club. Barcelona came out on top with Manchester United and Real Madrid in second and third. But after Lyon and Paris Saint-Germain, Real Sociedad came in alongside Basque cousins Athletic Bilbao. The latter have maintained their Basque-only player policy so their place in the list is not unexpected but Real Sociead remain in the top six despite allowing foreign players since 1989. Real Sociedad have 15 players in their own squad that are homegrown and nine who are currently plying their trade in another big club in Europe. Moyes (far right) addresses his new squad, that include 15 homegrown players, at a training session last week . THREE FOR THE FUTURE . Pablo Hervías . At just 21 Pablo Hervías is one of the gems of Zubieta and he showed what confidence he has last April when he made his first team debut and tried to lob Espanyol keeper Kiko Casilla with practically his first touch in La Liga. The effort went wide but his 16-minute cameo was enough to convince Real Sociedad fans that he can push on this season. His chances have been few and far between so far as previous manager Jagoba Arasate preferred more experienced players as he clung to his job but he did give him another chance coming off the bench against Getafe and he responded with an 82nd minute goal only for Real Sociedad to then concede twice in injury time and lose the game. Comfortable on the right of the three behind the striker or playing off the left wing and shooting off of his favoured right foot he had both Real Madrid and Barcelona watching him last season and looks ready to give Moyes the dynamism he will want from his team. He is also not the only flying winger Moyes can call upon from the Real Sociedad B-team. Alain Oyarzun is also just 21 and only just behind Hervías in terms of development. Pablo Hervias (right) has made three appearances for Real Sociedad this season . Ruben Pardo . No-one has excited locals watching the young talents at Zubieta in recent years as much as Pardo who Real Madrid bid £8m for before he had even made his first team debut. Pardo won the Under-19 European Championship with Spain and looked set to become the lynchpin in Sociedad’s midfield for years to come. Aged 22 he is still yet to fulfil that enormous potential but the club showed they continue to believe in him last season when they extended his deal to 2018 and kept his £23.8m buy-out clause. He also has a special ‘anti-Athletic Bilbao’ clause set at 60m preventing the neighbours from pinching the current Spain Under-21 international. He might need to toughen up to fit Moyes’ profile of the perfect central midfielder but thanks to years on the training pitches of Zubieta all the technical qualities are in place. Ruben Pardo was the subject of an £8m bid from Real Madrid before making his first-team appearance . Joseba Zaldua . The 22-year-old right back started out as an attacking midfielder when he joined the club as a 14-year-old. He still carries a threat striding forward but has turned himself into a compact and reliable right-back. He is another who the club have tied to a contract that takes him up to 2018 and he has started nine games this season. There were suggestions in the summer that when Real Sociedad finally made their loan deal for the former Arsenal forward Carlos Vela permanent, Arsene Wenger asked after the possibility of including the young defender in the transfer. Ultimately Real Sociedad resisted, seeing the full-back as integral to the future of their defence.

"Just last week the ardent tennis fan wrote a guide to Wimbledon for Vanity Fair in her new role as contributing editor. And Pippa Middleton made sure to follow some of her own guidelines - one of which was bring an umbrella - as she arrived to take in the Andy Murray match at Queen's tennis club today. Wearing a mint green knit twinset by luxury brand Cashmere By Tania, the younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge arrived with a male friend to spend a changeable afternoon in the west London tennis club. In her new vanity Fair column last week, Pippa advised Vanity Fair readers to bring 'everything from sunblock and sunglasses to a . mackintosh and umbrella' and to wear comfortable shoes.

Pippa and Carole would have taken in a number of matches at Queen's, which is the first of Britain's grass tournaments . Pippa is of course a keen tennis fan - and wrote in Vanity Fair last week of her childhood dream of winning Wimbledon. The article saw Pippa describe the tournament as 'the highlight of my summer', and recalls her first visit to the All England Club at the age of eight. She says that she was an aspiring professional tennis player at the time, and remembers purchasing a postcard of the women's championship trophy and writing on it: 'I will win this one day.' The British weather proved as changeable as ever, forcing Carole and Pippa to take cover under a brolly .

"It was an expletive uttered by his new team-mate Thierry Henry that initially made Bojan Krkic aware that another kind of life was possible away from the suffocating madness of Barcelona. Henry, used to being in the public eye as a French World Cup winner and Arsenal legend, hadn't been at the Nou Camp long before realising the levels of adulation and pressure in Catalonia were on a totally different scale to anywhere else. 'When Thierry came, after 10 days he was like: ""F***""' recalls Bojan, whose move from La Liga to Stoke City in the summer transfer window has been one of the most eye-catching transfers of 2014. VIDEO Scroll down for Bojan Krkic scores first Stoke goal since joining from Barcelona . Bojan Krkic has revealed that he is enjoying life in England and with Stoke City . The diminutive frontman claims he loves the passion at Barcelona, but prefers life at Stoke . 'Thierry said in England it was easy, the people never came to the training ground and the journalists only visited once a week. At Barcelona, there are five thousand people at training every day, television crews filming you every day. It's totally different.' Furthermore, Henry assured his young colleague that in England, supporters didn't grab at you in the street or travel miles to wait outside your house in the hope of catching a glimpse. For Bojan, who found it hard to cope with the huge expectations placed on him after eclipsing Lionel Messi as the youngest goalscorer in Barcelona's history aged 17 years, 54 days, the exchanges with Henry were illuminating. It sowed a seed that maybe there was a future, a more pleasant future, in England. And while he could not have foreseen then that his journey would one day lead to Stoke, a place better-known around the world for pottery than football, he has no regrets. 'I love the passion at Barcelona, I have grown up in a Latin country after all, but I like it better here. In Spain, people do not respect the players, the same as in Italy,' he says. Bojan found it hard to cope with the expectations placed on him after eclipsing Lionel Messi as the youngest goalscorer in Barcelona's history aged 17 years and 54 days . Bojan burst on to the scene and reminded fans of Messi, which may have worked against him . 'In England it looks like a different world, the people admire the players but also respect them. Here is better, more tranquil.' To outsiders, the transfer of a one-time boy wonder to Stoke appears strange. Four years ago this weekend, he was involved in El Clasico when Barca thrashed Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid 5-0 in what was hailed as the greatest club performance of all-time. This Saturday, he will instead be sharpening his boots for the visit of Burnley at the Britannia. But scratch the surface and it does make more sense for the 24-year-old to have changed direction in his career as sharply as he turns defenders on the pitch. The son of a Serbian footballer whose own career ended in Spain, Bojan was inducted into Barcelona's world-famous academy at the age of nine. The 24-year-old was inducted into Barcelona's world-famous academy at the age of nine . His quicksilver feet reminded everyone of Messi – no pressure there, then – and he scored 900 goals at youth level before making his first-team debut at a younger age than the Argentine genius. Comparisons between them reached fever pitch. 'At the time. I thought I didn't feel pressure but when I look back now, I can see it is difficult for a 17-year-old boy to get by and deal with the whole situation,' admits Bojan. 'Everything changed for me overnight. A lot of my friends would still be at school and if I tried to go out with them, it would suddenly be very complicated. Bojan  is closed down by Wes Morgan of Leicester during the Premier League match in September . The Stoke forward (left) drags the ball back and leaves Spurs' Harry Kane heading for the hot dog stall . 'Fans would run up to me if I'd go through the streets, My family lived in a village rather than the city but supporters would still come to my house. One newspaper portrayed me as a superhero. 'I lost some of my childhood and that is one of the things I am most sensitive about and touched me the most. I am a family person but there were many moments I didn't haven't the chance to enjoy with them, even though I know football has given me other things.' Bojan makes it clear he is not looking for sympathy or putting out a sob-story. But it's true that everyone is hard-wired differently and while Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi coped with being in the spotlight, the softly-spoken Bojan found it difficult. - Makes his Barca debut in a 0-0 draw away to Osasuna in September 2007 less than three weeks after his 17th birthday. - Takes Lionel Messi's record as the youngest scorer in Barcelona history with a clever right-foot finish against Villarreal at the Nou Camp, aged 17 years, 54 days. - Replaces Santi Carzola for his Spanish debut at 18 in World Cup qualifier against Armenia. It remains his only Spanish cap but he has played seven times for Catalonia. - Scores a wonder goal from Xavi's pass in a 4-1 Barca win against Villarreal. Bojan put the ball to the defender's left while he ran around the other side before finishing in the corner . - Sets up the final goal for Jeffren in the best Barcelona performance ever, a 5-0 victory over Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid in El Clasico of November 2010. - Shows Stoke fans what he can do with an outstanding solo strike at Spurs in their last Premier League match, picking the ball up from near the halfway line and finishing with a 25-yard drive . Bojan (centre) runs off in celebration after scoring his first Stoke goal against Tottenham . Bojanis congratulated by team-mate Steve Sidwell after his goal at White Hart Lane . 'I grew up at Barcelona in one of the golden ages with the best players in the world. Every day we learned with the ball, and that was critical. 'But when you play with a big club, you need to get results every single day, even more when you come from the house (homegrown). It's not easy. 'Frank Rijkaard was my first coach in the first-team and I played well and scored. In my second year, they changed the trainers (to Pep Guardiola) and the chances and opportunities were different.' Rijkaard adored Bojan but under the more intense and demanding Guardiola, the little forward was gradually reduced to the role of bit-part player. There were dark rumours in Catalonia that Bojan felt he was picked on. It's not something he expands on during this interview but his words do indicate he was an unhappy footballer, eventually leaving on loan to Roma, AC Milan and Ajax between 2011 and May 2014. Bojan sealed a £3million move to Mark Hughes' side and joined former Barca team-mate Marc Muniesa . 'As an only son, it was not easy for my parents to see all the things I was going through (in Barcelona). So eventually I took the decisions I took and I was convinced I was doing the right thing.' When Stoke City made an inquiry for the fallen idol last summer, their timing was perfect – and Bojan remembered what Henry had told him about England. Encouraged that his former Barcelona team-mate Marc Muniesa was already at Stoke, he quickly said 'Yes' to manager Mark Hughes, a former striker at the Nou Camp himself. After his problems with Guardiola, the relationship with Hughes has been key. 'I don't like it when a coach puts up a big distance between himself and the players,' explains Bojan. 'He (Hughes) is very close to us and that's why I like him. Thierry Henry's words of wisdom about England helped Bojan to make the decision . 'I knew Stoke was a historic club and when I learned Mark wanted me in this team, it was a great motivation.' Off-the-field, he has settled in well, taking twice-weekly lessons to improve his already-passable English and knowing enough to use country roads from his Cheshire home to training each morning thereby avoiding the busy M6. Football-wise, it's been more of a slow burner with Hughes asking for patience from Stoke fans. But last weekend, Bojan rolled back the years to score his first goal for the club against Spurs following a brilliant solo run and low finish from 25 yards. It hints at plenty more to come. 'The first few months have been important to improve my physical condition and get used to a new league. But anyone will tell you, the more you play, the better rhythm you find,' he explains. Hughes' Stoke side find themselves in ninth-place in the Premier League with 15 points from 11 games . 'I think I have played well in some games but people will say Spurs was my best match because I scored and we won! 'I don't compare Stoke to Barcelona. Not everybody can say that they have been at Barcelona, but I don't think everyone can say, “I am a professional footballer in the Premier League.” 'English football has changed in the last 10 years, it's not so different now from Spain. If a defender goes in hard, they will be booked or sent off. 'Some of the things I did early in my career might have been forgotten now. But I know how much it cost me and that is why I feel proud. And it gives me the strength to continue. I will work to improve every day. I am only 24 and there is plenty of football ahead.'","Bojan Krkic reveals advice from Thierry Henry steered move to England .

"A Chilean college security guard has been arrested in the murder of an American graduate and ordered held in jail, an appeals court unanimously ruled on Wednesday. Erica Faith Hagan, 22, from Kentucky, had been in the southern Chilean city of Temuco on an exchange program after graduating from Georgetown College. She was working as a teaching assistant in English and religious education at the Colegio Bautista school, where her lifeless body was found in her dormitory bathtub on September 6. In custody: Domingo Cofre, 44 (left), a former security guard at the Colegio Bautista in Chile, has been arrested in connection to the murder of US graduate Erica Faith Hagan (right) Clues: DNA evidence linked Cofre to the crime scene, where the 22-year-old American psychology graduate was found bludgeoned to death with a metal rod September 6 . A week later, investigators in Chile arrested 44-year-old Domingo Cofre, a former night watchman for the Colegio Bautista, in connection to the slaying. On Wednesday, Judge Alejandro Vera ordered Cofre to remain in custody for the duration of the investigation, which is expected to take three months. Local media reported that the 22-year-old teaching assistant had apparently suffered multiple blows to her head with an iron poker. The Chilean news website Soychile.cl reported that DNA evidence found on the metal rod linked Cofre to the crime scene. Prosecutor Cristian Paredes has told El Tiempo that the injuries had ‘slashing-crushing’ elements. According to the site Emol.com, Cofre allegedly hit Hagan at least three times and then tried to start a fire in her apartment in an apparent attempt to cover up the crime. When police searched Cofre's home September 12, they reportedly found a blood-stained shoe. The footwear has been sent to a lab for testing to determine if the blood belonged to Hagan. The parents of the 22-year-old psychology graduate  traveled to the city of Temuco earlier this month to transport their daughter's body back to the United States. Erica Faith Hagan was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco September 6. Parents' worst nightmare: Bambi and Chris Hagan are pictured in Chile, where they arrived this week to transport their daughter's body back to the US . She was working as an English teacher at a secondary school in Temuco, located 450 miles south of the capital of Santiago. On Tuesday, local authorities announced that they are investigating three potential suspects in connection to Hagan's slaying. They have not been named. Roberto Garrido, a spokesperson for the Public Ministry of Chile, told the press the investigation into the killing has revealed that Ms Hagan likely knew the killer or killers and opened the door for them because officers found no signs of forced entry in her apartment, reported Soy Chile. Hagan's wounds were said to have been caused by a blunt object. AFP reported there were traces of a fire at the unit. Two separate online fundraisers have been set up to help Erica's parents with her final expenses, including the cost of transporting her remains back to the US. Well-educated: Hagan, 22, graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year . Bright future: Hagan obtained a degree in psychology with a minor in Spanish . A friend of Erica Hagan’s has launched a GoFundMe account hoping to collect $100,000, which would go toward a memorial scholarship to 'help carry on her legacy.’ Erica's older sister, Kimberly, also set up a fundraiser Monday, which has since reached - and surpassed - its goal of collecting $5,000 towards the 22-year-old's funeral expenses. ‘Its [sic] very obvious she was loved by many, she will be greatly missed and never forgotten,’ the bereaved Ms Underhill wrote. Kimberly Underhill also revealed that an FBI agent has been sent to Chile to help with the investigation into her sister’s murder. Miss Hagan graduated from Georgetown College in Kentucky earlier this year with a degree in psychology and a minor in Spanish. In July, she traveled to Chile after accepting a six-month job as a teaching assistant in English. She had visited Chile previously and was scheduled to return home in December. 'This was a phenomenal, well-loved young lady that deserved better,' said Hagan's aunt, Charlene Martin.

She was found with three head wounds in the bathtub of her apartment on the campus of Colegio Bautista of Temuco (pictured) on Saturday morning . Killed by friends? Officials in Chile revealed that Hagan likely knew her killers because her apartment showed no signs of a forced entry . Erica had been documenting her experiences of living and working abroad in her blog 'Donde en el Mundo?' (Where in the world?) Her last entry went up September 5, just two days before her violent death. In her lengthy post, Hagan discussed some instances of culture shock she had experienced in her encounters with the locals. Along with anecdotes about cultural differences between Chileans and Americans, Hagan gushed about the friendliness of the local people. 'God has blessed me with many people that care how I spend my time and don't want me to be lonely while I'm here,' she wrote. 'Everyday I meet more people that invite me to be social with them and I love it! The hardest part is for me to take them up on it by asking them to keep me company during my free time. 'Ironic I know, but I still have that southern upbringing that taught me that it's rude to invite yourself to places. In due time I guess...' Temuco is one of the country's largest cities and located near the southern boarder. A memorial service will be held this week at Georgetown College.

"The family of a British man who died in mysterious circumstances in Thailand have made an appeal for money needed to fly his body home. Sam Austin, 26, died on November 13, just weeks after flying out to Asia to start a new life, but the Thai authorities are yet to tell his distraught family how it happened.

"An Arctic blast is due to batter Britain over the next few days with temperatures expected to plunge to -7C by next week. Forecasters have also warned that strong winds and heavy rain could bring a weekend of wet weather misery to most parts of the country, triggered by the massive snowstorms in the US. The cold and wet weather has been sparked by a 'meandering' jet stream with winds of 200mph, which will allow freezing air from the Arctic to sweep across the UK. Scroll down for video . It was a foggy morning along the River Nene embankment in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire yesterday. More fog is expected as temperatures could drop to below -7C by next week . The Met Office said the distinct downward trend began last night, as recent mild temperatures were replaced with a cold snap which hit the north of England. The lowest recorded temperature was in Glascarnoch, Scotland, where temperatures dipped to a chilly -2C. Southern England managed to escape the bitter weather, with minimum temperatures in the south west remaining at around 10C. But, by Sunday night, most parts of the country will be in for a shock as temperatures again dip to around -3C, causing heavy frost on Monday morning. That cold spell will stick around for the beginning of next week, as forecasters warn temperatures in the Scottish Highlands could plummet to -7C. Simon Partridge from the Met Office said: 'There will be a far chance of frost around on Monday morning, mainly in central areas. 'It will come after a cold night on Sunday, when temperatures will be around -3C. 'But it will be nice and dry and still not far off average temperatures for this time of year. But, because of the mild weather we have been having, it will feel a lot colder.' Forecasters have warned that the snowstorms in the US, pictured is West Seneca in New York, could trigger strong winds and heavy rain across much of the country . Forecasters say the higher temperatures seen in the south last night will stick around today, with the mercury expected to reach a a balmy 15C in some parts. But a band of heavy rain will bring misery to Britain for the next 24 hours, leaving almost no part of the country dry. Downpours and strong winds will slowly sweep across the country today and tomorrow, causing an onslaught of grey and unpredictable weather. The Met Office has issued a yellow 'be aware' wet weather warning for Grampian and Central, Tayside and Fife for today and tomorrow, where up to 40mm of rain is expected to fall. There will also be a high chance of thunder in the south west tomorrow, while particularly heavy rain is expected in Wales. The only expected glimpses of sunshine will be in the north. Forecasters say that unsettled weather will continue through to Sunday, particularly in southern England. Thick fog descended on the roads in Peterborough at rush hour yesterday evening. Forecasters have warned it will be colder on Sunday night, with some frost and fog developing . It will then clear to make way for the colder weather, which could also bring a heavy dose of mist and fog. The coldest areas will be around the Wales, the West Midlands, eastern Scotland and central southern areas. But forecasters ruled out the US freeze moving to the UK, saying the cold, snowy weather will stay on the western side of the Atlantic. Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said: 'The jet stream will weaken as it moves into the Atlantic. 'When systems reach our shores, they will start to weaken due to high pressure over Russia. This three-day forecast shows how most parts of the country will be wet over the weekend, with the best chance of sunshine in the north of England and Scotland . 'Cold air in the US was one of the factors in stronger jet last winter, but there were others. There's no sign of what happened last winter being repeated this winter.' Alexi Venerus from Meteogroup said the weather looked 'unsettled' with showery outbreaks expected. Leon Brown, from The Weather Channel UK, said the whole of Britain will  start to feel much colder by the beginning of next week. He said: 'It is feeling quite cold on Sunday. It still looks like a frosty and icy start to Monday still across Wales and southern Britain with temperatures as low as -2C or -3C. 'A colder feel to the weather next week, and there will be more frosts, especially over the north.

"It may just sound like baby talk, but mothers who hold a ‘conversation’ with their infants are actually teaching them to speak more quickly. Researchers found new mothers who respond enthusiastically to their baby’s babbling are helping to speed up the child’s language development . They say parental feedback is a vital process that enables mothers and babies to become mutually engaged in ‘talking’. Mothers who communicate with their babies help speed up their speech and language development, file photo . It enhances the ability of children to communicate – unlike cases where mums did not respond attentively. A new study, by US academics at the University of Iowa (UI) and Indiana University, serves as evidence that speaking to infants at a very early age is vital for their development. The authors say parents who babble back at their newborns – even if they don’t understand what they’re trying to say – are a key part of the process. The findings challenge the belief that human communication is innate and cannot be influenced by parental feedback. Instead, the researchers argue that parents who consciously engage with their babbling infants can accelerate their children’s vocalising and language learning. Senior study author Julie Gros-Louis, assistant professor of psychology at the UI, said ‘It’s not that we found responsiveness matters. ‘It’s how a mother responds that matter.’ Researchers observed the interactions between 12 mothers and their eight-month-old infants during free play twice a month for 30 minutes over a six-month period. They noted how the mothers responded to their child’s positive vocalisations, such as babbling and cooing, especially when it was directed toward the mother. Current research in Dr Gros-Louis’s lab has found similar levels of responsiveness of mothers and fathers to infants’ babbling. Researchers discovered that infants whose mothers responded to what they thought their babies were saying showed an increase in more complex sounds, with consonant-vowel vocalisations. They say the babbling has become sophisticated enough to sound more like words to the mother. Researchers found that mothers who ignored their infants impeded their development, photo posed by models . The babies also began directing more of their babbling over time toward their mothers. However, infants whose mothers did not try as much to understand them and instead directed their infants’ attention at times to something else did not show the same rate of growth in their language and communication skills. The findings are published in the latest edition of the journal Infancy. Dr Gros-Louis says the difference was mothers who engaged with their infants when they babbled let their children know they could communicate. Consequently, those babies turned more often to their mothers and babbled. She said ‘The infants were using vocalisations in a communicative way, in a sense, because they learned they are communicative.’ In a survey a month after the study ended, mothers who were most attentive to their infants’ babbling reported their children produced more words and gestures at the age of 15 months. Last month a study from American researchers showed that exposing infants to clear vocal sounds from birth helps them distinguish language from other noises. They found that babies aged seven months can differentiate voices from other sounds - even when they cannot see the person speaking. By the age of 11 months, before they can speak themselves, the children have already learned to differentiate their mother tongue from other languages, the scientists discovered.","Mothers who interact with their babies speed up their language skills .

"'Political pressure': Ilan Ziv, who accused the BBC of 'incompetence' after they failed to show his documentary . The BBC has been accused of 'political naiveté' after dropping a controversial documentary which called into question the mass exile of Jewish people from Jerusalem in AD70 after their failed uprising against the Romans. The one-hour programme, Jerusalem: An Archaeological Mystery Story, was due to air on BBC4 last week but was scrapped at the last minute. Film maker Ilan Ziv accused the BBC of 'incompetence' and suggested they succumbed to 'conscious or subconscious political pressure' after they decided not to broadcast it. In a blog post, Mr Ziv said the decision to axe the programme was: 'Ultimately a sad saga of what I believe is a mixture of . incompetence, political naiveté, conscious or subconscious political . pressure and, I believe, a lack of courage of broadcasters . when they are faced with the complexity of the Middle East issue and the . intense emotions, fears and aggression it generates.' The Jews were expelled from Jerusalem following an uprising against the Romans, with hundreds of thousands killed and many more sent into exile. After the revolt there were still . pockets of Jews left living in Jerusalem, but the centre of gravity for . the Jewish people shifted to the Galilee. A Radio Times preview said the documentary, which questioned the scale of the exile, would have 'severe ramifications for relations in the region'. Dr Siam Bhayro, a University of Exeter senior lecturer in Early Jewish Studies, said the decision to axe the programme was 'strange', given the BBC's past record of airing controversial documentaries. And angry viewers took to the magazine's website to accuse the corporation of 'pandering to a small interest group.' Pat Heath wrote: 'Furious this has been pulled! After all the fuss last about how . ""Public interest Arguments"" for showing flagship documentary on North . Korea will be vehemently defended, but why is this quietly removed?'

Controversial documentary: Jerusalem: An Archaeological Mystery Story questioned whether the Jewish exile from Jerusalem in AD70 ever happened . The . BBC denied that the film had been dropped because it was controversial . and said it 'did not fit editorially' with a series of historical . archeology films. However, Israeli-born Mr Ziv claimed a . 'mini political storm was brewing' at the Corporation in the days . before the documentary was due to broadcast. He claims he was told that the programme was 'delayed' in going out because he had not had enough time to review the final cut of his longer 104-minute film. Television viewers were angry after the BBC scrapped the documentary which was one of the Radio Times' picks of the day. Viewers accused the Corporation of pandering to small interest groups.

Liam Loftus said: 'I agree with these comments, it looks like this show was pulled at the last minute to please some unnamed pressure group. How come unnamed groups get to dictate who and what we watch??????' Joseph Boulas added: 'Andy Marr said that, when joining the BBC, one has the ""organs of opinion formally removed"". Now I wonder if he got right what organs are removed...' Pat Heath said: 'Furious this has been pulled! After all the fuss last about how ""Public interest Arguments"" for showing flagship documentary on North Korea will be vehemently defended, but why is this quietly removed?' Meg Howarth wrote: 'The pulling of this programme reeks of censorship.' He described the situation as: 'A saga of well meaning programming executives who acquired the “courageous“ film they claim to love, believing that they can sneak it by with a “neutral title”. 'When they were “caught”, rather than face the criticism and be helped by the mountains of documents and dates I was ready to send them,  they panicked like deer in the headlights not knowing what to do and eventually raised  their hands in resignation.' Dr Bhayro said he was surprised that the BBC had decided to axe the show. ‘Although I have not seen the film, it would appear that the maker is not saying anything new - everyone knows that Jews continued to live in the Holy Land after AD70,' he said. 'But if the film maker is trying to argue that today's Palestinians are directly descended from the first century Jewish inhabitants of Judea, then his argument is deeply flawed and far too simplistic. 'Having said that, given their past record, it is precisely the sort of argument I would have expected the BBC to broadcast, so their decision is strange either way. 'After all, it is not like the BBC hasn't broadcast documentaries showing controversial points of view before. 'Indeed, it often seems like, to get a documentary on the BBC, you have to be saying something a bit bizarre or controversial - they are not really interested in the more solid, mundane or rigorous aspects of scholarship.’ Blog post: Ilan Ziv accused the BBC of 'incompetence' and suggested they succumbed 'conscious or subconscious political pressure' in this post after they axed his documentary . A Radio Times review of the programme said 'archeology is politics in the Middle East'. The reviewer added: 'The precarious . balance of Muslim, Jewish and Christian holy sites in the ancient heart . of Jerusalem is informed as much by what’s below ground as what’s above. 'Which . is why evidence revealed here, suggesting that the Jewish exile from . Jerusalem in AD 70 may never have actually happened, has such severe . ramifications for relations in the region.' The BBC showed a repeat of a documentary about Egyptologist Flinders Petrie last Thursday evening instead. A spokesman for the BBC today said they may show Mr Ziv's programme in the future. 'We . originally acquired Jerusalem: An Archaeological Mystery Story to . supplement BBC Four's season exploring the history of archaeology,' he . said. 'However, it was . decided that it did not fit editorially so we did not show the programme . as part of the season. Any future transmissions are under review.' ANALYSIS by Dr Siam Bhayro, Senior Lecturer in Early Jewish Studies, Exeter University . Jewish exodus: Painting of the Destruction of Jerusalem in 70AD by David Roberts . The ‘First Jewish War’ was a Jewish revolt against Roman rule in the Holy Land. It lasted around four years from AD66 to AD70, culminating with the conquest of Jerusalem and destruction of the Second Temple. Initially, the Romans suffered incredible losses, among the most costly the Empire ever experienced, which explains the level of retribution they meted out. It is estimated that Roman losses were at least 20,000, while Jewish losses numbered in the hundreds of thousands, with many more sold into slavery. After this war, the centre of gravity for the Jewish nation moved steadily further away from Jerusalem, ending up to the north in the Galilee. The historicity of these events is not disputed and is agreed upon by the three main monotheistic religions – Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The theological interpretations of these events may differ, but there’s no argument about the events themselves.","Film maker Ilan Ziv accuses the BBC of succumbing to political pressure .

"The history of Formula One is littered with dramatic last-day title shootouts in which legends such as Lauda, Hunt and Schumacher have put everything on the line... and all without the need to award double points. Ahead of Sunday’s showdown we look at F1’s most thrilling finales. 1950 — Monza, Italy . The first Formula One season came down to a fight between the three Fs of Alfa Romeo: Nino Farina, Juan Manuel Fangio and Luigi Fagioli. Farina, with his straight-arm driving style, led but was being harried by Fangio until his gearbox broke. Fangio rejoined the race in his team-mate Piero Taruffi’s car but was hampered by further gremlins. With Fagiolo way back in third, Farina, a qualified doctor and cavalry officer, won to become Formula One’s first champion. Nino Fabrina (pictured) won in 1950 to become Formula One's first ever champion . 1959 — Sebring, USA . Jack Brabham led the table coming into the final race but Stirling Moss, also in a Cooper T51, was just 5.5 points behind after winning the previous two grands prix. Ferrari’s Tony Brooks was also in contention. Moss, who had taken pole, retired with a broken gearbox. Brooks was bumped on the first lap and took a long pit stop. It was all clear for Brabham to win the race and the title. But he ran out of fuel. He got out and pushed the car over the line for fourth. It was enough for the championship, too. Jack Brabham pushed his car over the line to win the Driver's Championship in 1959 . 1964 — Mexico City, Mexico . John Surtees became the only man to win a world championship on two and four wheels. His rivals were Graham Hill, who headed the standings, and Jim Clark, who needed to win the race. Hill was running third, enough for the title, but he collided with Lorenzo Bandini and his hopes were dashed. Clark, who started on pole, was driving brilliantly at the front only for his Lotus to start leaking oil, eventually forcing him to stop. Bandini let his Ferrari team-mate Surtees through for second — and history. John Surtees is still the only man to have won a world championship on both two and four wheels . 1976 — Fuji, Japan . ‘By all the laws of humanity,’ wrote James Hunt on the front page of the following day’s Daily Mail, ‘I should not be motor racing champion of the world.’ It had been an insane climax to an insane season. Ferrari’s Niki Lauda had almost burned to death at the Nurburgring, allowing Hunt to narrow the gap during the Austrian’s recuperation. It came down to Fuji. The weather was so bad that Lauda retired after one lap. Hunt carried on, took third and the title. James Hunt (left) was involved in a tense battle for the 1976 championship with rival Niki Lauda (right) 1984 — Estoril, Portugal . The closest race ever in numerical terms, Niki Lauda beating McLaren team-mate Alain Prost by half a point. Prost won the race, equalling Jim Clark’s record of seven wins in a season (although when the championship started in 1950 there were just six grands prix in Europe as well as the Indianapolis race). But Lauda, helped by Nigel Mansell spinning off, came second and that was enough for his third and final title. Lauda celebrates after winning the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch in July, 1984 . 1986 — Adelaide, Australia . All seemed under control for Nigel Mansell — he was in third place, enough to beat his title rivals Nelson Piquet and Alain Prost. But on lap 64 at Dequetteville Terrace his tyre blew violently. ‘Look at that,’ exclaimed Murray Walker on the BBC. Mansell somehow kept his Williams out of the wall but his race was over. Prost became world champion but Mansell consoled himself with becoming ‘People’s Champion’ and BBC Sports Personality of the Year. Left to right: Ayrton Senna, Alain Prost, Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet pose for the cameras in 1986 . 1994 — Adelaide . A bitter day that, rightly or wrongly, shaped the reputation of Michael Schumacher as a dirty fighter. The German, who started the race one point ahead of Damon Hill, hit the wall in his Benetton. This allowed Hill to get alongside Schumacher, who then turned his car in on the British favourite. Both men were out of the race, making Schumacher champion. Michael Schumacher celebrates with his team manager Flavio Briatore after winning the 1994 championship . 1997 — Jerez, Spain . Schumacher was again cast as villain. He turned in on Jacques Villeneuve at Dry Sack corner, but this time it did not work for him. Schumacher ended up beached in the gravel, Villeneuve survived and took third and the title. Schumacher was disqualified from the championship and admitted he regretted the incident — a rare mea culpa. Canadian driver Jacques Villeneuve gets out of his Williams-Renault F1 car at the Jerez circuit in Spain in 1997 . 2008 — Sao Paulo, Brazil . Perhaps the most dramatic final day of all. In spitting rain, Felipe Massa of Ferrari crossed the line first. Lewis Hamilton needed to finish fifth or better to win the title but the Briton was sixth as Massa won. But in the next few seconds, Hamilton passed Toyota’s Timo Glock, who was struggling on slick tyres on the wet track. News of Hamilton’s late surge was relayed to the Massa family, who were already celebrating in the Ferrari garage. Their faces fell. Hamilton won the title and Massa, in front of his home support, conducted himself graciously in numbing defeat. Lewis Hamilton celebrates in Sao Paolo in 2008, after winning the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos . 2012 — Sao Paulo . Poor Fernando Alonso, who lost out on the title on the final day of the season for the third time. The hero of the day was Sebastian Vettel. The left side of his Red Bull was severely bruised in a collision with Bruno Senna on the fourth corner of the race. Ferrari’s Alonso, trailing by 13 points at the start, finished second. Vettel, in a superior car, fought back doggedly to sixth. It was enough for his third title at the young age of 25. Sebastian Vettel won his third Driver's Championship in a row at Sao Paolo in 2012 .","The history of Formula One is littered with dramatic finales .

"MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . Vincent Tan has torn into Wigan Athletic, accusing ‘a racist chairman of hiring a racist manager’ as the storm involving Dave Whelan and Malky Mackay escalated. On a day when the Football Association launched an investigation into comments made this week by 77-year-old Whelan — who could yet find himself banned from his own club — Cardiff City’s Malaysian owner delivered his damning verdict. Tan, having already been branded a ‘Chink’ by Mackay in the exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist messages revealed by Sportsmail in August, has taken particular exception to Wigan chairman Whelan trying to justify his new manager’s use of the term. VIDEO Scroll down for Dave Whelan apologising on Sky Sports for controversial interview . Wigan boss Malky Mackay (left) and Dave Whelan have been called racist by Cardiff owner Vincent Tan . Cardiff owner Vincent Tan (left) has blasted Mackay - the pair worked together at the Welsh outfit . The Scotsman took charge of his first Wigan training session on Thursday morning . Tan also criticised Whelan for using derogatory comments about Jews — as well as the word ‘Chink’ to describe Chinese people — in an interview with The Guardian. Whelan has apologised and says he was misrepresented, although initial plans by Wigan to release a statement on Friday were abandoned after Tan’s attack. ‘This is a racist chairman hiring a racist manager,’ Tan told the BBC. ‘I hope that stops at two racists in Wigan, not snowballing to 2,000 or 20,000 racists in Wigan. I think he (Whelan) insulted the dignity of all Jewish people. I think he insulted the dignity of Chinese.’ On Friday, the FA confirmed an investigation had been launched into Whelan. ‘The FA is very concerned to read about the comments that have been attributed to Dave Whelan,’ said the governing body in a statement. ‘We take all forms of discrimination seriously. As with all such cases, this will be dealt with as a priority. The investigation is already under way and The FA’s Governance Division have written to Mr Whelan. He has three working days to respond.’ How the Daily Mail exposed and covered the continuing scandal over Mackay's inappropriate texts . The Scottish manager was fortunate to be given another chance in football following the fallout . Mackay appears in good spirits during his first training session with Wigan . Sportsmail understands the punishment for Whelan could be severe, even if officials at Wembley struggle to find a precedent. Players found guilty of racism on the field face a minimum five-match ban. When it comes to a club official the FA might yet point to the case of Northumberland FA official John Cummings, who recently received a four-month ban for telling a female referee her place should be in the kitchen. If the FA follow that path, Whelan could be banned from the stadium that is named in his honour. But then anti-racism group Kick It Out has already questioned whether Whelan is a ‘fit and proper person’ to run a club. Tan stressed the need for the FA to take action against Mackay too, even as Wembley officials continue to wrestle with the issue of public and private communication. Malaysian businessman Tan poses with Mackay after winning the Championship title with Cardiff City . Kitchen company Premier Range ended their sponsorship deal with Wigan over Mackay's appointment . Tan has warned the FA that the 'whole world is watching' their investigation . Mackay was appointed manager of Wigan despite being under investigation by the FA because of the emails and text messages he exchanged with former Cardiff head of recruitment Iain Moody. Tan says he hopes the FA ‘considers carefully’ the case of Mackay amid claims, in particular by Whelan, that the 42-year-old Scot is likely to escape action. ‘If that is true and if the FA is taking this matter lightly, I must say I am very disappointed,’ said Tan. ‘The FA must understand that the whole world is watching.’ Tan cited the case of Donald Sterling, the ex-owner of American basketball team the LA Clippers. Sterling was forced to sell the club by the NBA after making racist comments to his girlfriend. ‘Will (the FA) be a regulator on football matters with teeth or a toothless regulator?’ asked Tan. Whelan's decision to hand Mackay a return to football has been widely criticised . Whelan, who has already seen one major sponsor part company with the club, also came under fire from leading members of the Jewish community. Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said Whelan’s comments were ‘outrageous and offensive and bring the club and game into disrepute’. Arkush said Whelan’s apology was ‘half-hearted’. Arkush said: ‘His apology does not go far enough. You cannot insult a whole group of people, and then say, “I would never insult them”, and hope that’s OK. ‘We need to see a proper apology and full recognition of the offence caused. Whelan has a responsibility to set the tone for his players and supporters. Racism and anti-Semitism will prevail on and off the pitch if it’s acceptable and unchallenged in the boardroom. ‘We will be taking up the matter with the FA and Kick It Out.’ There was support for Whelan from Hull boss Steve Bruce, who worked under him at Wigan, and insisted he is not a racist. Wigan captain Emmerson Boyce also welcomed Mackay’s appointment in his column in the Wigan Evening Post. ‘Looking at Malky’s record, Wigan have hit the jackpot in getting him here,’ Boyce said. ‘People make mistakes, things happen, and if he can get us promoted I’m sure people will be talking about the positives rather than the negatives.’ Whelan risks ostracising himself from football after his outburst about Jews .

"Dave Whelan blundered into a race storm after appointing Malky Mackay this week but there may be a power-shift already under way behind the scenes at Wigan Athletic. Whelan has long cherished a vision for his grandson to take over at the helm and 23-year-old David Sharpe is increasingly influential at the club this season.

Whelan has spoken openly about his desire to keep the club in the family when he steps aside and has resisted selling out abroad. ‘The time comes for everyone when you need to retire or take a step back because you’re simply not what you used to be,’ said Whelan, in an interview with FC Business, three years ago.

I’m inclined to let him have a go and I hope that it happens.’ Wigan say there are no imminent plans for Whelan to step down, but Sharpe’s involvement has increased since Sharpy’s, the fish and chip restaurant he managed near the DW Stadium, closed earlier this year.

"A Colorado boy's mother led him to believe he was cancer-stricken and was used by her to raise at least $25,000, investigators said - and now she has pleaded guilty to fraud. Sandy Thi Nguyen pleaded guilty to both child abuse and charitable fraud charges Friday, The Denver Post reported, Friday, with her sentencing set for a November date. Scroll down for video . Faker: Sandy Thi Nguyen, pictured, pleaded guilty to fraud. She reportedly ran a scheme saying her son had cancer in order to obtain thousands of dollars . Scam: Nguyen used $16,000 and also took her family on a Disneyland trip, the Arapahoe County Sheriff's said . The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said in a March release 'it was discovered that [Nguyen] did convince her son, family and community that her 6-year-old had cancer and was receiving cancer treatment since approximately September 2012.' One year later, 'over $25,000' was gathered by Aurora residents, the sheriff's office said. However, the sheriff's office revealed that 'Over the last several months, Ms. Nguyen accepted at least $16,000.00 from that account as well as a trip to Disneyland for herself and her family, which was paid for by the donated funds.' $23,000 was found inside her home 'and in a subsequent interview, [Nguyen] admitted that her son does not have cancer, and stated that some of the money recovered was from donations received,' the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said. Bogus: The story of Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race . Hoax: Nguyen allegedly falsely posted online a list of cancer treatments for her son . Nguyen's son, in excerpts of an arrest affidavit published by CBS Denver, said 'he believes he has cancer and is going to die' and was under the impression he received nightly chemotherapy treatments. The boy also revealed 'his mom shaves his head every morning before school,' according to the published excerpts. 7NewsDenver reported  Nguyen's 'cancer-stricken' son was also heavily featured in a charity race, and that she posted 'updates' on his treatment online. The principal of the boy's school, Darla Thompson, said in a letter published by the station 'We are deeply troubled by these allegations and saddened to learn that an adult may have taken advantage of an innocent child and our school community.' 'But the allegations do not, in any way, diminish the concern and support demonstrated by the Rolling Hills community for a child believed to be facing a life-threatening challenge. 'It is important for our community to continue to show support and compassion for this child, who is also a victim in this case. The child was wrongfully led to believe that he was ill, and he was not responsible for the parent’s alleged actions.'","Sandy Thi Nguyen led her 6-year-old son to believe he was cancer-stricken and was used by her as a way to raise at least $25,000, investigators said .

"Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has confirmed the club have opened contract talks with full-back Nathaniel Clyne. Clyne has been one of Saints' stand-out performers this season and has enhanced his growing reputation this week with impressive displays for England against Slovenia and Scotland. The 23-year-old's contract will expire in the summer of 2016 and Southampton are eager to tie him down before the deal runs into its final year. Nathaniel Clyne (left) made his international debut against Slovenia earlier this month . The 23-year-old has been in good form during Southampton's impressive start to the season . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has confirmed the club have opened talks over a new deal for Clyne . 'I know Clyney's contract has one year left after this season so it's normal to do something now to keep that player,' Koeman said. 'Have those talks already started? Of course, you cannot wait until next season.' He continued: 'I have had conversations with (executive director) Les Reed about the contracts of the players. 'We want to keep everyone and I am not surprised about Clyne's performances for the national team. 'He is a fantastic player which he has showed since the start of the season. 'If there is interest, we will hear about that and we will try everything to keep him here because he is fantastic football player.' The full-back impressed for England in their 3-1 Euro 2016 qualifier win over Slovenia . He enhanced his growing reputation further with a solid performance in the victory against Scotland . Southampton spent most of last summer fielding enquiries for their talented squad and another player set to spark interest again in January is Morgan Schneiderlin. The midfielder appeared non-committal on his Saints future when he told French newspaper L'Equipe during the international break that he wanted to play for a 'big club'. 'I say nothing about his future because he is a Southampton player,' Koeman said. 'I also know - I had that experience as a player - that when you go back to play for your national team you do interviews and they make it a bit different and then it comes back to England and it is a big story. 'He is a Southampton player and he is focused on Aston Villa on Monday.' Schneiderlin returned from international duty with a groin injury but Koeman is hopeful the 25-year-old will be available for the clash at Villa Park. Morgan Schneiderlin continues to be linked with a move away from Southampton in the January window . The midfielder (right) was in action for France during the international break . Steven Davis is a doubt with a hamstring problem sustained against Leicester but Dusan Tadic is fit again. Southampton face a difficult Christmas period with games against Manchester City, Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea all to come before the end of the year. Koeman, however, insists his team will not change their style of play against the league's tougher opponents. 'It's always easier to keep winning when the start is positive,' Koeman said. 'The belief the players have is important to win games and in my opinion the most important thing is we keep our way of playing.

"Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock fully expects to go up against a strong Liverpool side in London on Sunday despite the Reds' recent struggles. Liverpool are travelling to Selhurst Park in the midst of a three-match losing streak in all competitions. Brendan Rodgers' side last won in the league in a 3-2 triumph at QPR on October 19 and have collected just one point since.

Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and now could be out until next year . Goals have been in short supply this season for the Merseysiders since the departure of striker Luis Suarez to Barcelona. Daniel Sturridge is the only striker to have hit the back of the net for Liverpool in the league this season. 'I wish I had their problems,' Warnock said. 'They have world-class players in every position. 'You just have to look at the strikers they have, two of them I quite like myself. 'I think (Mario) Balotelli is a fantastic player, Rickie (Lambert) is good, too. They have different qualities.' Palace, meanwhile, have lost four of their last five league games, including a 1-0 defeat at Manchester United before the international break. Warnock is hoping his side can rise to the occasion and clinch their first win since a 2-0 triumph at home to Leicester on September 27, their only league victory at Selhurst Park so far. 'We know we are going to have to play extremely well,' Warnock said. 'I just want us to cause them problems. 'It's going to be a great game. They have very good players and it's another opportunity for us to prove ourselves against a strong team. 'We just have to be ready, we must focus on ourselves and play our own game.

Dwight Gayle celebrates with Yannick Bolasie after a 3-0 comeback ends Liverpool's title hopes last season . The Eagles trailed Liverpool 3-0 last season at Selhurst Park but fought back to earn a 3-3 draw. 'I watched that game again last week and it was amazing,' Warnock said. 'Liverpool could have been 7-0 ahead because Suarez missed so many chances, it was so exciting and a great game, it's why we love football. 'Our defence will have to put in another convincing display like it did at Manchester United, that is vital. 'We also need to create a bit more ourselves. It is all about finding that happy medium.' Palace have scored just five goals in five home league games and Warnock wants his players to be more clinical in attack. 'We need to create a little bit more,' Warnock said. 'Teams perhaps have found us a little bit predictable so far. 'We've had easy opportunities in the past games and we haven't been able to put them away. 'But you cannot feel sorry for yourself. We have eight games until January and we must score more goals. We have a good group.

"Brendan Rodgers insists there will be no lingering scars as Liverpool prepare for a first return to the stadium where their title hopes imploded. Crystal Palace's extraordinary comeback in May at Selhurst Park, when they pulled back a three goal deficit to draw 3-3, left Liverpool's players shattered and effectively extinguished any chance Rodgers had of leading the club to their first title since 1990. Liverpool go back to South London in a completely different vein of form, having only won one of their last six matches, and Rodgers needs to stop the rot. He has no concerns that what happened five months ago will have an effect, even though some critics say his squad haven't recovered.

The result left former Liverpool striker Luis Suarez in tears as the club's title hopes were shattered . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard consoles Suarez, now of Barcelona, after the game . 'Our objective that night was to win the game,' said Rodgers. 'We were 1-0 up and then got a quick couple of goals after half-time. The excitement then took over and we maybe thought we could cutback Manchester City's goal difference. But the damage was done in the Chelsea game. 'On reflection after the game, I was proud of them for actually getting into that position in the league after I had got over the frustration and disappointment. The players are giving me everything. We just hope we can find that extra one per cent. Once we get confidence, the wins will flow.'

'I am happy to be here for as long as possible like the big names that are on that wall. I am just happy to play football at this football club for many years to come. 'The club has spoken to my representatives and hopefully something can be done really soon. I thought we played well at times against Chelsea in our last match. We just need one result to kick us on. Hopefully it will be Palace on Sunday.'","Liverpool threw away a three-goal lead to draw 3-3 against Palace in May .

"As a model, Clare-Alana Ford has to hold hard, angular poses for long periods. But she can go weak and floppy at any moment due to a rare muscle condition – just like a real-life rag doll. Ms Ford, 22, from Hayling Island, Hampshire, suffers from a bizarre condition that makes her body go limp and weak without warning. The incurable condition, often nicknamed the rag doll disease, can cause Ms Ford to lose all control of her voluntary muscles, such as those in her legs and arms. Scroll down for video . Clare-Alana Ford, 22 has forged a successful career as a model (left), despite suffering from a rare muscle condition which makes her go weak and floppy at any moment. She had surgery to remove her thymus gland in 2013 (pictured right) and is waiting to see if it has been successful . Ms Ford says sometimes she will attempt to do her hair and make up, but her arms will go limp and floppy . Despite her 'rag doll' condition - known as myasthenia gravis – she has worked hard to forge a successful modelling career . But despite her rag doll condition - known as myasthenia gravis – Ms Ford has managed to forge a successful modelling career. Clare-Alana said: 'Sometimes I will go to put my hair up and suddenly my arms will just go limp and flop down to my side. 'I've been walking along the road before and my legs will just give way, and there's nothing I can do. 'It's a condition that improves with rest so I have to talk breaks when I'm doing activity. 'It sounds strange but it's just like a rag doll. 'It can be difficult as I get very tired, but I refuse to be a slave to my condition. 'I love modelling and I've been able to be successful despite my health issues. 'I'll always do my best and I'll never let it affect how well I do on a shoot. 'I won't let my condition define me.' Ms Ford began to model at the age of 17 - just as she began to experience her unusual symptoms. She said: 'A friend of mine was looking for people to model some dresses for a show during London Fashion Week. 'I thought it sounded like fun, so I told her I'd do it. Myasthenia gravis is a rare long-term condition that causes certain muscles to become weak. It mainly affects muscles that are controlled voluntarily –often those controlling eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, swallowing and talking. Sometimes, the muscles that control breathing, neck and limb movements are also affected. The muscle weakness associated with myasthenia gravis is usually worse during physical activity and improves with rest. It is an autoimmune condition that affects the nerves and muscles. Autoimmune conditions are caused by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. In myasthenia gravis, the immune system produces antibodies (proteins) that block or damage muscle receptor cells. This prevents messages being passed from the nerve endings to the muscles, which results in the muscles not contracting (tightening) and becoming weak. It is not fully understood why some people's immune systems produce antibodies that attack the muscle receptor cells. Source: NHS Choices . 'But at around the same time I started to get very tired easily and weak for no reason at all - I was terrified I'd fall over on the runaway in front of everyone. 'I was very active and I did ballet, so I thought I was just doing too much. 'I was nervous but I loved the experience of modelling, and I decided to embark on it professionally. 'Then I remember once my legs just totally gave way and I felt like a weight was pushing down on me and I couldn't get up.' At first the doctor told her she was suffering from growing pains, but she pushed for further tests. Eventually she was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, an uncommon condition which affects about 15 in every 100,000 people s in the UK. Ms Ford said: 'At first the doctor told me it was growing pains, but I knew it was something more so I pushed for further tests. 'Eventually I was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis - I'd never even heard of it before. 'It was very scary and such a shock to be diagnosed with something so foreign to myself, and something that even medical professionals knew little about, but I was determined to carry on with my life as normal.' Ms Ford has continued to model, and even had surgery last year in the hope of treating her condition. She said: 'I had surgery in July 2013 to remove my thymus gland, as there is some evidence that this can help kick start the condition into remission and aid symptoms. 'It can take up to three years to see improvement so I have a little while yet. 'For now I'm taking medication and I'm trying not to let it affect me too much. 'It can be hard as the condition is invisible, so often people don't realise if I'm having a particularly bad with it. 'People can be quite insensitive at times because of their ignorance about the condition and I'm often mistaken for being lazy which is very upsetting. 'Stress can play a big factor in worsening the symptoms so I try to stay cool and not let things affect me too much. Ms Ford is able to model but has to take breaks, as her condition improves with rest . Now she has become a successful model, Ms Ford won't let anything hold her back . As her agency is based in London, she says travelling back and forth on the tube can be 'daunting' with all the stairs and crowds . 'Sometimes I've had to pass up jobs as I've been ill - I had the opportunity to model for Harrods but I was too unwell to accept it, and I turned down the chance to model in Thailand as I was having surgery. 'My agency is based in London so traveling back and forth can sometimes be daunting and scary - the idea of facing the tube on a casting day is mortifying for me with all the stairs and the crowds. 'It's hard sometimes to miss out on things, but it just makes me more determined to get better. I won't let anything hold me back.' Ruth Ingledew, CEO of Myasthenia charity, Myaware, said: 'Myasthenia Gravis is a neuromuscular condition which affects the transmission of messages from nerves to muscles. 'The brain can tell a muscle that it wants to, for example, lift up an arm, but the more the message tries to get through, the message gets weaker and weaker, until eventually the arm can't lift up anymore. 'Initially it can affect the facial muscles so often people are misdiagnosed with a stroke. 'We don't know what triggers myasthenia gravis, but women tend to be diagnosed in their 20s and 30s, whilst men are diagnosed in their 40s and 50s - our figures suggest that there around 10 to 12,000 people with the condition in the UK. 'In the past, myasthenia gravis could be fatal, but these days there are medications that work very well, and people can go on to lead happy, normal lives. 'If people want any support or information about the condition, we have a great website and a Facebook page that sufferers of all ages will find useful.'

"David Cameron has been urged by a Labour MP to give Dave Whelan's donation to the Conservative Party of £1.5million to charity in light of the Wigan owner's 'anti-Semitic and racist' remarks. Labour MP Karl Turner has written to the prime minister to suggest it would be more fitting the money Whelan has given to the Tories since 2007 be distributed to charities. Whelan has been forced to apologise for comments he made following the appointment of Malky Mackay, who is being investigated by the FA after Sportsmail revealed the 42-year-old sent and received racist, sexist and homophobic texts while he was manager of Cardiff City. THE LETTER Scroll down to read Labour MP Karl Turner's letter in full to David Cameron . Malky Mackay was unveiled at a press conference with owner Dave Whelan at the DW Stadium on Wednesday . Whelan, 77, caused a stir over his appointment of Mackay as the new Wigan manager earlier this week . Turner calls on Cameron to ‘personally condone or condemn’ the 77-year-old’s comments, with Whelan’s most recent contribution £100,000 in August 2014. Whelan sparked outrage on Thursday, making extraordinarily offensive remarks about Jewish people and the Chinese while defending his appointment of Mackay. 'The Jews don't like losing money,' Whelan said. 'Nobody likes losing money. Do you think Jewish people chase money a little bit more than we do? 'I think they are very shrewd people. It's telling the truth. Jewish people love money, English people love money; we all love money. 'If any Englishman said he has never called a Chinaman a ""chink"" he is lying. There is nothing bad about doing that. It's like calling the British Brits or the Irish paddies.' Turner, a Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, writes in his letter that Cameron’s leadership should be questioned if he fails to 'act swiftly in this matter'. 'Given his status as a significant contributor to your re-election efforts you must now make it clear if you personally condone or condemn these comments. 'I hope that you agree with me that these anti-Semitic and racist comments have no place in modern British society, and as such I hope that you also agree with me that you must now give up any money that you have received from Mr Whelan and consider which charitable groups would be better recipients of it. 'Failure to act swiftly in this matter will show a lack of leadership. It will not be possible for you to simultaneously condemn offensive remarks while accepting large sums of money from those responsible for them.'

"Alan Pardew believes Joey Barton could follow him with a career in the dugout – but admits he won’t go away quietly whatever he does. The 32-year-old returns to St James’ Park for the first time on Saturday after leaving for Queens Park Rangers three years ago. Barton has since been critical of the ownership and hierarchy at the club but remains in contact with his old boss. Joey Barton returns to St James' Park on Saturday for the first time since leaving for QPR three years ago . Barton's former boss Alan Pardew says the midfielder could go into management when he retires . The 32-year-old heads the ball clear as QPR prepare for Saturday's clash with in-form Newcastle . And Pardew says he was amused rather than agitated by the midfielder’s forthright views on every subject. ‘If you work with Joey he has got an opinion on everything and he likes to express that,’ revealed Pardew. ‘He always made me laugh, or made me think. I didn't 100 per cent categorically disagree with him, but he has an opinion and you have got to admire that and I really enjoyed working with him - I had a great relationship with him.’ As for the future? ‘Joey isn't going to go away quietly,’ admits Pardew. ‘I am sure he has got a plan and I think he could go down (the management route). Barton spent four seasons at Newcastle and played under Pardew in the 2010-11 campaign . Pardew issues instructions to his players during a training session on Thursday . ‘But I think he gets overlooked for what a good player he is. In terms of his tweeting and everything else he does, none of that bothers me, it is what he does on the pitch that matters and he does it very well.’ Barton returned to action following injury during QPR’s 2-2 draw with Manchester City earlier this month. That point took Harry Redknapp’s side to within one of safety, but their record on the road remains played five, lost five. Pardew, though, is confident that his opposite number will emerge from the drop zone he himself populated until four wins on the spin. Steven Taylor (left), Cheik Tiote (centre) ad Rolando Aarons are out through their paces on Thursday . ‘Harry’s CV and reputation speak for themselves – he’s been there and done it. He knows that his team is playing well,’ said the United manager. ‘When I was under a difficult spell, just before the big disappointment at Southampton (4-0 defeat), we were terrific but didn’t win a game. ‘I think that’s where QPR are. They are better than the position they are in and we’ll see that. ‘We won’t be surprised to get a tough game. I think there will be goals, hopefully we’ll get one more than them. Sammy Ameobi (left) and Remy Cabella (right) prepare for Saturday's visit of QPR . Pardew, who is expecting a tough game aganist Harry Redknapp's side, joins in with Thursday's session . ‘But I always enjoy Harry’s teams. They play to win, like my teams, and are always on the front foot with flair.’ Newcastle, meanwhile, could enter the top four with a sixth straight victory in all competitions. It was back in 2012 that the Magpies finished fifth, although Pardew feels this team is more about pace on the break compared to the domination of that vintage. ‘This is a different squad and it has not got the experience of that team,’ he said. ‘Possession was the key to that team and this is slightly different. We can still win games, but we do not control the game in terms of possession. ‘Instead, we have some real assets in the team in terms of pace and exuberance.’","Joey Barton played under Alan Pardew at Newcastle before joining QPR .

"Nos 50-41: Includes Albert Luque, David Ngog and Claudio Pizarro. Nos 40-31: Includes Rolando Bianchi, Helder Postiga and Andriy Voronin. The centre forward: The leader from the front, the No 9, the provider, the talisman, the goalscorer. Since 1992, the Premier League has been blessed with the best, from homegrown talents Alan Shearer and Andy Cole, to foreign imports Tony Yeboah and Thierry Henry, but unfortunately there have also been some major disappointments. Whether failing to justify their huge price tag, or just incapable of hitting a barn door, there have been some dreadful forwards. As we build-up to the return of the Premier League following the international break. Sportsmail runs you through Nos 30-21 of the worst strikers to have ever played in the division... do you agree? 30) Diego Forlan (Manchester United) He may have been a cult hero with Manchester United fans following his £6.9million transfer from Argentine club Independiente in January 2002, but the Uruguayan simply did not take to life in the Premier League - and it took him an incredible 27 games to get off the mark! It seems strange that such a talented footballer - who has excelled for Uruguay, Villarreal and Atletico Madrid, among others - struggled so desperately at Old Trafford, but sometimes the face simply does not fit. Rather amusingly, Forlan was told to wear longer studs in order to get greater grip in the pitch but Sir Alex Ferguson discovered he was failing to follow orders and he was promptly marched towards the exit door in 2004 having scored just 10 in 63 Premier League games. Diego Forlan moved to Manchester United from Independiente for £6.9million in January 2002 but failed to adapt to the Premier League . Forlan (left) is held back by Anthony Gardner of Spurs during a match in March 2004 at Old Trafford . The Uruguayan forward managed just 10 games in 63 Premier League games for United during a three-year spell at the club . 29) Sergei Rebrov (Tottenham Hotspur) Tottenham Hotspur supporters thought they were getting the real deal when Rebrov arrived for £11m from Dynamo Kiev in May 2000 - but they didn't anticipate how much of a struggle it would be for Ukrainian to adjust to the English style of play. Despite being the man who was supposed to bridge the gap to north London rivals Arsenal, all Rebrov managed in four years at White Hart Lane was 10 goals in 60 Premier League matches as he was frozen out by Glenn Hoddle. He moved to West Ham United, then in the Championship, and netted just once at Upton Park before returning to his native country where he has gone on to become the highest scorer in the history of the Ukrainian Premier League. Sergei Rebrov moved to Tottenham Hotspur for £11m in May 2000 from Dynamo Kiev but struggled to adapt to English football . The Ukrainian (left) is held off by Martin O'Connor of Birmingham City in July 2000 at St Andrew's . Rebrov went back to his native country and became the highest scorer in the history of the Ukrainian Premier League . 28) Andreas Lund (Wimbledon) Just as everything was going down the swanny for Wimbledon and they thought it couldn't possibly get any worse they only went and splashed £2.5m to bring Andreas Lund from Molde in 2000. The Norwegian forward's striking ability, much like the unfortunately-doomed club's future, was non-existent and he managed just two Premier League goals in 12 games. To be fair those strikes came against Chelsea and Arsenal, but 6ft 2in Lund's lack of mobility and shyness in front of goal meant he was quickly shipped back to Norway and Dons fans no longer had to sigh whenever the big man received the ball. Andreas Lund signed for Wimbledon from Molde for £2.5m in 2000 but his striking ability was essentially non-existent . Lund, pictured holding off Mikael Silvestre of Manchester United, scored just two goals in 12 Premier League games for the Dons . 27) Andreas Andersson (Newcastle United) Newcastle United fans are lucky to have witnessed the likes of Alan Shearer, Peter Beardsley and Les Ferdinand grace the St James' Park pitch down the years - but they were also forced to endure the painful experience of watching Andreas Andersson try to be a Premier League striker. Andersson arrived on Tyneside from AC Milan for £2m in 1998 but the Swedish forward was utterly hopeless. He scored just four Premier League goals in 27 appearances and was sent back to Swedish side AIK after only one season in England. He was so bad in fact that Newcastle fans only really remember him for the blond locks and ridiculous hairband he sported. Andreas Andersson sported blond locks and a ridiculous hairdband at Newcastle United during his unsuccessful spell on Tyneside . Andersson, falling over in the penalty area against Sheffield United, managed just four goals in 27 Premier League games . 26) Martin Dahlin (Blackburn Rovers) The 1993 Swedish Player of the Year moved to Lancashire for £2.5m from Roma in 1997 having bagged 10 goals in 19 games while on loan at Borussia Monchengladbach the season before. Highly-praised during the 1992 European Championship for Sweden, Dahlin's time at Blackburn Rovers was decimated by a training ground injury - which eventually forced him to retire - and he is remembered as a big disappoitnment. A mere four goals arrived in 27 Premier League appearances during his two years at Blackburn before he was forced to hang up his boots. His is one of the sadder stories. Martin Dahlin (centre), sent off for Blackburn Rovers against Everton in 1998, struggled in England due to injury . The Swede managed just four goals in 27 Premier League appearances after suffering an injury on the training pitch . 25) Michele Padovano (Crystal Palace) When a £1.7m striker (a big sum for Palace in 1997) fails to appear in more than two consecutive games, it tells you all you really need to know about their time in south London. Padovano signed for  Palace from Juventus - or more accurately their reserve side - and he arrived in England hopelessly out of shape and woefully out of form. When the Eagles were relegated, the Italian flew off to Metz having scored just once in 12 Premier League matches - only to return to reportedly collect the £1m worth of wages he believed the club, who were battling against financial meltdown, owed him. Maybe he should have thought about scoring more and keeping Palace up - then he may even have received a pay rise! Michele Padovano (right), arguing with Phil Gilchrist of Oxford United in August 1998, scored just one in 12 Premier League games . The former Palace striker (right), being tackled by Tottenham Hotspur's Sol Campbell, reportedly returned to the club for unpaid wages . 24) Lee Dong-gook (Middlesbrough) The South Korean was so hopeless he couldn't get anywhere near the Middlesbrough squad for four months, and this at a time when they were beginning to really struggle in the top flight. Lee moved to Boro on a free transfer from Pohang Steelers in 2006 and during his 18 months on Teesside it appears he set about attempting to ensure he would be on the list of the Premier League's worst ever strikers... Here's how you sum up Lee: 23 league appearances, zero goals. He was simply dreadful. Lee Dong-gook played 23 times for Middlesbrough in the Premier League but failed to score a single goal for the club . Dong-gook arrived on a free transfer from Pohang Steelers in 2006 and spent 18 months on Teesside before moving on . The South Korean, pictured against Portsmouth in December 2007, was so bad he couldn't get near Boro's first team for four month . 23) Viorel Moldovan (Coventry City) The Romanian cost a hefty £3.25m from Grasshoppers in 1998 and, during his exceptionally short stay in the west Midlands, he proved to be an extreme pain in the backside for Coventry City boss Gordon Strachan. Moldovan allegedly criticised Strachan's capabilities as a manager and also the qualities of the rest of his side - forgetting the adage that people in glass houses should not throw stones. He netted just twice in 10 Premier League appearances before heading for Turkey - much to the relief of Strachan and Sky Blues fans - just months after signing. Viorel Moldovan proved to be an extreme pain in the backside for Coventry City boss Gordon Strachan during his time in the west Midlands . The Romanian striker (right), challenging for the ball with Tottenham's Campbell in April 1998, was hopeless at Coventry . 22) Andrea Silenzi (Nottingham Forest) One of the very first Italians to grace the Premier League, Silenzi is not quite remembered in the same sort of bracket as the likes of Gianfranco Zola or Gianluca Vialli. 'Big Brush' Silenzi arrived at Nottingham Forest for £1.8m in 1995 from Torino as a 6ft 3in striker with a big reputation yet he looked anything but a player who could play up front. He was slow, lackadaisical and generally inept around the park. His then-astronomical wages of £30,000 a month did not guarantee him hitting the target and when he left having failed to score even once in his 12 Premier League appearances, manager Dave Bassett - who allegedly tore up the forward's contract - declared: 'The whole business turned into a complete fiasco.' That's certainly one word for it... Andrea Silenzi was paid £30,000 a month at Nottingham Forest but proved to be completely hopeless during his time at the club . The Italian was signed from Torino for £1.8m in 1995 and failed to score in any of his 12 Premier League appearances . 21) Milton Nunez (Sunderland) The story of Milton Nunez at Sunderland is a classic cautionary tale. With the Black Cats believing there were acquiring a £1.5m signing from Uruguayan top-flight side Nacional Montevideo, they pursued the deal for Nunez. In actual fact, they were signing the forward from a Third Division team - Uruguay Montevideo - meaning the difference in quality was quite large... The Honduran was on Wearside from 1999 to 2001 but played only once in the Premier League - for a grand total of 44 minutes - and needless to say he failed to score. Sunderland took legal action against Nunez, his agent and Uruguay Montevideo and agreed to settle out of court so they did gain back the majority of the fee. They will always have to live with the sheer embarrassment, however. Milton Nunez signed for Sunderland for £1.5m in 1999 from Uruguay Montevideo - but they thought they were getting someone else!

"Ryan Taylor is sat having dinner with two of his team-mates and their partners. It is April of last year and they are at the historic Close House, resting on Hadrian’s Wall in Newcastle. It’s where he got married, plays golf and socialises. It’s a happy place. Tonight, however, those special memories will be tainted by one phone call and the devastating news relayed to him. Forty-eight hours earlier, Taylor, afforded protection as a ‘non-contact floater’ in a practice match at Newcastle’s training ground, tweaked his knee chasing a loose ball. Ryan Taylor poses after unveiling the new mural of 2,000 Newcastle United fans that took selfies . Taylor unveiled a mural featuring 2,000 fans outside St James’ Park on Friday ahead of the match vs QPR . The mural was created and installed by sponsors wonga.com outside of Newcastle's St James' Park . Only a matter of days into his comeback from eight months out with knee ligament damage, he convinced himself it was a minor setback. Then the phone rang. It was Paul Catterson, the club doctor. ‘I was with Dan Gosling, James Perch and our wives and girlfriends,’ he recalls as we sit in the home dressing-room at St James’ Park, where he will on Saturday run out for the first time in more than two years against QPR. ‘The Doc phoned. I always used to know with his calls if it was good or bad. It was either very quiet, “Hello Ryan”. Or, “Alright Ryan, how you doing?”. ‘I knew straight away. It was the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) again. I went back to the table, everyone was really upset. It hadn’t sunk in with me.’ Sink in, it later did, but only amid a flood of tears. ‘It wasn’t until I walked through the doors at training that I thought, “hold on a minute, I’m not coming to train here”,’ says Taylor, who on Friday unveiled a mural featuring 2,000 fans outside St James’ which was created and installed by sponsors wonga.com. ‘I completely broke down. There were a few shoulders which had tears on that day.’ Taylor has been recalling the devastating injury that kept the defender out of action for Newcastle . Taylor speaks with Sportsmail's Craig Hope in the changing rooms at Newcastle's St James' Park . Taylor was told he could be 30 by the time he returned to football following his devastating injury . Taylor, then 28, was told he’d be 30 by the time he returned. He rang his dad, Darren, back at home in Liverpool. ‘We talked about it - I’d put so much in and got nothing from it. It just killed me, my body went in to shut-down mode,’ he says. ‘I said to my dad, “this could be me”. He said, “listen, it’s not happening”. It took a while to get my head around it all.’ The best surgeon in the world was identified – Dr Richard Steadman of Colorado. It emerged that Taylor’s initial knee operation, the previous year, had not gone to plan. He spent the next six months ‘doing absolutely nothing, it was torture’. Then, thanks to a donor – a male in his twenties who had died – his patellar tendon was replaced. After that it was rehab. And then, more rehab. In October of this year, 26 months after his last appearance, finally, it was matchday. The opponents, Manchester City at the Etihad in the League Cup. Taylor takes up the story. ‘I thought I’d get half an hour but we had a team meeting and the XI went up. I was like, “hold on a minute, I’m in it”,’ he laughs. Taylor pictured during Newcastle training, practising kicking the ball and taking free-kicks over mannequins . In October of this year, 26 months after his last appearance, Taylor returned to face Manchester City . ‘I thought I’d play an hour. Once he’d made all three subs I thought, “what’s going on? It’s only 1-0, we could go to extra-time here”. So when Moussa (Sissoko) scored our second I wish that I could have sprinted and kissed him, but I couldn’t run. ‘It was one of those days where everything fell right and the result topped it off. It made those two years feel like two minutes.’ Afterwards, he received a standing ovation from his comrades. ‘It was incredible, the reaction from our fans and the lads,’ he says. ‘I had messages from John Terry, Steven Gerrard, Michael Owen, they helped me.’ Newcastle’s physio, Derek Wright, also gets a special mention – ‘he was like my dad up here’ – but his wife, Kim, and boys, Henri, three, and baby Evan, were Taylor’s biggest source of strength. This Saturday afternoon, the club have allowed him to walk out with Henri. ‘He’s been there from day one,’ says Taylor. ‘He’s never seen me play here, he was only six months old when I did my knee. ‘It will be a special day and I’m lucky to have a brilliant relationship with these fans, scoring the winner against Sunderland helps of course.’ That goal, in a 1-0 win in 2011, is a happy memory.

"David de Gea will be in goal for Manchester United at Arsenal on Saturday despite dislocating his finger only last week. United manager Louis van Gaal confirmed Sportsmail's story of earlier this week that the Spanish international has made a remarkable recovery from an injury that at one stage looked set to keep him out for two or three week. David de Gea will start for Manchester United against Arsenal despite suffering a dislocated finger . Louis van Gaal confirmed that David de Gea, Angel di Maria and Michael Carrick should all be fit . Michael Carrick is expected to be ok after picking up a groin injury on England duty . Daley Blind will find out the full extent of his knee injury in 10 days time . Daley Blind: Knee injury . Luke Shaw: Hamstring injury . Marcos Rojo: Dislocated shoulder . Rafael: Muscular injury . Ashley Young: Groin/Pelvis injury . Phil Jones: Calf/Shin injury . Radamel Falcao: Calf/Shin injury . Jonny Evans: Ankle/Foot injury . Jesse Lingard: Knee injury . 'De Gea is fine,' said Van Gaal. 'He is good.' Van Gaal also confirmed that Michael Carrick is likely to be okay despite suffering a groin injury training with England while Angel di Maria has trained after taking a knock playing for Argentina in midweek. 'There is no question mark about him,' he added.

"Mauricio Pochettino insists blame for Tottenham’s poor season should lie with him - but the Argentine is adamant he has no regrets about letting Michael Dawson leave the club. It was quite a claim when set against the dreadful, rudderless defensive performances that have followed Dawson’s summer departure for Hull after nine years in north London. What the club have lost in both a leader and centre-half could be thrown into sharp relief when Spurs play at Hull, even if they do have the comfort of knowing their worst form has been reserved for games at White Hart Lane. Mauricio Pochettino blames himself for Tottenham's poor start to the Premier League season . The Spurs boss said that he has no regrets about allowing Michael Dawson to join Hull this summer . Tottenham were beaten 2-1 by Stoke at White Hart Lane in their last Premier League game . It’s at home where four of their five Premier League defeats have occurred, though aside from geography it is clear that fundamental problems exist within a defence that concedes an average of 1.5 goals per game. Perhaps that ought to make Pochettino question the decision to let Dawson, 31, leave shortly after his own arrival, but the Tottenham head coach said: ‘It was not only my decision – we had a chat with Michael about the situation, and we agreed the best thing for him was to join Hull. ‘We were transparent with him all the way, and we had a very good relationship – we always talked face to face, but I don’t (regret letting him go) because it wasn’t only down to me. ‘I understand the situation with Dawson because I played for more than 10 years with Espanyol before I decided to leave. Like Michael, I was the captain and I shared the decision to leave with the club. Pochettino has overseen Spurs' worst start to a league campaign since Juande Ramos was in charge in 2008 . Centre back Dawson spent nine years at Tottenham and captained the side last season . ‘It is always sad, for the people who have been close to you for 10 years, when you part because you share emotions together. ‘But this is professional football, and when you decide to do something different, you need to look forward.’ Certainly looking backwards will offer little encouragement. Pochettino reiterated his belief that his players lack the correct ‘mentality‘, though he was clear that he must take responsibility for sitting 12th. He said: ‘I have no complaint with the players. I complain with me, with myself, because I need to give them more tools to play better. This is my worry.’ Pochettino attempted to play down suggestions that Jan Vertonghen is unhappy, but the Belgium centre-half is understood to be considering leaving the club after finding his opportunities limited under the Argentine.","Mauricio Pochettino accepts responsibility Tottenham's poor form .

"Fashionistas may despair at the latest trend reports - but their granddads will be delighted. Socks and sandals are the latest must-have look, according to a leading fashion editor. And it's not the delicate shimmering sock with an elegant heeled sandal you've seen at Burberry and Prada but an altogether more masculine pairing. Rita Ora has been braving the trend since spring, with Velcro sliders. Time to get some sheepskin 'Stocks? Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen wear the socks and sandals combination - apparently it's the hottest trend . This season it's all about double-strap flats and thick, ribbed socks, says Katherine Ormerod, senior fashion news editor at Grazia. She has said that the Birkenstock is a more affordable take on designer looks, but warns you must retain some bare skin and avoid covering up your whole leg to make it work. The look has been dubbed 'Stocks and socks and is all about a silhouette of chunky sock and chunky, flat shoe. Traditionally, it's a look favoured by granddads and hippies and general creatures of convenience with minimal interest in fashion. But the past few months have seen it filter through designer catwalks such as Miharayasuhiro, through to fashion bloggers like Man Repeller, and down to showbiz darlings like Rita Ora and the Olsen twins. Now, it's stomping its way through social media and onto the feet of the fashionable woman on the street, says the Guardian. The James Long show for SS15 (l) and Miharayasuhiro at Paris Fashion Week, also SS15 (r) The Birkenstock Arizona shoes with sheepskin lining (l) and a fashion show attendee in Paris this summer (r) 'Flat sandals and socks look good worn with a pretty dress, bare legs and a chunky jacket. It doesn't work with tights,' says Katherine Ormerod. 'The sock needs to be substantial, something with a bit of a hiking vibe to it. Best get them in a grungy colour, a grey or an olive or a brown, and wear them a bit slouched down. The whole look needs to be outdoorsy. It can work for men as well as women too, as part of that whole urban woodsman look. You know: the beard, lumberjack shirt, rolled-up jeans, sandals and socks. 'While this look is always going to look great on a woman with long slim legs, like many things, socks and sandals can be flattering to lots of shapes and sizes because of the proportions involved. Things that are heavier around the ankle make your leg look slimmer. This is why big chunky boots are currently so popular too.' Birkenstocks were, of course, huge for summer. But fashion says you should consider carrying the shoe into autumn (especially the new sheepskin-lined Arizona style), paired with chunky socks. The look will definitely keep your toes toasty as well as, apparently, make your legs look slimmer and earn you plenty of fashion points. A couple of weeks ago, geeky Velcro-strap sandal company Teva ran a promotion with Urban Outfitters in America. They celebrated socks and flat sandals by offering a pair of Teva with Woolrich socks at a $65 set. Models in a dedicated lookbook were seen wearing the sandals with colorful socks and hipster-chic ensembles such as chambray shirt-dresses and acid wash joggers. And in an appeal to the snap-happy Instagram set, the lookbook had the hashtag #SockAndSandals printed on the cover. But highly styled, long-limbed, airbrushed models are one thing, and real life is another. It remains to be seen whether even the most stylish women on the street will really adopt the look. Are you convinced? Fearne Cotton in the old look of thin sock and heels in 2011 (l) and Uma rocking the current trend (r)","Traditionally a fashion faux-pas, the dreadful look is now 'on trend'

"Wayne Rooney has revealed the inspiration behind his cartwheel goal celebration in England's 3-1 win against Scotland - his son Kai. In an Instagram post on Friday, the Manchester United striker explained that his five-year-old boy asked him to pull off the acrobatic manoeuvre if he found the back of the net at Celtic Park. Rooney uploaded a video of Kai doing cartwheels in the Wembley tunnel prior to the Three Lions' 3-1 victory against Slovenia, adding that his son had been doing them on a regular basis. Wayne Rooney uploaded an Instagram video of his son Kai on Friday afternoon . Kai performed the celebration before England's 3-1 win against Slovenia on Saturday . Kai can be seen wearing a full England strip with 'Daddy 100' on the back . Kai looks delighted with himself after completing the cartwheel before England's match against Slovenia . The 14-second Instagram video shows Kai perform a cartwheel celebration . Wayne Rooney was banned by Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United from celebrating goals with a cartwheel in case of injuring himself. The incident occurred after the Red Devils' striker scored his side's winning goal in their Carling Cup semi-final second leg against local rivals Manchester City in January 2010. And although the England skipper celebrated his first strike against Gordon Strachan's side in more traditional style, he listened to his son's wishes after beating Craig Gordon late in the second half. Rooney wrote on Instagram: 'Lots of people asking why I did a cartwheel to celebrate my goal against Scotland. It was because my son Kai has been doing them a lot lately and asked me to do one, here he is doing one in the tunnel before the @england Slovenia game!' In the 14-second clip Kai, who is wearing a full England strip with 'Daddy 100' on the back, can be seeing doing a cartwheel as he and his younger brother Klay prepare to accompany their father onto the Wembley pitch. Wayne (centre) scored twice as England defeated Scotland 3-1 at Celtic Park on Tuesday . Rooney took his two sons out with him as he collected a special golden cap from Sir Bobby Charlton last week, recognition for reaching 100 international appearances. The 29-year-old marked the occasion by scoring a penalty, then added his 45th and 46th goals for his country against the Scots on Tuesday. Those goals moved Rooney above Jimmy Greaves in England's all-time list and to within three of Charlton's record haul of 49 goals. Speaking after his brace north of the border, Rooney said: 'I'm just enjoying my football at the minute. I've always loved playing for England. 'I hope that continues and if that means beating the record I'll be delighted.' Rooney celebrated his second strike in the dying moments of the match with the cartwheel celebration . Although it was Rooney's goals that helped seal victory against the Scots, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain gave Roy Hodgson's men the lead with a fine header after 32 minutes. The Arsenal midfielder converted a pinpoint cross from club team-mate Jack Wilshere, nodding the ball beyond David Marshall and into the bottom corner. Rooney doubled England's lead just after half-time, recating quicker than the home defence to give the visitors a two-goal advantage in Glasgow. Hull City's Andrew Robertson halved the deficit seven minutes before the final whistle with a well-taken goal, beating ex-Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster at his near post. But it was Rooney who had the last laugh, finishing off a slick passing move to put the result beyond doubt with just five minutes remaining. Rooney's celebration mirrored his son's cartwheel with his own effort on Tuesday night .","England defeated Scotland 3-1 in Glasgow on Tuesday night .

"Michael Dawson believes his former club Tottenham will reap the rewards for showing patience and sticking with beleaguered manager Maurico Pochettino, the man who sold Dawson to Hull in the summer. Tottenham have shown little sign of shaking off what many perceived to be early season rustiness and a 2-1 home loss to Stoke before the international break has left fans wondering if there is a deep-rooted problem behind their five defeats in 11 league games. But while Dawson will look to inflict further misery upon his former club when they meet on Sunday, he believes Pochettino will eventually propel Spurs up the table once the team is familiar with his high-intensity pressing style of play. Michael Dawson played at Tottenham for almost ten years before moving to Hull in the summer . Maurico Pochettino has seen Tottenham lose five of their opening eleven Premier League matches . Dawson (right) has enjoyed life so far at Hull City and believes they are building for the future . 'They have to be patient,' Dawson told The Daily Express. 'It takes time when you bring in a manager and he brings different players in. He will have a different style of football. 'There are high expectations at Spurs and it comes with a lot of pressure. You have to be able to live that.' Dawson, who made over 300 appearances in almost ten years at White Hart Lane, said he accepts Pochettino's decision to sell him in the summer, and has enjoyed his time at Hull so far.

"Alex Pearce’s defensive nightmare handed Cardiff City a 2-1 triumph to extend Russell Slade’s perfect home record. The Reading defender s​cored an own goal, conceded a penalty and was sent off in a shambolic first-half performance to give Vincent Tan’s chosen man his fourth successive win at the Cardiff City Stadium. Michael Hector hit a consolation goal for the Royals but it could not stop their dire run of just two wins in 12 games. The Cardiff players celebrate after Reading defender Alex Pearce (not pictured) put them 1-0 up . Peter Whittingham doubled the lead for Cardiff from the penalty spot on the stroke of half-time . Pearce sees red just before half-time after a challenge in the area conceded a penalty in Cardiff's favour .

Goal: Hector 81 . Booked: Williams 41, Blackman 90 . Sent off: Pearce 45+3 . Referee: James Linington . Attendance: 20,643 . Glenn Murray tested home goalkeeper David Marshall early on as the visitors found space between the Cardiff City midfield and defence. But their bright start was extinguished by one of their own after 19 minutes when Pearce diverted Peter Whittingham’s corner past Adam Federici - who was yet to make a save. Former Royals defender Sean Morrison proved a handful in the Reading penalty area and Pearce only had eyes for his man when Whittingham sent his kick curling in. Confusion reigned in the away side’s defence and the ball had deflected off the leg of Pearce and past the Federici before either knew anything about it. Hal Robson-Kanu led the search for an equaliser before half-time with a testing drive at the same end he scored his match-winning goal for Wales against Cyprus last month. Both sides seemed content to head in at half-time with the score at 1-0 after Anthony Pilkington and Danny Williams were booked for their part in a melee, but the evening was about to go from bad to worse for Pearce. Pearce (second left) scored an own goal in the 20th minute to put Cardiff 1-0 up against Reading . The referee reaches into his pocket (left) to send Reading defender Pearce off just before half-time . Former Madjeski favourite Adam Le Fondre controlled a searching Peter Whittingham ball 18 yards from goal and tried to beat Pearce, who had found himself one-on-one with the tricky attacker. The Ireland international dragged Le Fondre down and referee James Linington pointed to the spot and pulled a red card out of his pocket. Whittingham finished the move he started by sending the Australian goalkeeper the wrong way to give Cardiff a flattering 2-0 half-time lead. Chris Gunter (second right) and Pearce (centre) confront the referee James Linington to appeal the red . Adam Le Fondre (left) is fouled by Pearce on the stroke of half-time - the latter was then sent off . Simon Cox was sacrificed for Gareth McLeary at the break as Nigel Adkins sought to shore things up at the back. But the early signs were not good as Anthony Pilkington and Craig Noone burst down the flanks but saw their shots fly high and wide. Le Fondre was next to test the away side’s three-man defence as the home side took advantage of their one-man advantage. But Cardiff did themselves no favours as they let their possession advantage go to waste with some sloppy defending. Oliver Norwood (centre) looks to evade the challenge of Le Fondre of Cardiff .

"Danny Welbeck has revealed that he was finding life at Manchester United 'difficult' before deciding to make his £16million to Arsenal. Welbeck, who has enjoyed playing in his favoured centre forward position since joining the Gunners, often found himself playing on the wing or on the substitutes bench at Old Trafford. Speaking to Arsenal's official website, Welbeck said: 'When you’ve been somewhere for so long and then you’re going to start a new chapter in your career, you’ve got to think about it a lot. Danny Welbeck has revealed he was finding life at Manchester United 'difficult' Welbeck has scored 10 goals for club and country since joining the Gunners on transfer deadline day . 'Over the past year or so, I started to think about what’s best for me because at the time I was playing on the left wing a lot and in a 4–4-2, which is very difficult for me because I can’t make an impact on the game. 'You start to have thoughts but at that time you’re still going to training and I was still giving 100 per cent and giving my all in every single game – that’s just me, I’m not going to change that.

The 23-year-old has scored 10 goals for club and country since joining Arsene Wenger's team and believes he's in the right place to further his career as a striker.

"Swansea boss Garry Monk admits Wilfried Bony's new contract will not stop the speculation about his future. Bony signed a one-year contract extension on Wednesday that will keep him at the Liberty Stadium until June 2018 after proving to be a huge hit since his club record £12million move from Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem in the summer of 2013. The Ivory Coast striker - who scored 25 goals in his first season in English football and has another four so far this term - has been linked with Arsenal and Liverpool in the past and Monk accepts that speculation will always exist if the 25-year-old keeps on performing. Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony has signed a new deal to stay at the Liberty Stadium until 2018 . Bony has scored four goals for Swansea so far this season after netting 25 times last term . 'It's just reward for what he's been doing since he joined us and it's a boost for the club and the fans but also for his team-mates,' Monk said at his press conference ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League game at Manchester City. 'He's been very important on and off the pitch but he shows the commitment that the club have shown him in offering him a new deal. 'The club deserves it too and him signing it shows clear indication he wants to be here and part of this team, training with the players he's training with. 'But I don't think any contract you sign will stop speculation and being linked with anyone. 'We can't stop speculation whether it's a one-year or 20-year contract but that's not our problem. 'My problem is to try and sign the players we want on long-term contracts for as long as possible.' Bony could actually miss as many as six games for Swansea in January and February following the Ivory Coast's qualification this week for the Africa Cup of Nations finals in Equatorial Guinea. But Bony will be available after the Ivory Coast's goalless draw against Cameroon which secured CAF qualification for the trip to the Etihad Stadium - a ground where Swansea have yet to score in the Premier League, let alone collect a point. Swansea manager Garry Monk accepts that speculation over his star striker's future will continue . The Ivory Coast's gaolless draw against Cameroon could see Bony (C) miss six games for Swansea next year . Manchester City have injuries to key players this weekend with Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko ruled out by injury and captain Vincent Kompany and David Silva also struggling to make Swansea's visit. But Monk said: 'The players they've got to come in would get in most sides in the league. 'They are very strong as well and probably look at this as a chance to get three points but, hopefully, we can put on a performance to try and warrant points for ourselves. 'It's a tough place to go as they've got an extremely good squad and are defending champions. 'But the players relish these games to see how far they've come as individuals and a group. 'We can see how far we have come in these games and this is another chance to do that.' Swansea climbed into the top five before the international break with an excellent 2-1 comeback home victory over Arsenal but Monk said no-one was getting carried away at the Liberty Stadium with the start they have made this season. 'We just focus on the next game because if you look too far ahead you lose track of what you're doing,' Monk said. 'We're just looking at Man City and giving that 100 per cent commitment and effort and see where that takes us. Bafetimbi Gomis celebrates scoring the winner against Arsenal that took Swansea to fifth in the table . 'Who knows if we can stay in the top six.

"Harry Redknapp has challenged Charlie Austin to score at least 20 goals this season for him to be considered for a place in the England team. England manager Roy Hodgson is keeping an eye on the Queens Park Rangers striker, who has scored six goals in 10 appearances this season, including strikes against Chelsea and Manchester City in their previous two matches. Facing Newcastle on Saturday is the first chance for Austin to impress since Hodgson revealed he is close to a call-up to the national team. Charlie Austin has scored six Premier League goals for QPR so far this season . The striker has risen through the lower leagues to make his debut in the Premier League at 25 . Harry Redknapp has challenged Austin to earn an England call-up by scoring 20 goals this season . Redknapp said: His target’s got to be as near to 20 goals as he can this year and if he does that he’s proved he’s a Premier League goalscorer. ‘People go ""can he score in the Southern League"" – he’s come from the league below the Southern League. Can he go on from the Southern League? I think he was at Bournemouth for a while, they were looking at him, didn’t take him. ‘Then he ends up at Swindon and proves he can score goals at Swindon then he goes up a step again to Burnley. It’s been gradual. Can he score in the Championship? Yeah, he can. Then, can he score in the Premier League? Now he’s showing that he can so he’s just got to keep doing that.’ England manager Roy Hodgson admitted he had his eye on Austin, pictured in training on Thursday . Austin tussles with QPR team-mate Armand Traore during training on Thursday . At 25-years-old, Austin has been a late-developer into a top flight forward. His rise from non-League is well-documented and Redknapp believes Austin is a throwback to the 1990s when star players would regularly emerge from outside of professional football. ‘Years ago there used to be loads that’d come out,’ Redknapp added. ‘Les Ferdinand, Stuart Pearce, Ian Wright, Alan Pardew all played non-League. There were so many of them in those days. It was just a conveyor belt of players out of non-League.’","Striker Charlie Austin has scored six league goals so far this season .

James split up with his wife to rekindle a relationship with childhood sweetheart Amanda Salmon, and they have been together for nearly a decade. He was forced to pay Tanya £3m as part of the divorce settlement. His PR team have refused to comment about the bankruptcy. James' pink goalkeeper strip he had previously worn against Chelsea in the 2010 FA Cup final was sold and the yellow England jersey he wore against Algeria at the 2010 World Cup went for £1,155 at auction . He is also selling a Technics SL-1200 Turntable - this series of music player is no longer manufactured . A petrol driven chainsaw was also up for grabs as James auctions off many of his possessions . A signed Frank Lampard shirt, a bright pink Portsmouth goalkeeper top, a Malawi shirt and an NFL jersey were among the 150 items. A Holland jersey James swapped with Edwin van der Sar and a Michael Owen No 10 kit with 'best wishes' penned across it were also up for grabs. A 1998-1999 multi-coloured Port Vale goalkeeper shirt - which he would have swapped with former Manchester United trainee Kevin Pilkington - was also available to buy. Not just limited to football memorabilia - including a large number of pre-worn shorts and signed balls - DJ equipment including a Technics turntable (which is no longer manufactured), three bicycles, a Diamond Jubilee plastic half-mug piece and a chainsaw were also sold.

James, who made 53 appearances for England between 1997 and 2010, won two major honours during his spell in England - the 1995 League Cup with Liverpool and the 2008 FA Cup with Portsmouth before moving to Iceland to join IBV. Former team-mate Stan Collymore, who played with James at Liverpool, said the goalkeeper had a tendency to throw away his money as if he'd be earning it for ever. Collymore said in his 2004 autobiography: 'If he had a new car and he pranged it, he would just go and buy a new car. 'If he bought a new pair of shoes and he scuffed them, he wouldn't clean them. He would just chuck them in the spare room and buy a new pair. 'Too much disposable income, I suppose. Too easy just to bin stuff. Too easy to spend money like you're going to be earning that kind of money for the rest of your life.' One item not included in the auction is the infamous white - or cream, depending on who you ask - suit worn by James and his Liverpool team-mates on the Wembley pitch before the 1996 FA Cup final. They came to sum up Liverpool's 'Spice Boys' and James lamented that the suits became more memorable than the match itself, which was won 1-0 by opponents Manchester United. The Armani suits were the goalkeeper's choice as he was modelling with the firm at the time. His former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Fowler told the Independent in 2008: 'It was David James's idea. 'At the time, he was an Armani model. If we had won, nobody would have mentioned it. But we lost and it has become infamous. People remind me about them all the time.' We can only wonder what the suit might fetch were it included in the auction. James and Phil Babb (right) on the pitch wearing the infamous 'white' Armani suits in 1996 .

"Chief executive Peter Lawwell claims Celtic are potentially the biggest club in the world. Lawwell made his assertion after contextualising the Hoops' earning potential at the club's packed annual general meeting at Celtic Park on Friday. He claimed that the 40,000 season tickets sold for this campaign was only bettered in Britain by Manchester United and Arsenal, then told shareholders that winning the Scottish Premiership title brings in £1.8million while claiming that clubs relegated from the English top flight rake in £65million. At a press conference in the Celtic Park boardroom afterwards he expanded on the theme, claiming that, if the Scottish champions had access to the sort of broadcast monies available to the top clubs in England, Celtic would be peerless. Peter Lawwell, Celtic chief executive, thinks the Hoops are potentially the biggest club in the world . Lawwell (right), pictured alongside Celtic manager Ronny Deila, was speaking at the club's AGM on Friday . 'I believe that,' he said. 'If you go back 25-30 years and compare us to Manchester United before the media and TV boom, there probably wasn't much in it. 'I think our story is unique, it is rich - it is the best. 'We have a potential fan-base of Scots/Irish diaspora around the world to support that and we have fantastic, strong fan-base in Scotland. 'I don't see any barrier if you compare Celtic to Manchester United or Arsenal, the top clubs down there. 'I don't see any barriers if we were getting the same media values as they are getting regularly.' Asked about comparisons with Real Madrid and Barcelona, Lawwell replied: 'Similarly. The media values in England will outweigh the media values or be similar to the top in Spain or Germany. 'Therefore if it is a level playing field with our strong fundamentals. I don't see any reason why we couldn't be.' Lawwell joined chairman Ian Bankier and manager Deila (left-right) to address the media . Celtic chief Lawwell (right) took time to speak to FA chairman Greg Dyke at Celtic Park on Tuesday . In a more cryptic way, Lawwell suggested that moves were afoot all across Europe for clubs in a similar situation to Celtic - essentially big fish in small ponds - to increase revenue potential, having earlier mentioned regional leagues or supranational leagues. 'We are not alone,' he said. 'Other leagues and nations are suffering the same problems and there needs to be a solution, and I think more than ever UEFA are open to a solution . 'There are no concrete plans, but it is getting to become more of a discussion item.' Lawwell, who hopes to convince striker John Guidetti to make his loan move from Manchester City permanent, reiterated a previous assertion that the absence of traditional rivals Rangers from the top flight costs the Parkhead club £10million per season. The Celtic annual general meeting was held at Celtic Park on Friday . There was a large turnout for the meeting, which saw Lawwell claim Celtic would be peerless if they received the same income as the top Premier League clubs . However, he was unimpressed when reminded that former Hoops boss Gordon Strachan, currently the Scotland national team coach, had recently spoken about the need to get Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian - all battling to get out of the Championship - back into the top flight. Strachan said: 'People say you can't manipulate it, but I think you have to get them back in.' However, Lawwell said: 'I love Gordon dearly. He is a pal, but he is way off the mark there. We would never support that. 'It is sporting integrity. It is a football competition and above all else you have to apply the rules, and to manipulate those rules would be wrong and there would be clubs who would suffer, as well as clubs who would benefit.' There were relatively few nods to Ibrox during the AGM, which lasted just over two hours, but Lawwell was later asked, in his capacity as member of the main board of the Scottish Football Association, whether there was a possible conflict of interest in the shape of Rangers shareholder Mike Ashley, who appears to be increasing his power-base at the Ibrox club while still the owner of Newcastle United. Lawwell said: 'I think potentially there is, but I am sure the SFA and the other authorities will scrutinise, analyse and do the right thing.'","Celtic held their annual general meeting at Celtic Park on Friday .

"Re-live all the drama here . Radamel Falcao celebrated his season-long loan move to Manchester United by spending some of his £280,000-a-week wages on a Chinese meal and some red wine. The Colombian forward completed his £6million loan deal in the early hours of Tuesday morning after the Old Trafford club held off competition from Arsenal and Manchester City for his signature. Falcao posted a picture on his Twitter account with agent Jorge Mendes and his lawyers, Paulo Rendeiro and Carlos Osorio, enjoying a glass of wine, some prawn crackers and a Chinese meal at Wing's restaurant in Manchester - a regular haunt for both United and CIty players.

United will pay Falcao £280,000-a-week after luring the player from the tax haven of Monaco and the Colombian will don the No 9 shirt at Old Trafford this season. Robin van Persie has been struggling with a succession of niggling injuries and that convinced Louis van Gaal and the Old Trafford hierarchy to make a move for the free-scoring Falcao. Since making his debut for River Plate in 2005, Falcao has scored an incredible 200 goals in 305 appearances for the Argentine club, Porto, Atletico Madrid and Monaco. He has also netted 20 times in 51 international caps for Colombia but was ruled out of the 2014 World Cup after rupturing his cruciate knee ligament in January. Why Wing's? Wing's is a popular and fairly upmarket Chinese restaurant in Lincoln Square in Manchester. Plenty of footballers and their WAGs visit Wing's for a Chinese meal, as do other North-West celebrities. In the blurb on its own website, Wing's describes itself as: 'One of the very few 5-star restaurants in Manchester city centre conveniently located close to Albert Square in the centre of the city.

Daley is a great reader of the game and he has played under my philosophy over a number of years.’ Falcao’s arrival meant striker Danny Welbeck was allowed to join rivals Arsenal in a £16m deal, while Javier Hernandez went to Real Madrid on a season-long loan, with an option for a £16m permanent move.","Manchester United won the Premier League race to sign Radamel Falcao .

"CLICK HERE to read why Danny Welbeck is proving to be a better deal than Radamel Falcao . Arsene Wenger has dropped a major hint that Danny Welbeck  will be shifted to the left wing against his old club Manchester United to accommodate fit-again Olivier Giroud. Arsenal welcome back Giroud after three months out with an ankle injury but his return throws up a selection dilemma for Wenger. Welbeck has made no secret of his wish to be used as a centre forward and, since his arrival from Old Trafford on transfer deadline day, he has scored five goals for Arsenal while deputising for Giroud. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Wenger's thoughts on Manchester United and Welbeck . Olivier Giroud is in contention to face Manchester United after three months out with an ankle injury . Arsene Wenger has hinted that Giroud may return to his central role if he plays on Saturday . Danny Welbeck (centre) could be moved out to the left side of attack against his former club . However, Welbeck could now find himself back out wide, a position in which he found himself — much to his frustration — at United. ‘Welbeck can play in different positions up front,’ said Wenger. ‘I don’t think that will stop him from scoring.’ United manager Louis van Gaal made it plain that he let Welbeck leave because he never considered him worth a regular place in the starting line-up. ‘Here (at United) Welbeck doesn’t play every match. He wasn’t a line-up player here. He was more a substitute. He was not a line-up player with previous coaches. Then along comes Mr Van Gaal and then the world is changing. ‘No, the world is not changing. These are facts. They are not my facts. These are the facts of Danny Welbeck.’ France international Giroud trains at London Colney ahead of United's visit to the Emirates . Wenger speaks to Alexis Sanchez who is also likely to start in Arsenal's attack . Wenger says that Welbeck was never given any guarantees that he would play centrally . Wenger explained why Welbeck may have to move out wide, saying: ‘Welbeck had chances the other night (playing for England) when he played on the left. He looks comfortable on the left because he knows what to do. ‘One of the main reasons he came here was that he wanted to play. It was not a condition [to play as a central striker].’ Wenger said he has the option of using Welbeck and Giroud as a conventional strike partnership, adding: ‘We can adapt our formation so they can play together.’ Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla (right) compete for the ball during a training session .

"Danny Welbeck will be facing Manchester United on Saturday at the Emirates for the first time, but will he follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo and Mark Hughes by scoring in his opening match against his former club? Looking back at Premier League history, the England striker may not hold the highest hope of hitting the back of the net. The likes of Ronaldo and Hughes have a good record against United, but they are one of very few. The Portuguese superstar has scored two in two games for Real Madrid having moved to Spain in 2009, while Hughes scored in his first game against United in October 1995 after leaving in the summer. Danny Welbeck faces his old club for the first time at the Emirates on Saturday . But Welbeck will want to avoid joining the likes of Teddy Sheringham, Dwight Yorke, Louis Saha and Dimitar Berbatov in being unable to net after leaving Old Trafford. Here, Sportsmail looks at the hits and misses of former Red Devils strikers. Cristiano Ronaldo - 2 goals in 2 games against United since leaving . Ronaldo left for Real Madrid for £80million in 2009, and came back to haunt them in the Champions League last 16 first and second leg in 2013. He scored the equaliser in the 1-1 draw at the Bernabeu, then the winning goal in the 2-1 win at Old Trafford in the return leg. Cristiano Ronaldo has scored twice in two games against Manchester United for Real Madrid . Fraizer Campbell - 2 goals in 7 games against United since leaving . The striker scored a consolation for Sunderland in the 3-1 defeat at Old Trafford in 2012, and the equaliser in the 2-2 draw with Cardiff last season. Overall he has played seven games against United since leaving in 2009. Fraser Campbell has two goals in seven games since leaving the club in 2009 . Mark Hughes - 2 goals in 11 matches against United sinceleaving . The Welsh striker struck on his first game against United since leaving in 1995, in a 4-1 defeat at Stamford Bridge fro Chelsea, and then in 1997 season he made it 2-1 for Chelsea in a 2-2 draw at Old Trafford in the Premier League. In 11 matches, these were his only two goals against the Red Devils. Mark Hughes' only two goals against United since leaving the club in 11 games in total, both for Chelsea . Carlos Tevez - 3 goals in 9 matches against United since leaving . The Argentine scored both goals in the League Cup semi-final first leg in 2010 at the Etihad, with City coming from behind to win 2-1. He scored again in the return leg, but United progressed with a 4-3 aggregate win. These are the only goals he has scored against United. Carlos Tevez scored three goals in his first season away from Old Trafford with rivals Manchester City . Andy Cole - 1 goal in 12 matches against United since leaving . 'Cole the Goal' scored just once against his old club, in a 3-1 defeat for Blackburn Rovers in the League Cup semi-final second leg in 2002-03, where United progressed to the final. Andy Cole scored in a League Cup semi-final against United in the 2002-03 season . Dion Dublin - 1 goal in 20 matches against United . Dublin left United in 1994 to join Coventry, and since has scored just once against the Red Devils, for the Sky Blues in the 1997-98 term. Dion Dublin has just one goal in 20 appearances since leaving United in 1994 . The misses... Louis Saha - 5 matches, 0 goals . Dwight Yorke - 11 matches, 0 goals . Teddy Sheringham - 9 matches, 0 goals . Dimitar Berbatov - 2 matches, 0 goals . Teddy Sheringham has over 100 Premier League goals, but none against United since leaving .","Danny Welbeck faces his old club for the first time on Saturday .

"Britain's Kyle Edmund had to settle for the runners-up spot at the Yokohama Challenger but is still set to break into the world's top 200 for the first time. The 19-year-old, long regarded as Britain's most promising young male player, reached his first final on the second-tier Challenger Tour thanks to back-to-back victories over higher-ranked players. But Australian John Millman proved too strong in the final, winning 6-4, 6-4 in Japan. Britain's Kyle Edmund is set to break into the world's top 200 for the first time . It is the second consecutive weekend Millman has beaten a British player in a Challenger final, with James Ward losing in Australia seven days ago. Edmund may well have been spurred on by the rapid progress of 20-year-old Liam Broady, who reached his first Challenger final last month to climb into the top 200. Edmund's success has come since he ended his coaching partnership with former British number one Greg Rusedski last month. Having made encouraging progress under Lawn Tennis Association coach Colin Beecher, Edmund turned to Rusedski in April but the association proved to be short-lived. The split came after a succession of first-round defeats, with Edmund continuing to work with his other coach, James Trotman. Edmund recently ended his coaching partnership with former British number one Greg Rusedski (above) LTA chief executive Michael Downey had been a strong supporter of the Edmund-Rusedski partnership, and he said: 'Kyle wanted Greg and Greg wanted an opportunity. I'll wear this one. But we are optimistic of where Kyle is heading.' Rusedski's television and other commitments meant he could only spend a certain number of weeks working with Edmund during a very important time in his development. Director of player development Bob Brett said: 'I spoke with Greg and I said he needed to have a project. But there has to be a real commitment to it and unfortunately he wasn't ready to make that commitment, although he did free up extra weeks.'","Britain's Kyle Edmund reached his first final on the second-tier Challenger Tour thanks to back-to-back victories over higher-ranked players .

"MATT LAWTON: Malky Mackay and Iain Moody investigated by FA over 'sexist, racist and homophobic' text messages during time at Cardiff . If Malky Mackay wanted to be rehabilitated, he should have chosen his next chairman more carefully. He finds himself back in football alongside an employer who did him no favours on Wednesday. In 2011, Dave Whelan gave a radio interview to LBC about the high-profile racism cases involving John Terry and Luis Suarez. Asked for his view on black players who take issue with being racially abused on a football pitch, he said: ‘You know, I think the players who come and complain sometimes, they’re a little bit out of order.’ He added: ‘If they call somebody black, you’ve just got to get on with it’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Malky Mackay and Dave Whelan at new manager's unveiling . Malky Mackay (left) should have chosen his next chairman more carefully than Wigan Athletic's Dave Whelan .

On a player's female agent . A picture entitled Black Monopoly (where every square was a ""Go to Jail"" square) Sent to members of Cardiff's staff . On Wednesday Whelan, now 77, appeared every bit as out of touch when it came to the issue of his new manager and an exchange of racist, sexist and homophobic text messages and emails that remain the subject of an ongoing Football Association investigation. As out of touch as the LMA when they dismissed Mackay’s exchanges with Iain Moody as ‘banter’, only to then apologise for the original apology. Whelan said Mackay had been ‘unlucky’ and had ‘done a little bit wrong’, adding that the football club had endured ‘these little problems’ in the past before finally declaring the FA investigation would probably come to nothing. Every bit as offensive and patronising was his dismissal of Lisa Nandy, the Wigan MP who wrote to Whelan last week echoing her constituents in expressing concern about Mackay’s possible appointment. ‘She’s not a Wigan girl by the way, she was imported into Wigan from another area, she’s not a Wigan lass, so she doesn’t understand football,’ he declared. The truth is, no club should have even considered appointing Mackay while he remains the subject of such a serious investigation; one that remains two or three weeks away from completion. Lisa Nandy (left) wrote a letter directly to the club and chairman Dave Whelan (right) about the unrest . MP Lisa Nandy sent this letter to Wigan chairman Dave Whelan after being contacted about Mackay . Mackay admitted he has made 'mistakes' but hopes the Wigan fans can get behind the team . While Whelan says there is a clause in Mackay’s new contract that gives the club the right to take action should he now be charged, he already seems to think no action will be taken. Whelan is being as disingenuous as the man who continues to insist he has already apologised for those text messages and emails. During that apology in a staged interview with Sky, Mackay said he was responsible for only three offensive text messages or emails. But he did so knowing full well there were more - and the following morning those messages were published on the pages of the Daily Mail. One of them referred to Vincent Tan, his Malaysian former employer at Cardiff, as ‘a chink’. Sportsmail revealed the exchange of 'racist, homophobic and sexist' texts and email messages by Mackay and Iain Moody (right) while at Cardiff . Another ridiculed a gay Watford season-ticket holder for feeling intimidated by homophobic chants during a match against Brighton. Mackay has not apologised for those messages and until he is asked to explain himself by an independent FA tribunal, it is hard to see him getting any closure on the matter. There is a real desire among the FA’s senior officials to see Mackay charged even if there remains a major problem over this issue of public and private communication. When Greg Dyke said ‘the FA does not consider private communication sent with a legitimate expectation of privacy to amount to professional misconduct’ in reference to the recent Richard Scudamore controversy, he created a problem for the disciplinary officials now examining the Mackay case. But if Mackay’s appointment amounted to an embarrassment for English football, it will be nothing compared to the FA’s failure to take action against the new manager of Wigan. Not least because men like Whelan and Mackay will feel vindicated if he escapes censure. Whelan (left) and Mackay were excruciating in their analysis of the severity of the latter's misdemeanours . Whelan said he believes Mackay is 'the man to lead us back to the Premier League' May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City. June 2011: After Dave Jones is sacked following a Championship play-off semi-final defeat, Malky Mackay is appointed manager. February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time. May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post. Tan controversially decides that the club’s shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon - causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters. September 2012: Tan replaces the club’s chief executive, Alan Whiteley (left), with associate Simon Lim. April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship. August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment. October 2013: Mackay’s head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov, reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds. December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘a single penny’ for transfers. December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked. December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager ‘for the foreseeable future’. December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan. December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager.","Malky Mackay was appointed as Wigan Athletic boss on Wednesday .

"Rafael Nadal is due to resume full training at the beginning of next month and will embark on a full schedule at the start of next year. The 14-time Grand Slam winner is waiting for stitches to be removed from his recent appendix operation before going back into training having cut short his season and missed last week's Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. He also confirmed the public statement from his doctor earlier this month that he has been undergoing stem cell treatment to treat his back. Rafael Nadal spoke to the media at a Poker Stars event in central London on Tuesday night . Despite Nadal's omission from the star names at the O2 last week, he was still in the minds of many fans . The procedure, which involves taking cells from the body and injecting them to try and repair damaged cartilage, is legal and has been used most often to help players in American Football. Nadal admitted that his back has become a concern, and not just during January's Australian Open, where it affected him in the final. 'This year I had periods with problems in my back,' said Nadal, who was in London on Tuesday night for an event with his sponsors Poker Stars. 'I hope I will have had time enough to fix my back one hundred per cent again.' The Spaniard, pictured at Wimbledon in June, has won 14 Grand Slams in his career . Nadal, who is pictured after winning at the French Open earlier this year, hopes to be back in the New Year . His first tournament will be an exhibition in Abu Dhabi and after that he will play the ATP event in Doha before heading to the Australian Open. 'Of course I won't be able to train fully immediately, but I would expect to have a month when I can practice 100 per cent before my first big event.' The 28 year-old Spaniard did not wish to become embroiled in the controversy affecting Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka at the 02 Arena. However, he felt it was 'one of the strangest tournaments there has been. So many one-sided matches, normally when you get the top eight players it should be close.' Federer failed to train on Tuesday ahead of Friday's start to the Davis Cup final in Lille but was hopeful of getting on court on Wednesday morning.","Rafael Nadal is due to resume full training at the start of next month .

"Moeen Ali struck twice in three balls to put England in a promising position in the first match of their World Cup winter but failed to capitalise as Sri Lanka responded from a slow start. Moeen, who learned the previous day that he will replace Alex Hales in this fixture as Alastair Cook's new opening partner, made his mark on proceedings with the ball by taking the wickets of Niroshan Dickwella and then Dinesh Chandimal for a second-ball duck. On a stodgy pitch after a rain-delayed start which reduced the match to 43 overs per side, the hosts - a line-up containing nine international players - won the toss and moved to 66 for three after 15.

The accurate Chris Woakes had a stifling effect with a first spell of 4-1-3-0. It remained hard going for the batsmen as England turned to off-spin at both ends - and even after opener Kusal Perera lofted Moeen over long-on for six off the final ball of the 10th over, the total was still only 28 for one.

Chris Jordan made a poor start at the other end, though, conceding 11 in his first over and then 14 in his second - including three wides, a no-ball and Perera's free-hit for six over long-on. Sri Lanka responded thanks to the efforts of Jeevan Mendis, 40 not out, and Ramith Rambukwella reaching 30 as the hosts finished on 198 having been in a precarious position at 122 for six.

"CLICK HERE to read why Welbeck might not start in a central role against United . Fortunes in football can turn on small details, and so it is in the case of Danny Welbeck. Late on transfer deadline day, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger signed the England centre forward from Manchester United if not exactly against his better judgement, then certainly with some reservations. Wenger had initially wanted to sign Radamel Falcao from Monaco, but had been put off by the astronomical weekly wage — in excess of £250,000 a week. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal come under fire for selling Danny Welbeck . Danny Welbeck (centre) trains with his new team-mates ahead of Arsenal's clash with former club United . England forward Welbeck will come up against Manchester United for the first time since being sold for £16m . Welbeck was forced out of Old Trafford by the arrival of Colombia international Radamel Falcao (right) Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger was interested in signing Falcao but appears to have got the better deal . Louis van Gaal and Wenger will come face to face in the latest episode of one of the league's fiercest rivalries . At the last minute, Wenger decided to take Welbeck instead, while Falcao — to everybody’s surprise — joined United on a season’s loan. As the two clubs prepare to face each other at the Emirates, it would appear, for the moment at least, that Arsenal got the better deal. Welbeck heads into the game having scored five times for his new club this season and the same amount for England. Falcao, meanwhile, will stay behind in Manchester on Saturday nursing an injured calf, having made almost no impact at Old Trafford. ‘Arsene wanted Falcao but the numbers were too high,’ an Arsenal source revealed this week. ‘He wasn’t totally sure about Welbeck, wasn’t sure he was exactly right. He thought his business was done for the summer and headed off to Europe on deadline day.’ Arsenal fans held reservations over Welbeck's finishing after he first arrived in north London . Welbeck opened his Premier League account for the Gunners against Aston Villa in September . Welbeck has scored five goals for Arsenal, including a Champions League hat-trick against Galatasaray . The 23-year-old has also been in fine form for England, scoring five goals including this one against Slovenia . Wenger was actually refereeing a charity five-a-side game in France when the Welbeck deal became live. Arsenal          Man United . Wins                      73                    87 . Win percentage   35.10              41.83 . Draws                    48                    48 . Goals                    284                  315 . Av goals/game    1.37                 1.51 . Total games                     208 . On the manager’s say-so it was signed off by his chief negotiator at the Emirates, Richard Law. The Arsenal manager’s reservations about Welbeck were familiar. Wenger was, by all accounts, unsure about the centre forward’s natural abilities as a finisher. The jury may remain out on that one — Welbeck has scored in a relatively modest three games for Arsenal so far — but it is understood that the Arsenal manager has been impressed by his new signing’s willingness to learn, work and also with his link-up play. Peculiarly, Welbeck has also transpired to be quicker than Wenger thought. The striker was born in the Manchester suburb of Longsight and was spotted by United talent scouts when he was only six-years-old. For more reasons than this, he was always a popular player at United, as Wayne Rooney’s comments indicated on Friday. Impeccably mannered and fully understanding of team principles, he works hard on his finishing in training, even if it was not always the case. Welbeck was not always trusted at United where he had to compete with  Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie . Falcao (centre) arrived at United on an expensive loan but has spent most of the season sidelined by injury . The Colombian slides on his knees after scoring against Everton, his only goal since arriving . United manager Louis van Gaal could regret his decision to let Welbeck leave Manchester United . A United source told Sportsmail this week: ‘Maybe when he was younger Danny didn’t do quite enough on his finishing as he could have, but that changed over time. ‘He puts the hours in now and has done over recent years.’ CLICK HERE to read why Louis van Gaal may be having second thoughts on signing Radamel Falcao permanently . At Old Trafford, former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson always believed in Welbeck. His successor David Moyes was not so sure but former United captain Gary Neville and coach Rene Meulensteen have both subsequently criticised Louis van Gaal’s decision to sell him. ‘It’s a strange one,’ said Neville. ‘I can’t work it out.’ Ferguson perhaps didn’t do the young forward that many favours by constantly playing him out of position. An accommodating type, Welbeck rarely complained about being shunted out to the right and the left, but it irritated those close to him, the feeling being that he was never given the opportunity to flourish in his natural position. This issue has always been at the heart of the Welbeck debate and working out which came first is something of a chicken-and-egg question. Did Welbeck get shoved out wide because he wasn’t scoring enough goals? Or did he not score enough goals because he was too rarely used as an central striker? Wenger speaks to stellar summer signing Alexis Sanchez on his return from international duty . Olivier Giroud could play some part against United after returning to fitness following an injury lay-off . Jack Wilshere (left) and Santi Cazorla compete for the ball during the session at London Colney . Certainly it was easy to feel sorry for him in the summer of 2012. Having finished the previous season showing signs of a productive and natural partnership with Rooney, Welbeck then saw Ferguson spend heavily on recruiting Robin van Persie from Arsenal. Perhaps that, in essence, was the end of Welbeck’s chances at United. Whatever the case, new manager Van Gaal appeared to get a little irritated when asked about Welbeck again on Thursday. Equally, the Falcao topic is becoming an unpopular one. ‘It’s not just a question of fitness, but also you have to train with the group,’ the United manager said. ‘For now Falcao does not train with the group so it’s out of the question for him to be on the bench. With Welbeck, it was a good move for him. As a first choice he will develop himself much more. ‘If it was right for us depends how we play, how we score, and what position we shall finish in the league.’ Sources close to Welbeck insisted this week that it was the player’s decision to leave on hearing of Falcao’s imminent arrival in August. He was, they say, not prepared for another season among the supporting cast. If that is true then he is to be commended. Equally, it is fair to say he still needs to become more clinical in front of goal and learn to score more frequently in the really big games. The Dutch manager speaks to his injury-ravaged side as they prepare for the trip to the Emirates . England captain Wayne Rooney (centre) and youngster Adnan Januzaj (right) race each other in training . Record signing Angel di Maria (left) has been passed fit after picking up a cut on international duty . Welbeck’s most high-profile goal for United was probably his strike at Real Madrid in the Champions League in February 2013. Apart from that, he scored twice against Tottenham and Arsenal in three full Barclays Premier League seasons for United and once against Manchester City. This season his goals for his new club have come against Aston Villa, Galatasaray and Hull. Saturday would certainly be a good day to buck that particular trend. Arsenal’s other main striker Olivier Giroud is fit again and, for Welbeck, the battle for the No 9 slot will soon begin all over again.","Arsenal host Manchester United in their Premier League clash on Saturday .

"Just when it seemed that everyone else should abandon hope against the machine-like quality of Novak Djokovic, along came Kei Nishikori to provide some inspiration. It took the relatively diminutive Japanese, helped by an 02 Arena crowd fed up with one-sided matches, to show that the world No1 can be rattled, but ultimately yesterday’s result turned out as expected. Djokovic is through to Sunday’s final of the Barcalys ATP World Finals with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 victory over Nishikori, but it seemed a blessing that for the first time in this event he was made to sweat for it. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Novak Djokovic has apologised for losing his temper with the O2 Arena crowd on Saturday afternoon . Nishikori waves to the crowd in London after losing to Djokovic in the ATP World Tour Final semi-final . Djokovic at full stretch to return a forehand to Nishikori during the semi-final match at the O2 Arena . That will have been noted by whoever plays him at the strange hour of 6pm this evening, the winner of last night’s all-Switzerland semi-final between Roger Federer and Stanislas Wawrinka. Djokovic has a strong but simmering temperament, and it boiled over at the start of an unexpected fightback from the hugely gifted Japanese player early in the second set. The crowd — who in the past week have been disappointed by a diet largely consisting of uncompetitive matches — applauded a double fault from the Serb as he was broken back for 2-2. Djokovic responded at the end of the game by sarcastically clapping them with one hand on his racket strings, and he was so needled that he lost his form and his footwork temporarily. The 27-year-old Serb apologised afterwards, and blamed himself rather than the throng of more than 17,000 spectators who were heavily behind the underdog. Nishikori lines up a forehand during a match in which he troubled the reigning champion . Djokovic survived a scare against Japanese Nishikori, who took him to three sets in the semi-final . Djokovic with a look of full concentration as he returns a forehand against his opponent . ‘It’s sport and they want to see a more interesting match, I made a mistake and let my emotions go. I lost my concentration, I won’t do it again,’ he said. ‘The crowd has a right to cheer for who they want. Some individuals were going over the line the whole match, but I should have known better. The truth is it’s the end of the season and I’m exhausted but I still think I will have enough energy tomorrow.’ He looked anything but the supreme warrior during the six out of seven games that he lost, which led to him conceding a set for the first time since Federer beat him in China a month ago. Nishikori has an outstanding record in deciding sets, and when he had two break points in its opening game an upset seemed on, only for him to blow his chance and then unravel as Djokovic regained his composure. That is the end of the season for Nishikori, but he has shown that if he can put his poor injury record behind him there are not many limits to what he can do next year. Andy Murray is already looking ahead to 2015 and yesterday Tim Henman became the latest pundit to urge him to employ a more expansive game if he wants to get back to Grand Slam- winning form. ‘He’s got all these shots in his armoury, my question is why doesn’t he use them?’ asked Henman. ‘He has to look at the way that he can be more offensive and more proactive instead of letting these players dictate to him. He’s got as good a two-handed backhand as Djokovic, but he doesn’t use it as much.’ Djokovic emerges from the smoke at the O2 to a rapturous welcome from the crowd . World number five Nishikori enters the O2 Arena ahead of his match against Djokovic . While emphasising that he was applying high standards to Murray, Henman said: ‘He’s a great athlete, but he does too much running and, when he’s doing too much running, he’s not dictating enough. ‘It’s about clarity of thought and that’s when you’ve got to take a step back and look at the whole set-up, the whole team and his whole lifestyle and see whether that is working as well as it can. ‘I don’t think he has been playing the right way. Because Andy’s such a good player he’s capable of winning the wrong way.’ Kyle Edmund, the Yorkshire teenager reckoned to have the most potential for a GB player since Murray and Henman, was through to his first Challenger final on Sunday morning in Yokohama, Japan, and due to play Australian John Millman.","Novak Djokovic beat Kei Nishikori 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 at the O2 Arena in London .

"England will provide a clue to their one-day strategy for their forthcoming seven-match series in Sri Lanka when they omit Alex Hales from their top three in Friday's warm-up game against Sri Lanka A in Colombo. The 25-year-old Nottinghamshire opener, who is currently third in the ICC's Twenty20 world rankings, has been touted by many as a potential match-winner at next year's 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. But England are set instead to go in to their tour opener with a top three of captain Alastair Cook, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell – leaving them open once more to the accusation that their approach to one-day cricket is simply too conservative to challenge the world's best sides. Alex Hales, pictured during a nets session in Colombo, will not be part of England's top three against Sri Lanka . Nottinghamshire opener Hales is currently ranked third in the ICC's Twenty20 world rankings . Hales has played just four one-day internationals, all against India at the end of the summer, when he made only 92 runs at a strike-rate of 68, with a top score of 42. But four games is hardly a scientific sample, and many still remember his breath-taking unbeaten 116 from 64 balls to dispatch the Sri Lankans during the World Twenty20 earlier this year in Bangladesh. As one six after another flew into the Chittagong night sky, it seemed England had unearthed a world-beater for both forms of limited-overs cricket. In his next match against Sri Lanka – another Twenty20 game at The Oval in May – he top-scored with 66 from 41 balls, with no other England batsman reaching 30. It is fair to say he is the one England player the Sri Lankans truly fear. Yet coach Peter Moores and Cook took note of Hales's struggles against the tight line served up by India's opening bowlers in August and September, and have also borne in mind the spin option provided by Ali in a part of the world where slow bowlers need little encouragement. Coach Peter Moores, pictured during a nets session on Thursday, could be accused of being too conservative . Captain Alastair Cook (right) will make up part of England's top three with Moeen Ali and Ian Bell . Even so, for those looking for signs that England will embrace an aggression-first approach as they seek to avoid a sixth successive World Cup flop, the news that Hales is not being given a licence to thrill at the top of the order will feel dispiriting. At a training session at the Nondescripts Cricket Club in Colombo today, Moores said: 'We're trying to move to be a more positive side, with both bat and ball, take every opportunity to score runs and put pressure on the opposition. 'It's not a simple process to say ""I'm going to walk out and whack it"". 'We saw that in that India game, when Rohit Sharma [who made 264 against Sri Lanka at Kolkata] started slowly, and then suddenly found freedom and played beautifully. Ali (left) and Bell (right) will complete England's top three in Friday's warm-up match against Sri Lanka A . 'We've got to do that. It's not actually complicated. You've just got to find your way of doing it as an individual, and a team.' With only two warm-up games scheduled before Wednesday's first one-day international here in Colombo, it looks as if Hales's best hope will be for Bell to fail twice. It is not the ideal sentiment at the start of a tour which England hope will provide them with a platform to shock the world in Australia and New Zealand.","Alastair Cook, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell will make up England's top three .

"Retired Australian cricketer Mike Hussey will once again take to the pitch - for one match, at least - when he captains a Prime Minister's XI side against England in January. The match will be played on January 14 at Manuka Oval, four days before England's opening match of a one-day international tri-series that also includes Australia and India. Hussey played 79 tests for Australia from 2005 to 2013 and 185 one-day internationals from 2004 to 2012. His career included 19 centuries among 6,235 test runs. Mike Hussey played in 79 tests for Australia and 185 one-day internationals before retiring in 2012 . Former players Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee have appeared as PM's XI captains in the past two years 'so it's humbling to follow in the footsteps of two icons of Australian cricket,' says Hussey. The remainder of the team will be announced later.","Mike Hussey played 79 tests and 185 one-day matches for Australia .

"England’s tour Sri Lanka has barely begun, yet Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores have already found themselves on the defensive after the controversial decision to leave Alex Hales out of the opening warm-up game in Colombo. With Hales, ranked third in the ICC’s Twenty20 batting table, left out of the top three in favour of Cook, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell for Friday’s 50-over match against Sri Lanka A, England once more stood accused of the kind of conservative thinking that many fear could condemn them to another World Cup flop in Australia and New Zealand next year. And while Cook insisted England were ‘nowhere near’ identifying his opening partner, there is a concern among the coaching staff that Hales was exposed by India’s bowlers during his four one-day internationals at the end of the summer. Alastair Cook (right) and Angelo Mathews shake hands next to the trophy for which they will be playing . Cook (left) and Moeen Ali are set to open for England against Sri Lanka A on Friday . Those games brought him only 92 runs and a modest strike-rate of 68, and Moores explained: ‘India started to bring the ball back into Alex and bowl spin at him, so he has to decide what else he is going to come back at them with.’ Alex Hales has been left out of England's first warm-up match against Sri Lanka A . Cook, meanwhile, did his best to leave the door open. ‘It was incredibly hard to pick a side even for this warm-up game,’ he said. ‘We just wanted another bowler in top six, and Moeen gives us that option. But we’re nowhere near making our final decision.’ Even so, England’s refusal to hit the home bowlers with their heaviest artillery at the earliest possible opportunity will do little to dissuade critics that their one-day game has fallen badly behind the rest of the world. No innings by an England batsman this year was more breathtaking than Hales’s 64-ball 116 not out against the Sri Lankans during the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, and there are worries that a top three of Cook, Ali and Bell will stagnate too easily. Not for the first time, Moores was left to defend his captain’s role as opener, which has not produced a score above 80 in his last 39 innings. ‘We know he’s a steely character and a very good player,’ said the England coach. ‘If you take his record from the last World Cup, he’s still in the top 10 batters in the world over that period of time, in terms of runs scored.’ Cook is, in fact, 12th in that table. Of the 11 above him, only two – the Pakistan duo of Mohammad Hafeez and Misbah-ul-Haq – have a lower strike-rate than his 80. And none have hit fewer than his eight sixes. Moeen and Ian Bell walk out for a bat at the tremendously-named Nondescript Cricket Club in Colombo . Ben Stokes and Eoin Morgan have a drink of water on a hot day in Sri Lanka . Cook and Moores were forced to defend the decision to leave out Hales . In Alastair Cook's last 39 one-day innings as an opener, the England captain has not scored above 80. But England are refusing to be influenced by the global trend for higher one-day totals, stunningly exemplified last week when India’s Rohit Sharma made a world-record 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata. ‘Scores in India are always higher and you’ve got to accept that,’ said Moores. ‘We’re going to play a tournament in Australia and if you ask the stats man what a good score is, some places it would be 300 and at others it wouldn't be. ‘We’re playing matches in New Zealand, where 300 isn’t a normal score. We’re trying to get a batting unit that scores above par on a given surface. To do that, it is not as simple as saying to guys, “Go out there and whack it”.’ The Sri Lankans, who are hoping to build on their Test and one-day wins in England in May and June, may not be able to believe their luck.","Alastair Cook and Moeen Ali will open for England against Sri Lanka A .

"When Chris Jordan was making his way in cricket he would think of the World Cup as the ultimate. ‘It is one of those lifelong dreams,’ he said. ‘You see the World Cup as a kid and you think, ""That’s where I want to be, that’s the stage I want to perform on.’ It would be everything. Who knew this is where I’d be today? 'I kept faith through injuries and ups and downs and always had my eyes on the prize. Hopefully I’m in a position now to claim that prize.’ Chris Jordan celebrates after taking the wicket of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara during the ODI in May . In the absence of Jimmy Anderson (left) and Stuart Broad, Jordan will be hoping to seize his chance . It is within touching distance for a gifted all-rounder who has arrived in England’s new era via the unconventional route of a childhood in Barbados before making his life in England through a scholarship at Dulwich College. But first comes a one-day series in Sri Lanka that will make or break that dream for Jordan, who will be given the perfect chance to claim his World Cup place in the absence of the injured Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad. The man who has shown glimpses of enormous potential in his first year of international cricket but also inconsistency knows that something will have to give and someone will have to miss out when the spearheads return. So, in effect, he has seven matches in Sri Lanka, along with the likes of Steven Finn, Chris Woakes and perhaps even Ben Stokes, to prove that he should be on the plane to Australia in January. The England attack is very much on trial. ‘Everyone is talking about the World Cup but for me it’s about staying in the moment,’ Jordan told Sportsmail. ‘We are a new side and are still getting to know each other. We need to start winning in Sri Lanka to put ourselves in a good position for the World Cup. I’ve enjoyed every minute of playing for England and international cricket is everything I expected it to be.’ Jordan (right), in action for Sussex, celebrates bowling out Rikki Clarke in the 2013 Yorkshire Bank 40 League . But he is far from fully established yet. There have been the highs of his superlative all-round performance on his home ground in Bridgetown against West Indies in a Twenty20 international; his demolition of Sri Lanka in a one-day international at Old Trafford and his seven wickets in the final Test against India. Yet there have also been lows, in particularly the third Test at the Ageas Bowl last summer and the one-day international in Cardiff against India when his radar went awry and Jordan looked anything like a leading England bowler. ‘I’m trying to be a world-class player, a great player, so I have to get better with both balls,’ said Jordan. ‘I couldn’t put my finger on what went wrong at Southampton. I’d just come from a game at Horsham for Sussex where I’d bowled well and taken a few wickets. 'It was just one of those things. The first ball just didn’t come out right and it set the tone for the rest of the day. But as the series went on I got better and better and finished strongly so I’ve drawn a line under Southampton and don’t think about it any more.’ Jordan bowls during a nets session at Headingley Carnegie Stadium in September 2013 . Jordan (second right) celebrates taking the wicket of Dimuth Karunaratne of Sri Lanka at Lords last June . It is the stuttering run-up of Jordan’s that the purists questioned when he was prone to bowling wides last summer, particularly of someone who is such a brilliant athlete. It was born out of necessity when he spent a year on the sidelines with a serious back injury and he has no plans to tinker with it just yet. ‘I actually used to run in a lot faster and from quite a way back but after coming back for injury I worked on a more measured approach for consistency,’ said Jordan. My head is a lot more still and I can really focus on my target. It’s something that works for me but equally you’re always looking to evolve and get better so if that’s an area I can eventually make a little bit more efficient it’s something I’m more than happy to work on. ‘Everyone isn’t the same and different things work for different people so you have to have a strong character because that’s what’s got me here in the first place. But it’s my first season in international cricket and everything is not always rosy. I have been working on the negatives and keep improving. ‘I want to bowl quickly and add a few miles on to it. I think I can be over 90 miles per hour consistently, not just the odd ball here and there, but to do that I have to make sure my body is in top condition.’ Jordan prepares to make a spectacular catch during a practice session at Trent Bridge in Nottingham in July . His run up served him well enough when he got everything right last summer. ‘Barbados was one of the highlights for sure,’ he said. ‘I hadn’t played on that tour since the first game in Antigua and it was the first time my family had been able to watch me playing for England, around 15 or 20 of them. It couldn’t have been written any better and I enjoyed the moment with all of them. It was very special.’ He will be back in Barbados for Christmas after the Sri Lanka tour when he hopes to catch up with his old friend from Combermere School in Bridgetown, the singer Rihanna. ‘I haven’t seen her since I started playing for England but I like to think she’s still a friend and I hope to see her then,’ he added. But first there is a World Cup place to earn. Jordan says he is trying to become a world-class player as he prepares to take on Sri Lanka .

"New Zealand kept a firm grip on the second Test in Dubai after some timely interventions from their seamers. Three times Pakistan, 1-0 up in the three-match series, looked to have gained a foothold back in the game with one partnership over a hundred and two half-century stands, but each time they were pegged back. As a result they closed the third day still 122 runs adrift in their first innings at 281 for six. New Zealand celebrate as Pakistan's Asad Shafiq walks back to the pavillion after being dismissed . A positive start to the day saw Azhar Ali and Younis Khan put on 113 either side of lunch as they moved on from their overnight 34 for two. But just as they were looking to make significant inroads into their opponents' lead Younis (72) slapped a long hop from James Neesham straight to Mark Craig at cover. The fall of that wicket did not slow Pakistan's advance, however, as Misbah-ul-Haq then joined in a 50-run stand before the taking of the new ball after tea produced another breakthrough. Pakistani batsman Sarfraz Ahmed plays a shot down the leg side during the second Test against New Zealand . New Zealand profited from some timely interventions form seamers James Neesham and Trent Boult . Having attacked with a number of in-swingers, Trent Boult got one to move away and take a thick outside edge to remove Misbah for 28 before Azhar's stoic stay was finally ended after more than five hours at the crease. Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi hurried one through to trap the batsman lbw for 75 but even then Pakistan bounced back once again as Asad Shafiq and Sarfraz Ahmed combined in a 57-run seventh-wicket partnership. The return to the attack of paceman Tim Southee late on paid dividends as in the penultimate over of the day he induced an edge to slip from Shafiq four runs short of his half-century. Trent Boult ended the day on 1-46 with eight maidens, but the one wicket he took was vital .","Pakistan are currently 1-0 up in the series but trail in the second Test .

"Harry Gurney insists the Sri Lanka rainy season cannot blow England's World Cup preparations off course. Gurney is one of the two specialists, alongside four all-rounders for this seven-match one-day international series, in a seam attack which is relatively inexperienced in the injury-enforced absence of Stuart Broad and James Anderson. But the 28-year-old, speaking after England's second practice session of the tour, is confident both he and his team-mates will rise to the challenge and will have ample opportunity to do so - despite the threat of curtailment from daily storms here. Harry Gurney (above) does not believe that the Sri Lanka rainy season will cause a huge problem for England . England captain Alastair Cook (above) goes through his paces in the nets as England prepare to play Sri Lanka . Wicketkeeper and batsman Jos Buttler (above) takes a catch in the England training session . The established weather pattern puts day-night matches - of which there are four - in particular peril, because rain clouds routinely build up by teatime. Five reserve days are available, but if current conditions persists - as many expect - even they may not be enough to allow for 100 overs. Before then, England have to dodge the storms too in practice and then two warm-up matches on Friday and Sunday. Sawdust for the bowlers was much in evidence to help the bowlers at the SSC nets on Wednesday. But Gurney said: 'Being English, we're all used to a bit of rain. So that doesn't bother anyone really. 'Turning up and having slightly damp footholds is not something any of us are fazed by.' Ian Bell (right) hands out advice to team-mates James Taylor (centre) and Eoin Morgan (left) England cricket coach Peter Moores (right) talks to bowler Steven Finn (left) in training . Extreme humidity is another occupational hazard with which he can happily cope. 'It is quite warm,' said Gurney. 'But most of the guys have been over here in March-April time, when it is really stinking hot. 'This feels relatively pleasant compared to that, so we're okay with it.' As for the further outlook, Gurney has no doubt he and his fellow World Cup hopefuls will beat the weather to state their case for inclusion in the squad Down Under early next year.

"Former England star Kevin Pietersen has offered to participate in school cricket coaching after expressing disappointment in falling participation levels. The England and Wales Cricket Board revealed the results of its National Playing Survey on Wednesday, showing a seven per cent decrease in participation among the Over 14s. Total playing numbers in 2014 were recorded at 844,000, down from 908,000 for the previous season. Kevin Pietersen has offered to coach cricket in schools as he bids to boost the sport's popularity . Poor weather this summer was cited as a potential factor in the drop, but the announcement has been met with consternation within the game. Pietersen, whose own participation levels this year fell somewhat following his sacking by England, took to Twitter to have his say. In a series of messages, the country's leading international run scorer wrote of his dismay at the figures and even opened the door to some grassroots work himself. 'Been off Twitter for a while, but couldn't stay off when I heard about today's announcement re drop off in cricket participation over here,' he said. Pietersen plays a shot for Surrey during the Natwest T20 Blast match against Somerset at The Oval . 'We've got a fantastic pool of talent here in UK & thought of kids dropping out & not fulfilling potential is frightening & needs changing. 'Any school cricket coaches or after school clubs doing winter training, tweet me and I'll pick a couple next week to join you...? 'We need to encourage people of all ages to take part. #ILoveCricket.' Pietersen's offer is sure to gain plenty of interest, his star power apparently undimmed by his removal from the international scene and the subsequent controversies caused by his autobiography. Pietersen caused considerable controversy recently with the launch of his autobiography . Announcing the survey results, ECB chief operating officer Gordon Hollins said: 'ECB recognised the participation challenges that have been facing all team sports and we were determined to gain a greater insight into those issues and find long term solutions. 'To do that ECB changed the way in which it measured participation last year and introduced the new National Cricket Playing Survey as part of our wider efforts to gain a greater understanding of what drives grassroots cricket participation. 'Thanks to an excellent response ECB now has a much clearer picture than ever before of who plays recreational cricket, what type of cricket they prefer to play, when they want to play it, and we are now setting about finding ways in which we can best address their needs going forward. 'We are already working in partnership with our 39 County Cricket Boards as part of a detailed participation review.'","Kevin Pietersen said he was shocked to hear about declining numbers of children playing cricket in England .

"The tension was palpable in Thursday’s drivers’ press conference as Formula One's title contenders’ Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg came face-to-face in Abu Dhabi. Heading into the season finale, Hamilton holds a 17-point lead over his Mercedes team-mate. A second-placed finish will secure the championship. In contrast, it is likely that Rosberg must follow his victory in Brazil with another win in Abu Dhabi to stand any chance of claiming his maiden Formula One title.

"A month after a pay dispute controversially derailed its tour to India, the West Indies Cricket Board has confirmed that 14 top-flight players have been contracted for a three-test series in South Africa. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, the most powerful stakeholder in the game, suspended bilateral ties with the West Indies last month and threatened to claim millions in compensation. There was initially concern about the South Africa tour going ahead next month, but West Indies management took the first step last week by selecting a 15-man squad and giving players a week to sign and return the tour contracts.

"CLICK HERE to read how the German plans to pip Lewis Hamilton to the post in Abu Dhabi . Nico Rosberg offered Lewis Hamilton his hand, and he stared at it as if it had come from Mars, not from the friend of his racing youth. At least boxers look each other in the eye at the weigh-in, even if they are chewing and snarling. But Hamilton found it hard even to meet Rosberg’s gaze when they came together for the traditional handshake of title contenders ahead of Thursday’s press conference. Rosberg was the more chipper of the pair. Shoulders back, a swagger in his step. He took the initiative in putting out his paw. He has nothing to lose. He is already second in the table, 17 points behind his Mercedes colleague going into Sunday’s Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.

Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. Perhaps he felt renewed confidence after his win in Interlagos a fortnight ago. It was maybe the best win of his career and one of the few occasions he has beaten Hamilton in an absolutely straight fight. Hamilton insisted he was not nervous but, if I had a pound for every championship leader who has tried to kid himself into believing that on the eve of the deciding race, I could almost afford a lemonade in the opulent Viceroy hotel overlooking the track. This tension stalked the final pre-race press conference of the season — always the most intense all year. On Thursday, the camera lenses chattered like cicada on the Great Wall of China. It was a far cry from their carefree days as young karters in Team MBM. Half their lifetimes ago they were in Parma with Robert Kubica, a great karting talent lost to Formula One after a rallying accident. Kubica recalled: ‘They would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.’ As Kubica told the BBC: ‘They always wanted to win, to beat each other. It was friendly competition. There was always laughing afterwards.’ Hamilton and Rosberg ate vanilla ice cream in the middle of the night, wrestled and slept in the same room. ‘Probably the first bit of real competition we had was when Nico used to ride a unicycle everywhere,’ said Hamilton. ‘So I thought, “I’ve got to learn to ride this unicycle. I’ve got to be better than him.” I spent all my time outside the go-kart learning to ride this unicycle.’ Ah, they were more innocent days, before the on-track skirmishes of this campaign.

On Thursday, Lewis, wearing a white cap with a Union Flag on the underside of the peak, struggled to smile such was the burden on him. His answers were polite but short. This is largely understandable: he is on the verge of one of the biggest days of his life and he considers reporters’ questions to be unwelcome hoops to jump through en route to the grid on Sunday. Yet despite the world’s glare, he said: ‘I generally feel it’s quite similar to back in the karting days. ‘At that age it was as intense as I had experienced. I wanted to win back then and nothing’s changed.’ Rosberg, separated on the dais from his old buddy by Nico Hulkenberg, was not in total agreement, saying: ‘It’s quite amazing to think now that 15 years later we’re actually in the position we used to dream about: to be in the best F1 team, fighting for the championship, fighting for the race wins. It’s really amazing. ‘It is more intense now. There is more surrounding it — that’s the best way to put it.’ Before the official press conference, the two men conducted their respective media briefings on opposing sides of the Mercedes hospitality area. Rosberg spoke in German, with his assistant Georg, a former Bild journalist, watching on intently. The separation — one drivers’ huddle in one place, the other’s nearby — was reminiscent of Hamilton’s first Formula One championship fight.

There is no special recipe for it.’ Rosberg was a little more honest, saying: ‘It’s an intense situation. But it is the situation I have been looking forward to all my life.’ We could glean more from their body language. Hamilton was tight – or focused. He barely raised a smile though the half an hour of the official press conference. Rosberg was inscrutable. These are big moments in their lives and it showed. But, of course, their body language may count for nothing when their lights go out on Sunday, when Hamilton only needs to finish first or second to be assured of the title.

Under normal circumstances he would only need to finish sixth in Abu Dhabi to guarantee the title, but with double points, he must now finish second. Lewis Hamilton (left) and Nico Rosberg (right) could both win the Formula One championship in Abu Dhabi . Surely that isn’t fair, though? Probably not, and the fans will probably be in uproar if Nico Rosberg triumphs by virtue of the ruling. It doesn’t make any sense for one race to be worth more than another, particularly the soulless surroundings of Abu Dhabi. It would have been a better idea to award double points at one of the blue-riband events; Monaco or Brazil for instance. The Yas Marina circuit in Abu Dhabi hosts the final race of 2014 F1 season, with double points up for grabs . 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points . 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points . Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday week, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. Whose idea was it? You may be unsurprised to hear it was Bernie Ecclestone’s brainchild, the same man who thought the introduction of sprinklers during a race would be a good idea, too. The 84-year-old originally wanted the final three races to carry double points, but failed to get the green light. He’s now distanced himself from it in recent weeks. Indeed, in the build-up to the season finale, he said: ‘One race is stupid but imagine if it was the last three races. It means that somebody would have to have a 150-point advantage minimum to be sure they will win. The teams have not accepted it because they are bloody idiots.’ F1 Chief Executive Bernie Ecclestone poses with Brazilian footballer Pato at the Brazilian Grand Prix . Does that mean double points will be off the menu in 2015 then? It seems that way. The teams and drivers appear unanimous in their disdain for the ruling, and it sounds as though Ecclestone has had enough, too. ‘I don’t know what we are going to do next year,’ he claimed. That said, as it stands, the ruling still forms part of next year’s Sporting Regulations, so action will need to be taken over the winter to ensure they don’t return. ‘Nobody likes the double points,’ Mercedes boss Toto Wolff said. ‘We are going to discuss that next time around, I don’t think Bernie likes them, so it’s probably something we should be getting rid of for next year.’ Rosberg hurls his trophy into the air as Hamilton is awarded his trophy for second place at the Brazilian GP . What happens if Rosberg wins the title then? Will he be viewed as a deserving champion? Many would see it as a case of Hamilton being robbed rather than Rosberg winning fair and square. Indeed, even if Rosberg wins on Sunday it will be his sixth of the season compared to the ten racked up by Hamilton. However, we should not forget that Rosberg has beaten his team-mate in qualifying this season with the Briton widely considered as one of the quickest drivers over one lap in the sport, nor that Hamilton would have lost the title to Felipe Massa in 2008 had the double points ruling been in place then. You can only play to the rules in front of you. Mercedes team-mates Hamilton and Rosberg have been battling each other in a two-horse race all season .","The Formula One season comes to an end in Abu Dhabi on Sunday .

"Owen Farrell is happy to concede centre stage to George Ford when the former school friends start their first England match together in Saturday's QBE International against Samoa. Ford, the Aviva Premiership's form fly-half, has been told 'you're the boss, so get bossing' by Stuart Lancaster as the head coach seeks to address the lack of tried and tested depth in the position. As Lancaster's first-choice 10 for most of his reign, Farrell has become accustomed to the role of team general and the vocal 23-year-old is at ease with the responsibility of giving orders. George Ford (left) and Owen Farrell are in good spirits during England's captain's run at Twickenham . Jonny May (left), Farrell (centre) and Ford walk onto the Twickenham pitch for their final team run on Friday . But against the big-hitting Pacific Islanders he must play second fiddle at inside centre, taking directions from Ford and relinquishing the goalkicking duties he treasures. 'It's George's first start so it's good for him to have the whole responsibility. I know he'll be brilliant,' Farrell said. 'He'll love it and it's good that he's going into the game with the whole package. I agree with what's happening. I'll concentrate on my job, which is helping him out. Farrell will partner his Saracens team-mate Brad Barritt in the centre against the hard-tackling Samoans . 2008 . England Under 16 teammates. Farrell captained the side, Ford had just turned 15. 2008-09 . England Under 18 team-mates. Toured Argentina together in 2008. Toured South Africa in 2009. Finished the season unbeaten. 2011 . England Under 20 teammates. Won U20 Six Nations Grand Slam. Lost 33-22 to New Zealand in U20 World Cup final. 2014 . Ford made senior debut off the bench at Twickenham as a replacement for Farrell against Wales in the Six Nations. 'I like the responsibility of goalkicking, but I'll not be too down-heartened about not doing it because I have a job to concentrate on.' Despite his competitive nature, Farrell does not resent losing his cherished fly-half jersey to his former England age grade team-mate. 'I'm chuffed to be playing. I didn't for one second think that even if things were going brilliantly and we were winning every game that I was going to start every game from now until whenever,' Farrell said. 'I've never been that naive to think I'd play every game. This is a chance to try something different.' Lancaster has been longing for the chance to start Ford and Farrell as twin playmakers, a partnership that has only been seen briefly during the Bath 21-year-old's previous appearances as a replacement. But the selection has drawn criticism with Lancaster forced to deny Farrell is 'undroppable' in response to his poor performances in the three-point defeats by New Zealand and South Africa. Former England scrum-halves Austin Healey and Matt Dawson have also questioned the logic of picking a fly-half like Ford, who stands flat and attacks the line, only to then deploy a limited offensive midfield outside him in Farrell and Brad Barritt. Ford (left) played alongside Farrell (right) for England at the Junior World Cup in 2011 . The head coach referenced Mike Catt's occasional presence alongside Jonny Wilkinson in the 2003 World Cup-winning team in explaining the need to develop the option of having two fly-halves in the backline and Farrell gives his view on how his partnership with Ford will work. 'I'm not an out-and-out classic centre. What we will try to do is get some organisation to hopefully give a couple of options. I'll obviously be playing one pass out, but I'll still be playing the same way,' Farrell said. 'I don't think I'll pipe down, it'll be a different way of talking, more about feeding information in. 'It will be more about giving George options and there will be times where I'm sure we'll swap around. We can afford to interchange like that.' Starting XV: Mike Brown (Harlequins), Anthony Watson (Bath), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Jonny May (Gloucester), George Ford (Bath), Ben Youngs (Leicester), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Rob Webber (Bath), David Wilson (Bath), Dave Attwood (Bath), Courtney Lawes (Northampton), James Haskell (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins, capt), Ben Morgan (Gloucester).

"Jenson Button claims he has been placed in an 'uncomfortable situation' by McLaren chief Ron Dennis' dithering. Button should have known by now whether he had a future with the team beyond this season as Dennis promised over two months ago to deliver an answer on his driver line-up ahead of this weekend's year-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. Button and team-mate Kevin Magnussen, however, were informed this week they would be kept in limbo until December 1 at the earliest as to who will partner Fernando Alonso in 2015. Jenson Button is pictured in the Abu Dhabi paddock ahead of the final race of the campaign . The Briton could be competing in his final race with Fernando Alonso set to replace him next season . Via a statement, seemingly in Dennis' words, the team claimed 'the optimal driver line-up is clearly an important process, and it is therefore one that requires precise and prolonged analysis'. Just how long it requires Dennis to decide between the experience of a world champion and a driver at the end of his first year, but who he rates very highly, has been a hot topic on social media. Certainly there was the feeling Button, in particular, given his longevity and standing in the sport, has been treated shabbily. There is also a train of thought that as Button apparently has other options, Dennis is delaying matters to force him into opting for the exit door, so leaving the Group CEO with an easy choice. Alonso shares a joke with Button in Thursday's press conference after the Spaniard was asked who he wanted to team up with at McLaren next year. Alonso (left) announced he was officially leaving Ferrari on Thursday after five years with the Italian team . Assessing the latest twist in the saga over his future, Button said: 'It's been an interesting few months. 'When you're in Formula One for so many years - 15 years - you have blinkers on in terms of anything else apart from Formula One. 'This is the best sport in the world, this is your life, this is everything. But when you are put in an uncomfortable situation your eyes are opened to other possibilities. 'There are a lot of challenges out there, whether it's in motorsport, another sport or something else altogether. 'I'm open to many things in life, and for me I love what I do for a living, I love racing in Formula One. 'The time I have spent with McLaren, OK the last two years have been a bit tricky because of the results, but in terms of the personnel, they're mega. 'We had a barbecue on Wednesday night, and there is such a good atmosphere in this team. It is like a big family, and I have loved working with them. 'But will I wait for the decision? That's something I can't comment on right now.' Ahead of the race at the Yas Marina circuit, Button is hoping the outcome will play no part in Dennis' thinking. 'Personally, I would hope not,' added Button. 'I would hope a result would not change my fate for the future. I feel I bring a lot more to the team than just one race. I would hope my career would speak a lot louder than one individual race.'","Button is out of contract with McLaren at the end of the current campaign .

"London Welsh have signed Wales rugby league star Elliot Kear from Bradford. The 25-year-old claimed 17 tries in 55 Super League appearances across three seasons at the Bulls, but will now jump straight into the Exiles' Aviva Premiership relegation dogfight. The promoted outfit have suffered seven straight league defeats and are already eight points behind closest rivals Newcastle in the early standings. Wales international Elliot Kear has signed for rugby league side London Welsh from Bradford . Kear scored for Welsh in a 64-0 pre-season friendly victory over Henley, and now head coach Justin Burnell believes he will make a quick impact at the Old Deer Park club. 'Elliot had some excellent performances for Bradford in the Super League last year and won numerous man-of-the-match awards, most notably against Wigan,' said Burnell. 'He's got a lot of pace and he's a fantastic addition to our squad.' Kear admitted his Welsh move allows him to realise a long-held ambition to cross codes. The 15-cap Wales league international said the Exiles remain adamant they can still beat the drop, ahead of hosting Leicester at Oxford's Kassam Stadium on Sunday. London Welsh head coach Justin Burnell described the signing of Kear as a 'fantastic addition' 'I've always wanted to play rugby union and to have signed for London Welsh and to play at the highest level is definitely something I've wanted to do for a long time,' he said. 'Hopefully now I can take my chance and be the best I can be. Everyone is extremely focused at London Welsh and everyone has the view that we can still stay up - it only takes a few results. 'That's what we're searching for now, a result, and hopefully we can get that on the weekend.'","Elliot Kear scored 17 tries in 55 games and three seasons for Bradford .

"If Andy Robinson had led Scotland to victory over Tonga two years ago, it’s possible that Vern Cotter would still be enjoying French cuisine rather than being introduced to the culinary delights of a Killie pie. It was the defeat at the hands of the South Sea Islanders at Pittodrie that led to the Englishman’s resignation — and opened the door, eventually, for the Cotter era. Delayed for a year after the SRU refused to buy out the final 12 months of his contract at Clermont Auvergne, the change has been worth waiting for if the Kiwi’s first six matches in charge are anything to go by. Vern Cotter prepares his Scotland players for their Autumn international against Tonga . Scotland look a team reborn and go into the match against Tonga at Rugby Park looking to make it five wins out of seven under Cotter, the only defeats coming against the top two sides in world rugby, New Zealand and South Africa. The head coach’s time in charge has led to a change in fortunes of not just the team but also of back-row forward Johnnie Beattie, who had never been a Robinson favourite. In fact, the former Glasgow star was so far out of the picture under him, he didn’t even make the 60-strong training squad put together for the three defeats to New Zealand, South Africa and Tonga in 2012 that eventually led to his resignation. Beattie holds no ill-will against Robinson, but if he had still been in charge, perhaps the 29-year-old would have been on club duty for Castres this weekend rather taking the field at No 8 for his country. The focus is the future, however, not what might have been, and Beattie knows how tough it will be to win a regular starting place in a Scotland team playing what he believes is the best, most exciting rugby he has seen since he made his debut against Romania in 2006. Back-row forward Johnnie Beattie has been given a new lease of life under Cotter's regime . The way Cotter, not the most demonstrative of men, has gone about his business since he took over last summer, has convinced him the national team is going places. ‘There is no selling of the sizzle with him,’ said Beattie. ‘There is no razzmatazz and falseness. ‘He is just a good old-fashioned bloke, who is a good rugby coach. Already we can see after two games of the Autumn Tests his imprint, his game plan, his structures and how he wants us to go about our play. We are definitely in a better place under him. ‘Overall, he has made minor adjustments and has changed the basic structures of our play. How we get into phase play, how we keep the ball, how we stretch defences. All those things, those simple things, he has come in and implemented in a better way. ‘It is quite clear he has made a massive difference, especially when you realise this is mainly the same group of players, with a few youngsters coming in, that he is working with compared to coaches before.’ Scotland players line up as they look to make it fives wins out of seven under Cotter . Beattie, who celebrated his 29th birthday on Friday, believes the Scotland fans are also buying into the Cotter era, with the atmosphere against New Zealand the best he had ever experienced at BT Murrayfield. ‘The rugby we are producing is making it more of a spectacle for our supporters and we saw that from the support we got against New Zealand,’ he continued. ‘We did not win, granted, but the effort, our ability to retain the ball, the ability to stretch teams, meant we gave the supporters something to shout about. I have not seen that level of support pretty much since I have been involved. ‘That game against New Zealand was the first time I have been back at Murrayfield since we lost to England in the Six Nations nine months ago, when we got humped 20-0. Scotland showed their recent improvement, despite losing to New Zealand at Murrayfield . ‘We showed absolutely nothing and produced absolutely nothing and could not create anything for our fans to get behind us for or to enjoy. In that space of time, to go where we have been to where we are now is great and very encouraging, but the important thing is we keep working and keep getting better.’ The competition for the No 8 jersey is fierce. South African Josh Strauss will be eligible to play for Scotland through residency in time for the 2015 World Cup and with Adam Ashe, David Denton and Ryan Wilson also in contention, the match on the artificial surface at Rugby Park is a vital one for Beattie. He wasn’t picked for the 2011 World Cup in New Zealand and is determined not let the showpiece occasion in England next year pass him by. Beattie missed out on the last World Cup but is determined not to let England 2015 pass him by . ‘I would love to be involved in the World Cup but rugby is a funny old game and you never know what is going to happen,’ said Beattie. ‘In the life of a professional rugby player, you see injuries all the time, players in and out, coaches change their views on you. ‘I didn’t make Andy Robinson’s squad two years ago and I know things can change very quickly, so I am under no illusions how hard I have to work to be retained by this coaching team and the effort I have to put in. ‘It starts against Tonga today on an artificial surface on which it is hard to keep your feet. Everyone will have to work hard to keep up at scrum time and at rucks so we don’t give away stupid penalties. ‘This is a big game for all of us, including me, and is my chance to impress Vern and to be part of what I think could be a very good time for Scotland going forward.’","Scotland face Tonga in their QBE Autumn International Test on Saturday .

"Former St Helens scrum-half Sean Long has returned to the club as an assistant coach. The 38-year-old enjoyed 13 decorated seasons with the Saints, winning 11 team trophies and the Lance Todd award for man of the match in the Challenge Cup Final three times. He left Saints in 2009 for Hull but retirement soon followed due to injury, and he has since drifted around the coaching scene, working with Wigan, Salford and Samoa. Former St Helens scrum-half Sean Long will return to the club as assistant coach next season . A move to Langtree Park is a real homecoming, though, and he has signed a two-year deal to work under Keiron Cunningham, his former team-mate who is readying himself for his first spell as the head coach. Cunningham has replaced Nathan Brown in the top job after he returned to Australia in the wake of his side's Grand Final triumph over Wigan.

"Wigan have received the go-ahead to play their World Club Series clash with Brisbane Broncos at the DW Stadium. The Grand Final runners up had drawn up contingency plans to take the game on Saturday, February 21, to an alternative venue because it clashed with Wigan Athletic's Sky Bet Championship match against Charlton - but the Latics agreed to bring their fixture forward to the Friday. Joel Tomkins celebrates his try for Wigan Warriors against Warrington Wolves at the DW Stadium . Wigan chairman Ian Lenagan said: 'Sometimes clashes like this cannot be helped when two teams share a stadium but Wigan Athletic have been very helpful and we are thankful for that. 'The Wigan club has a great tradition in this competition and talk is already building ahead of what should be a fantastic game with Brisbane.' The match is part of an expanded World Club Challenge, for which tickets went on sale on Friday. The action kicks off on Friday, February 20, when Warrington host St George Illawarra and reaches a climax on Sunday, February 22, when Super League champions St Helens take on NRL Grand Final winners South Sydney for the right to be crowned world champions.

"England forward Lee Mossop has cut short his injury-hit stint in the NRL to rejoin Wigan. The 25-year-old prop left the Warriors after their Grand Final win over Warrington 12 months ago and joined Parramatta on a two-year contract, with an option for a third season with the Sydney club. However, he was sidelined for the first three months of the season with a shoulder injury and missed the end of it after undergoing surgery on the problem for a second time. Lee Mossop (pictured winning the Challenge Cup final in 2013) has re-signed for Wigan Warriors . Now he is back with the Warriors, having signed a three-year deal, with the option of a fourth in the club's favour, although chairman Ian Lenagan says they have inserted a clause in his contract in case the player fails to make a full recovery from his latest operation. Mossop, who becomes the second England international to rejoin Wigan in the last six months following Joel Tomkins' return from rugby union, said: 'I have enjoyed my time with Parramatta but I felt it was the right time to return to the UK. 'Wigan was always going to be my first choice and I am really happy that we have been able to agree a deal. 'I owe a lot to this club having come through the youth system. The squad is a bit younger now and I hope to be able to pass on my experience to some of the other players. I was at the Grand Final last month cheering the boys on and hope to be back there again next season.' Mossop, who made 111 appearances in his first spell with the club, was wanted by Leeds, who are looking to bolster their front row after releasing Ryan Bailey and Ian Kirke in recent weeks, but Wigan had first option on him. They will need to release players to make room for Mossop under their salary cap and it is thought Scott Taylor and possibly Gil Dudson could now be moved on. Wigan coach Shaun Wane said: 'As soon as I heard that he might be available, I asked (rugby manager) Kris Radlinski and Ian Lenagan to see if it was possible and I am grateful that they have done just that. 'I am pleased also for Lee showing loyalty to the club. Having seen the fans welcome Joel Tomkins back earlier this year, I am looking forward to seeing them give Lee a great reception at the DW next season.' Shane Wane (pictured celebrating the Super League win in October) is pleased that Mossop is back at the club . Wigan say Mossop will miss the start of the new season but is expected to recover from his latest shoulder operation in time to make his return in late February. Lenagan said: 'We are aware that Lee has had issues with his shoulders in the past which did not resolve with keyhole surgery but he has now had advanced surgery to put them right and our medical specialist advise that statistics have proven the surgery to work in 97 per cent of shoulder cases. 'As is the case in instances like this, we have put provisions in Lee's contract to protect the club against recurrence. 'We all know that a fit Lee Mossop is one of the best front rowers in the game and I have confidence in my coaching staff to bring the best out of him again and, hopefully, even more with his shoulder problems fixed. 'Lee had a lot of interest from rival clubs but preferred to be back at Wigan. 'This is another positive for Wigan and for rugby league in this country and serves only to vindicate our policy of allowing players to play in other competitions whilst keeping the option available for them to return to the club in the future. 'With this deal, there will now be a few consequential changes to our squad for the 2015 season to follow.'","Lee Mossop will enjoy a second spell at Wigan Warriors .

"Emerging half-back Liam Sutcliffe has signed a new three-year deal with Leeds. The 19-year-old made his first-team breakthrough in the just-ended season, making 26 appearances and winning the Challenge Cup along the way. The former Hunslet amateur is seen as one of the long-term successors to the current creative trio of Rob Burrow, Danny McGuire and Kevin Sinfield, who have formed the backbone of Leeds' era of success. Half-back Liam Sutcliffe has signed a new three-year deal with Leeds Rhinos . All have been mainstays over six title wins but - at 32, 31 and 34, respectively - will not be around for another decade and chief executive Gary Hetherington has spoken of a need for some continuity beyond the club's older heads. 'As soon as Gary said the club would like to offer me a longer deal, I was more than happy to sign,' Sutcliffe said. 'I grew up dreaming of playing for the Rhinos and there is no other club I want to play for. 'I liked the comments Gary made about building a squad for the future around our young players and that does give us a boost. The 19-year-old has been rewarded for an impressive breakthrough season . 'The squad will have a period of transition over the next few years and for all the squad to know the vision for us as a group is both reassuring and acts as motivation for us to carry on the great traditions of success over the last decade.' Coach Brian McDermott added: 'Liam has already shown he has all the qualities needed to succeed at the Super League level. 'He is still developing his natural game, but we saw last year that the foundations are definitely there.'","Liam Sutcliffe signs three-year extension with Leeds Rhinos .

"Injured Liam Davies battled through the pain to conjure an amazing fightback and ensure Collingtree Park were crowned men’s champions in the Mail on Sunday Classic. Just 10 days before the grand finals, the electrician fell off the roof of a house he is building and injured his ribs as he landed on a supporting wall although that stopped him dropping a further 20 feet. ‘I realise how lucky I am to be here,’ said Davies. ‘I stepped where I thought there was something and fell. My first thought when I hit the wall was that’s it, I can’t play.’ Collingtree Park Golf Club celebrate their win in The Mail on Sunday Golf Club Classic 2014 . The six-handicapper was in agony and did not play in the semi-final against Worthing, which his club won 3-2, but he agreed to play against experienced Seaton Carew. The team from Hartlepool had knocked out The Shire London in the other semi-final after Robert McGahan beat John Murray in a nail-biting shootout which was decided at the 20th hole. It was the third time the club had reached the grand finals of the biggest golf club team event in the world and the talent in their ranks was reflected in a combined handicap of just two. Yet there was added motivation for Collingtree Park. They were desperate to win for their club captain, Adrian Kilshaw, who is recovering from heart surgery. He suffered a heart attack during the Northampton club’s first-round match, but recovered to help them through some of the later rounds. Three weeks ago he underwent further surgery which prevented him from taking part in the finals. Dan Messom, took the first point for Collingtree Park, winning 3&2 at the testing North Course at El Rompido. Andy Billson increased their lead with a 5&3 win. Seaton Carew then levelled the tie with a 5&3 victory for Jonathan Conley and McGahan won 4&3. Collingtree Park Golf Club beat Seaton Carew 3-2 in the Mail on Sunday Classic . Davies, who needed pain-killers and wore strapping, was two down after 11 holes against Kris Diamond but the 49-year-old managed to sink a 15-foot putt at the 12th to stay in the match. ‘If I didn’t get that the game would have been pretty much all over. The last thing I wanted was for it all to come down to me, but that’s what happened,’ he said. Despite the pressure, Davies went on to claw back the deficit with a birdie at the 13th and notching a par at the 14th to go all square. He then holed a 40-foot putt at the tricky 16th to go one up and gain the upper hand. At the crucial 17th, Diamond hit his tee shot out of bounds but just when it looked like Davies could take advantage, his second shot bounced in to some long grass and it seemed that his ball had been lost. But in true sporting fashion, Seaton Carew supporters found it, allowing Davies to go on and win 2&1 and seal Collingtree Park’s 3-2 triumph. Billson summed up the emotion, saying: ‘As an amateur golfer, it doesn’t get any better. The fact one of Seaton Carew’s supporters found our ball epitomised what the game of golf is about. They should be very proud of their club. ‘It is a totally unbelievable victory because of how good they were. Our mantra has always been keep the match alive as long as you can and there’s always a chance.’ The tears flowed as Lin Kay’s team became the pride of Farnham by winning the women’s title in the Mail on Sunday Classic. The Surrey club notched a 4-1 victory over Whittington Heath and club champion Karen Stevens, who won 4 & 3, said: ‘Although we all wanted to win our own matches, we wanted to do it for Farnham. We wanted to do it for the people at home and put us on the map.’ With no single handicappers, and knowing they would face more experienced golfers at El Rompido, the team were given team golf lessons and took on a men’s team in preparation for the main event — and beat them 4-1. Farnham Golf Club celebrate their 4-1 victory over Whittington Heath . In the semi-final they saw off an experienced side from South Moor 4-1 while Whittington Heath knocked out Sale 3-2. Team captain Kay had to make some difficult decisions, as she had a squad of six players and made a tactical switch for the final. She replaced club captain Judith Nicoll who had won in the semi-final with Melanie Wilson. Kay said: ‘You have to use every shot you can. I told them before we came out that one would play one day and one the next. ‘I chose Judith for the semi-finals as she was getting one extra shot. Melanie came back fighting. I didn’t need to give the girls a pep talk. They were so up for it.’ Nicoll added: ‘Lin made very good decisions and I think that helped. She showed her faith in everybody. She’s been brilliant.’ Lin Kay Captain of Farnham Golf Club celebrates their win in The Mail on Sunday Golf Club Classic . All the team refer to Elaine Lewis as their ‘rock’ and she showed why. In the semi-final the 16-handicapper came back from four down to clinch a vital half and in the final she fought back from three down to win 2&1. ‘It’s totally amazing little old Farnham have done this. The whole club is behind us and they’ve been calling us the pride of Farnham,’ said Lewis. Kate Sear, who went out first for the team and halved her match admitted: ‘It was petrifying. I did not stop shaking. It was up and down all day. We only had three halves all the way through. I was terrified I’d lose for the team, so I dug in to get the half.’ Val Talbot, who won 3&1, said: ‘It’s helped my golf. It seriously has improved my concentration.’ And Wilson, who secured another half, summed up the success when she added: ‘It’s been like being a lady pro for three days. You watch it on telly and you see these really confident ladies and we’ve just tasted that. It’s been wonderful.’","Liam Davies fell off the roof of a house he is building ten days before event .

"Former Hull KR boss Craig Sandercock is back in the NRL as Rick Stone's assistant at Newcastle . Australian Craig Sandercock has been given his old job back at Newcastle Knights.
