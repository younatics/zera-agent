David Cameron has been warned to expect a leadership challenge if  he tries to force the  Conservative Party into another coalition. A close ally of the Prime Minister said the party would ‘come for him’ if he fails to win a majority at the 2015 general election. Mr Cameron is said to be prepared to offer Tory MPs a vote on any future coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats to bind them into a decision to go for a new pact, just as Nick Clegg did with his MPs in 2010. Future plans: David Cameron has privately discussed plans to ensure a power-share agreement if he fails to win a majority in 2015, it has been claimed . But Conservative MPs yesterday said that the party ‘will not swallow another coalition’ and demanded that party members, as well as MPs, are given power of veto. They privately warned that Mr Cameron’s critics could seek to oust him if he tries to team up with Mr Clegg again. One of the Prime Minister’s closest advisers told the Mail: ‘They won’t move against David before the election but if he doesn’t win a majority they will come for him. ‘Some people are champing at the bit for a leadership  contest. Our job is to make sure that there isn’t one.’ Possible candidate: MP Adam Afriyie . Some 25 MPs are thought to have pledged loyalty to prospective leadership candidate Adam Afriyie, who has said the Tories should never go into a coalition. He is holding a rebel summit next month. Up to 100 MPs are said to be defiantly opposed to any further coalition – numbers that could entice better-known rivals, such as Boris Johnson, into a leadership challenge. One MP said: ‘If Cameron pushes for another deal with Clegg, it will be a gift for Boris.’ Another claimed that planning for a coalition was a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’. And with MPs queuing up to air their concerns,  Peter Bone said: ‘If we don’t win an outright majority we should govern as a minority government.’ He called for plans to give party members veto powers over the formation of a coalition to be discussed at the Tory conference next month. Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, agreed. He said: ‘I think it’s essential. If there were to be another hung parliament where coalition was a possible outcome, then I think it’s important that all of the parties that might be a part of that have a proper full discussion and participate in the decision-making process.’ Former Tory donor Lord Ashcroft tweeted: ‘Any proposal for a second coalition should be put to all party members.’ MP Douglas Carswell said the current coalition was presented as a ‘fait accompli’. He added: ‘I think the coalition agreement we have at the moment sold us short.’ Philip Hollobone MP said: ‘I do not think anyone wants a coalition, apart from the LibDems because they will not get into government any other way.’ A Tory party spokesman said: ‘We are working for a majority Conservative government.’","David Cameron may be challenged as Tory leader after 2015 .

A three-month-old baby died after an ambulance took three times the target time to reach her because it stopped to refuel and then got lost twice. Bella Hellings' mother Amy Carter called for an ambulance when the infant suffered a fit at home and stopped breathing. But instead of reaching the infant within the recommended eight minutes it took paramedics - who were the third ambulance to be called - 26 minutes to arrive at the scene. The health trust responsible for the crew has now identified a 'catalogue of errors' in a damning report into the tragedy. Three-month-old Bella Hellings, pictured with her mother Amy Carter, died after an ambulance took three times the target time to reach her because it stopped to refuel then got lost twice . East of England Ambulance Service Trust's (EEAST) own investigation into the blunders has found: . By the time Bella was seen by a doctor she had not been breathing for almost an hour and was pronounced dead. In addition, Bella's family claim the paramedics insensitively joked about creaking knees when they first bent down to scoop up the baby. And during the journey back to the hospital the crew casually talked about their weekend, the family claim. By the time Bella was seen by a doctor she had not been breathing for almost an hour and was pronounced dead . EEAST, which is already under fire for other similar tragedies, has said it is now recruiting more frontline staff to improve its service. But Bella's family have called for more to be done ahead of an inquest, which will rule on the blunders' contribution to the infant's death. Bella's devastated mother Miss Carter and father, lorry driver Scott Hellings, both 24, have slammed the ambulance trust as a 'shambles'. In a statement released through their solicitor, the couple said: 'We see this report as an important first step towards establishing the facts and ensuring a dramatic improvement in the ambulance service. 'It was a catalogue of errors. The report portrays an organization in a complete shambles. 'Little Bella was one of five patients to die following ambulance delays during March alone. 'For years it was known there was an alarming problem, but warnings went unheeded. 'There is however no evidence that staff on the ground were responsible for the problems, and we can only wonder what their morale must be like.' The damning report was compiled following Bella's death on March 11, after her family made an official complaint. The health trust responsible for the crew has now identified a 'catalogue of errors' in a damning report into the tragedy . Bella stopped breathing at around 11am at her home in Thetford, Norfolk, after suffering a fit and her mother dialled 999. It was the third time the mother had called an ambulance amid concerns for her daughter. On the first occasion the crew arrived in just two minutes and Amy and paramedics managed to revive her. The second incident was more serious and after the ambulance promptly arrived Bella was taken to hospital. On the third, fatal occasion, the report alleges the series of 'failures' took place during the critical 26 minutes it took an ambulance to reach the patient. The report details how the first ambulance sent to the call was already treating a patient in a Norwich hospital, 30 miles away. The ambulance went round a roundabout on the outskirts of Bury St Edmunds twice before taking the longer route to A&E. The new report also revealed that an air ambulance was dispatched with a clinician on board, but the other ambulance wasn't notified and had by this time collected the patient. It also explains when the baby finally reached A&E she was carried inside by a medic, rather than been wheeled on a stretcher, which would have allowed treatment to take place. Speaking when the EEAST confirmed it was investigating Bella's death Amy, also mother to son Ryan, four, said: 'The people who are meant to help failed Bella. If they had got to her in time she would be alive today.' The family's lawyer Sharon Allison, a medical negligence specialist with Ashton KCJ, says the family will consider their legal position after the inquest, in September. A spokesman for the EEAST said: 'We can confirm that a thorough internal investigation has taken place and the findings have been shared as appropriate ahead of the coroner's inquest which is being held in Norfolk in September. 'As a Trust, we are in the process of recruiting more frontline staff and getting more ambulances on the road in order to improve our performance for patients living in those areas of most need. 'This approach is borne out of our turnaround plan published in April and, in effect, by increasing staffing and resources, we can help reduce journey times of crews and ensure that we are responding to patients more quickly.' Bella's death is one of five the EEAST, which covers Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, is currently facing questions over. It has been criticised for almost two years over its poor response times, particularly in rural areas, before it was reviewed. All five non-executive directors of the Trust have since resigned.","Baby died after ambulance took three times the target time to reach her .

Police chiefs wanted to use money donated in memory of the Hillsborough disaster to pay for a holiday flat for officers, it has emerged. South Yorkshire Police also suggested using Hillsborough Disaster Fund donations to pay for microwaves for police station kitchens and new gym equipment. The suggestions were given in 1991 after trustees of the fund asked the force for ideas on how to spend 'residual money'. South Yorkshire Police wanted to use money donated in memory of the 96 people killed at Hillsborough for a holiday flat for officers. Pictured, Liverpool fans pay their respects ahead of a match in 2011 . The Hillsborough Disaster Fund money was raised through donations from Liverpool FC, the city council and sales from a charity single featuring Paul McCartney and Gerry Marsden. Pictured: A floral tribute to the victims . Former Merseyside chief constable Sir Norman Bettison wanted £2,000 to refurbish the reception area of his police station . The majority of the £12million fund had been given to families, survivors and others affected by the disaster, including match stewards at the stadium. But a significant amount of 'residual' funds remained, and its trustees asked police and other organisations for ideas on how they might be used. Former Merseyside chief constable Norman Bettison, then a superintendent based in South Yorkshire Police’s F Division, requested £2,000 to refurbish the reception area of his police station, according to the documents released by the Hillsborough Independent Panel. The proposal for a holiday flat 'either . home or abroad' came from Chief Inspector John Donnelly, who was in . charge of policing Sheffield city centre on the day of the disaster. He said it should be used by officers and their families. Other ideas included new blinds for the force’s casualty bureau and 'better gifts' for officers on sick leave. None of the projects are believed to have been approved by the fund’s trustees. The disaster fund included £100,000 from Liverpool FC, as well as money from Liverpool city council and the proceeds of a charity version of Ferry Cross the Mersey featuring Paul McCartney and Gerry Marsden, which was number one for three weeks in May and June, 1989. Chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, said: 'It is one of the most shocking things I’ve heard in a long time. 'It’s not something I was previously aware of and to hear how, even in 1991 when it was clear to everyone that the police were to blame they were suggesting money should go to them to pay for microwaves and holidays, it is quite hard to believe. 'And to hear Bettison suggesting money should go to refurbish a police station is sickening. 'People often think all of that money went to the families, but they are wrong. A lot of it went elsewhere. 'I feel that 96 people died for that money - and they wanted to use it for new microwaves. It’s despicable.' A total of 96 football fans died at Hillsborough in 1989 because of overcrowding at the ground . A policeman tells the referee to stop the match. Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, said the police suggestions for spending the fund money is 'one of the most shocking things I've heard' A submission from the force’s D Division asked for gymnasium equipment, including exercise bikes, and microwaves, which it said were 'always being requested' at police stations. In his proposal, Mr Bettison identified the police control room at Hillsborough as being in need of repair, but concluded 'the room is the responsibility of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and the police would therefore be deriving no benefit from such a contribution.' He added: 'I therefore propose a preferred option that if funds are available then Hammerton Road Police Station, which was used as a reception area for friends and relatives of those who died in the disaster, should benefit.' Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign said: 'What makes me feel so angry about this is the fact that I asked the disaster fund would they give a small amount of money for a person who lost a family member at Hillsborough for her bus fares to college for an access course. Sheila Coleman, of the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, said it shows the 'contempt officers had for the families' 'And the reply I received was ""No, the . families have already had money"". I think there are people very close to . Hillsborough who have to search their consciences now for what they . agreed to in allowing those funds to be wound up.' She added: 'This shows the contempt authorities had for Hillsborough families and victims. It’s disgraceful.' Deputy Chief Constable Andy Holt from South Yorkshire Police told the BBC said the force formally submitted suggestions after being approached by trustees of the fund. He told the BBC: 'As a result, South Yorkshire Police formally submitted a number of suggestions to the trustees of the Hillsborough Disaster Fund which included enhancing the quality of the police control rooms at Hillsborough and other football stadia to improve public safety and the policing of future football matches. 'Other suggestions included the provision of better equipment for the Force's Casualty Bureau, the creation of an Occupational Health Unit and a number of community-based projects.'

'Evil' plot: Nilanka De Silva, 34, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was today sent to prison for 20 months . A cash-strapped currency exchange owner was today jailed for recruited a gang of thieves to steal £10,000 from his wealthy mistress. Nilanka De Silva, 34, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, was sent to prison for 20 months after hatching the ‘evil’ plot in a desperate attempt to pay back a debt of £40,000 he owed to lover Kirti Mistry. The holistic therapist was left traumatised after she was mugged at Victoria Coach Station in Central London as she headed to Leicester to pay for medical treatment for her mother. She confided in De Silva, unaware he was responsible for the attack, and the plot was only exposed because one of the thieves was an experienced criminal under police surveillance. Sentencing married father-of-two De Silva, Recorder Francis Bacon said: ‘You hatched what I consider to be a thoroughly dishonest and evil plan to give her some money and arrange for this money to be stolen. ‘You were the person Ms Mistry confided in and you pretended you had nothing to do with what happened on that day. You behaved abysmally and you have brought shame upon yourself, your family and everyone who knows you.’ De Silva’s gang members Christopher Wynter, 34, Pedro Lewis, also 34, Blaine Ryan, 22, and Matthew Williams, 29, were jailed for a total of four-and-a-half years. Wynter was jailed for 18 months, Lewis for 14 months, Williams for 12 months and Ryan for 10 months. Prosecutor James Norman told Southwark Crown Court: ‘De Silva was in an intimate relationship with Ms Mistry and knew she was transporting a large amount of cash. ‘He arranged for the cash to be stolen . by the other defendants. Ms Mistry met De Silva in 2010. Their contact . fizzled out but they met in 2012 and a sexual relationship developed. ‘She . took up a premises a stone’s throw from De Silva’s currency exchange in . Greenwich. She gave him £40,000 in cash, her savings. ‘She did that because she trusted him to . look after it for her and he persuaded her that it would be safer at his . business premises rather than at her flat, and she believed him.’ Attack: The holistic therapist was left traumatised after she was mugged at Victoria Coach Station (pictured) in Central London as she headed to Leicester to pay for medical treatment for her mother . But on February 22 this year she asked . for the £40,000 back because she needed it to pay for her mother’s . treatment. Mr Norman said: ‘He was unable to give her any money and for . the succeeding few days avoided her. 'You behaved abysmally and you have brought shame upon yourself, your family and everyone who knows you' Recorder Francis Bacon . ‘When she eventually got hold of him, he told her he would have half the money by March and the remainder by the middle of the following week.’ When De Silva learned she was travelling with £10,000 on March 3 he plotted to steal it and pay her back with her own money. He tipped off Wynter, who tasked Ryan to drop off Williams in Greenwich to follow her to Victoria. Lewis . was ready to pounce when she arrived at the coach station in the . afternoon, Southwark Crown Court heard. Andy Hill, defending De Silva, . said he planned to sell his house to repay his ex-lover. Sentencing: Southwark Crown Court (pictured) heard De Silva planned to sell his house to repay his ex-lover . ‘He holds himself responsible for the sums of money that are outstanding to the victim and he feels he betrayed her. He was in a relationship with Ms Mistry . and there is a betrayal of her by his actions. 'He is unable to look . himself in the mirror because of what he has done, not only to her but . his own family and his own prospects.’ 'He is unable to look himself in the mirror because of what he has done, not only to her but his own family and his own prospects' Andy Hill, defending Nilanka De Silva . Tejal-Rome Karia, representing Lewis, said he became involved in the plot to ‘clear some debts and loosen the noose around his neck for a while', adding: ‘He was not involved in the planning of the offence and does not know De Silva and Wynter.’ Richard Barrett, for Ryan, a father of two, said he only became involved on the day and was ‘genuinely remorseful’. De Silva, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent; Wynter, of Hampton, Surrey; Ryan, of Willesden, north-west London; Williams, of Maida Vale, west London; and Lewis, of Willesden, all admitted conspiracy to steal.

Police are investigating whether thieves targeted the home of Olympian Rebecca Adlington after being tipped off that she was out by the star's Twitter feed. The 24-year-old swimming star revealed how she was reduced to 'absolute pieces' when she thought her Olympic medals had been stolen in the raid on her home in Romiley, Stockport, yesterday - then later described her relief after the irreplaceable items were found safe. It has emerged that, just hours before the break-in in Stockport, Adlington had tweeted a photograph to her some 335,000 Twitter followers of her enjoying an 'amazing meal' with friends in London.

Prolific: The Olympic champion kept her Twitter followers updated on the unfolding drama . Describing her panic, she said '...you can't insure Olympic medals, and although you can get them . replaced - I'd know they weren't the originals. 'Added to this was the fact that we were a three hour drive from home . and desperate to get home to see our house and the state it was now in,' said Adlington. 'When the police arrived, I was on the phone to them trying to figure . out how the break-in had happened and what had been taken.

Russia's Emergency Ministry scrambled helicopters to rescue the brown bears (pictured) from flood waters after they were found trapped in their cages . Two stranded Russian brown bears were dramatically rescued from rising flood waters after emergency services scrambled helicopters to airlift them to safety. The bears were stuck in cages and could not escape the floods, which are the worst the country's Far East has seen in 120 years. Russia's Emergencies Ministry launched a pair of helicopters on Saturday to rescue the bears from the flooded region near Blagoveschensk. The animals were found by rescue workers at a tourist camp base where they were being kept in cages. They had been bought several years ago from a zoo in Ivanovo. Helicopters winched the cages from the site and delivered them to higher ground. Both the Amur . river, the Zeya tributary have flooded in Siberia, forcing tens of . thousands of residents in the Amur and Khabarovsk regions to evacuate. Russian TV has shown footage of military vehicles carrying people away from flooded areas. Although . some 20,000 people have been evacuated from the flooded areas, Russian . news reports indicate that many have chosen to remain and not leave . their homes. The floods hit three regions along the Chinese border in the Far East, 3,000 miles from Moscow, and some of those evacuated have moved into 166 emergency shelters. The flooding, set off by torrential rains, has already affected 140 towns and villages across the broad area. The helicopter carried the bears' cage to the safety of higher ground and away from the flood waters . The Amur region has been the worst affected, but the flooding there has passed its peak. The Amur River, which has reached a record high, is still rising and could flood Komsomolsk-on Amur, a major city in the Khabarovsk region.

A mother subjected her toddler son to a sickening catalogue of beatings, which left him looking like he had been ‘hit with a frying pan’. The son, just 22 months old at the time, suffered four broken bones in his arm and shoulder and numerous bruises to his head and body in a week. His horrific injuries were revealed at Preston Crown Court in Lancashire as the 22-year-old ‘depressed’ woman was jailed for four years. Shocking: His horrific injuries were revealed at Preston Crown Court (file picture) in Lancashire as the 22-year-old woman was jailed for four years . The woman has never admitted hurting the boy and was criticised by a judge for trying to pin the blame for the injuries on others. Her father was even interviewed by police, because he helped look after the child. She was convicted of three counts of wounding and of neglect. All of the assaults all took place in one week two years ago in Preston. As well as being jailed, the woman was banned from ever looking after children again - including if she has any more children of her own. Judge Heather Lloyd said: ‘The one person a child should look to for protection is his mother but this was a case which involved a parent inflicting harm upon a child. ‘You did things to him which resulted in him having multiple fractures to his body and arms, bruising his cheeks and a significant head injury. ‘One witness said he looked like he had been hit with a frying pan. Why you did it remains a complete mystery. ‘You have never told the truth about what happened, you repeatedly changed your account and sought to blame others. ‘Your lies meant your father was . interviewed as he had been caring for him at your request, you sought to . blame your friend partner or at least inferred that. ‘The . jury were completely satisfied that the person who repeatedly injured . him was you. Abuse: The woman has never admitted hurting the boy and was criticised by a judge for trying to blame others for the injuries (picture posed by model) ‘You even told your friends that he had bruising to his cheeks and went through the farce of getting them to research it. ‘One response was that it may be a rare blood disease or even meningitis. You faked surprise when a lady at nursery saw him. ‘You quite deliberately did everything you could do to deflect suspicion from you. Your conduct was not an isolated event. 'But it is impossible to say when all this happened. Not all the injuries are of the same age - bruising to the cheek on Monday, the remaining injuries between Tuesday and Thursday evening, he had four fractures. ‘Fortunately he has recovered from his injuries, how he will feel when he finds out what his mother has done to him is anyone’s guess. 'One witness said he looked like he had been hit with a frying pan. Why you did it remains a complete mystery' Judge Heather Lloyd . ‘It is quite clear to me this was course of conduct over a period of time rather than an isolated incident although how you caused these injuries is impossible to say.’ The court heard that after she was arrested the child’s father attacked her and is he now serving a ‘lengthy’ prison sentence for assault. Beverley Hackett, defending, said: ‘She understands that nothing I can say can go beyond the verdict of the jury. She has lost her son. ‘She also dreads the day when he is older and comes to know what happened and that she has some very serious questions to answer. ‘Thankfully he has been placed with her mother, which is of some comfort to her.’ Lancashire Constabulary Detective Sergeant Jamie Lillystone said: ‘We have never been able to identify how the injuries were caused to the young boy as she denied the allegations throughout the trial. ‘This was a complex and difficult case to investigate. The injuries sustained by the child were extensive but fortunately he has since made a full recovery. ‘The sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime committed and reinforces that behaviour of this cruel nature will not be tolerated.’ Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Son suffered broken bones in arm and shoulder .

A Norwegian man jailed on murder charges in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been found dead in his cell. Tjostolv Moland, 32, was one of two men accused of murder, espionage and conspiracy, following the 2009 murder of their driver in the Congo jungle. Mr Moland had been detained along British-Norwegian Joshua French, with both men denying all charges. Mr Moland was found in his cell on Sunday, which he reportedly shared with Mr French, a fellow former military serviceman. Norwegian authorities have always denied the accusation of espionage on behalf of the pair, and are now demanding answers from Congolese authorities. Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said he would not speculate about the cause of death but added that Norway would use ‘full pressure’ to seek clarification. Lambert Mende, Congo's information minister, said the Congolese government is investigating Moland's death. ‘We're trying to determine whether it was suicide or homicide. It looks like suicide but we're not sure,' he said. A Congolese court at one stage handed down the death penalty and ordered the Norwegian government to pay more than $500 million in damages to Congo. The death penalty was later overturned by Congo's military high court. ‘We have been working with Congolese authorities through various channels over the years, some public, others not, without any success. Imprisoned: Tjostolv Moland, left and Joshua French have been imprisoned since 2009, on charges of killing their driver Abedi Kasongo, espionage, armed robbery and organised crime . 'I can honestly say that no case in the ministry has demanded more of our resources and attention,’ Eide told a news conference in Norway. ‘Our main focus now is to get French home.

A grandmother has been given a £250 reward by a judge after she locked a burglar in her garden shed. Judith Gazzard, 69, of Cinderford, Gloucestershire, was woken in the early hours by the sound of drug addict Jason Marshall, 25, breaking into her conservatory - where, bizarrely, he ate bird feed. Without waking her husband Julian, Mrs Gazzard crept downstairs and found the conservatory ransacked and the door ajar. Then she spotted a flickering torchlight in the shed a few yards away. Heroic actions: Judith Gazzard, 69, of Cinderford, Gloucestershire, was woken in the early hours by the sound of a drug addict breaking into her conservatory - where he bizarrely ate bird feed . She tiptoed up to the door, then slammed and bolted it shut before calling police. Officers arrived minutes later to find Marshall on the floor after eating three Magnum ice creams from her freezer. At Gloucester Crown Court, Marshall, of Coleford, Gloucestershire, was jailed for 16 months after he admitted burling the home of the retired civil servant and her husband on July 30. At the time of the burglary he was wearing an electronic tag because he was on curfew as part of his sentence following earlier offences. Mrs Gazzard said after the sentencing: ‘I didn’t think for a second about my own safety, I was just really angry that someone had got into my house. I was livid and I thought, “How dare he?” ‘At first when I heard the noise I thought it was one of our neighbours who gets up very early putting his bin out. I got up and listened by the window and then put on my housecoat and slippers and went down to see what was happening. Caught: Jason Marshall, 25, was jailed for 16 months at Gloucester Crown Court after admitting burglary . ‘When I walked into the conservatory it . was like a bombsite in there. I couldn’t see anything missing but . someone had helped himself to a couple of handfuls of the suet pellets . we give the birds. ‘They contain mealworms and insects so I don’t know what he made of them. I went out onto the patio wondering what the hell was going on and I saw a light in the shed. ‘I thought, “There’s somebody in there” - so I went quietly down the path. I realised the padlock on the door had been forced and wasn’t there - the police actually found it in the burglar’s pocket later. ‘But we have an outside bolt at the top of the door so I quickly locked him in. He realised he was in trouble because he started rattling the door but he never said a word and neither did I. ‘I went back into the house and woke my husband and he went out with a big torch and shone it through the shed window. He could see the man crouched down on the floor with his hoodie up. ‘Julian stood against the door to prevent the man trying to force it open and I called the police. It was quite comical when they arrived. ‘One of the officers opened the shed door and said “All right buddy, who are you then?” I heard a little voice say “Jason”. The policeman said ""Jason who?"" and the man said ""Jason Marshall"".’ 'I didn’t think for a second about my own safety, I was just really angry that someone had got into my house. I was livid and I thought, ""How dare he?""' Judith Gazzard . Mrs Gazzard said she and her husband . found later that Marshall had also tried to get into their motorhome, . which is parked up against the front of the shed. She added: ‘It was quite funny when the policeman asked me “Did you have some Magnum ice creams in your freezer?” I said ""yes"" and he told me “Well, he’s eaten them all”. ‘It was only much later that I thought about the risk I’d taken. My husband asked me why I didn’t wake him - and he said he would never have done what I did.’ Bizarre: Mrs Gazzard in her conservatory, where Marshall ate some of her bird food before breaking into the shed - where she bolted him in . Praising Mrs Gazzard’s bravery, Judge . William Hart ordered that she be paid a £250 reward by the High Sheriff . of Gloucestershire. The . judge told Marshall: ‘This was a night time burglary of an occupied . house and you were caught because of the very brave and commendable . behaviour of the lady of the house. ‘At great risk to herself she went in pursuit of you across the garden to the shed and locked you in. You were only caught because of what she did.’ In a citation to the High Sheriff, the judge added: ‘She could see a light in the shed but she had no idea what the nature of that person was in the dark. ‘She went over to the shed and coolly locked the top bolt and detained the defendant inside. ‘That deserves to be marked by a commendation from me and a reward of £250 for her public spirited and brave actions which have led to a repeat offender being imprisoned.’ In court, prosecutor Julian Kesner praised Mrs Gazzard’s ‘fortitude and clear thinking.’ ‘When the defendant was interviewed he said he had no recollection of events at all due to his taking of illicit drugs,’ Mr Kesner said. He told the court Marshall was on a 7pm-7am curfew at the time of the 3am burglary, following an appearance at Cheltenham Magistrates’ Court in April when he admitted two burglaries. He also had other previous burglary convictions. Hungry burglar: Officers arrived minutes later to find Marshall on the floor of the shed after eating three Magnum ice creams (file pictures) from Mrs Gazzard's freezer . Jon Holmes, defending, said: ‘He has a long history of drug abuse. On this night he had taken MKat (Mephedrone), which appears to be the drug of choice at the moment in the Forest of Dean. ‘He had injected it that night and has a consequence has very little recollection of the offence. He can only assume he did it because he wanted somewhere to sleep. It explains his odd behavour and his eating. ‘ .

Jeremy Outen has resigned as the head of the National Crime Agency's Economic Crime Command after failing security checks . A senior fraud investigator put in charge of fighting financial crime at a new FBI-style police agency will not take up the job after claims he failed the security vetting. Jeremy Outen, a former partner at KPMG earning around £580,000 a year, was named as head of the National Crime Agency’s Economic Crime Command in April. Due to the role’s highly sensitive nature, he was put through extensive vetting with experts trawling through his financial affairs, employment and personal life. Last night well-placed sources confirmed that Mr Outen had failed the process. One said: ‘He failed the direct vetting procedure which was a requirement of the job. ‘Mr Outen was given the option of going through the process again, but he declined.’ Last night, the former forensic accountant told the Daily Mail he withdrew from the role for  ‘personal reasons’ but declined to reveal details. Yesterday one report claimed his tax affairs had played a part in the decision. However, Mr Outen strenuously denied the allegation. His departure comes two weeks after the resignation of Sir Ian Andrews, chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, which will be rolled into the NCA when it launches this year. Sir Ian quit after he failed to declare he owned a private company with his wife, who works for a global consultancy firm involved in security and investigations. SOCA also faces damaging allegations that it failed to investigate City companies over the employment of corrupt private investigators. Last night Mr Outen said: ‘The reason I’m leaving, or not joining, is entirely personal. It is personal to me and it is not something I really want to discuss. ‘I know that people want to know what it is but I am not going to tell anybody what it is and there we are.’ One report claimed Mr Outen quite over his tax affairs while the Home Office said he left for 'personal reasons' When asked if it was because he failed . the vetting, he said: ‘I can’t really talk about my vetting because the . whole issue is surrounded by confidentiality which was imposed on me . from the outset. ‘We are . into difficult territory. What I am saying is I’ve withdrawn from the . process and not the other way round, so you can work out from that that . my vetting status isn’t the issue.’ Mr Outen's departure comes two weeks after the resignation of Sir Ian Andrews as chairman of SOCA (pictured) Mr Outen added that he was ‘happy to deny categorically’ that his tax affairs were an issue. ‘I  have not been involved in any tax avoidance, or any other such arrangements. I never have been,’ he said. ‘My tax affairs are very straightforward and I’m not aware that I am the subject of any investigation by the HMRC.’ When Mr Outen was appointed, Keith Bristow, director general of the NCA, said he was an ‘exceptional candidate’ who would be a major asset. Home Secretary Theresa May added that Mr Outen had ‘the skills and experience to tackle the challenges posed by economic crime’. Although he has never been a police officer, Mr Outen has worked closely with government departments and law enforcement agencies in investigating complex fraud cases at home and abroad. A forensic accountant with KPMG for 21 years, his previous cases have included the collapses of Kuwait Investment Office’s investments in Spain and SBS-Agro in Moscow. He has also investigated dormant Swiss bank accounts belonging to victims of Nazi persecution. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘Jeremy Outen has decided not to take up the post for personal reasons. Steps are being taken to ensure this position is filled.’","Jeremy Outen named head of National Crime Agency's Economic Crime Command in April but has now withdrawn from the role .

A House of Lords peer has been convicted today of assaulting a motorist in a road rage incident in Northern Ireland. Lord Ken Maginnis, 75, a former Ulster Unionist Party MP, was found guilty at Dungannon Magistrates’ Court of grabbing Keith Kirk by the arm and threatening to punch him. The court heard the peer became enraged after Mr Kirk honked his car horn at him during the incident in Dungannon last summer. Lord Ken Maginnis was convicted of assaulting driver Keith Kirk during a road rage incident last year . The peer admitted calling Mr Kirk a 'yellow bellied b******' but had denied the charge of common assault. District Judge John Meehan said he was satisfied the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt. He fined Lord Maginnis £200 and ordered him to pay a further £200 in compensation to Mr Kirk. Following the hearing, the peer said he had already lodged an appeal. He said: 'I am obviously not letting it rest here. 'One . might say what’s a couple of hundred pounds but this is my reputation. And I am appealing it, I can assure you I am appealing it.' He had previously suggested to the court that political factors were behind his prosecution. He told the court from the witness box that a speech he had delivered in the House of Lords earlier this year, in which he referred to the incident as a non-offence, had influenced the move to prosecute him. Lord Maginnis also claimed his threat to take court proceedings against Stephen Farry, Stormont's Employment and Learning Minister, was also a factor. Lord Maginnis (right) called Keith Kirk (left) a 'yellow bellied b******' and threatened to punch him . Mr Kirk told the court that he was taking his younger sister to the bank when a red Honda CRV pulled out of a junction in front of him without looking, causing him to break suddenly. He said he honked his horn - an act he alleged prompted Lord Maginnis to get out of his vehicle and march back to confront him through the wound down window. Mr Kirk claimed the peer, a former major in the Ulster Defence Regiment, grabbed his arm and held the other fist in the air threatening a punch. 'He grabbed my right arm with his left hand and he had his right hand in a fist, he was trying to hit me with it,' he claimed. The prosecution conceded it was a non injury assault and that the politician had not struck Mr Kirk. Judge Meehan said he had taken account of Lord Maginnis’s years of public service in determining the punishment.","Lord Ken Maginnis found guilty of common assault by magistrates .

Doctors may one day use eye tests to detect the very early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, according to new research. Non-invasive retinal testing is now being trialled and could help flag up the condition by alerting doctors to the presence of amyloid plaque deposits, a known marker of the disease. Testing could mean that patients are diagnosed or are at least flagged up as high-risk up to 20 years before noticeable symptoms begin, helping patients get treatment before memory loss develops. A simple eye test (library photo pictured) could soon be available that detects deposits at the back of the eye to assess the likelihood of a person developing Alzheimer's. Around 800,000 people in Britain suffer from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia . Experts generally accept that amyloid plaques - a type of protein deposit - in the brain are a key marker of the disease. Neurologists have also long believed that . there is a correlation between the amount of amyloid in the eye and amyloid in the brain. The arguement for this is strong because the retina is formed from the same tissue as the brain when a foetus is developing in the womb. To confirm this theory, two tests - the Retinal Amyloid Index by NeuroVision and the Sapphire II by Cognoptix - have been developed and trials are underway, according to a report by Primary Care Optometry News. ‘Ocular exams through the years have attempted to diagnose Alzheimer’s at an early age,’ Dr Michael Tolentino, a Primary Care Optometry News Editorial Board member, said. The condition is characterised by amyloid plaques in the brain (pictured in tissue sample) ‘We have looked at [various methods of testing, including] optic nerve cupping, pupillary response to tropicamide dilation and ocular muscle movement. 'While all have been investigated, all have failed to withstand the test of time in terms of sensitivity and specificity.' Professor Keith Black, chairman of the Department of Neurosurgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles, and co-founder of NeuroVision, said that with most people, if they’re going to get Alzheimer’s, they begin  to  develop the hallmarks, such as amyloid deposits, in their 50s. ‘The key for having an effective treatment for AD is early detection. You want to prevent those brain cells from being killed or dying in the first place,' he told the journal. The Sapphire II  works by measuring the amount of photons - light 'particles' - captured when scanning the eyes. The amount of photons captured directly correlates with the amount of amyloid in the eye, explained Carl Sadowsky, medical director of the Premiere Research Institute at Palm Beach Neurology in West Palm Beach, Florida. He stated that the Sapphire II is currently in phase one of two in clinical feasibility trials and that phase three is expected to begin in 2014. Around 800,000 people in Britain . suffer from Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. The number of cases . is expected to double within a generation. There is no cure and existing drugs can only ease symptoms. The . condition is diagnosed by memory tests and occasionally brain scans. However, the disease can only be confirmed by a post-mortem examination, which . reveals the  presence of a harmful amyloid plaques in the . brain.","Two new tests - the Retinal Amyloid Index by NeuroVision and the Sapphire II by Cognoptix - are being trialled in the U.S.

Coronation Street star Chris Fountain has been axed from the show after video clips of him rapping about rape and violence while disguised in a Halloween mask emerged online. The 25-year-old actor and former Dancing on Ice contestant was suspended from the show last week after the videos - posted on YouTube under the name of his rap alter-ego The Phantom - came to light. Last night ITV confirmed that the actor had been sacked from the soap, stating: 'Chris Fountain's contract with ITV has been terminated as a result of the unacceptable comments he made in a number of online clips.' Scroll down for video . Axed: Coronation Street actor Chris Fountain has been sacked by ITV after he was unmasked as controversial YouTube rapper The Phantom . 'Mortified' Fountain has issued an apology and said he is 'deeply ashamed' of the YouTube videos, which show the actor spouting lyrics about raping women, bombing houses and stabbing people in the face with syringes. ITV spokesman . In one distasteful clip, he raps . about dragging a girl upstairs, adding: ‘I will **** anybody up in the . worst way, rape a b***h on her birthday.’ The actor has said the explicit lyrics were 'blurted out in a moment of madness'. He said in a statement: 'I would like to . sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. I am deeply ashamed . by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour. 'The videos were made . over a year ago when I was experimenting with music and I’ve not done . anything like it since and nor will I,' said the actor, who said he accepted ITV had 'no choice' but to end his contract. Show bosses have decided not to edit . Chris out of episodes he has already filmed so his character,  mechanic Tommy Duckworth, will appear on TV this week. Family soap: Fountain, seen in a scene from the show with co-star Michelle Keegan, will not be edited out of upcoming episodes that have already been filmed . Over the weekend Coronation Street bosses reportedly urged Fountain to speak out on a television show such as Daybreak or This Morning in a bid to appease fans. 'The lyrics that appeared online were influenced by a style of hiphop that I was experimenting with at a private freestyle session and blurted out in a moment of madness. There is absolutely no excuse - I take complete responsibility for my actions - but they were in no way thought out or represent at all my attitude towards women, rape and violence. I just want to apologise from the bottom of my heart to everyone who I have offended or upset. I completely understand that ITV had no choice but to terminate my contract today. I have had two wonderful years playing Tommy Duckworth with only happy memories of my time on Coronation Street. I am mortified that I have brought so much embarrassment to my colleagues and employers these last few days. My biggest regret however is not to do with losing my job, but that I have hurt and let down so many people including those in a vulnerable situation and I am so very deeply ashamed of this. I am also mortified to have put my mother, grandad and girlfriend through the last few days which they are hurt and bewildered by and so do not deserve. I am so sorry. Once again to everyone who I have let down and hurt. I am deeply sorry.' A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'These videos are disgusting and bosses now need to work out exactly how to handle the situation. 'But while they are furious, they need to make sure his future is dealt with fairly... He is hoping the fact that they are suggesting he might go on TV to make a grovelling apology is a sign that they could see a future for him.' The source suggested Fountain could appear on several TV shows in order to ensure his apology reached the broadest audience possible, or possibly hold a press conference about the scandal. But the broadcaster confirmed last night that there was no longer a place for Fountain at Coronation Street. In one of the shocking video clips the actor performs a . stabbing action while he raps: ‘I’m a nasty ****, I will punch you in . the face and you look like you’ve been having some acupuncture ’cos my . fist is lethal. ‘I’m a ******* hero, you’ve got ******* zero.

Determined: Keith Rule not only got his money back but also helped 46 others win back nearly £1.3million . A laundry owner who feared losing life savings in a Spanish property scandal is celebrating after helping lawyers win a landmark legal case which has given hope to thousands of wronged Brits. Father-of-two Keith Rule, 46, spent hours trawling the Internet with the help of Google translator after a bank refused to return his £45,983 deposit on an off-plan villa never built because of the economic crisis. He took on bank bosses after discovering a 45-year-old property law making them jointly responsible with promoters for returning guaranteed deposits on failed developments. Now the businessman has not only got . his money back - but helped win back nearly £1.3 million for 46 mostly . British buyers whose dreams of villas on the same development in south . east Spain were scuppered. Mr . Rule, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, impressed the Costa lawyers . he instructed to take their case on so much, they asked him to work for . them on a part-time basis. He . now combines the day-to-day running of his firm on an industrial estate . in his home town with his new job preparing case files for other Brits . engulfed in the drama that swept him up when Spanish savings bank CAM . washed its hands of buyers after an initial promise of a bank guarantee . seven years ago. Last night Mr Rule, described as a 'dog with a bone' by one of the lawyers who agreed to fight his case through the 1968 law he found on the Internet, urged others in the same situation not to give up. The 47 buyers involved in the landmark trial at a court in Albacete province near Murcia, south east Spain, have just received all the money back they put down. Only some of the 617 three and four-bed homes with pools on the luxury Finca Parcs development in Hellin on the Albacete-Murcia border were ever partially finished. The group are now also applying to the court for case costs and interest on their deposits to be paid. Only some of the 617 three and four-bed homes with pools on the luxury Finca Parcs development in Hellin on the Albacete-Murcia border were ever partially finished . Mr Rule, who handed over deposits on two villas in November 2006, said: 'At the start of this fight people called me crazy but they don’t now and I’m delighted to have given hope to other Brits. 'There was no concept five years ago in Spain banks could be liable in these sorts of situations. 'We’ve created case law here. 'I haven’t got a magic wand I can wave for everything but my message to people in the situation I was in is ""Don’t give up."" 'I’m living proof you can take on powerful institutions and beat them when they’re wrong and you’re right.' A Spanish judge ruled CAM - now taken over by Sabadell - was guilty of malpractice for failing to ensure deposits were spent only on building the villas and never collecting an equivalent cash safeguard from the promoters. The holiday home buyers won an initial trial against the bank and Spanish promoters Cleyton Ges in May 2012 - and an appeal in March this year. A second lawsuit on behalf of 13 more Finca Parcs buyers has already been filed . A Spanish judge ruled CAM - now taken over by Sabadell - was guilty of malpractice . A second lawsuit on behalf of 13 more Finca Parcs buyers has already been filed - and Mr Rule is working on a third lawsuit with Algeciras, Cadiz-based lawyer Maria de Castro and her brother Jaime who took the first case to court. Theirs and other Spanish legal firms around Spain are also winning cases based on law 57/1968 - the law Keith uncovered on Google which has spared Brits the nightmare scenario of exhausting court battles against promoters with no money. He said last night: 'I bet the CAM executives I demanded my money back from five years ago wished they had given me a cheque that day. 'The court case set a legal precedent and is being used by other law firms around Spain.' Jamie de Castro, of De Castro lawyers, added: 'It’s amazing that a non-Spaniard who didn’t even speak Spanish and was using Google translator helped get us this far. 'I have no problem in admitting I wasn’t confident at the start this would work and feared Keith might be wasting time and money. 'But he insisted and insisted and began to make us believe it could. 'My sister described him once as a dog with a bone which I hope he takes now as a compliment.' Pensioner Reg Matthews, a friend of Mr Rule's who has had his £22,980 deposit returned, added: 'It’s a great relief to have my money back although I was keen on having a place in the sun like thousands of other Brits. 'Without Keith’s help I and many others would have lost everything.'","Keith Rule spent hours trawling the Internet for help after a bank refused to return his £45,983 deposit on a villa which was never built .

The Georgia widow accused of lying to investigators about the death of her husband, who was shot dead by her alleged lover in 2010, was found guilty on nine of 13 felony counts this afternoon. Prosecutors accused Atlanta resident Andrea Sneiderman of making false statements to police investigating her husband's slaying and lying under oath during the trial of her former boss and paramour, Hemy Neuman. The 13-count indictment included charges of making false statements, hindering an investigation and perjury. Scroll down for verdict video . Guilty: Andrea Sneiderman, pictured in court Monday, was found guilty on . nine of 13 felony counts of lying to police and hindering the . investigation into the murder of her husband . Confined: Andrea Sneiderman leaves the courtroom in custody to await sentencing Tuesday morning . Spared: Sneiderman had been facing murder charges, but those were dropped last month by the prosecution . Sneiderman, 37, was found guilty of four counts of perjury, hindering the apprehension of a criminal, concealment of material facts, and three counts of giving false statements. She was found not guilty of three counts of perjury and one count of giving a false statement. Jurors got the case Thursday and deliberated all Friday before leaving without a verdict. They returned for additional deliberations Monday and delivered the verdict after more than three hours. Sneiderman's defense has said prosecutors had a weak case but were desperate to convict Sneiderman of something. Sneiderman's lover Hemy Neuman was . last year convicted of the murder of Rusty Sneiderman and sentenced to . life in prison. He told police an angel who looked like Olivia Newton John told him to do it. The mother-of-two was initially accused of arranging her husband's murder but the charges were dropped last month. DeKalb County District Attorney Robert James cited his recent review of evidence the defense turned over as part of pre-trial discovery. Thomas Clegg, one of Sneiderman's lead attorneys, balked at the explanation. 'I believe they have known all along that they didn't have a murder case,' he said in open court. The judge granted James' request to drop the more serious charges before the start of jury selection and released Sneiderman from house arrest. Judge Gregory Adams set Sneiderman's sentencing for 9am Tuesday and said she had 30 days to file her notice of intent to appeal.

Miss Sneiderman showed . little emotion as she sat with her defense team, carefully writing down . the counts and the jury's findings. She was then led out of the . courtroom by deputies. Throughout . the trial, prosecutors played and replayed video and audio clips of . Sneiderman's interviews with police investigators and her testimony . during Neuman's trial. They contrasted that with witness testimony and documents that they said proved she had lied to police and the court.The . defense called a string of character witnesses who testified that . Andrea and Rusty Sneiderman had a happy and loving relationship. They . also called experts to refute some of the documents and evidence . presented by the prosecution. During testimony earlier this month, Rusty's father Don . Sneiderman said his daughter-in-law called him and told him what . happened while she was on the way to the hospital. 'There are some calls you never forget,' he said. Defense atorney Tom Clegg: Sneiderman is accused of lying under oath and hindering the investigation into her husband's death . Torn apart: Russell Sneiderman was murdered after dropping his children off at daycare . But Sneiderman herself testified at her lover's murder trial that she 'didn’t . know what happened to Rusty until I got to the emergency room. No one . told me what happened to Rusty', Fox Atlanta reported. Sneiderman's defense . attorneys painted her out as a happily married mother devastated by her . husband's death, not the woman prosecutors described as engaged in a .

On July 18, Shannon filed with the EEO office claiming that Mayor Filner had sexually harassed her. She received a response that her allegations would be reviewed. Explaining why she has decided to come forward with her story, Shannon, a mother and great-grandmother, said, 'I want to do the right thing for San Diego.'

University of California, San Diego, political science professor Steve Erie said Filner seems to be in denial but also may be trying to appear like he is digging in his heels so he has more negotiating power over his future. The mayor's stubbornness could be aimed at leveraging a deal to leave office under the condition that he shed his financial responsibilities if the city loses a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Filner's former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, Erie said. Veronica 'Ronne' Froman (front left), Sharon Bernie-Cloward (front right), Joyce Gattas (back left), and Patti Roscoe (back right) have all claimed that they were harassed by Filner . 'I think what we're seeing here is bunker mentality,' Erie said. 'I think our mayor is still in denial or he wants to appear like he will resolve to fight it to the end. This may be a bargaining strategy, because the minute he resigns, all bets are off, and he's lost leverage.' Several businesses — including four Hooters restaurant locations — have posted signs from a radio talk show campaign stating the establishments will not serve the mayor because 'we believe women should be treated with respect.' Melissa Fry, director of marketing for HootWinc, the West Coast Hooters franchise told Slate magazine it was not a political move but was a stand for the fair treatment of women.

The . game between the longtime rivals quickly turned testy, with the benches . and bullpens clearing in the second and the teams being warned about . beanballs by plate umpire Brian O'Nora.

Target: A-Rod has a target on his back after appealing a 211-game suspension for allegedly using PEDs . Applause: Fenway erupted with applause as the controversial third-baseman for their bitter rival was hit by a pitch . Dempster . appeared to take aim at Rodriguez, recently suspended for 211 games by . Major League Baseball in the Biogenesis drug case. Rodriguez appealed . the penalty and can play until there is a final decision. Booed . when he was on deck at the end of the first inning, Rodriguez was . jeered when he led off the second. Fans chanted 'You're a cheater!' as . Dempster threw his first pitch behind Rodriguez's knees. Dempster . missed inside with the next two pitches and then threw a fastball that . hit A-Rod's elbow pad and deflected into his back. O'Nora . immediately issued an emphatic warning to both benches, and a trainer . escorted Rodriguez to first base. Rodriguez stared at Dempster, but made . no move toward the mound. Girardi, however, . ran onto the field and began hollering at O'Nora. Presumably in . disbelief that Dempster hadn't been ejected, a livid Girardi wildly . swung his fist - and it came near O'Nora's chin. 'He . was trying to establish his fastball,' Red Sox manager John Farrell . said during an in-game interview on ESPN. 'Obviously, the pitch got away . from him.' Vigilante Justice: Red Sox Ryan Dempster seemed to intentionally hit A-Rod with a pitch in Sunday night's game at Fenway Park . 'We didn't feel in our dugout it was anything intentional,' he added. Dempster had hit four batters in 140 innings this season going into the game. He plunked two last year. Tension . already was high this weekend with the Red Sox leading the AL East and . the Yankees scrambling for a playoff spot. This dustup at Fenway . certainly looked familiar - Boston pitcher Pedro Martinez threw down New . York coach Don Zimmer during a wild brawl in the 2003 AL championship . series, and Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek pushed Rodriguez in the face . during a 2004 scuffle. But this confrontation came with a decided twist: Along with the Red Sox, Rodriguez has been at odds with the Yankees, too. Yankees . management has been feuding with Rodriguez and his legal team, with the . club still owing him more than $80 million through 2017. Heated: Yankee Manager Joe Girardi sticks up for A-Rod, whom he feels was intentionally plugged by Dempster . The Boot: Girardi was ultimately tossed from the game after a screaming match with umpire Brian O'Nora . 'It's . hard to engage someone when this stuff is going on,' general manager . Brian Cashman said hours before Sunday's game, explaining why he and . Rodriguez don't talk much anymore. Other major . leaguers also have spoken out, criticizing players penalized for using . performance-enhancing drugs for the damage they've done to baseball. Boston pitcher John Lackey recently said he had a problem with Rodriguez . being allowed to play while his suspension is under appeal. Cashman . specifically took issue with Rodriguez and his new lawyer, defending . the team's medical treatment of the star third baseman during last . year's playoffs. Over the weekend, lawyer . Joseph Tacopina told The New York Times that the Yankees tried to make . Rodriguez look bad, claiming they used him in the playoffs while he was . hurt. The three-time AL MVP went 3 for 25 with 12 strikeouts in the 2012 . postseason. 'I know that our medical staff . did everything they possibly can to assist Alex, help Alex, diagnose . Alex and give him the best proper medical care,' Cashman said. Cashman . said Rodriguez never complained of any problem during the playoffs . until Girardi pulled him for a pinch-hitter in a key spot. This weekend, Rodriguez said: 'I shouldn't have been out there last year.' Cashman disputed that stance. He didn't like how the message was delivered, either. 'Did he ever say he didn't feel right? He never said it,' the GM said. 'You . see the attorney say what he said and Alex is talking to you guys after . the game and it seems like when I'm reading the comments, it's like, ""I . can't really comment."" It's as if he doesn't know anything about it, . which we all know he really does,' Cashman said. Sidelined . by a hip injury and quadriceps problem, the 38-year-old Rodriguez made . his season debut Aug. 5 on the same day MLB handed down his suspension. Rodriguez . was hitting .279 with one homer and four RBIs going into Sunday's game. After being hit by a pitch, he drove in a run with groundout in his . next at-bat. In the sixth, Rodriguez hit a . leadoff drive to straightaway center field against Dempster and let out a . scream as he rounded both first base and third. The three-time MVP . clapped his hands as he stepped on home plate and pointed to sky. The . home run trimmed the Yankees' deficit to 6-4, and they went ahead later . in the inning when Brett Gardner hit a bases-loaded triple. Rodriguez's second homer since coming off the disabled list left him 11 behind Willie Mays for fourth place on the career list.","The Yankees believe A-Rod was intentionally hit by Boston Red Sox pitcher Ryan Dempster .

Major League Baseball today said it would waive the confidentiality clause in its drug testing program to release all documents relating to treatment of beleaguered Yankees player, Alex Rodriguez, as his lawyer insisted he will not serve a single inning of his 211-match ban. Attorney Joe Tacopina was presented with a letter from MLB on the Today show stating that it was prepared to release the information and host Matt Lauer asked the lawyer to sign it. 'We would love nothing more than to discuss his testing history,' Tacopina responded, saying the investigation had been 'rife with misconduct'. But on Monday afternoon, he rejected the offer, even though the letter stated that Rodriguez's side could also disclose all documents they wanted. He called it a 'publicity stunt' and a 'trap'. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Alex Rodriguez's lawyer Joe Tacopino said his client should not serve a single inning of his 211-match ban because evidence against him using performance-enhancing drugs will not stand up in court . Tacopina and A-Rod have been accused of . using the confidentiality agreement as a barrier put up to avoid . answering whether or not he took performance-enhancing drugs. It comes as an alleged former mistress of Yankee's boss Brian Cashman claimed he knew about steroid use within the team but did nothing about it in explosive court papers filed today. MLB said it would readily release information on A-Rod's prior violations, communications, text messages and instant messages related to his treatment by Anthony Bosch, who founded the Miami-based Biogenesis anti-aging clinic linked to performing-enhancing drugs. A-Rod has been served a 211-game ban for taking the drugs, but he remains on the field while appealing the decision. All 13 other players accused of the drug use have accepted their bans. Stubborn: Tacopino did not say if he would sign a letter from MLB to waive confidentiality of the drug testing . Speaking to Today, Tacopina also took . aim at the Yankees, accusing its management of purposefully keeping his . client in the dark about his ailing health. He . presented an MRI scan to the show which he claimed would reveal that . A-Rod had a hole in his left hip on October 11, 2012, which he claimed . the Yankees did not tell his client. 'Nobody told Alex Rodriguez that he . had a hole in his left hip - nobody,' Tacopina said. 'He didn't know . until he went to his own doctor.' Lauer said an independent doctor was looking at the scan. Tacopina admitted he did not know why the team would purposefully withhold the medical information, but suggested they wanted to make him a 'scapegoat'. Controversy: Alex Rodriguez, pictured at Sunday's Yankees Red Sox game, has been banned from playing for 211 games but is still allowed on the field while he appeals the ban . Claims: Yankees boss Brian Cashman's alleged mistress Louise Meanwell said he was aware of the steroid use . Court papers filed today allege that Yankee’s boss Brian Cashman knew about steroid use within the team but did nothing about it, instead adopting a ‘win-at-any-cost’ attitude. The papers were filed on behalf of Louise Meanwell, who allegedly had an affair with Cashman in late 2011 while he was still married. Meanwell claimed she fell pregnant with his child at the time and he paid for an abortion. He, in turn, accused her of stalking him and extorting $6,000 to keep quiet about their relationship. She was arraigned on grand larceny, stalking and harassment charges in February 2012 and spent five months in Rikers Island prison. The British native claims Cashman told her of steroid use within the Yankees, naming specific players, and admitted intentionally misleading federal investigators during the Roger Clemen’s investigation, according to court papers. It also states: ‘Mr Cashman was ambivalent to the use of performance enhancing drugs so long as nothing came back to the Yankee’s organization…and shared with [Meanwell] his win-at-any-cost attitude.’ The papers were filed citing a conflict of interest because Alex Rodriguez’s lawyer Joe Tacopino and Meanwell’s lawyer Stephen Turano form the law offices of  Tacopina Seigel & Turano, P.C. The papers order Tacopino to stop representing the Yankee's player because Meanwell should have been consulted prior to agreeing to represent him. Meanwell said she relayed all of the details of her conversations with Cashman to Turano and was not informed when the firm started representing Rodriguez, who denies using performance-enhancing drugs. The papers state: ‘Mr Rodriguez and his current circumstance is consistent with a New York Yankee management takedown, as was in the case of [Meanwell]. 'While it appears the Yankee organization is attempting to get out from under a $100million obligation to Rodriguez, Meanwell’s interests are not so consistent with the baseball player’s as for her to give consent to the law firm to represent Rodriguez’s possible divergent interests.' He previously said that . Yankees' president Randy Levine told Dr Bryan Kelly, who performed hip . surgery on Rodriguez in January, that he didn't 'ever want to see him on . the field again', the New York Daily News reported. He . said that Levine wanted the Yankees to collect insurance on the $114 . million that remains on Rodriguez's contract before the 2013 season . began. 'I know that our medical staff did . everything they possibly can to assist Alex, help Alex, diagnose Alex . and give him the best proper medical care,' Yankees General Manager . Brian Cashman has said. On Monday, Tacopina added that evidence . against his client would not stand up in a court and that MLB was simply . 'perverting the process'. 'Alex Rodriguez will be found not responsible,' he said. 'To the degree he will not be made to serve one game suspension. 'I know the evidence against Alex . Rodriguez and it will never stand up in a court of law because it relies . on one person - Anthony Bosch... He has no credibility, He has no . ability.' He added of his . client: 'If I were to advise him, I would say don't take one inning out. That being said, that's his decision to make.'

Comeback: Lois Goodman, 71, will referee at the upcoming US Open a year after she was arrested for killing her elderly husband, only to be cleared in the death . The professional tennis referee who was charged of bludgeoning her husband to death with a coffee cup last year will return to the US Open this month after being cleared in the death. In August of last year, then-70-year-old Lois ‘Lolo’ Goodman was marched out of a New York City hotel in handcuffs after being accused of killing her 80-year-old spouse, Alan, by hitting him with a mug and then using the broken shards to stab him. The umpire insisted she was innocent, and her lawyers suggested Mr Goodman died in an accidental fall at the couple's Woodland Hills home in California last April. Prosecutors dismissed charges four months later, saying they had received new information and had insufficient evidence to charge her. Goodman's daughter, Joan, told the New York Post that her mother is anxious about making a comeback to the prestigious tennis event scheduled to begin August 26, and she is hoping to stay out of the spotlight. ‘She is grateful she has her job, and she wants to be able to do it without distraction,' Joan Goodman told the paper. The news of Miss Goodman’s return to US Open comes just days after the 71-year-old referee sued the Los Angeles Police Department, the county coroner's department, and others for false arrest and malicious prosecution. Falsely accused: Lois Goodman, seen after her arrest in New York last August, has always maintained her innocence in connection to her husband's death in April 2012 . Tragic accident: The tennis referee's husband of nearly 50 . years, Alan . (left), was found covered in blood next to a broken mug. Ms Goodman (right) told police she found him after returning to their home in LA . On parade: Goodman was arrested in New York August 20, 2012, shortly before she was due to referee at the world-renowned US Open tennis tournament . Lois Goodman has alleged in a federal lawsuit released by her attorney Friday that she suffered humiliation, damage to her career and physical pain from her confinement in jail when first arrested in August 2012. Attorney Robert Sheahan said his client suffered the trauma of finding her spouse of nearly 50 years dead, only to have the grieving period curtailed by being arrested and thrown in a jail he describes as ‘a veritable dungeon.’ The 21-page complaint states that the septuagenarian was subjected to emotional distress when police waited until she had traveled to New York to referee the US Open and conducted her arrest in front of media at a New York hotel. ‘Instead of calling Mrs. Goodman or her attorney, they waited until she traveled to New York to officiate at the US Open tennis tournament. Then, traveling to New York on “official business,” LAPD defendants alerted the national media and publicly arrested Mrs. Goodman in New York City, where they caused her to be incarcerated at Rikers Island,’ the complaint states, according to the Courthouse News Service. Cleared: Lois Goodman addresses the media after all charges were dropped in a preliminary hearing at the Van Nuys Courthouse last November . Arrest: Goodman was officiating qualifying matches at the U.S Open over the summer when she was arrested by police for the murder of her husband Alan, seen here . Fatal injury: Mr Goodman died after suffering 'deep penetrating blunt force trauma' Goodman was officiating qualifying . matches at the US Open last summer when she was arrested by police . for the murder of her husband Alan, who died after suffering 'deep . penetrating blunt force trauma.' Furthermore, Goodman claims that the LAPD knowingly lied to the media, telling them that the 70-year-old woman was having an affair and an Internet relationship with two US Open officials . She accused a police officer of trying to pressure her to confess and said the coroner's finding of homicide was wrong. According to the federal suit, Mr. Goodman ‘was legally blind and had colon cancer...had a long history of high blood pressure, heart disease, depression and insulin-dependent diabetes [and] a history of failing to take his medication.’ Defense attorneys later revealed that her DNA wasn't found on the coffee mug found next to her husband’s body. Goodman said she spent over $100,000 on her defense, borrowing and selling assets to cover costs. She hired a renowned medical examiner and a polygraph expert to help show her innocence. After the dismissal she was reinstated as a referee but said she drew less important assignments than before. ‘To this day, Mrs. Goodman suffers on a daily basis,’ said the lawsuit. ‘The public humiliation is unending. There are whispers and pointed fingers wherever she goes.’ Although the suit said her reputation has suffered, the attorney who won her dismissal, Alison Triessl, said Goodman will be working in referee duties at the upcoming US Open. Wrongfully blamed: 'I didn't know what they were thinking,' Lois Goodman said during an interview this morning. 'I'm a spouse and they didn't have anyone else to blame so came after me.' Thankful: Ms Goodman thanked her attorneys Robert Sheahen and Alison Triessl, seen here with Matt Lauer on The Today Show, and said she would have been in a lot of trouble without them . The 71-year-old Goodman had been . accused of bludgeoning her 80-year-old husband to death with a coffee . cup. She said she was innocent and her lawyers suggested Alan Goodman . died in an accidental fall. The couple had been married 50 years . and had three grown daughters. They had lived in the San Fernando Valley . area of Los Angeles their entire lives. Alan Goodman died in April. Authorities initially believed he fell down stairs at home while his . wife was away but later decided it was homicide after a mortuary . reported suspicious injuries on his head. They then alleged he had been . clobbered on the head with a coffee mug and began to treat Goodman as a . suspect. But defense lawyers said there was . little forensic evidence in the case because of the delay in the . investigation. Lois Goodman later had passed polygraph . tests supporting her claim of innocence. She was arrested by Los Angeles . police in New York August 20, 2012, as she arrived to be a line judge in the . US Open. She made her first court appearance wearing her tennis . uniform. Lawyers representing Lois Ann Goodman, centre, have argued that the death of Alan Goodman was 'a freak accident' Ms Goodman, 70, was released to home confinement in California after her attorneys successfully argued for a bail reduction . Scene: Alan Goodman was found dead at the couple's condominium on April 17 in Woodland Hills, pictured . Goodman, who has refereed matches between some of tennis's greatest players, pleaded not guilty. After a brief stay in jail, she had . been released on electronic monitoring and subsequently came to court . for pretrial hearings with friends and family there to support her.

It was lauded as an event that would 'inspire a generation', but just a year after the London Olympics came to a dramatic climax new Government figures show the number of youngsters participating in sport has actually fallen. A survey of 2,000 children carried out by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has revealed nearly 75 per cent of under 10s had not been inspired to take up a sport in the after glow of the Games. The picture was slightly better for youngsters aged between 11 and 15, but even then fewer than half had been moved to get active. Worrying: Despite the Government's hope the London Olympics would encourage youngsters to take up sport, figures show fewer are now participating . Inspiration: The Government had hoped scenes such as Jessica Ennis winning the 800m to take gold in the heptathlon would encourage youngsters to take up sport . Worryingly for the Government, the figures showed there had actually been a decline in the number of children involved in sport across all age groups over the past five years. A report published in The Daily Telegraph claimed 25 per cent of girls aged between five and 10 had not participated in a sport in the past month - an increase of 17 per cent on the figure five years ago. One in seven boys of the same age had not participated either. And the number of children doing gymnastics, playing rounders or going swimming has also fallen away. It has led to accusations that a lack of funding has led to fewer opportunities for children to participate in sport at school.

When it comes to shedding the pounds bread is generally regarded as bad. But dieters desperate to indulge in a sandwich for lunch or an extra slice of toast for breakfast will welcome the arrival of a supermarket loaf with 'half the carbs of regular bread.' Dieters' dream: LivLife high protein content will allow the calorie-conscious to indulge in sandwiches without worrying about eating too many carbs . With health foods increasingly big business, Waitrose has recently launched the new LivLife 'low carb' bread in its stores. Billed by the marketing men as 'a brand new concept in bread,' the manufacturers have replaced wheat flours with natural protein flours, seeds and grains. The supermarket chain's new LivLife bread contains 50 per cent less carbohydrate than regular varieties: 14.6g per 100g in a Seriously Seeded loaf, compared with a typical 42.7g, Waitrose says. Its 67 calories per slice compare with the 103 calories in Kingsmill 50/50 and the 116 calories in Hovis Soft White. Natalie McAdam, a nutritionist who worked on LivLife, said high protein flours from soya had been used to reduce the wheat flour. 'Carbohydrates have had a terrible reputation so it isn't surprising so many people had cut them out from their diets,' she said. 'However, we are a nation of sandwich lovers and although bread is seen as the worst offender of all carbs, it's the one food product that consumers can't live without.' Reduced: The new LiveLife bread contains 50 per cent less carbohydrate than regular varieties . No bread zone: The Duchess of Cambridge (left) avoided carbohydrates in the lead up to her wedding, while health fanatic Gwyneth Paltrow (right) doesn't feed her children bread . The new loaf may well lead to a variety of weight-conscious celebrities heading for their nearest supermarket. The Duchess of Cambridge is said to have followed the low-carb and high-protein Dukan diet before the royal wedding, while actress Gwyneth Paltrow has said she avoids feeding bread to her children Apple, eight, and Moses, six, because she thinks it is bad for them. Nicholas & Harris, the company behind the LivLife bread, claims 40% of adults are trying to cut their carbohydrate consumption. In Germany the low carbs bread market is worth £65m and the bakery firm hopes the UK market will follow the trend. The company is also reportedly hoping to tackle the next 'low-carb' evil by expanding into the pasta market next year. The NHS advice for healthy eating is that starchy foods - such as potatoes, cereals, pasta, rice and bread - should make up around one third of the food people eat.","LivLife bread is made with natural protein flours, seeds and grains ."

An investigation into a claim the SAS was involved in the death of Princess Diana has been welcomed by the family of Henri Paul, her driver on the night she died. Scotland Yard has confirmed that officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing information handed to it ‘recently’ by the Royal Military Police. The extraordinary allegation emerged during the second court martial of Sergeant Danny Nightingale, who was found guilty of illegally possessing a gun and ammunition. The family of Henri Paul (right) who was driving Princess Diana (left) when she died have welcomed the news that Scotland Yard are assessing information that she was killed by a SAS soldier . Princess Diana and with Dodi Fayed (pictured together on the night they died) were killed alongside Henri Paul when the car crashed in a Paris tunnel . It was outlined in a letter seen by the Daily Mail and written by the mother-in-law of an SAS sniper, known only as Soldier N, who was a key witness for the prosecution. The eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’. Soldier N is also accused of saying he could enlist the help of his colleagues to ensure his wife – the mother of his two children – would ‘disappear’. The letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of his unit use for private jobs’. ‘They put in  the box the name, address and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to earn extra money does that job.’ When Soldier N was challenged by his mother-in-law, he is accused of saying: ‘Let me stop you right there – I kill women and I kill children.’ The Metropolitan Police has confirmed officers are ‘scoping’ the details of the new information and ‘assessing its relevance and credibility’. The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said . An inquest in 2008 found that Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross negligence’ of Mr Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who had been drinking. The families of Henri Paul and Dodi al Fayed (pictured with Princess Diana) have always believed their was a murder plot . However, the driver’s mother Gisele said she believed her son was murdered together with Diana and Mr Al Fayed when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in an underpass. Mrs Paul, 83, said: ‘We believe there was a plot to kill the Princess that terrible night in August 1997. ‘We know in our hearts that our son was murdered and we still live with the hope that one day the truth will be known.’ The new information was also welcomed by Dodi’s father, former Harrods owner Mohamed Al Fayed, who also insists the couple were murdered. He said he trusted the Metropolitan Police would investigate the new claims ‘with vigour’. Sergeant Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N. Soldier N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from whom he is now separated. The letter was sent to Soldier N’s . commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service . Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial. All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA. The . paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his . wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that . has been covered up.’ Scotland Yard confirmed officers from its specialist crime and operations command are assessing information handed to it by the Royal Military Police. Pictured: The couple at the Ritz Hotel before they both died . Soldier N’s wife last night told the Daily Mail that she had not spoken to detectives about the allegations. She said: ‘I have absolutely no idea what is going to happen. The local police are making sure we are okay.’ The new claims were described as ‘mystifying’ yesterday by Dai Davies, a former Head of Royal Protection. Mr Davies insisted the deaths were ‘an accident by any definition’ and that three separate inquiries had come to the same ‘independent conclusion’. A royal spokesman said there would be no comment from the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry or Clarence House.","Family of Henri Paul, who died in the 1997 crash, welcomed investigation .

Highest rates overall continue to be in the South, led by Arkansas and . Mississippi, each with rates of about 50 per 1,000. In Arkansas, the . majority of teen births are to white moms. In Mississippi, the majority . are black. - White . teens continue to have the lowest birth rate nationally — about 22 . births per 1,000. Black teens saw a larger improvement, but their rate . was still more than twice the white rate, at 47 per 1,000. - Overall, the Hispanic rate plummeted from 75 to 49 per 1,000, now virtually a tie with the black rate. The CDC report released Thursday is . based on birth certificates for 2007 through 2011. Last year, the CDC . announced the overall improvement in teen births: a record low of 31 . births per 1,000 teens ages 15 to 19. That compares to 42 births per . 1,000 five years earlier. The teen drop in the last five years . coincided with an overall decline in births, which experts attribute to a . weak economy that dampened enthusiasm for having children. Hispanic . women have been part of that trend, possibly due to the economy and to . illegal immigration crackdowns in some states that reduce the number of . young Hispanic females entering the country from Mexico and other . nations, said John Santelli, a Columbia University professor of . population and family health. That . means new immigrants are having less impact on birth statistics, and . second- and third-generation families are having more influence. As time goes on, Hispanics — like other immigrant groups before them — tend to adopt American customs and practices. 'There . is more attention on education, career, and the future,' said Dr. Janet . Realini, head of Healthy Futures of Texas, a San Antonio-based . organization focused on preventing teen and unplanned pregnancies. Hispanic rates, though, continue to be . much higher than those for blacks and whites in most of the states with . the largest Hispanic populations, including California, Texas, New York, . New Jersey, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Georgia. Young mother: Courtney Smith,18, prepares her daughter Kasiyah Buckner to go home from daycare at St. Paul Lutheran Childcare in St. Joseph, Mo. Texas has the highest number of teen births in the nation, with nearly 43,000 in 2011. Nearly two-thirds were to Hispanic moms. The overall improvement, though, is something to celebrate, said Bill Albert, chief program officer of the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. 'Geography, politics, or policy alone simply cannot explain the widespread declines,' Albert said in an email. 'Credit goes to teens themselves who are clearly making better decisions about sex, contraception, and their future.'","Lowest rates are in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Vermont .

Almost three out of four of the world's smartphones are now running the Android mobile operating system, a report has revealed. Google's mobile OS now has a 72.4 per cent share of the market for mobile operating systems, a massive increase from the 52.5 per cent it held a year ago. Samsung's wildly popular smartphones accounted for a big portion of that gain, with the South Korean tech giant shipping 55million units, the majority of which run on Android. Models display Samsung Electronics' newest smartphone Galaxy S III in Seoul, South Korea: New research shows the Android OS, which the SIII uses, now holds nearly three-quarters of the market . Apple, meanwhile, whose devices run on its own proprietary iOS software, sold around 23.5million phones over the same period, the third quarter of 2012. That was up from 17.3million a year ago, but the rise was not enough to stop the market share of the Silicon Valley company's operating system slipping from 15 per cent to 13.9 per cent. IT market research firm Gartner said the fall in Apple's market share could have been a result of users around the world waiting for the release of the iPhone 5 in their countries. Slipping: Apple's iOS lost market share, . possible because users around the world were awaiting the release of the . iPhone 5 (pictured) in their markets . 'With the launch of iPhone 5, Gartner analysts expect iOS share will grow strongly in the fourth quarter of 2012 because users held on to their replacements in many markets ahead of the iPhone 5 wider roll out,' it added. The news comes a week after it emerged that Samsung's flagship Galaxy S3 had become the world's best-selling smartphone for the past quarter, pushing aside Apple which had dominated the chart for more than two years. Research firm Strategy Analytics said Samsung sold 18million S3 models in the third quarter, compared with iPhone 4S sales of 16.2million. Gartner's report also showed Research In Motion's Blackberry brand continued it's precipitous decline, it's share of the world's smartphone OS market more than halving to 5.3 per cent, compared to 11 per cent at the same time last year. However, it nevertheless climbed to become the third most popular mobile OS after the number of Symbian users collapsed, that software falling from nearly 17 per cent of the market to 2.6 per cent. Microsoft's Windows Phone OS also lost some share of the market, with many users apparently holding off buying phones running Windows Phone 7 in anticipation of the release of Windows Phone 8. Source: Gartner, November 2012 . Total smartphone sales grew nearly 47 per cent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year, the research showed, accounting now for nearly 40 per cent of mobile phone sales. 'After two consecutive quarter of decline in mobile phone sales, demand has improved in both mature and emerging markets as sales increased sequentially,' said Anshul Gupta, principal research analyst at Gartner. 'In China, sales of mobile phones grew driven by sales of smartphones, while demand of feature phones remained weak. In mature markets, we finally saw replacement sales pick up with the launch of new devices in the quarter.' The smartphone marketed was dominated by Apple and Samsung. 'Both vendors together controlled 46.5 percent of smartphone market leaving a handful of vendors fighting over a distant third spot,' Mr Gupta said. But Gartner predicted a weaker than usual boost to sales over Christmas, with consumers either cautious with their money of finding other gadgets like tablet computers more attractive gifts. Total mobile phone sales continued to decline for the second quarter, falling just over 3 per cent year-on-year as non-smartphone sales plummeted 21 per cent.","Android holds 72.4 per cent share of world's mobile OS market, up from the 52.5 per cent share it held a year ago .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:49 EST, 1 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:55 EST, 1 August 2013 . The former Goldman Sachs trader known as 'Fabulous Fab' is liable in a massive mortgage securities fraud case, a New York City jury found today. The Securities and Exchange Commission had accused Fabrice Tourre of scheming to sell investors subprime mortgage securities that he knew would fail. Authorities said the maneuver allowed a hedge fund and its billionaire president, John A. Paulson, to make $1 billion by betting against the investment. Tourre, a known party lover who grew up in France and moved to the U.S. in 2000 to study at Stanford, insisted at the trial that he never misled anyone. His attorneys portrayed him as a scapegoat in the economic downturn which they said was caused by larger economic forces. Scroll down for video . Verdict: Former Goldman Sachs vice president Fabrice Tourre, center, leaves Manhattan federal court with his attorneys on Thursday after he was found liable in a massive mortgages fraud case . Tourre, 34, found liable in six of seven SEC fraud claims. He faces potential fines and a possible ban from the financial industry. The exact punishment will be determined at a future proceeding. Speaking with the Wall Street Journal, Tourre said that he knew the case would haunt him. 'I'm . not naive,' he said. 'It's going to stay with me forever... You cannot . erase Google searches. You will forever get the same articles, forever . get the fabulous Fab.' The SEC had accused Tourre of misleading institutional investors about subprime mortgage securities that he knew were doomed to fail, setting the stage for a valued Goldman hedge fund client, Paulson & Co. Inc., to secretly bet against the investment. The maneuver ended up making $1 billion for the hedge fund and its wealthy president, John A. Paulson, and millions of dollars in fees for Goldman. Liable: French-born Tourre, 34, now faces potential fines and a possible ban from the financial industry . The SEC also sought to show that it helped earn Tourre a bonus that boosted his salary to $1.7 million in 2007. SEC lawyer Matthew . Martens told the jury in the trial, which kicked off two weeks ago in New York, the deal Tourre put . together was 'secretly designed to maximize the potential it would fail' to the benefit of the hedge fund. 'In the end, Wall Street greed drove Mr. Tourre to lie and deceive,' Martens said. On the witness stand, the SEC lawyers confronted Tourre with a January 2007 email it said deliberately misled another institutional investor about Paulson's short position in the investment called Abacus 2007-AC1. Asked repeatedly if the information in the email was 'false,' Tourre responded, 'It was not accurate.' Under fire: Fabrice Tourre (3rd from L), is shown in this courtroom sketch in Manhattan Federal court . He added: 'I wasn't trying to confuse anybody; it just wasn't accurate at the time.' Leaving . the courtroom on Thursday, SEC lawyer Matthew Martens said, 'We're . obviously gratified by the jury's verdict and appreciate their hard . work.' Satisfied: After the verdict, litigator Matthew Martens said he was 'gratified' by the result . Tourre left the courthouse without speaking to reporters. His attorney also had no immediate comment. In . closing arguments, Martens called Tourre's testimony 'surreal, . imaginary, unreal, dream-like' and told jurors that the defendant wanted . them 'to live in his imaginary land ... to live in a fantasy world.' 'Only if you close your eyes to the facts, you can find Mr. Tourre not liable for his actions,' the SEC lawyer said. Tourre's attorney, John Coffey, countered that the government had 'unjustly accused him of wrongdoing.' Coffey urged jurors to put the investment's failure in perspective, noting that all similarly packaged securities ""went off the cliff as well"" after 2007. Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, said the SEC was trying to turn her client into a 'scapegoat'. 'This is not a case about whether you approve or disapprove of Wall Street,' she had said. The civil case had been called the most significant legal action related to the mortgage securities meltdown, but it lacked the drama and high stakes of white-collar criminal cases. Much of the testimony was devoted to the intricacies of synthetic collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs - a complex type of investment central to the case. Some of the testimony focused on a personal email Tourre sent to his girlfriend in France. Bourgeoisie: Fabrice Tourre reportedly 'loved to party' and claimed to be from a prominent French family . The SEC lawyers said the missive proved the hubris of a man at the center of a massive fraud, while the defense claimed was ""an old-fashioned love letter"" penned by a young trader who was full of self-doubt and angst over upheaval in the financial world. Writing in French, Tourre said of the financial markets: 'The whole building is about to collapse anytime now.' 'Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab ... Standing in the middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities!!!' Pressed by Marten on what he meant, Tourre said, 'I didn't create any monstrosities.' Goldman settled with the SEC in 2010 by paying a $550 million fine without admitting or denying wrongdoing. Tourre left the firm in 2012. Workplace: Tourre started working for Goldman Sachs in New York, pictured, in 2001 but is now pursing a PhD . Tourre told the Journal that he had never intended to work on Wall Street but moved up the ranks after landing the job at Goldman in 2001. In 2009, he was called to meet with the SEC about a deal he'd helped structure and a year later, a colleague told him there was a news story about the SEC filing a complaint against him and Goldman. 'It was a shock,' he said. Before he testified to a U.S. Senate subcommittee, he learned Goldman had released his emails to the public. 'They took certain steps that immediately didn't make me look good,' he said. 'But did I understand why they took those steps? Of course I did.' He said he is now looking forward to returning to the University of Chicago, where he is working towards a degree in economics. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Former Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre was charged with fraud for allegedly selling toxic mortgage investments deliberately designed to fail .

BP is to appeal $1billion of compensation payments for its Gulf of Mexico oil spill, after lashing out at ‘absurd’ claims by US law firms cashing in on the disaster. The British oil giant yesterday increased its estimate of the total bill for the 2010 disaster to an eye-watering £27.7billion. Some £6.3billion of the total is made up of claims by people who say the accident cost them money, many of them fishermen, hoteliers and restaurant owners. But BP is set to battle ‘fictitious’ claims by ‘greedy’ lawyers looking to use the oil company as a cash machine. The explosion happened on 20 April 2010 triggering the worst oil spill in US history. BP says it will fight fanciful legal claims over the accident . ‘No company would agree to a settlement that pays businesses that suffered no losses,’ said chief executive Bob Dudley. ‘We want everyone to know that we are digging in and are well-prepared for the long haul on legal matters.’ Mr Dudley took the reins at BP in 2010 after an explosion ripped through its Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 people and triggering the worst oil spill in U.S. history. He replaced gaffe-prone predecessor Tony Hayward, who infamously enraged Americans as the disaster unfolded by declaring: ‘I’d like my life back.’ And Mr Dudley has proved a far more popular figure in the US, particularly given his roots in the Gulf Coast state of Mississippi. Poggy fish lie dead stuck in oil in Bay Jimmy near Port Sulpher, Louisiana. Many of the claims are from businesses directl affected by the accident . But the American sought to show he was no pushover, warning that BP would take its appeal against ‘absurd’ claims all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary. He pointed out his duty to protect the interests of investors in BP, a major component of the pension funds that will help millions of Britons through their retirement. ‘BP shareholders, of which there are many in the UK - and the dividends from this company are so important here - should be unhappy, just as they should be in the US,’ he said. Mr Dudley added that the Gulf of Mexico compensation process was ‘curious and somewhat out of control’. He lashed out at America’s litigation culture, saying that inflated claims against BP were a symptom of a wider problem. He cited a claim by residents of Oklahoma against weathermen who failed to predict the devastating tornado that ripped through the US state earlier this year, killing 23 people and injuring 377 more. And he said he was recently invited to join a £15million lawsuit against Southwest Airlines over its failure to provide free drinks coupons that it had advertised. ‘There’s something wrong with this system,’ he said. ‘The precedent is not good for America.’ Mr Dudley’s comments have been spurred by a sudden surge in claims by law firms winning compensation not just for their clients, but for themselves. The compensation fund is administered by a judge, meaning BP has no control over who is deemed eligible for a payment. Since BP agreed to settle, administrators of the settlement fund have paid an average £527,000 to more than 300 law firms, adding up to more than £160million in total. But in the past week the average claim by a law firm has spiralled to nearly £1million, while one firm secured a £10million payment for itself. The cash windfalls come on top of any fees charged to ordinary claimants such as shrimp farmers and hoteliers, who typically forfeit up to 25 per cent of their payouts to lawyers acting on their behalf. A dam erected at Grand Isle, Louisiana, to protect the island's beaches from oil that washes ashore from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion and spill in the Gulf of Mexico . The rough ride given to BP contrasts with the treatment of US construction giant Halliburton, which made the cement on the British firm’s doomed well. Halliburton has agreed to pay a fine of just $200,000 after it was found to have destroyed evidence from tests it performed on the quality of the cement used in the well. But the financial hit is dwarfed by BP’s own costs, which it has warned could rise beyond the £27.7billion it has set aside. BP has previously warned it faces a ‘feeding frenzy’ of lawyers, while the firm’s US head of communications last week said the firm’s efforts to meet its obligations were being exploited. ‘The Deepwater Horizon settlement could have been a model for resolving lawsuits after industrial accidents,’ said Geoff Morrell. ‘Instead it’s running into a monument to plaintiffs’ lawyers’ greed.’ BP intends to appeal against some £650million of payouts in total, with claims by law firms believed to make up nearly half of the total.","BP set to battle 'fictitious' claims from U.S. lawyers .

Driver: Gagandeep Kakkad, 23, was banned from driving after admitting causing death by careless driving after Neil Bird died . A drunken pedestrian knocked down and killed by a hybrid car while walking home may not have heard its quiet engine as it approached him, a court heard. Neil Bird suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital following the collision with a hybrid Toyota Prius. Gagandeep Kakkad was banned from driving, ordered to carry out community service and pay court costs after admitting causing death by careless driving. The 23-year-old avoided going to prison as the judge heard Mr Bird had been in the middle of the road and dressed completely in black when he was hit in the early hours of the morning. There was also evidence to suggest that Kakkad was only driving around 28mph at the point of impact. Prosecutor Sandra Beck said: 'The deceased in this case was in the road and from where the car ended up we know he was right in the middle of the carriageway Mr Kakkad was travelling in. 'It was always the Crown’s case he should have seen him for a significant period. It was quite clear there was no braking, no deviation prior to the impact.' The court heard Kakkad, a student of micro-electronics at Brunel University, had been working at one of his father’s restaurants. He left to go home, giving a colleague a lift on the way, along a route he had never driven at night. As they drove along Wokingham Road in Reading, Berkshire shortly after 4am, Kakkad claimed he was distracted by the lights of an oncoming car. His passenger, however, saw the figure in the road and said: 'Slow, slow,' but to no avail. Mr Bird’s head hit the corner of the roof and the windscreen pillar and although he was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment the 43-year-old died of his injuries. He had been wandering home to Highgate Road, in Woodley, Berkshire, from Reading’s Purple Turtle bar, where he was a regular. Thomas Garner, for the defence, said his client’s estimated speed of less than 30mph may have been significant, particularly given the type of vehicle involved. 'The evidence from a taxi driver, who had encountered the deceased in the road minutes earlier, the evidence from buses, from CCTV, does show the deceased in the carriageway and weaving in and out. Silent: Neil Bird suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital following the collision with the hybrid Toyota Prius (file picture). The defence said the lack of engine noise might not have alerted him . 'It may be the lack of significant engine noise may not have alerted him.' He said his client had accepted he was responsible but that he nevertheless believed it had been a tragic accident. Kakkad had stopped at the scene, dialled 999 and, together with a passing cyclist, desperately tried to help Mr Bird. 'It has caused him significant problems,' said Mr Garner. 'He described being in total shock for about a week afterwards. He didn’t really believe it had happened. There’s a degree of confusion on his part. He said he was having dreams that he had seen him (Mr Bird) earlier in the evening. 'It is clearly a tragedy that will stay with the Bird family forever but also a tragedy that will stay with Mr Kakkad forever. Mr Bird had been wandering home from the pub to Highgate Road, in Woodley, Berkshire, from Reading’s Purple Turtle bar, where he was a regular. The crash happened in Wokingham Road, pictured . 'It is a nightmare for him.' The student had interrupted his university course because of what happened and was intending to resume it in 2014. The court heard that Mr Kakkad was distracted by the lights from an on-coming car and should have seen Mr Bird. Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You were driving a hybrid car and driving up the Wokingham Road. Mr Bird had been walking down the road and there is evidence from a taxi driver that Mr Bird had started walking into the road, both into the bus lane and the main carriageway itself. 'As you were driving along it seems your attention was drawn to the right. You thought there was a car coming round the corner. 'This is a little more than momentary inattention.' She accepted Kakkad, of Purley on Thames, Berkshire was genuinely extremely remorseful. The judge ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work over 12 months, to pay £1,200 pounds in court costs, and she also disqualified him from driving for 18 months and ordered him to take an extended test to regain his licence.","Neil Bird suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital .

The owner of an infested takeaway restaurant has been fined after a child found a cockroach baked into their pizza crust. Matloob Hussain, 44, was ordered to shut down his business after the bugs were discovered scuttling around in pans, inside chiller cabinets and running up the wall. Cooking equipment and surfaces were filthy and covered in years worth of dirt, grease and food debris, Leeds Magistrates’ Court heard. Infested: The cockroach baked into the child's pizza at Munchies takeaway in Leeds . Filthy: Environmental health officers who found the kitchen to be overrun with insects and full of mouldy food . Bags of mouldy doner kebab meat were on the floor and food were found stored directly on filthy surfaces at Munchies takeaway at 21 Harehills Road in Leeds. It was immediately closed down by environmental health officers when they saw the state of the food preparation areas. Fined: Former owner Matloob Hussain . Derek Hallam, prosecuting, said a child’s father reported the matter on August 22 last year after one of his children spotted the insect in a pizza. Situated near the city centre, the American-style takeaway is used as a regular treat by residents in the Harehills area of Leeds. Its website offers 'special calzones' and 'vegetable calzones' as its specialities. Hussain was fined £750 and ordered to pay £1,250 court costs after pleading guilty to eight offences relating to failing to keep his premises clean.

Brave: Abby Wetherell, from Michigan, miraculously survived the bear attack by playing dead but sustained deep gashes and puncture wounds to her thighs and back . Injuries: The animal knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful paws as she screamed for help . Wanted: The black bear knocked the girl down twice and lashed one of her thighs with its powerful claws before fleeing into the woods . Speaking to Good Morning America today she said: 'I see this bear. Oh, my gosh. I start running the way I was coming . from. All of a sudden, the bear stopped me and put me down . on ground, scraping me and clawing me. 'I was terrified. I was thinking, ""I shouldn't have went for this jog. This is it, I'm a goner'."" The bear suddenly stopped attacking . her and she took the chance to get up and run away but the bear came . back. She decided to pet it to see if she could get the animal to like . her. 'That did not work. Then it just got me again. 'And then I heard that you should . play dead. So that's what I did,' she told GMA. 'And then it kind of . went away and then it looked back and . then it just took off.' Her father Chris told GMA: 'I was in . shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I . saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible.' Abby was taken to hospital and had to get 100 stitches on her wounds over two hours of surgery. She is recovering at home. She said of her injuries: 'When the bear was attacking me, I couldn't feel it. I was . just numb. I don't know how or why but my whole body went numb and when I . started getting up it hurt bad. 'It's over. But, I'm not going to go in the woods without anybody. I'm OK and I'll be all right.' The Michigan Department of Natural . Resources (DNS) set traps in the area of the attack in Wexford County's . Haring Township, just north of Cadillac, and asked the public to be on . the lookout. The county has a well-established bear population but the animals generally avoid humans, DNR wildlife biologist Adam Bump said. The . agency gets occasional reports of females challenging people who get . too close to their cubs, he said. But in those cases, the sow usually . snaps at the person once or twice and leaves. The bear that went after Abby apparently was not protecting cubs, which made the attack highly unusual. If the animal is caught, it will be euthanized and tested for rabies or other diseases, DNR spokesman Ed Golder said. Father Chris Wetherell said: 'I was in shock when I first saw her. I didn't believe it was a bear attack until I saw the claw marks and bruises. It was horrible' Back home: Abby Wetherell is now recovering from the attack at home after undergoing two-hour surgery . Despite the fright, the spunky girl, who is a hunter, said she was planning to return to the site where she was attacked and was more concerned about missing a soccer game this weekend, her grandfather David Wetherell said, the Detroit Free Press reported. ‘She didn't want to let the team down,’ he said of Abby, who is a goalie on a traveling soccer team.Michigan's black bear population is estimated at 8,000 to 10,000 but about 90 per cent are in the Upper Peninsula, the DNR said. Wexford County is in the northwestern Lower Peninsula. Bears have been ranging farther south in recent years as growth of forested areas has provided more habitat and travel corridors, Bump said. Tough cookie: Abby, who is a hunting enthusiast, a soccer goalie, and loves the great outdoors, plans to return to the site of the bear attack in the near future - but not on her own . People who venture into likely bear territory should carry pepper spray, travel in small groups and make noise to avoid startling them, the DNR said. ‘If you encounter a bear, stand your ground and then slowly back away,’ the agency said in a news release. ‘Do not turn away.’ It advised people not to show fear, run or play dead, but instead to make themselves look as big as possible and talk to the animal in a stern voice.

Coronation Street star Chris Fountain has issued a grovelling apology after he was axed from the show after video clips appeared online showing him rapping about rape and violence. The Yorkshire-born actor, 25, conceded 'ITV had no choice but to terminate my contract' after it emerged that he was the star of the vile YouTube videos under the name of his rap alter-ego The Phantom. Soap bosses have already filmed a scene to explain the departure of his character Tommy Duckworth, which sees him flee Weatherfield after an argument with his girlfriend Tina McIntyre (Michelle Keegan). Scroll down for video . Coronation Street's reputation hit a new low this week as Fountain was fired after being unmasked as the rapper behind hate-filled internet videos in which he threatened to rape, batter and stab women . On Monday evening, ITV confirmed that . the actor had been sacked from the soap, stating: 'Chris Fountain's . contract with ITV has been terminated as a result of the unacceptable . comments he made in a number of online clips.' Was ITV right to sack Chris Fountain from Coronation Street? 'Mortified' Fountain has issued an apology and said he is 'deeply ashamed' of the YouTube videos, which show the actor spouting lyrics about raping women, bombing houses and stabbing people in the face with syringes. In one distasteful clip, he raps . about dragging a girl upstairs, adding: ‘I will **** anybody up in the . worst way, rape a b***h on her birthday.’ The actor has said the explicit lyrics were 'blurted out in a moment of madness'. He said in a statement: 'I would like to . sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. I am deeply ashamed . by the lyrics and very much regret my behaviour. 'The videos were made . over a year ago when I was experimenting with music and I’ve not done . anything like it since and nor will I,' said the actor, who said he accepted ITV had 'no choice' but to end his contract. Show bosses have decided not to edit . Chris out of episodes he has already filmed so his character,  mechanic Tommy Duckworth, will appear on TV this week. Family soap: Fountain, seen in a scene from the show with co-star Michelle Keegan, will not be edited out of upcoming episodes that have already been filmed . However, on Monday his former co-stars filmed scenes, which apparently showed David Platt (Jack P Shepherd) telling Tina that Tommy had taken a flight after a row with her. In scenes which are likely to be broadcast in around six weeks time, David tells Tina: 'Tommy proper kicked off. He packed a bag and went off to the airport.' Over the weekend Coronation Street bosses reportedly urged Fountain to speak out on a television show such as Daybreak or This Morning in a bid to appease fans. 'The lyrics that appeared online were influenced by a style of hip-hop that I was experimenting with at a private freestyle session and blurted out in a moment of madness. There is absolutely no excuse - I take complete responsibility for my actions - but they were in no way thought out or represent at all my attitude towards women, rape and violence. I just want to apologise from the bottom of my heart to everyone who I have offended or upset. I completely understand that ITV had no choice but to terminate my contract today. I have had two wonderful years playing Tommy Duckworth with only happy memories of my time on Coronation Street. I am mortified that I have brought so much embarrassment to my colleagues and employers these last few days. My biggest regret however is not to do with losing my job, but that I have hurt and let down so many people including those in a vulnerable situation and I am so very deeply ashamed of this. I am also mortified to have put my mother, grandad and girlfriend through the last few days which they are hurt and bewildered by and so do not deserve. I am so sorry. Once again to everyone who I have let down and hurt. I am deeply sorry.' A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'These videos are disgusting and bosses now need to work out exactly how to handle the situation. 'But while they are furious, they need to make sure his future is dealt with fairly... He is hoping the fact that they are suggesting he might go on TV to make a grovelling apology is a sign that they could see a future for him.' The source suggested Fountain could appear on several TV shows in order to ensure his apology reached the broadest audience possible, or possibly hold a press conference about the scandal. But the broadcaster confirmed last night that there was no longer a place for Fountain at Coronation Street. In one of the shocking video clips the actor performs a . stabbing action while he raps: ‘I’m a nasty ****, I will punch you in . the face and you look like you’ve been having some acupuncture ’cos my . fist is lethal. ‘I’m a ******* hero, you’ve got ******* zero. I’m a mother******* demon, I’ll stab you in the face with a needle.’ Fountain, . who finished runner-up in the third series of celebrity skating show . Dancing On Ice in 2008, also raps about being fed up with fame as he . lounges on a sofa with local rap group the West Yorkshire Cypher. ‘**** . with me and you don’t want to risk it, I’ll play you like a board game. I’m bored of fame so I’m taking the rap game, remember the name, it’s . ******* Phantom,’ he raps. Last . night a spokesman for support service Rape Crisis said: ‘This is yet . another shocking example of the hatred directed towards women by some . men. 'To dignify this with . the name ""music"" does music an injustice, but the far greater injustice . is that our young people are subjected to lyrics which encourage sexual . violence against women. ‘If . these violent and hate-filled lyrics were directed against other groups . in society, they would be counted as incitement to violence and treated . as a crime.’ Under fire: The 25-year-old actor, pictured at a Corrie party on July 26, has been slammed by charities and women's groups over his offensive lyrics . Faye Maxted, . chief executive of The Survivors Trust, said: ‘He is a high-profile . character. It shows a complete lack of any kind of respect for women at . all.’ Fountain, who has been dating girlfriend Jessica Derrick since 2010, has insisted the controversial lyrics 'in no way' represent his attitude towards women, rape or violence. Coronation Street producers immediately suspended him from the show, in which he has played mechanic Tommy Duckworth since 2011, when news of his rap alter-ego broke. Lounging: Chris, AKA The Phantom, raps while sat on a sofa with a group of pals. His video has since been removed from YouTube . Behind the mask: Chris Fountain has expressed his 'deep shame' at appearing in YouTube videos as masked rapper The Phantom . An . ITV spokesman said when the videos first emerged: ‘ITV finds the language used and the views . expressed in this video totally unacceptable. Chris Fountain has been . suspended pending further inquiries into this matter.’ The . former Hollyoaks star has changed his YouTube privacy settings to try . to ensure the series of five videos – already seen by thousands – can no longer be . viewed. However, other versions had been uploaded yesterday, meaning they were still widely available for viewing. An . official Twitter account belonging to The Phantom, which reportedly . contained a tweet in which he boasts about killing a rap rival, has also . been hastily removed.

The former Only Fools And Horses actor said that the BBC1 sitcom, which starred Lyndhurst and David Jason as Rodney and Derek Trotter, would not be made today. Lyndhurst, 52, who has replaced Alun Armstrong in detective series New Tricks, said his son Archie had the ‘acting gene’ and was a pupil at the Sylvia Young Theatre School.

Ducks and geese have been banned from eating white bread at a nature reserve because keepers are concerned it is making them fat. They claim families are arriving with bin bags full of white loaves to feed the birds at ponds in a Cambridgeshire country park, where they have been for the past 36 years. But officials say the creatures have now piled on the pounds, and as a result conservationists have had to put the hundreds of birds at Ferry Meadows Country Park, in Peterborough, on a diet. Ducks have been banned from eating white bread at a nature reserve because keepers are concerned it is making them fat . Some of the fat geese at Ferry Meadows Country Park which are being overfed by visitors. The weight gain shows in the thickness of the geese's legs . In a bid to cut out the huge quantities of carbohydrates being consumed by the birds, members of the public will be stopped from feeding them bread. The park shop has also stopped selling bread, and instead will be offering wildlife lovers 'healthy pellets'. Chris Park, 55, the park’s conservation officer since 1990, said he had no doubt white bread was the reason his ducks had become so plump. He said: 'About 90 per cent of people bring white bread to feed the ducks. 'If you put your children on an exclusive diet of bread then they would get fat too. 'People come along and think they aren’t getting fed but then ten minutes later somebody else will turn up with a big bag full. 'The weight issues were really apparent in some of our geese as well. 'Their stomachs and inside between their legs were nearly touching the ground.' Visitors to the park have been given the commercially available healthy duck pellets for the last four months, after the problem was first identified. Park wardens now plan to clamp down on the bread ban further amid concerns birth defects in chicks is linked to their parents living exclusively on white loaves. One condition, called angel wing, saw some of the ducklings and goslings unable to fly when their feathers grew in at protruding angles. It left them vulnerable to attacks from dogs and foxes but now Mr Park has revealed that the situation has drastically improved. They claim families are arriving with bin bags full of white loaves to feed the birds at ponds in a Cambridgeshire country park, where they have been for the past 36 years . Chris Park, 55, the park's conservation officer since 1990, said he had no doubt white bread was the reason his ducks, geese and swans had become so plump . Bread handouts led to the ducks, geese and swans on the pond crowding around the park visitor centre in a 'quacking mob' rather than foraging for themselves. A a fence has been erected around the water edge, and new feeding platforms installed, in a bid to control the birds’ weight. Mr Park added: 'The pellets we are using can float on the surface on the water and it encourages the ducks to forage naturally. The birds have now been placed on a diet by keepers who will only allow visitors to feed them healthy pellets . 'Since we brought in the changes there has already been a drastic improvement. 'We don’t have a rat problem any more and we don’t have any issues with angel wing among the ducklings.' A spokesperson from the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) confirmed that obesity in birds is something that needs to be looked at across the UK. Graham Appleton, from the BTO, said: 'Quite a few people are worried about how much white bread is being fed to ducks. 'We’re trying to encourage a more natural diet - nuts, fruit and seeds - where possible. 'When you’ve got ducks on a pond, that’s all they’re doing, sitting on the pond and eating, so they do tend to eat too much food and gain that extra weight.' Nene Park was opened in 1976 where both wild and domestic birds have lived on the pond in Ferry Meadows.","Birds have piled on weight at Ferry Meadows Country Park, Peterborough .

In 1963, then-12-year-old Dennis Komsa wrote a note on a piece of paper, put it in a glass mason jar and hurled it into the Atlantic Ocean near Sampson Avenue in Seaside Heights, New Jersey, hoping it would some day be returned to him. In November of 2012, nearly 50 years after Komsa tossed his message in a bottle into the ocean, the bottle was found. But not on some exotic, tropical island as Komsa might have hoped - it was found a quarter of a mile away from where Komsa had thrown it in. The bottle was found by Norman Stanton about a week after Hurricane Sandy devastated the New Jersey coast - he was picking through some debris outside his sister's home when he saw the jar away from the other bits of rubbish scattered throughout the yard. Message in a bottle: This note was found in November last year - nearly 50 years after it was tossed into the Atlantic Ocean . Message from the past: Hurricane Sandy tossed the message in a bottle into a back yard a quarter of a mile from where it was tossed into the sea . Science experiment: Komsa, seen here with his father, would often do these types of 'experiments' when he was growing up .

New York Yankee's boss Brian Cashman knew about steroid use in the team but turned a blind eye because he had a 'win-at-any-cost' attitude, explosive court papers claim. The papers were filed yesterday on behalf of Louise Meanwell - who had an affair with Cashman in 2011 and was later accused of stalking and extorting money from him to stay quiet about their relationship. The British native claims the Yankee's boss told her about steroid use within the team and even named specific players. The papers also state that Cashman admitted to her during 'pillow talk' that he intentionally misled . federal investigators during the Roger Clemen's investigation. Demands: Louise Meanwell filed legal papers in a bid to force Joe Tacopina to drop A-Rod as his client . Allegations: Explosive court papers say that Brian Cashman, right, knew about steroid use in the clubhouse and that A-Rod is a victim of a Yankee 'take down' 'Mr Cashman was ambivalent to the use of performance . enhancing drugs so long as nothing came back to the Yankee’s . organization,' the papers state. 'And shared with [Meanwell] his win-at-any-cost attitude.' Ms Meanwell spent five months in Riker's Island prison after she was . arraigned on grand larceny, stalking and harassment charges in February . 2012 relating to the affair. Court papers filed on behalf of Ms Meanwell's . mother in January this year accused Cashman of conspiring to have his former lover . committed so their affair would never be revealed. Ms Meanwell claims Rodriguez is another victim of a Yankee 'take-down'. 'Mr Rodriguez and his current circumstance is consistent with a New York . Yankee management take-down, as was in the case of [Meanwell],' the papers state. The motion was filed to force Joe Tacopina into ditching the Yankee's player on the basis his legal firm, Tacopina Seigel & Turano, had a conflict of interest. Ms Meanwell . is being represented by Stephen . Turano from the same law offices on a . separate case in New Jersey, not related to the Cashman affair. She claims Tacopina did not ask . her permission when he agreed to represent Rodriguez, who earlier this . month was handed a 211-match ban after he admitted to using performance . enhancing drugs. Ms Meanwell . says she paid Turano $10,000 and gave him 'intimate details' of her . relationship with Cashman and their conversations - some of which were about steroid use in the Yankees. Bullish: Joe Tacopina has hit back and accused Ms Meanwell's lawyer of 'not knowing the facts' of his own case . Peter Gleason, who filed the latest . papers on behalf of Ms Meanwell, said as Cashman’s former lover she . could be called to the stand in a forthcoming case involving the Yankee's slugger. Ms Meanwell's court papers claim: 'Prior . to Tacopina, Siegel & Turano PC representing Alex Rodriguez, [Meanwell] was never contacted nor did [she] give informed consent so . that Tacopina could represent what could be the differing interests [of . Meanwell and Rodriguez].' Gleason said: 'You . don’t drop a blue-collar client, who has paid a considerable amount of . money, for a marquis client coming down the pipe unless you get informed . consent.' But Tacopina hit back, arguing Ms Meanwell had hired Turano’s separate New Jersey firm, and not the New York-based Tacopina, Seigel & Turano - as her court papers . claim - to represent her. Centre stage: Alex 'A-Rod' Rodriguez was banned for 211 matches earlier this month after admitting to taking performance enhancing drugs while he was playing for the Texas Rangers . Tacopina also noted that Ms Meanwell was not 'dropped' as a client by Turano’s New Jersey firm. He pointed out Turano was still on retainer, adding Gleason 'should not make statements when he does not know the facts of his own case'. Tacopina said: 'It’s the most ridiculous motion I’ve ever seen. Even if they had gotten the law firm right, there is no conflict of interest. 'I don’t represent Brian Cashman, and I clearly don’t represent the Yankees. Their argument makes no sense.' But a legal expert told the New York Daily News there does appears to be a conflict of interest, regardless of whether two firms are involved. 'The problem is that the lawyer [could] be less than loyal to one client or the other,' said Monroe Freedman, a professor of law at Hofstra University.","Baseball steroids' scandal in new twist after 'conflict of interest' claims .

"By . Larisa Brown . PUBLISHED: . 19:36 EST, 19 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:35 EST, 19 August 2013 . Schools have been accused of reviving a controversial rule banning the promotion of homosexuality in the classroom. Ministers have ordered an immediate investigation into evidence suggesting dozens of schools and academies have been enforcing the rule – known as Section 28 – ten years after it was abolished. The law, introduced by Margaret  Thatcher’s Government, was blamed for inciting discrimination against gay people and was repealed by Tony Blair in 2003. Discrimination: At least 44 schools and academy groups in England policies that either echo Section 28 or appear not to be aware that it had been repealed (file photo) Ministers are said to be ‘concerned’ about the disclosures. Department for Education officials are looking into the schools, whose policies include clauses replicating Section 28 by singling out homosexuality as an issue. According to research by the British Humanist Association, at least 44 schools and academy groups in England have sex and relationship education policies that either echo the controversial clause or appear not to be aware that it had been repealed. Among those listed are the Grace Academies, three schools in the West Midlands which describe themselves as having a Christian ethos. The group’s policy, published on its website, says: ‘Objective discussion of homosexuality may take place in the classroom, including discussion of homophobic behaviour.’ But it adds: ‘The governing body will not permit the promotion of homosexuality.’ Equality fighter: Tony Blair repealed the law in 2003 . The Crest Academies, which runs two single-sex schools in North West London, also bans the ‘promotion of homosexuality’. Some schools identified by the researchers have already taken their policy statements down and it is unclear whether the phrasing was a deliberate signal or an oversight. But the DfE said it would be looking into the schools, adding that singling out homosexuality was ‘unacceptable’. It said: ‘All schools can draw up their own sex education policy but they must ensure they do not discriminate unfairly on grounds of sexual orientation. ‘Our sex and relationship education guidance makes it clear that schools should not promote any sexual orientation.’ Section 28 was a clause in the Local Government Act 1988 which prevented councils from allowing teaching which promoted the ‘acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship’. It was introduced by the Tories in response to evidence of Left-wing councils promoting gay relationships in schools. It was repealed by Labour with the Conservatives’ support. Section 28 also prevented councils spending money on educational materials and projects perceived to promote a gay lifestyle. While no one was ever prosecuted under the section, it was considered homophobic and had a wide effect. Libraries refused to stock gay newspapers, while gay websites were blocked on school and college computers. Teachers were confused about what they could say and do, and were unsure whether they could act when pupils faced homophobic bullying. In 2009 David Cameron issued an extraordinary apology on behalf of the Conservative Party for the legislation, seen by some as deeming homosexuality as unacceptable. He said the party had ‘got it wrong’ when it introduced the law in the late 1980s. Mr Cameron has overseen the change in the law that will allow same-sex couples to marry.","Section 28 banned the promotion of homosexuality in the classroom .

A hotel stay should be a chance to relax in luxury, put your feet up and have a night off doing the dishes. But one in three British hotel guests are too polite to leave the chores to hotel staff and admitted making the bed, tidying up and washing up tea cups before checking out of their rooms. And 10 per cent of Brits said they would try to make a maid’s life easier by avoiding wearing the hotel robe or using the tea making facilities. In a survey done by Appy Hotel some .

Younger . people in particular prefer not to trouble hotel workers, and 73 per . cent would rather deal with a problem themselves than ask for help.

A . third of British hotel guests said they would prefer to ask for help . over the phone, or using a mobile or tablet app than speak to hotel . staff in person.

A 16-year-old girl was lured to a hotel on the bogus promise of a cleaning job before being stabbed 58 times and sexually assaulted, a court heard. College student Sasha Marsden's body was then set on fire and dumped in an alleyway after she had been killed, a jury was told. The teenager suffered 'terrible and catastrophic' injuries as she was stabbed 58 times to the head, neck and face with a . kitchen knife. She 'struggled ferociously' in a vain attempt to fend off her 'sexually motivated' murderer David Minto, 23, in Blackpool, Lancashire, the court heard. Victim: Sasha Marsden, 16, was stabbed 58 times during the savage attack in Blackpool, Lancashire, a court heard today . Police who found her body thought a mannequin had been set on fire because she had suffered such severe injuries, it was said. Her injuries were so bad that she could only be identified by DNA from her toothbrush, Preston Crown Court heard. Minto, 23, is alleged to have removed her partially . clothed body wrapped in carpet underlay, a black bin liner and bedding . and set it alight behind the Grafton House Hotel in Kirby Road, Blackpool. Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said the knife wounds were 'deep and penetrating', with 48 of the wounds mainly to the back of the head. He said: 'There were a large number of wounds to her fingers, hands and forearms which were entirely consistent with what are known as defence wounds. 'In other words Sasha had struggled ferociously with her assailant in a vain effort to save her own life.' Minto was arrested shortly after the incident on January 31 and went on to tell 'a series of lies' to hide his involvement including a claim that Sasha, a child care student, had 'thrown herself' at him sexually, said the prosecutor. Forensic tests showed the teenager’s blood was found on the defendant’s clothing, throughout the hotel and on the murder weapon. Murder: Sasha was lured to a hotel in Blackpool after being promised a cleaning job, a jury heard . Her blood-stained Adidas top, pink and white training boots, pink purse and mobile phone were found in a waste bin in the rear alleyway. The phone had been dismantled and the battery removed, the court heard. Mr Wright said: 'It is the prosecution’s case that Sasha was subjected to a ferocious attack within the hotel. 'She was stabbed repeatedly by the defendant during the course of which she was sexually assaulted and, notwithstanding the valiant struggle she had put in, she succumbed to those injuries and died.' Minto then embarked on a 'determined effort' to clean up the property and dispose of any evidence connecting him to the murder and his sexual assault of her, said Mr Wright. Following his arrest the defendant said in a prepared statement that Sasha arrived at the hotel at about 3.45pm and he showed her what she needed to do for the job. 'He then suggested she had thrown herself at him when he came out of the toilet and he accepted that sexual contact had taken place between them,' Mr Wright added. Scene: A police officer stands guard after the dead 16-year-old girl's body was discovered in an alleyway in Blackpool . 'He went on to say that she carried on cleaning and that she had then had a severe nosebleed while kneeling down in the hallway. She told him this happened a lot.' When told that the body could be that of Sasha, Minto told police: 'If this was Sasha then I’m shocked and very saddened.' Mr Wright told the jury: 'We say nothing could be further from the truth. The truth was that this was a sexually motivated murder of a young girl by this young man in the confines of a hotel when she was alone and vulnerable. 'The truth is that Sasha Marsden met her death at the hands of this man. He set out to and he did in fact kill her. 'He set fire to her body and he disposed of her clothing and valuables as he tried to erase any evidence of his involvement in her death.' Minto met Sasha, from Staining, near Blackpool, through a mutual friend on a night out in Blackpool towards the end of 2012, the court heard. Investigation: A police forensics tent is set up as officers investigate the killing earlier this year . On January 27 - four days before her death - Minto managed to contact her on Facebook, jurors were told. Using his moniker David 'Demon' Minto he mentioned the prospect of a job at the hotel to 'arouse her interest in meeting him'. Mr Wright said Minto did not have the authority or money to offer her job and there was no need for it in the quiet off-season. He also kept his contact with Sasha as a 'complete and total secret' from his girlfriend who ran the hotel. It is alleged the defendant further defiled the teenager when he sexually assaulted her as she lay dying or was already dead. Minto denies murder. The case continues.

'Thank . you all so so much for your love and support. It means the world to me . and my family,' adding: 'I wish I could hug you all right now.'

The couple were charged in a 39-count indictment Monday with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, bank fraud, making false statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud. They are accused of exaggerating their income while applying for loans before their TV show debuted in 2009, then hiding their fortunes in a bankruptcy filing after their first season aired.

On the same day that the U.S. Department of State issued a global terrorism warning, a message suspected to be from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was posted on multiple jihadist web forums on Friday. In the 14-minute audio message, the 62-year-old al-Zawahiri criticizes the ouster of Muslim Brotherhood-backed former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy, blaming the military coup that resulted in his removal on Americans and 'Zionists.' The crusaders, the seculars, the Americanized army, (former Egyptian President .

However, the network notes that 'the language used in the last posting resembles that in other messages . attributed to al-Zawahiri in which he criticizes the treatment from . various parties of Morsy, the former Muslim Brotherhood leader who last . year became Egypt's first democratically elected president.' The terrorist leader goes on to say that those behind Morsi's ouster want a 'secular, pro-American president to rule Egypt so they can continue with . their plotting -- along with the Americans and Zionists -- to divide . Egypt, just like what happened in Sudan.' Ousted: former Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi was removed from power last month . Protests: Thousands of Egyptians took to the streets of Cairo to protest Morsi's ouster . Al-Zawahiri is part of a distinguished Egyptian family who worked as a surgeon with the Egyptian Islamic Jihad when it tried to overthrow President Anwar Sadat. Following Sadat's 1981 assasination, al-Zawahiri was convicted of weapons charges, . In 1980, al-Zawahiri met Osama bin Laden and roughly 10 years later merged the Egyptian Islamic Jihad with bin Laden's al Qaeda. In the other message released this week - believed to have been recorded on June 5 - al-Zawahiri slammed the U.S. for its treatment of detainees at the Guantanamo Bay military prison who had gone on hunger strike. Additionally, he urged Muslims to unite and fight. Earlier Friday, the State Department issued what the Associated Press referred to as an 'extraordinary global travel warning' following an apparent terrorist threat.

Ted, an 11-year-old bearded collie, was put down after suffering kidney failure caused by the adder bite on his front left leg while on a walk with his owner Pauline O’Brien, 67. The vet who treated Ted said it was the first time in her career of 26 years that she had seen a pet killed by a snake bite. Snakebite: A family photo of Ted, the 11-year-old bearded collie who had to be put down after he was bitten by a snake while on a walk in a park in Bolton, Greater Manchester, and went down with kidney failure . Adders are the only venomous snakes found in the wild in Britain and will normally only attack if they feel threatened. It is thought the adder may have bitten Ted because it was afraid it was about to be trodden on by the dog. Pauline, a divorced mum-of-one and a mobile hairdresser from Bolton, Greater Manchester, is now warning other dog owners to beware when using parks in the area. She had had Ted since he was a puppy. 'Like losing part of the family': Ted's owner Pauline O'Brien, 67, had him since he was a puppy and has been left distraught by his death . The incident happened at Smithills . Country Park in Bolton. Ted was bitten near the historic Smithills . Coaching House and it was not until the day after, when he started . limping badly, that he was taken to the vets and the adder bite was . spotted under his long hair. Ted . suffered from arthritis so his difficulty walking was not initially . thought to be a cause for concern. But when the swollen leg was shaved . the bite was discovered. He was bitten four weeks ago but his condition deteriorated, eventually suffering kidney failure, and he died on Saturday when he was put down by vets. She said: 'We were just walking around and he was off his lead and he was going in the long grass, I think that must be where it happened. 'It is very long grass and he is a bit clumsy, I think he had probably stood on the adder. 'When we got home I noticed that he was limping, I thought it was his arthritis but his leg had really swollen up. 'I took him to the vets and she initially thought that he had broken his leg but after the X-ray she called and said that it wasn’t broken. 'When she shaved all his hair she saw the two horizontal bite marks and she thought he had been bitten by an adder. 'Obviously what has happened is the poison had caused him to have kidney failure. At first the vet gave him penicillin, antibiotics and anti inflammatory but he was being sick after the medications. 'It was very serious and the vet had to give him injections because he wasn’t eating and then he was put on a drip. 'It was heartbreaking to see him like that, he couldn’t even get up the stairs he was that frail. I just looked at him and I thought he can’t go on any longer. A black adder, Vipera berus, in Sussex: Adders are the only poisonous snakes found in the wild in Britain and will normally only attack if they feel threatened . Location: Smithills Country Park near Bolton where the adder was lurking before it bit elderly Ted . Part of the family: Ted with his owner Pauline on one of their many walks. Vets battled to save him but couldn't . Irreplaceable: The family had to put Ted to sleep and they felt like they were 'losing part of the family' 'It was devastating to make the decision to put him to sleep. It was like losing part of the family. 'Ted will be irreplaceable. It was love at first sight when I saw him. 'I’m . still shocked that there are snakes, you don’t normally hear of them in . the UK but apparently because of the warm weather at this time of the . year there has been an influx of them. Since this has happened I have actually heard of other dogs being bitten. It’s tragic.' Unlucky: According to NHS Direct most snake bites suffered in the UK are not often serious and rarely deadly . Rare attack: Ted pictured in the snow. Vets said it was the first adder bite that they had come across . Vet Ruth Harrison, from Vets4Pets, said the suspected adder bite was the first she had come across in 26 years of working in Bolton and Chorley. She added: 'We rarely see snake bites. We tend to see adders on the moors or in other wild areas. They try to avoid people. Ted’s bite looked very much like a snake bite. 'Adders are the only indigenous snakes in the UK that are venomous. The bite caused a nasty reaction, it damaged all the tissues in his leg. Dogs are affected in different ways by the poison.'

Hopes have been raised for a 12-year-old girl fighting for her life after contracting a rare and extremely deadly brain-eating amoeba while swimming at an Arkansas water park. Kali Hardig contracted parasitic meningitis, a very rare form of meningitis that only a 128 people have been diagnosed with this in the U.S. in the past fifty years, more than two weeks ago. As she fights for her life in Arkansas Children's Hospital, the outlook so far has been grim since her disease is 99-percent fatal and most victims die within a week, according to the CDC. But Kali's mom, Traci Hardig, recently stated that she is confident her daughter will be one of the few survivors. Raised hopes: Hopes have been raised for 12-year-old Kali Hardig who is fighting for her life after contracting a rare and extremely deadly brain-eating amoeba two weeks ago . ‘It has been a very emotional couple days. Kali has reached for my hand, she has squeezed my hand, and she has moved her head,’ her mother optimistically wrote on Facebook last night. ‘To a mom that has been through what I have the past two weeks. This has been the answer to my prayers. I feel so blessed to have my baby Kali still her and all the support we are getting from all our family and friends, also from total strangers! ‘Please keep praying for my baby and I will keep the updates coming. Thanks again everyone for the out pour of love an support for Kali and our whole family!’ Kahli is indeed awake now as doctors are lowering her level of sedation, KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas reports. Good signs: Only two people in the world have survived amoebic meningitis and her mother is confident that Kali will be the third . Hardig is the second person to have . come down with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in three years after . swimming in the sandy-bottom lake at Willow Springs Water Park near . Little Rock, Arkansas. Only . two people in the world are known to have survived the extremely rare . Naegleria infection since the Centers for Disease Control began tracking . it in 1962. Kali's family has been praying for her to be the third survivor. Her mother Traci has had t-shirts made for family and friends with a large, bold number '3' beneath the word's 'Kali's Krew.' 'This is Kali's Krew. Number three stands for the third person who will survive this amoeba disease. My daughter Kali,' she told KLRT-TV. 'We are just going to take baby steps, but other than that, she's doing remarkable. She's a little miracle.' The condition is caused when the Naegleria parasite enters a patient's brain, usually after accidentally inhaling stagnant, warm water up the nose while swimming. Arkansas Department of Health spokesman Ed Barham told MailOnline the water must be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide. Naegleria are be found in nearly every freshwater body of water - even lakes. But, they only become active when water heats up. The cruel irony of the parasite is that the risk is highest when the temperature is hottest - and swimmers are looking for a reprieve from the heat. Kali's mother says her condition at Arkansas Children's Hospital is improving and the family remains hopeful she will recover - despite the astronomically slim odds . Closed: The owners of Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas, have shut down the lake after learning of two reported cases of the deadly disease in three years . Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots of their noses. The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years. Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by: . The CDC says there have been 128 cases of the disease in the U.S. in the last five decades - making the disease extremely rare, when compared to the number of lakes and muddy swimming holes Americans dip into for refuge from the summer heat each year. The amoebas are most active when the water temperature reaches about 85 degrees, Barham said. However, this is the second time the parasite has infected a swimmer at Willow Springs Water Park. In August 2010, 7-year-old Davian Briggs died after contracting the disease after he had been swimming at the lake. Because two cases have been seen from the same body was water, state health officials asked the park owners to close their swimming hole. They obliged. 'Though the odds of contracting Naegleria are extremely low, they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to swim,' owners David and Lou Ann Ratliff said in a statement. The park, which attracts up to 250 swimmers a day - and thousands over the course of a summer - is now looking into installing a hard pool bottom at the swimming hole and filling it with chlorinated water supplied by Little Rock. Kali's mother Traci Harding said she had no idea about the risks of swimming in warm lakes and had never heard of the disease. 'You're a mom, you're a dad. You can still take your child swimming. We don't want to scare people. We just want you to know there are little things you can do to help them out. So they can go and still be a kid,' she said. She encourages parents to make their children wear nose plugs while swimming - to minimize the risk of inhaling water through the nose and contracting the Naegleria parasite. Still, Barham, of the health department, says that swimmers really shouldn't be too concerned about the . The U.S. has recorded just 128 cases of Naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years . Another tragedy: Davian Briggs, 7, died of the disease in 2010 after swimming at the Willow Springs Water Park - where little Kali is believed to have been infected .","Kali Hardig, 12, contracted primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after swimming at Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas .

The warrant reveals new details about Derek Medina’s confession to the killing of Jennifer Alfonso, 26, on August 8 including that detectives took two Samsung cellphones, three Dell computers and an iPad from the couple’s South Miami home after the shooting. The warrant asks for permission to look for evidence including electronics, and suggests that the Facebook confession and photo will be key evidence for prosecutors as they prepare for a likely grand-jury indictment. Derek Medina, who is charged with murder in the death of his wife Jennifer Alfonso, told detectives that he shot her 'six to eight times' The document also shows that police seized a stun gun, a.380-caliber pistol and two other pistols and ammunition and a large knife from the kitchen, reports The Miami Herald. Police say Medina killed 26-year-old Jennifer Alfonso during an argument. Her 10-year-old daughter from a previous relationship was not injured. Medina told police Alfonso threatened him with a knife. He is charged with first-degree murder. His arraignment is set for Aug. 29. Medina appeared in court last Friday where he sat . silently, wearing a red jumpsuit and shackles around his wrists and . ankles, while a judge approved a request for the preservation of . evidence. Gruesome: Derek Medina was arrested after admitting to killing his wife on Facebook and posting a grisly photo of her body lying on the kitchen floor . The request will allow Medina's lawyers to photograph markings such as cuts and bruises on Alfonso's body. It is presumed Medina will claim the killing was in self-defense. Three South Florida attorneys are now . representing him, they took over from the . Public Defender's Office, which initially represented Medina. Medina . is facing charges of first-degree murder after he posted a message on . his personal Facebook account on August 8, allegedly admitting to . the murder of his wife. 'Im . going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys . miss you guys take care Facebook people you will see me in the news,' he . wrote. 'My wife was punching me and I am not going to stand anymore with the abuse so I did what I did I hope u understand me.'

He later told police that he shot Ms Alfonso several times after she picked up a kitchen knife, and punched and kicked him. Domestic abuse: There is speculation Medina's legal team will claim the killing was in self-defense . In . his affidavit, Medina said he had pointed a gun at his wife as they . argued in their bedroom. Later he confronted his wife in their kitchen and she said she was . leaving him, according to CBS News. The . affidavit claims Alfonso started to hit him so he went back upstairs . for the gun, as his wife reached for a kitchen knife. He told police he disarmed his wife but when she started to punch him again he shot her several times. Medina's father, Derek, to whom he confessed to shortly after the shooting, told the Miami Herald: 'They are making my son out to be a . monster and it was the other way around. She pushed him to the point of insanity.' The victim's family however, described Medina as controlling, claiming that he pressured her to leave her job.

Charged: Jailene Diaz-Ramos, 19, was carrying the Smith & Wesson revolver in her car when she crash in June . Police have found the handgun used in a 2012 double murder that has been linked to NFL star Aaron Hernandez, it was revealed today. The .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver was found in a black case in the trunk of a 19-year-old woman's car after she crashed near Springfield, Massachusetts, in June. The Massachusetts State Police sent the weapon in for ballistics testing and learned that it fired the rounds that killed Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, outside a Boston night club in July 2012. WSHM-TV reports that the woman, Jailene Diaz-Ramos, from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, said the gun belonged to a friend she would only name as 'Chicago.' She said she was giving her friends - who were football players - a ride to work and that they must have left it in her car. Police began investigating Hernandez's involvement in that case after he was arrested in June and charged with the murder of 27-year-old semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd. Investigators are still frantically searching for the .45-caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol used in that murder. Hernandez, 23, was a star tight end for the New England Patriots before the team dropped him when he was charged with murder. Last year, he signed a four-year, $40million contract with the Patriots. Hernendez, 23, is currently in jail awaiting trial on charges he murdered Odin Lloyd, a semi-pro football player, in June. He has not been charged in connection with the 2012 slaying . Unsolved: Police are reportedly investigating Hernandez's connection to the 2012 murder of two immigrants from Cape Verde after an altercation outside a Boston nightclub . The 2012 slayings of Correia de Abreu and Furtado, both immigrants from Cape Verde, occurred outside a Boston night club after Hernandez and his entourage had an altercation with the men, WSHM reports. An SUV with Rhode Island license plates was seen driving past the victims' BMW. Someone inside the SUV fired multiple rounds into the car and then sped off. Police later recovered that SUV at Hernandez's uncle's house in Bristol. It was registered to Hernandez, according to WSHM. Hernandez has not been charged in those killings, though prosecutors have convened a grand jury to investigate whether there exists enough evidence to file charges in the case. An SUV linked to the 2012 murders was found at Hernandez's uncle's house in Bristol, Connecticut. It was registered to Hernandez . The gun found is a .38-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver, similar to this one . The former NFL star is currently in jail facing charges that he murdered Odin Lloyd, a 27-year-old semi-pro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty and has hired two high-powered criminal defense lawyers to defend the case. The gun was found on June 21 after Diaz-Ramos was involved in a crash on the interstate outside Springfield. She was taken to the hospital and treated for mild injuries. When state police inventories her wrecked car, they found the handgun in the truck in a case with three rounds of ammunition. Police also found a locked safe, though they are still awaiting a search warrant to open it. Diaz-Ramos was arrested and charged with weapons possession.

President Obama has replaced Republican Mitt Romney as the most popular target for comedians, a study has revealed. Researchers who studied jokes made by late-night comedians during the first half of the year found far more gags were aimed at Obama and the Democrats than in the previous year. Obama was the target of 288 gags made by Jay Leno, David Letterman, Jimmy Fallon, Craig Ferguson and Jimmy Kimmel, according to an analysis by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University. Scroll down for video . Target: Late-night comics are making far more jokes about Obama and the Democrats than they are about Republicans. Obama, pictured with Jay Leno last year, will make another appearance on the Tonight show this week . The second most joked-about individual was New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner, at 120. But as the study was conducted before Weiner's second sexting scandal had come to light, the number of jokes aimed at him is expected to have jumped dramatically in recent weeks. In 2012, Mitt Romney was the butt of more than twice as many jokes as Obama, and Republicans were similarly the target of more than double the jokes that were made on Democrats. But between January and June 2013, Democrats were the target of 713 jokes, compared to 417 gags about Republicans, the study said. The only Republicans among the top 10 joke targets were former President George W Bush and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. Change: Even David Letterman, who has traditionally targeted the Republicans, made 102 jokes about Democrats in the first half of 2012 . Gags: Jimmy Fallon was the toughest comic on Democrats, targeting them 240 times compared to 76 for Republicans . But Robert Lichter, the CMPA's president, said the findings 'don't illustrate any political change of heart among late-night comics.' He added: 'The jokes follow the news, and with Republicans receding after an election campaign, Obama presented more opportunities. 'They're going after the most visible and powerful people that they can.' Even Letterman, who is generally harder on Republicans, couldn't resist joining in with jokes aimed at the Democrats. Referring to the recent revelations that government authorities had been listening to calls made by civilians, he said: 'People always say to me, they say, ""Hey, Letterman,"" they say. ""Why don't you make jokes about Obama?"" And I say, ""All right, I'll tell you why. I don't make jokes about him because I don't want the FBI tapping my phone.""'

An Ohio man is lucky to be alive after blowing his arm off with high-powered, homemade fireworks he bought from a neighbor just a few days before the Fourth of July holiday. Kevin Skubic, 34, says that on July 1, he paid 65-year-old Wayne Jones  $200 for 50 homemade 'quarter sticks.' The homemade explosives are nearly three times as powerful as M-80s, a popular explosive that can be found in most fireworks stores. Skubic says he's bought similar fireworks from Jones in the past and nothing went wrong. But when he purchased the quarter sticks this year, his life was changed forever. Lucky: Kevin Skubic lost his left arm when homemade fireworks he purchased accidentally detonated. He says he's lucky to be alive . When Skubic was leaving Jones' house, he noticed that the bag holding the explosives was on fire as he approached his pickup truck parked in front of the man's house. 'When I threw the bag, it just blew up right in my face,' he told NewsNet5, the ABC affiliate in his hometown of Akron. 'I looked down and my arm was hanging off. I didn't want to go into shock. I just started praying right away.' Skubic suffered severe injuries from the blast, including flash burns, hearing damage and a detached retina -- in addition to his severed arm and finger. The father of two girls says he was convinced he was going to die. Ouch: In addition to losing his arm, surgeons had to do skin grafts to replace skin lost during the blast with skin from Skubic's legs . 'I'm glad to be here with my family, not have my mom and dad go through burying one of their kid,' he says. After the explosion, Skubic was taken to Akron General Medical Center, where he underwent skin grafts where surgeons used skin from his legs to replace skin on his right arm that was lost in the blast. 'I . don't even know how I made it through. I look at the video of my truck . and the impact it took, and then my body, they're still pulling . cardboard out of me everyday,' he says. Boom: In addition to the injuries to his arms, Skubic suffered hearing damage and a detached retina . Powerful: The explosives that injured Skubic are three times more powerful than M-80s -- as his truck found out the hard way . Jones has been charged with manufacturing explosives, unlawful possession of dangerous ordinance, illegal assembly of chemicals/explosives and possession of criminal tools. However, he claims he didn't assemble the explosives and had simply been storing them for Skubic. 'I think they're blaming me for what happened to him,' Jones told reporters after he was released from jail. 'He's a grown man -- I didn't have anything to do with it.' Skubic, however, says the fireworks were assembled by Jones, and that he's been buying them from him for years. Dealer: Skubic says he bought the explosives from Wayne Jones (pictured), from whom he's purchased explosives for years . 'I . never made a firework and I don't know how,' he says. 'I just went over there to . buy them like every year... In my head, I think they hoped I would have . died.' Jones is scheduled to appear in court on July 19. Skubic, meanwhile, has some advice for fireworks enthusiasts. 'Don't play with fireworks no matter what age you are. It's better to go watch and see them from a distance,' he says.","The homemade explosives are reportedly three times more powerful than M-80s .

One of the most glaring errors in Jurassic Park - if you move past the minor technicality that various species of dinosaurs were brought back from extinction - is that the mosquito caught inside the famous amber sample is a fraud. In the film, blood contained in the gut of the mosquito is extracted by Richard Attenborough's character John Hammond and spliced with frog DNA to kick off the dinosaur cloning process. However, entomologists have now claimed that the particular mosquito used in the film is the only species that doesn't suck blood at all - making the extraction of the dino DNA impossible. In the film Jurassic Park, blood is extracted from a prehistoric mosquito encased in a preserved piece of amber by Richard Attenborough, pictured. This one action sets up the entire film, but experts have now claimed this to be impossible - mainly because the mosquito used is the only species that doesn't suck blood at all . Toxorhynchites are also known as 'elephant mosquitos. They the largest known species of mosquito. They also make up the only species that do not suck blood. Instead, adult T. rutiluss feed from honeydew, sap, nectar and fruit. Most species live in forests. Retired entomologist Joe Conlon told Business Insider that mosquitoes were around during the time of the dinosaurs, dating back 170 million years, and would have ultimately fed on their blood. Yet, not the one Steven Spielberg used in the 1993 film. Conlon said: 'Unfortunately, the species portrayed in Jurassic Park - Toxorhynchites rutilus - doesn't feed on blood. It's actually the only type of mosquito that doesn't.' The mosquito in the film is also shown with a hairy antennae, suggesting it is a male T. rutilus. This further boosts Conlon's claims. Only females of blood-sucking mosquito species sucks blood. Thirdly, the movie shows the mosquito being found in the Dominican Republic, yet that region has never produced fossils dating back that far. Spielberg is believed to have chosen the T. rutilus because it is the largest species of mosquito known to man - so big it has been dubbed 'elephant mosquito' - and this would have made it easier to film. This doesn't mean the concept of a real-life Jurassic Park should be completely disregarded, though. Scientists spliced the blood extracted from the mosquito with frog DNA to clone the dinosaurs seen in all three Jurassic Park films. Lead character Dr Alan Grant, played by Sam Neil, is pictured in a scene from Jurassic Park III (2001) Last year, perfectly preserved cells from a woolly mammoth were found in Siberia, bringing closer the prospect of a cloned comeback for the iconic tusked creature. An international team of researchers discovered the unique material in a permafrost mammoth graveyard in remote Yakutia, in the east of Russia. The find included ''soft, fatty tissue, hair, bone marrow of the mammoth', said the Semyon Grigoryev, Director of the Mammoth Museum at the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk, who led the expedition. The sample is now on display in Tokyo, and scientists are looking at ways in which they could bring the animal back from extinction.","Expert claims the mosquito preserved in amber is a Toxorhynchites rutilus .

Charged: Alan Stout, left, and his brother Gregory, face charges of vulnerable adult abuse causing death . Officers said when they opened the van they found Mrs Stout's body crammed in next to crates of animals. Every time they moved a crate, a swarm of cockroaches would scuttle away. The family had allegedly planned to release the cats into a Phoenix neighborhood, when they discovered Mrs Stout was dead. Temperatures in Phoenix reached 110F on Sunday, and the van had no air conditioning. Husband: Alva Stout, 79, was sat in the back of the van, near his wife's body . Mrs Stout's family gave differing accounts as to when the woman, who suffered from strokes, high blood pressure and schizophrenia, may have died when police were called on Sunday afternoon, according to AZ Central. According to court documents, Alan Stout, 42, said his mother had collapsed when they were loading the van in Quartzsite in the morning. He claimed she was put in the rear passenger compartment of the vehicle and driven to Phoenix, which is about 130 miles away. His brother, Gregory, 44, backed up that claim, but told police they stopped at a gas station in Quartzsite for a drink and then continued to Phoenix, according to CBS 5.

When emergency services were called to reports of a sick woman, they found Mrs Stout alongside the crates of animals, who were allegedly in an appalling condition. Twelve dogs, 22 cats and a pigeon were found in 13 piled up crates, that were covered in webs, feces and cockroaches. The animals were said to be dehydrated, malnourished and covered in bugs. Many were in such a bad condition that they had to be put down, officials from Arizona Humane Society said. Each crate was filed with several animals. Bretta Nelson, from the humane . society, said hoarding in homes was common the van case was one of the . worst they had seen in a while. 'What . made this so different was the fact that it was a van filled with . dozens and dozens of animals, people, feces, debris, cockroaches, . spiders, just something we haven't seen to that scope in a very very . long time,' Ms Nelson told Fox 10. She added: 'Every time they would move a crate or kennel there was a swarm of cockroaches.' Appalling conditions: Officers found 13 dogs, 22 cats and a pigeon crammed into the van . Infested: The animals had matted fur, and swarms of cockroaches were scuttling under their crates . Many of the animals had ring worm and bug-infested fur. All 22 cats and three dogs had to be put down and a spokesman for the Arizona Humane Society said it was unlikely the remaining animals would survive. Ms Nelson said: 'The cats were very emaciated, very dirty ... hard to know when they had their last sip of water. They were panting, they were in heat stress, matted, emaciated.'

'This was not really a case about bullying as was portrayed in the media,' Ballantyne said according to My San Antionio. 'This was really a case about child abuse.' Ambrose's lawyer, Dayna Jones had tried to argue that very few of the students recalled the event and that 'it was a misunderstanding.' However, during the trial the court heard how Neely was brought to Ambrose after he had been seen to hit a student. Put in front of the classroom, Ambrose encouraged her students to hit Neely which only ended when the seventh student hit Neely so hard that he began to cry. He is allowing her to serve the jail sentence on work release or to report to the Bexar County Jail on weekends. The former teacher was convicted of official oppression in June and had previously faced up to a year in jail.

The May 2012 incident occurred when the boy was brought to Ambrose by his teacher, Barbara Ramirez, after he hit another student. The boy, Aiden Neely, now seven, told the jury this week he remembers getting hit by students and later telling his brothers, but they didn't believe him. 'It started out as a pat,' Ramirez said. 'Then she told the class, 'Come on, hit him harder.' Ramirez was granted immunity in exchange for her testimony. She said she reported the incident to the school principal two weeks later.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is spear-heading an ambitious new effort to extend Internet access across the developing world by lowering the cost of getting online. The new project, called Internet.org, launched early Wednesday morning. It is a collaboration of some of the largest technology companies in the world, including handset makers Nokia and Samsung, telecom giant Ericsson, and chip designer Qualcomm. The project's goals are lofty - helping to make the Internet affordable for five billion people people in developing nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. But, the methods are decidedly not flashy. Scroll down for video . Leader: Mark Zuckerberg is behind a major push by several tech companies to expand internet access to 5billion people in the developing world . The 29-year-old billionaire took to his own Facebook page to promote the project by asking 'Is connectivity a human right?' Unlike Google's Project Loon - which aims to extend internet access in remote areas across the developing world by sending large balloons into the sky - Internet.org seeks to improve efficiency through better programming. Facebook is trying to streamline its mobile app so that it consumes less internet bandwidth and is therefore cheaper to run for users paying by the megabyte. Cellphone makers are trying to design handsets that have longer battery lives and draw internet bandwidth more efficiently. In five to 10 years, Internet.org hopes to reduce the cost of providing mobile internet by 99percent. 'The goal of Internet.org is to make Internet access available to the two-thirds of the world who are not yet connected and to bring the same opportunities to everyone that the connected third of the world has today,' Zuckerberg said. Inspiring words: The project used the words from President John F. Kennedy's 1963 speech on peace in a nuclear world in a video introducing the idea . The project focuses largely on mobile phone connectivity because billions of people in developing countries already use cell phones for talk and text. Smart phones are also more affordable than personal computers and they are often more practical in regions with spotty electricity. Internet.org went live early Wednesday with a slickly-produced site . promoting the project. It features a moving, highly-polished that sets . the words of President John F. Kennedy's 1963 American University speech . on world peace to images of peoples in developing nations across the . world. 'Today, Internet isn't accessible for two thirds of the world. Imagine a world where it connects us all,' the video intones. High hopes: Internet.org plans to leverage efficiency upgrades in mobile Internet technology to make smart phones and Internet access more affordable for billions . The 29-year-old billionaire is increasingly becoming a forceful public figure in public policy. He has previously spoken out about the importance of reforming the U.S. immigration system to make it easier to bring in skilled workers. As with the immigration debate, Internet.org isn't entirely an egalitarian effort. Facebook and the other partners in the project have already reached near-market saturation in the United States, Canada, Europe and other parts of the developed world. Extending Internet access to the developed world is one way for Facebook to grows its base of 1.15billion users.","Internet.org is a collaboration of Facebook, Nokia, Samsung, Ericsson, Qualcomm and other tech companies .

Unleashing kung-fu skills to rival Bruce Lee, one of the creatures rears its head and wings and launches a perfect kick at the other from mid air. Ha-so! The adolescent Eurasian crane aims a well-timed kick at his opponent . You squawkin' to me? Keepers at the Great Crane Project said the cranes were only showing off in front of each other . Keepers say the two youngsters were just showing off in front of each other at the Great Crane Project at Crane School in Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT) Slimbridge, Gloucestershire. They will be released next month onto the Somerset Moors and Levels. The animals are taught how to forage and avoid danger by human carers, who wear disguises to prevent the cranes from becoming tame. WWT aviculturist Amy King said: 'We are surrogate parents to the birds and try to teach them all they need to survive, but some things they just pick up on their own. 'Here the young cranes are sparring, as many young animals do. It looks dramatic but for now it is just practice. 'Once in the wild, they'll use these skills to determine their place in the pecking order and, if they need, to battle potential predators.'

'They'll soon learn the ropes with the help of the more street wise older birds and with the support of our local farmers there's plenty of wild food for them to get stuck into.' Cranes were once a widespread and culturally significant part of British wildlife and many villages - such as Cranford in Middlesex or Cranmore in Somerset - take their names from the birds. But by 400 years ago, they had gone extinct as a breeding bird because of the drainage of wetlands and over hunting. The Great Crane Project is a partnership between the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, RSPB and Pensthorpe Conservation Trust. It has major funding from Viridor Credits Environmental Company, which is reintroducing birds to the Somerset Moors and Levels.","Eurasian cranes raised from the egg as part of Great Crane Project in Gloucestershire .

Dan Anderson, who teaches at a high school in Queensbury, New York, decided the confusion surrounding Oreo fillings would be the perfect case study to engage his students in using maths in real life. Anderson, 32, brought one package each of regular Oreos, Double Stuf and Mega Stuf to class. A maths teacher and his students have confirmed what many cookie lovers have long suspected ¿ there simply isn't as much creme filling in Double Stuf as the manufacturers claim . The students weighed ten Mega Stuf Oreos, left, and ten Double Stuf Oreos, right . He then split his students into different groups, with some measuring the cookies' height and some their weight. ‘We weighed 10 of each - Double Stuf, Mega Stuf and regular,’ he told ABCNews.com. ‘And we weighed five wafers alone to deduct from the total.’ Using mathematical equations to determine the creme content of the cookies, Anderson's students found that the bigger Oreos didn’t include as much filling as their packaging suggested. The Double Stuf Oreos were only 1.86 times the size of regular Oreos, rather than double as the name suggests.

Anderson said his students were surprised by their findings, which he has documented on his A Recursive Process blog. MailOnline reached out to Nabisco, which makes Oreos, for comment about the apparent lack of filling in its cookies.

Millions of British holidaymakers book trips to sun-drenched foreign destinations but have no idea where they are on the map. A study of 2,000 people who travelled abroad last year showed 53 per cent of those who went to Cyprus had no idea where it actually was, confusing it with mainland Greece. Just under half of people who booked a sunny break in Turkey were similarly flummoxed when asked to identify it on the map, with many placing pointing to Ukraine is, despite there being more than 1,200 miles between them. Ancient: It may be steeped in history, but 29 per cent of those who visited Greece confused it on a map with France. Left, the Acropolis in Athens. Right, the Eiffel Tower . And more than one in ten of those who went to France confused it with Belgium when they tried to point it out. A . similar number of people who had managed to escape to the sunny climes . of Italy could not identify it, with some mistaking it for Belarus. It also emerged one in five would be hard pushed to name the capital city of the country they visited, while 27 per cent would not be able to name any of the neighbouring nations. The research was conducted by British Airways Holidays. Spokeswoman Claire Bentley said: 'This research shows people are going to all the effort of booking themselves a lovely holiday abroad, and yet so many have absolutely no idea of where they are actually going. It is surprising to think that people are prepared to spend their hard earned wages on a holiday, without researching something as important as its location. 'We know that cost and temperature is often the most important factor for adults wanting to book a holiday, but 23 per cent of our respondents admitted they would never think to look at where it is on the map before booking.' Nearly a quarter of those who travelled to Spain last year confused it with France on a map. The precise location of Portugal left Brits equally baffled with 31 per cent also pointing out France. The Netherlands caused concern for 36 per cent of people who confused it with Denmark. When people were asked where France was, 22 per cent thought it was Germany while 29 per cent thought it was Greece. Even Ireland leaves Brits bewildered. An incredible 24 per cent who visited their neighbouring country last year were unable to say where it was in Europe, believing they were in Spain instead.

When booking a holiday, the temperature . of the country turned out to be the most important factor for 65 per . cent of people, closely followed by local attractions (61 per cent). Accommodation proved important for 52 per cent of people, while a further 48 per cent were attracted to a hotel's facilities. Currency was a concern for 47 per cent of people, while 24 per cent wanted a decent swimming pool, 34 per cent wanted easy access to a beach, and 10 per cent wanted a decent pub.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 14:45 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:43 EST, 20 August 2013 . Evening newscasts on ABC and CBS are both gaining ground on market leader Brian Williams of NBC News, but that's one of the few things they have in common. Behind Diane Sawyer, second-place ABC is making strides with a sleek ""World News"" that emphasizes the American family, news that hits home and the cultural zeitgeist. Scott Pelley has revealed himself to be a traditionalist at 'CBS Evening News,' leading a show weighty with significant national and international events. NBC's 'Nightly News' remains in first place, where it has generally been since the late 1990s except for a brief run by Charles Gibson at ABC. The Nielsen company said NBC's viewership is down from last year while ABC and CBS are up, with ABC in July winning a week among the key 25-to-54-year-old demographic for the first time since 2008. The ratings leader: Brian Williams has anchored the NBC 'Nightly News' to ratings prominence since the late 1990s . Despite decades-long prophecies of doom, network evening newscasts remain a vital part of television's landscape, collectively reaching more than 22 million people each weeknight. Often, Williams' newscast is more popular than NBC's prime-time programming. Now there's a creative push to distinguish broadcasts that once seemed interchangeable. 'We recognize the environment has changed very significantly,' said James Goldston, ABC's senior vice president of news. 'The days when an evening newscast can act as a digest of the day's news are gone.' What's happening in the evening is similar to the morning, in terms of content. ABC's 'Good Morning America' has swept past NBC's 'Today' with a breezy show on the tip of pop culture and hosts that ooze chemistry. CBS remains in third, but has gained ground since it stopped trying to imitate its rivals. The most visible recent sign of the different approaches came not in the evening but a few hours before. On July 22, when Britain's Prince William and Kate Middleton became parents for the first time, ABC cut away from regular afternoon programming for more than an hour to talk about the birth, coverage that featured Barbara Walters. CBS didn't bother with a special report, a judgment that stood out more because NBC did the same as ABC. Pelley reported the story on the evening news. The traditionalist: Scott Pelley, anchor of 'CBS Evening News,' tends to focus on more hard-hitting stories . CBS News President David Rhodes quipped that 'it wasn't the Second Coming.' 'We tried to not completely lose our minds covering it,' Rhodes said. 'I don't think we were making a statement. I think the others were making a statement about themselves by doing it.' Goldston is fine with that. ABC has stayed on the story, airing a 'World News' report last Wednesday featuring Prince William talking about the experience of being a new dad. 'Millions and millions of people in America were interested in the birth of the royal baby,' he said. 'It's news. We just report the news.' Day-to-day, the differences are more muted. In 13 of 23 weekdays in July, the two evening newscasts led with the same story, according to news consultant Andrew Tyndall. On some of the days they diverged, ABC picked stories with more populist appeal. One day, ABC led with weather and forest fires, while CBS started with Egyptian politics. ABC led another day when the women kept imprisoned in a Cleveland home released a video message; CBS had a follow-up report on the San Francisco plane crash. On July 24, CBS began its broadcast with economic news, while ABC opened by reporting the name of William and Kate's baby. Getting beyond the day's obvious headlines is where different priorities emerge. ABC frequently airs detailed reports by Paula Faris that give concrete advice on how families can find savings; she recently talked about trimming fees included in home sales and costs related to sending someone off to college. The 'Real Money' series is less 'news' than practical advice. Sawyer's daily 'Instant Index' has voiceovers on stories like a study on successful marriages and soda companies defending the use of sugar substitutes. She's shown YouTube-worthy clips of a panda bear mom welcoming back her baby and a confused grandmother throwing her drink at a bride instead of confetti. Family oriented: ABC World News anchor Diane Sawyer focuses on stories with populist appeal . 'At the end of the broadcast, people not only feel empowered, smarter and enlightened, they know some of the things going on in the world that are interesting, that people are talking about,' said Michael Corn, 'World News' executive producer. At CBS, 'we like to have news all the way through the broadcast,' said Patricia Shevlin, executive producer. That doesn't mean all protein and no garnish: the panda clip ran on CBS, too. Yet while ABC played up a tearful Jennifer Garner and Halle Berry testifying in favor of a California law restricting paparazzi, CBS ignored the celebrities. Tyndall's content analysis also illustrates priorities. For instance, ABC spent twice as much time as CBS on winter weather stories and liked tales of lottery winners. CBS has given roughly four times the airtime to stories on gun control than ABC, with more than twice the coverage of Syria. CBS spent 47 minutes on federal budget squabbles and the sequester to ABC's 18 minutes. 'I don't think people watch CBS News because of cooking and concerts and royal updates,' Rhodes said. 'They do watch us for Washington news, international coverage, health and science.' CBS' viewership is up 7 percent this year to 6.4 million people per episode, Nielsen said. CBS is down 2 percent, however, among that 25-to-54-year-old demographic. That indicates 'CBS Evening News' is winning back many traditional viewers – the people who once watched Walter Cronkite, not just read about him – more than gaining new ones. ABC's audience is up 3 percent to 7.6 million, while NBC is down 2 percent to 8.4 million. Goldston said ABC works under the assumption that most viewers know the headlines when they tune in and are looking for something new. ABC emphasizes its own exclusives, leading 'World News' last month when Robin Roberts interviewed a juror in the George Zimmerman trial and last week shuffling the broadcast at the last minute for a Brian Ross report on drone strikes in Yemen. Shevlin said CBS hopes vivid reporting can take viewers inside the news of the day – sometimes literally, as Pelley hits the road on big stories. 'We have more than 140 characters,' she said.","Newscasts have become much more creative and are targeting different audiences by focusing on different interests .

An African-American mother has launched a petition urging Mattel to produce party supplies featuring a black Barbie after failing to find products themed around her daughter's favorite doll.

Scroll down for video . Taking a stand: Karen Braithwaite (pictured with her daughter Georgia) has launched a petition for Mattel to offer more black Barbie party supplies . The petition has now amassed over 3,000 signatures. Georgia - whose fifth birthday is this week - told DNAinfo that she wanted a black . Barbie-themed party because the dolls 'look like princesses and fairies,' she explained. 'They look like me.' But when her mother set out to find party supplies, she found that the only line offered by Mattel included more than 35 products featuring images of the white doll. Meanwhile, the sole indication of diversity was a . brown-skinned Barbie and a brunette - 'possibly meant to be a HIspanic,' noted the mother - featured on a tablecloth . and a handful of hanging decorations. So Mrs Braithwaite launched the petition, along with an accompanying video and letter explaining her situation and requesting the signatures of others. She explains in the video: 'This is about more than just my daughter's . birthday party - it's about promoting diversity, inclusion and respect.' 'This is about more than my daughter's . birthday party - it's about promoting diversity, inclusion and respect' Mrs Braithwaite points out that . Mattel is far from racist; in fact, the toy company sells black, . Hispanic and Asian barbies and markets many of its products . to young girls of color. But . she notes that if a black girl wants to have a Barbie-themed birthday party, she has no choice but to use products adorned with the white doll. She asks in the clip: 'Is that really the message Mattel wants to send in . 2013?' Mrs Braithwaite explains that the lack of diversity is not only disturbing in the modern world, but it can also negatively affect the image black girls have of themselves. Lack of diversity: When the Harlem mother set out to find Barbie-themed supplies for her daughter's fifth birthday party, she found more than 35 products featuring images of the blonde, blue-eyed version of the doll . The petition website reads: 'Featuring the white Barbie so prominently on the party favors while relegating the ""ethnic"" Barbies to near-invisible cameos sends a clear - and troubling - message to young girls' On the website for her . petition she writes : 'Featuring the white Barbie so prominently on the banners, . cups, napkins, plates, party favors, and invitations, while relegating . the ""ethnic"" Barbies to near-invisible cameos sends a clear - and . troubling - message to young girls.' 'Featuring the white Barbie so prominently sends a clear - and troubling - message to young girls' The accompanying video illustrates the diversity of Barbie fans. It shows a sequence of young . girls from various ethnicities playing with the dolls and saying to the . camera: 'I am a Barbie girl.' At the end of the clip, a banner appears that reads: 'Beauty comes in all colors.' And it seems Mrs Braithwaite isn't the only parent who has experienced difficulty with the lack of diversity in Mattel's Barbie birthday party supplies. Some of the supporters of the petition have listed their reasons for signing it on the website. One such woman wrote: 'Every little girl should see herself and be proud.'

'They look like me' Another supporter said: 'As a parent of a child of color, it has always been important to our family to have toys that represent our child's image.' When she contacted Mattel, they apparently told her that it was up to product licensees to produce black Barbie party supplies. Still, she Mrs Braithwaite says she thinks that the company should play a more active role in ensuring there is a diverse selection of party supplies on offer for consumers.

We may be seeing more prominent gay and lesbian characters on TV shows, but the movie industry lags well behind the small screen, an advocacy group reports. Out of the 101 releases from Hollywood's six major studios in . 2012, just 14 included characters identified as lesbian, gay, or . bisexual, a report released today by the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation showed. In its first study of LGBT roles in major studio releases, GLAAD found that compared with TV, where there has been a significant shift over the past decade, 'Major studios appear reluctant to include LGBT characters in significant roles or franchises.' Skyfall was noted as a film of 2012 that included a bisexual character, played by Javier Bardem (right), alongside Daniel Craig (left), however the bisexual character was evil . Most of the 14 roles in 2012 were no more than cameos or minor roles, it said — and none of the films tracked had transgender characters. 'Until LGBT characters appear more regularly in these studio films, there will be the appearance of bias,' said Wilson Cruz, GLAAD's national spokesperson, in an interview. He added that his organization will be meeting with studio executives to discuss the findings. There were some bright spots in 2012, and some more ambiguous ones, the group said. For example, Skyfall, the hugely successful installment of the James Bond franchise, featured a main villain, played by Javier Bardem, who was apparently bisexual. 'It was great to see an LGBT character in such a significant role,' said Matt Kane, associate director of entertainment media at GLAAD, also in an interview. ' 'But unfortunately the character was also devious, psychotic, and untrustworthy — it fell into that trap.' This character, Mitch, from the 2012 film ParaNorman, released by Focus Features, was revealed at the end of the movie to be gay . As genre films like comic book . adaptations consume much of the studios' capital and promotional . efforts, the report says, such films have a striking lack of LGBT . characters. In The Avengers, it notes, there is a gay news anchor, but his appearance is 'so brief it was likely missed by many viewers.' The report — called the 2013 Studio Responsibility Index — rates each of the six studio according to the number of LGBT-inclusive films they released. Faring worst: 20th Century Fox and Disney, which each receive 'failing' grades; the other four — Paramount, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros. — receive grades of 'adequate'. Asked in advance Tuesday afternoon about the report, the studios had no immediate comment. As part of its index, the group developed criteria to measure the quality of the LGBT roles. The percentage of characters played by gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and male and females in Hollywood releases from 2012 . They included: whether a character . was identifiably LGBT; whether it was not solely or predominantly . defined by its sexual orientation or gender identity; and whether it was . tied into the plot in such a way that its removal would have a . significant effect. One . of the best examples of an LGBT-inclusive film in 2012, according to . GLAAD, was, interestingly, an animated family film: ParaNorman, about a . misunderstood boy who can communicate with the ghosts of dead people. In the film, which came from the Portland-based studio LAIKA, Norman's cheerleader sister asks the hunky football hero Mitch for a movie date. He casually makes a reference to his boyfriend. The film's writer and co-director, Chris Butler, said the filmmakers, while determined to include the scene, had worried that it could cost them a PG rating and get them a PG-13 instead, which would have been inappropriate for the movie. In the end, they got their PG rating. Butler said he was disappointed with some negative commentary about the scene — including one viewer's online review that praised the film for its anti-bullying message of inclusion — but said it ruined matters by making a character gay. 'I was surprised at all the fuss,' Butler said. 'But on the flip side was the positive reaction.' The movie was the first animated film nominated for a GLAAD award. As a filmmaker, Butler said he was not optimistic that there would be an inevitable wave of more onscreen LGBT characters as time goes on and society changes, as on TV. 'It's a mistake to assume it's inevitable,' he said. 'The only way to make change is to do something about it. It takes hard work.' 'We are moving in the right direction,' Butler said. 'But not nearly quick enough. It's not enough.' Kane, at GLAAD, said the new report would help reinforce its longtime claims that Hollywood studios need to do more. 'Over the years we have met with studios, and it's always a point we make,' Kane said. 'Now, we have the numbers to take to them.'","Out of 101 releases of Hollywood's six major studios, just 14 included LGBT characters in 2012 .

A coroner's report reveals that journalist Michael Hastings had drugs in his system at the time of his fatal car crash in June. Hastings, who had reportedly been sober for over a decade before relapsing shortly before his death, had traces of amphetamine and marijuana in his blood when he died. The Los Angeles County coroner's report said that the drugs were not the cause of the fiery crash or his death, as that came due to the massive blunt force trauma that ensued. Clues: Michael Hastings had traces of amphetamine and marijuana in his blood when he died in a car crash . The Los Angeles Times also reports that his family were on their way from New York to California on the day of the crash because they wanted to have an intervention due to his relapse. The results of the toxicology report do not appear to be a surprise to Hasting's relatives, as the coroner added that 'his family was attempting to get (Hastings) to go to detox'. Relatives told the city officials that after 14-years of sobriety, the 33-year-old reporter that he began using drugs in the month leading up to his June 18 accident. A post that he wrote on his blog in 2009 confirms that timeline: 'I stopped using when I was nineteen. Good for me.' His relatives were not the only ones who knew that Hastings had begun using drugs again. Inferno: Skeptics came up with conspiracy theories about his death but the Los Angeles Coroner ruled that he died of a blunt force trauma, and died almost immediately after impact in the June 18 crash . Beyond Recognition: Authorities had to use a set of fingerprints on file with the FBI to identify his body . Police found a medical marijuana card in his wallet at the scene of the crash. Hastings, who made his name covering the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and effectively forcing the firing of former General Stanley McCrystal, was apparently given a prescription for marijuana to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. In addition to covering warzones, he also lost his fiancee when she was killed in Baghdad, and he wrote a book about the experience. A number of conspiracy theories surfaced about his death immediately following the early morning June 18 accident as he was revealed to be working on a story about the CIA. In the know: Relatives were reportedly headed to Los Angeles to have an intervention for Hastings as he had relapsed and started using drugs. His widow, Elise Jordan, says his death was likely just a tragic accident . Surveillance footage near the crash site showed that Hastings was driving the car and sped up before the Mercedes flipped into a palm tree. His body was so badly burned that he had to be identified using a set of his fingerprints that the FBI had on file. The agency issued a statement shortly after the fact saying that at no point was he under investigation. His wife, Elise Jordan, spoke out after his death saying that she did not suspect foul play was involved. 'The LAPD still has an active investigation...my gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and I'm very unlucky and the world is very unlucky,' she said at the time.","Relatives were on their way to Los Angeles to have an intervention for Hastings at the time of his death .

Compensation: Palestinian Nemah Shehadeh has been awarded £36,000 after a judge ruled she was unlawfully detained . A failed asylum seeker and convicted fraudster has been awarded £36,000 of taxpayers' money in compensation for being held in a detention centre. Nemah Shehadeh used public funding to launch her claim for damages over the 19 months she spent awaiting deportation, which she said was a breach of her human rights. The 58-year-old previously served a jail term for fraud after trying to use a false passport to leave Britain. Shehadeh lives in taxpayer-funded accommodation in Glasgow and comes from Palestine, but apparently does not hold citizenship of any state. She arrived in the UK in 2002, using what she said were valid documents issued by the government of Jordan. However, she stayed in the country after her visa expired, and in 2005 she was caught trying to leave Britain using a fake French passport. After being convicted of using a 'false instrument', she was sentenced to four months in prison and was due to be deported. Although she claimed asylum, her bid to stay in the UK failed, and in 2008 she was flown to Jordan. Authorities in the Middle Eastern country refused to let her in, so she was returned to the Dungavel detention centre in Lanarkshire for 19 months until granted bail. Shehadeh claimed that the detention was 'unlawful' and breached her human rights - and now a judge ruled in her favour, awarding her £36,000 of the £100,000 she demanded. Speaking at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Lord Tyre said that officials had 'grossly overestimated' the chances of the asylum seeker going on the run, and ruled that she should have been released as soon as it became clear that it would be difficult to deport her. In his judgement, he wrote: 'I have reached the view that during the months following receipt of the Jordanian Embassy's advice on 2 July 2008, a fair-minded assessment balancing the prospect of the petitioner's successful removal against the risk of her absconding ought to have led to the conclusion that the respondent would not be able to effect deportation within a period that was reasonable in all the circumstances. Ruling: Lord Tyre delivered his judgement at the Court of Sessions in Edinburgh, pictured . 'I accept that the respondent was entitled to take some time following receipt of the Jordanian advice to complete its review procedure and in particular to obtain official or perhaps ministerial authorisation of conditional release. 'I also bear in mind, however, that this case concerns an individual whose liberty had been restricted and I consider that it is reasonable to expect the matter to have been addressed with some expedition.

He was convicted of murdering eight people in the late 1970s . A man convicted of murdering eight people in Miami-Dade County in the late 1970s was executed Monday night at the Florida State Prison, despite his lawyers' pleas that he was too mentally ill to be put to death. John Errol Ferguson, 65, died at 6:17 p.m. following a lethal injection. The execution came less than two hours after the U.S. Supreme Court denied a final request for a stay. Before the execution, Ferguson made a brief statement before 25 witnesses, including family members of the victims. 'I just want everyone to know that I am the prince of God and will rise again,' he said calmly. At about three minutes into the procedure, he moved his head, strained his neck, moved his feet, put his head back down and closed his eyes. The entire execution took 16 minutes. About three dozen people protested across the street from the prison. Ferguson and two others were convicted of murdering six people in 1977 during a robbery at a Carol City house used by marijuana dealers. Ferguson dressed as a utility worker to gain access and let his accomplices inside. Most of the victims were friends who happened to drop by the house while Ferguson and the other men were there. The victims were blindfolded and bound, and the encounter turned violent after a mask fell off one of Ferguson's gang members and his face was spotted by a victim. Protesters to the death penalty talk as they wait for the execution of John Errol Ferguson, across the highway from the Florida State Correctional facility . The decision was made to kill all eight people in the house. Two survived. At the time, it was the worst mass slaying ever in Miami-Dade County. Ferguson also was convicted of the 1978 murder of a 17-year-old couple, Brian Glenfeldt and Belinda Worley, from Hialeah. They were shot as Ferguson, dressed as a police officer, tried to rob them while they were parked at a lovers' lane. Worley was raped. The randomness of the crime and the youth of the two victims stunned many in Miami. Ferguson confessed to killing 'the two kids' after he was arrested in April 1978 for the earlier killings, court records show. Worley's mother, Edna Worley, waited for decades for Ferguson's execution but died last year. Ferguson was sentenced to die in both cases; he unsuccessfully used the insanity defense in the trial over the teenagers' murders. Protesters against the death penalty await the execution of John Errol Ferguson in Florida . The issue of Ferguson's mental stability was a current that ran through his life, and his execution came after months of court appeals. Ferguson's lawyers said their client had a long history of mental illness. The attorneys appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, saying that Ferguson lacked 'rational understanding' that he will be executed and that killing him would 'cruel and unusual punishment,' violating the Eighth Amendment. Christopher Handman, Ferguson's lead attorney, said his client's mental illness manifested itself long before the slayings. Ferguson's alcoholic father died when Ferguson was 13, and that's when he started experiencing hallucinations, family members told the attorney. Ferguson also experienced abuse by his mother's boyfriends, then was abandoned by his mom and raised by his sisters in a vermin-infested shack in Miami-Dade County. When he was 21, he was shot in the head by a police officer in Miami. For several years in the 1970s, Ferguson was in a state mental hospital and was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia; he was twice found not guilty of crimes by reason of insanity. Handman said one doctor wrote that Ferguson should not be released because he was a danger to himself and to society. But he was released and, months later, committed the Carol City murders. Christopher Handman, an attorney for Ferguson, said Monday in a statement that he was disappointed in the Supreme Court's decision, denying his client a stay of execution. 'Mr. Ferguson is insane and incompetent for execution by any measure,' Handman said. 'He has a fixed delusion that he is the `Prince of God' who cannot be killed and will rise up after his execution to fight alongside Jesus and save America from a communist plot. He has no rational understanding of the reason for his execution or the effect the death penalty will have upon him.' Earlier in the day, Ferguson chose to eat the same food other prisoners were being served as his final meal: A meat and vegetable patty, white bread, stewed tomatoes, potato salad, carrots and iced tea.","John Errol Ferguson, 65, died at 6:17 p.m. following a lethal injection .

The weekend wedding between the billionaire chairman of cosmetics giant Estée Lauder and the glamorous CEO of the Brooklyn Public Library was dramatically called off at the last moment after the couple decided things were moving too fast. Leonard Lauder, the 80-year-old son of Estée Lauder, and his intended, Linda Johnson, 55, have enjoyed something a whirlwind romance since meeting last year. The couple had begun publicly dating in late 2012, just a year after Lauder had tragically lost his first wife Evelyn to ovarian cancer. They had been married for more than 50 years and had helped grow the family business together. Slowing things down: Estée Lauder heir Leonard Lauder and his Brooklyn Library boss girlfriend Linda Johnson have postponed their wedding but have gone on honeymoon anyway . Lauder and Johnson were pictured attending several New York society events together last year and spent last New Year's Eve at the Metropolitan Opera Gala. In May it was revealed that the couple were very happy and talking about marriage, news that caused much distress among aspiring socialites 'of a certain age'. Launder, the chairman emeritus of Estée Lauder Co., is worth an estimated $8 billion and had been described as ‘New York’s most eligible bachelor.’ The couple had been planning to wed in Philadelphia in front of an intimate group of family and friends over the weekend. Cancer campaigner: Leonard Lauder pictured with late wife Evelyn Lauder in 2009, who famously spearheaded the Breast Cancer Research Foundation's Pink Ribbon initiative . But the New York Post reports that the couple had started to called guests just a few weeks ago to tell them that their big day was being ‘postponed.’ Although no new date has been fixed, the pair are still very much an item and are currently enjoying a holiday in Sardinia, which had originally been scheduled to have been their honeymoon. ‘Some people assumed that Leonard and Linda had not reached an agreement on a prenup in time for the wedding, but in fact the prenup had already been signed a while ago,’ a source told the Post. ‘They have been having a few ups and downs, and perhaps he feels it is “too soon” after Evelyn.’ Leonard and Evelyn Lauder married in 1959 and had two sons together.

Navlet Anderson, 50, claimed her shoes got stuck under the pedals of her car before it crashed into a takeaway in Bristol . A mother who drove into a kebab shop injuring four people including a close friend has been jailed after trying to blame the crash on her flip flops. Navlet Anderson, 50, claimed her shoes got stuck under the pedals of her car before it crashed into Antalya kebab shop in Bristol. She drove her Vauxhall Corsa into Stephen Brothwood before crashing straight through the front windows of the shop and hitting another bystander on April 28. Despite Mr Brothwood being described as a 'dear friend' and neighbour, the mother-of-two reversed over him as she tried to escape. Anderson abandoned her car on top of her injured victim who suffered a punctured lung, fractured ribs and legs. Three other people were hurt and the shop suffered thousands of pounds of damage. She was cleared yesterday of causing grievous bodily harm with intent but found guilty of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. It is thought she is one of the first people to be found guilty of the new charge after legislation brought it into law last year. Judge Geoffrey Mercer QC jailed her for three years at Bristol Crown Court and told her it was a matter of 'pure fortune' no-one was killed. He said: 'I have not the slightest doubt you were driving in anger. Your anger may have been directed specifically at someone other than those who had the misfortune to be there and be struck by the car. 'But the reality is you drove in such a way in your anger that you had no regard as to who might be in you way. 'Four people were hurt, one seriously, Mr Brothwood, described as a friend, but he was seriously hurt and I have no doubt the injuries he sustained have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on his life. Emergency services at the scene where Navlet Anderson drove into a kebab shop injuring four people . 'It will be obvious to anybody that has heard the evidence that it is a matter of pure fortune that the injuries were not worse and that somebody was not killed.' Anderson was also disqualified from driving for five years and will need to pass an extended test. The court heard Anderson, from Redfield, Bristol, told police the sole of her right flip-flop jammed underneath the accelerator. She told officers: 'My flip-flop got caught. The accelerator pedal was between my toe and the base of my shoe. 'The flip-flop was underneath the accelerator pedal. It was a sandwich and I was not able to brake. Navlet Anderson claimed her shoes got stuck under the pedals of her car before it crashed . Despite describing Mr Anderson as a 'dear friend', the mother-of-two reversed over him as she tried to escape . 'The car went through the kebab shop window. I did not see anyone in front of me.' Anderson said she threw the right flip-flop out of the car window and reversed in shock. She then pulled the car forward and saw Mr Brothwood on the ground. She said: 'I wondered what he was doing there. I thought the glass fell on him. I know him very well. He is a neighbour, a dear friend.' Anderson recalled how she momentarily went to her home nearby 'in a daze' before police arrived and arrested her. Anderson said she threw the right flip-flop out of the car window and reversed in shock . Chester Beyts, defending Anderson, said: 'She has always been remorseful and apologetic for her actions once she realised the gravity of what had occurred.' Anderson was also handed a three month prison sentence to run alongside after she pleaded guilty to assault by beating. In a statement DC Simon Atyeo said: 'The victims are still coming to terms with what happened that day, and some are still dealing with the injuries they suffered during this incident, so we are pleased with today’s verdict and hope it will go some way towards helping them with their healing process, and assist them with their recovery.'","Navlet Anderson drove her Vauxhall Corsa into Stephen Brothwood before crashing into the shop and hitting another bystander .

"When strange bits of clothing started turning up on their doorstep Richard and Sophie Windsor were puzzled to say the least. Later, as towel sets, baby clothes and a German sausage found their way on to their kitchen floor, the confusion deepened. When they then spotted half a pizza wedged in the cat flap the penny finally dropped – their beloved pet moggy Norris had turned into a cat burglar. Norris has been known to steal from neighbours' homes and gardens in Bedminster, Bristol - much to the dismay of his owners . Eyes on the prize: Norris began by stealing food from neighbours' bins before moving onto clothing and homeware . The two-year-old tabby started bringing . home food about a year ago, before raiding local gardens, washing lines . and even venture into nearby houses in Bristol. He returns home to his embarassed owners, Richard and Sophie Windsor, every morning with a stockpile of pants, bras, dusters and food. The cat has amassed such a huge pile of knickers from these moonlit raids his owners have red-facedly delivered letters to residents admitting they may have of some of their property. Every morning Norris shows off his loot to his embarassed owners Sophie and Richard Windsor who have had to deliver letters to neighbours explaining his naughty habit . Richard, 26, a graphic designer, said: 'He was perfectly well behaved up until the age of one, then he started to turn to a life of petty crime. 'He first started bringing things in from the recycling bins when he was about one. At first it was just the odd thing - but over the last four months, he has really started to up his game. 'Initially it was dusters and dish cloths but this has now intensified to clothes, including bras, pants, T-shirts and jumpers. 'We have even had a pair of washing-up gloves - each brought in on a separate night. He goes out in the evening and then returns quite late on or in the early hours. 'He brings his stolen items in and then meows and meows to announce he is back so we will go and see what he has brought in. Sometimes he will go out multiple times during one night.' Norris roams the streets of Bedminster every night looking for something to bring home. His owners believe the problem has developed because there is no wildlife in the area for the cat to chase after . The couple are now trying to reunite the items with their owners after collecting a huge stash of Norris' stolen goodies in a special cat swag bag. They delivered letters explaining his naughty habit, appealing to anyone who was missing items from their washing line to get in touch. Mr Windsor added: 'At first we thought it was funny. But as his stash grew and the items were getting bigger, we thought we needed to return them. Norris sneaks through neighbours' catflaps and into their homes where he has his pick of clothes, food and homeware . 'It is not as if they are high-value items, but they all belong to someone.. 'Fortunately all our neighbours have been very good natured about it and think it is funny. At least now they know where to come if something disappears mysteriously.' The couple have started ignoring Norris when he arrives home from a night of looting in the hope he'll soon drop the bad habit. 'By ignoring him when he arrives and tries to wake us up, we hope he will stop doing it. 'There are lots of other cats in the area which I guess means there is not much wildlife around to hunt. So Norris chooses to steal stuff instead to pass the time.'","Norris the cat started by taking food from bins but has moved on to stealing from washling lines and houses .

Researchers tackling the illegal trafficking of desert chameleons are using barcode scanners like those used in supermarkets to police trade. Unique ID microchips are being fitted to the six-inch long Namaqua chameleons in the Namib desert so their movements can be tracked. The chameleons can now be read just like a supermarket barcode when a researcher waves a scanner over them. Beep beep: Researchers are using similar scanners as those used in supermarkets to keep track of desert chameleons . British photographers Ann and Steve Toon, from Tarset, Northumberland, documented the unique project while on a trip to Namibia in west Africa. A global trade supplying chameleons as pets and to collections exists with around 60,000 animals legally exported from their home countries each year. But customs officials trying to show a chameleon is being illegally exported have found proof difficult to come by. This is why chameleon expert Dr Krystal Tolley, of Cape Town's South African National Biodiversity Institute, is fitting the implants with Tommy Collard, a natural history guide in Namibia. The chameleons can now be read just like a supermarket barcode when a researcher waves a scanner over them . The chameleons can now be read just like a supermarket barcode when a researcher waves a scanner over them . Dr Tolley says the new chips cause no harm to the wild creatures and hopes it will deter the theft of Namaqua chameleons. She said: 'We are inserting a tiny metal piece encoded with a barcode with a syringe just under the skin. 'The chip itself is actually called a Passive Integrated Transponder tag. 'We haven't seen any side-effects. The skin is sterilised before the tag is inserted, and it's a very small piece, a few millimetres. 'It would be like having a biggish splinter. The small hole is then covered with spray-on skin glue, the stuff you get in pharmacies.' The Namaqua is found in arid parts of Angola, Namibia and South Africa. British photographers Ann and Steve Toon, from Tarset, Northumberland, documented the unique project . The chameleons spend much of their time on the ground or clambering onto sparse, scattered shrubs . Unlike most of the world's 160 species of chameleon, the chameleons spend much of their time on the ground or clambering onto sparse, scattered shrubs. They have the typical chameleon features of well-developed legs, large, grasping feet, a prehensile tail and mobile, independently-moving eyes on the ends of 'turrets'. But its most striking characteristic is the row of large, knobbly tubercles running along a ridge on its back, giving it a zigzag outline reminiscent of a small dragon or dinosaur. The chameleons have a surprising turn of speed when required - but with so little ground cover, it isn't particularly difficult for poachers to locate and catch them. As a result, policing illegal trade is difficult and traders often falsely declare that chameleons for sale are the descendants of legally-imported specimens. Tiny: A Namaqua chameleon baby in the Namib desert before it was chipped so researchers can keep track of it . Unless they can be caught in the act of smuggling, the onus is on the authorities to prove the animals have in fact been taken from the wild. But this is where microchipping could prove invaluable. Dr Tolley said: 'We do know that some Namaqua chameleons were shipped to Europe under 'permits' issued by Uganda. 'But this was just a ruse, because this species doesn't occur in Uganda, so they have no right to ship or issue these.' Dr Tolley hopes the microchipping initiative will also stop valuable data about the behaviour of these little-studied creatures. The barcodes could track long term changes in growth, size and weight. The researchers will also track the movement of adults and juveniles of both sexes. Little of this information exists currently so they hope the data reveals plenty of information about how the species lives. Barcoding could also determine what sort of range size they need, their survival rates and even population size.","Microchips are being fitted to Namaqua chameleons in the Namib desert .

A 'conman' murdered the owner of a luxury cattery and mutilated her body in a bid to cover his tracks after cheating her out of about £60,000, a court heard today. Businesswoman Diana Lee, 54, was bludgeoned to death at her home in affluent East Cheshire by her debt-ridden boyfriend David Ryan, prosecutors allege. The divorcee’s naked body was found face down in a wheelbarrow full of wood by firefighters who were called to attend a blaze at her gated detached property in the leafy village of Cranage, near Holmes Chapel, on August 9 last year, Chester Crown Court heard. Diana Lee, a wealthy businesswoman, was battered to death and her body was found in the burnt out garage of her luxury rural home. David Ryan, pictured leaving Chester Crown Court in Cheshire, denies murdering her . The cattery owner had suffered fatal head wounds from 'a sustained attack with a blunt object' and her genitals had been mutilated, the jury heard. Ryan, of Byrom Street, Altrincham, denies murder. Summing up the prosecution case, Brian Cummings QC told the jury of six men and six women: 'We suggest that the evidence is very strong indeed and amounts to compelling proof that the person who murdered Diana Lee was indeed David Ryan.' Mr Cummings described Ryan as 'devious' and a 'conman' and said he targeted Ms Lee when he was 'at a particularly low ebb' due to his spiralling debt. Ms Lee, 54, suffered fatal injuries in the attack at her luxury cattery in a large gated property . The court has heard that Ryan, who is married, was bankrupt and had racked up £90,000 debts, and that he was receiving 'large amounts of cash from Diana Lee' during their trysts. 'He landed on her as a suitable target for fraud,' the barrister said. The prosecution allege that he presented a 'bogus business opportunity' to her and that over a period of months she gave the defendant around £60,000 which he could not repay. The prosecution say Ryan mutilated Ms Lee’s genitals in an attempt to get rid of his DNA as the pair had engaged in unprotected sex the night before she was killed. Grim discovery: A forensics officer at the murder victim's house last year . Earlier Mr Cummings told the jury, during his prosecution opening, that the defendant had started four fires at the victim’s home to destroy all evidence of their connections. He said: 'Other than the fact he had unprotected sex with her, he believed that there would be nothing to link him to her, nor indeed anything to indicate there had been anyone at Parklands (her home) that night other than Diana Lee and her lodger. 'We allege that this is why he mutilated her body and attempted to incinerate it along with all the bedding.' The court also heard that Ryan tried to 'frame' Ms Lee’s lodger, Andrew Leese, for the murder. After her brutal killing, Ryan took an antique German dagger belonging to Mr Leese and dipped it in the victim’s blood, it was alleged. He also planted Ms Lee’s underwear in the lodger’s room, the jury have heard. Ryan owned a glazing and conservatory firm, but was declared bankrupt in June 2012 , the court heard. He was conducting a secret affair with Ms Lee for almost two years, after the pair met in the Cinnamon Club in Bowdon village, near Altrincham in 2010, it was said. Ms Lee did not know he was married, the defendant told police. During their fling, she withdrew £70,000 from various accounts. Mr Cummings told the jury Ryan’s 'cash purchases and deposits' during the same period totalled 'more than £60,000', despite the fact he had no legitimate income and huge debts. The defendant admitted he had sex with Ms Lee in the back of her Vauxhall Corsa near his home in Altrincham on the evening of Wednesday, August 8, the day before her body was found. The prosecution described Ryan as 'devious' and a 'conman' and said he targeted Ms Lee when he was 'at a particularly low ebb' due to his spiralling debt . But the prosecution say this is a lie and that the pair actually had sex in Ms Lee’s bed that night and that Ryan made up the story of sex in the car as he tried to cover his tracks and distance himself from the murder scene. The jury was told that, when first arrested, Ryan claimed he only knew Ms Lee after giving her a quote for new windows at her cattery. But the following day he was interviewed by police again and admitted: 'I was with her the night before. I had sex with her in the car.' Ryan described their relationship to police, claiming he and Ms Lee were 'friends with occasional sex' He added: 'I was in her car. It was only for a few minutes. It did not last long.' Ryan described their relationship to police, claiming they were 'friends with occasional sex'. After Ms Lee’s death, Cheshire police analysed his computer and found Google search terms including for 'countries that do not have an extradition treaty with the UK' - which prosecutors allege prove he was planning to flee the country. Mr Ryan said he was simply researching another crime in which he was interested. Experts also found the defendant had visited a page relating to Diana Lee’s murder on the Cheshire Police website, then tried to delete it. Ms Lee ran a luxury cattery from a building next to Parklands, off Byley Lane near Cranage Park.

A former New York socialite has been forced to don an unflattering orange jumpsuit and pick up the trash in Los Angeles after attacking her billionaire ex-boyfriend. Taylor Stein, the daughter of legendary rock promoter Howard Stein, has a relationship that can best be described as fractious with her ex, former Estée Lauder CEO William Lauder. Stein and Lauder were an item while he was still married and six years ago had a daughter together, Djuna. Socialite Taylor Stein, left, was sentenced to 19 days community service after attacking former lover William Lauder on an L.A. street . Not long after the child’s birth, Lauder agreed to pay Stein $9.5 million through to the year 2017 on the proviso that she moved to California and wouldn't visit New York for more than two weeks a year. She also had to alert him six weeks in advance before her trips east. Stein has since had to take Lauder to court after he attempted to renege on the deal, but the former love birds remain in contact and Lauder regularly sees his daughter. It was on one of Lauders visits to California late last year that things got out of hand. The New York Post reports that Stein punched Lauder in the face after the pair got into an argument on an L.A. street last November. In 2011 Stein bought a black-market baby for $180,000 and then helped the FBI bring down the Ukrainian ring that sold him to her . William Lauder pictured in 2011 with his late mother Evelyn and father Leonard . Despite, or perhaps because of their history, Lauder choose to press charges and Stein was arrested and later released on $50,000 bail. In May she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence and was fined $1,834 and sentenced to 19 days of community service - cleaning streets for the California Department of Transportation. The Post reports that Stein was spotted wearing orange coveralls as she swept trash in Santa Monica while completing her sentence last month. She is due in court again on Oct. 30 for a progress report on her three years of probation.

The latest advertising campaign from Marks & Spencer has been billed as a ‘celebration of women’. But according to one critic, it’s sailing under false colours. Academic Mary Beard has accused the retailer of being unrealistic by failing to include any women with grey hair. The television historian – who famously eschews hair dye and make-up – complained that there was not so much as a ‘whiff of grey’ in the high-profile promotion. Academic Mary Beard has criticised M&S for not including a grey-haired woman in the line-up that features (left to right) Katie Piper, Nicola Adams, Tracey Emin, Ellie Goulding, Helen Allen, Monica Ali, Grace Coddington, Dame Helen Mirren, Laura Mvula and Karen Elson . Academic Mary Beard accused the retailer of being unrealistic by failing to include any women with grey hair . The campaign, which store bosses hope will revive struggling sales, features 12 famous faces described as ‘Britain’s leading ladies’. It was shot by fashion photographer Annie Leibovitz, with one portrait alone costing upwards of £100,000. However, Professor Beard, 58, wrote to  her 50,000 followers on Twitter:  ‘Women in new M&S ad are a great and feisty bunch. But unless I have mistaken [Helen] Mirren’s blonde, don’t spot a whiff of grey. Women go grey M&S!’ The adverts, which have been described by the store as a way to illustrate its ‘move into a new era’, feature only two women over 60 – Oscar-winning actress Dame Helen, 68, and 72-year-old Grace Coddington, creative director of US Vogue. Neither appears to have grey hair in the pictures. Last night customers took to Twitter to support Professor Beard in her criticism of M&S. ‘Shame on them. I am grey and proud,’ wrote one. ‘Women go grey? Shock horror… I just thought my mirror had gone a bit weird,’ joked another. One added sarcastically: ‘Three things a woman must NEVER do: gain weight, go grey and turn 50!’ ‘Think it is the worst line-up I have ever seen. Enough to keep me out of M & S for ever,’ another woman wrote. M&S chiefs hope the campaign will boost sales of its autumn/winter fashion range, which is seen as make-or-break for the store after two years of declining sales. But there has already been criticism of the women it has chosen, with many questioning whether controversial artist Tracey Emin is an appropriate ambassador for the respectable brand considering her party-loving past. One customer wrote on Twitter: ‘Is this a joke?’ Others selected for the campaign include Olympic gold medal winning boxer Nicola Adams, ballerina Darcey Bussell, Save the Children chief executive Jasmine Whitbread  and novelist Monica Ali. It also features former nurse of the year Helen Allen, acid attack survivor Katie Piper, model Karen Elson and singers Ellie Goulding and Laura Mvula. Mary Beard said the line-up was a 'feisty bunch' but wanted to see more grey, saying that she thought Helen Mirren (centre, seated in red jacket) was blonde in the shoot . M&S say the new line-up and collection is a 'womanist campaign... designed to celebrate women' It marks a departure from the store’s previous adverts starring household names such as Twiggy and Dannii Minogue. M&S has claimed it is a ‘womanist campaign … designed to celebrate women. To whom clothes are presumably important’. Professor Beard, who lectures  in classics at Cambridge University, has refused to alter her style  since she found fame presenting BBC programmes such as Meet  the Romans. Last year she wrote in the Mail: ‘Sure, I don’t wear make-up. I have nothing against those who do if it gives them pleasure, but actually I feel happy enough in my own skin not to feel I want to bother with it. ‘I don’t dye my hair for the same reason. I ask myself: “If I did, what would I be covering up?” And how do you stop doing it once you’ve started?’ Professor Beard has been the target of online trolls who have criticised her looks and earlier this month she received a bomb threat on Twitter. Last night M&S disputed her accusation that there were no women with grey hair included in the campaign. A spokesman said: ‘No, we won’t comment. Helen has grey hair so we will have to agree to differ on that.’ The advertising campaign  comes as M&S faces pressure to revive its fortunes following eight consecutive quarters of declining clothing sales. Customers complained that levels of quality had fallen and that the store no longer sold clothes they actually wanted to wear. However, it has recently bolstered its fashion team with recruits such as style director Belinda Earl, former chief executive of Jaeger.","Cambridge academic complained there is not a 'whiff of grey hair'

Scroll down for video . Direct action: A scene from the video portraying children standing up to greedy businessmen . Mail Online has contacted both Unite and the production company to comment on why they do not want the video published here. Unite – run by left-wing firebrand Len McCluskey – has joined forces with the main teaching unions the NUT, NAS/UWT and the Association of Teachers and Lecturers to get the material into schools. Five videos teach ‘strategies for public protest’ and ‘how organised protest is an effective way of ensuring change takes place’. The videos show a group of cartoon teenagers protesting against a fictitious company’s plans to ‘take over’ the town of Tethergo – an anagram for ‘together’ – and its ‘big plans to privatise the entire area’.

When they fail, lesson plans prepared by Unite urge teachers to think about how they might make protests more threatening. Children are asked to think of ‘five things you could do to push the protest further.’ They are then urged to make their own placards and ‘consider emotive language used to write letters of complaint’. Unite also recommends that ‘teachers may wish to create a display of finished protest placards’. Incredibly, the union also wants children to undermine the authority of their headteachers.

It might be acceptable in the schools of Pyongyang, but not in Britain. ‘These cack-handed attempts to pedal trade union ideology in schools would be funny if it wasn’t so dangerous.’ Mike Griffiths, head of Northampton School for Boys, said: ‘If anyone even remotely suggested it where I work they would get short shrift. The notion of encouraging children to undermine teachers is reprehensible.’ Peter Kent, head of Lawrence Sheriff School, a boys grammar school in Rugby, said he would only consider allowing the subject in lessons if it was balanced. ‘If it was part of a lesson about  history and the teacher wanted to explore how people used public protest I can see a legitimate angle,’ he said. ‘But they would have to make sure it covered both sides of the argument with respect for authority figures.’ Christian May, spokesman for the Institute of Directors, denounced the negative depiction of businessmen.

A bridegroom who lost his legs under a train has fulfilled his dream of dancing with his new bride after eight months of practice. Nathan Stephens, 25, promised bride Charlene Beard, 26, they would have the traditional first dance together at their wedding reception. The Paralympic athlete, who lost both of his legs under a train when he was just nine-years-old, secretly practised the dance routine with his wife in their living room ahead of the ceremony. Scroll down for video . Nathan Stephens, 25, who lost his legs under a train, stunned his wedding guests by dancing for the first time with his new bride, Charlene Beard, 26 . Mr Stephens from Bridgend, South Wales has competed in the Paralympic Games for Great Britain but never wears prosthetic legs as they cause him 'agony' Mr Stephens dances with two of his wedding guests to rapturous applause from the wedding party . His stunned wedding guests watched in surprise as Mr Stephens wheeled himself out of the reception and to a cupboard where a pair of prosthetic legs had been hidden away from sight. Moments later guests cheered and applauded as the newlywed couple took to the floor and performed the three-minute routine - described as good enough for Strictly Come Dancing. Mr Stephens said: 'I wanted to dance with Charlene more than anything but not pushing myself along in my wheelchair. 'I was adamant I was going to do it on my legs and if I set my mind to something I always get there. 'We practised for eight months in our living room and no one had a clue. 'It was all a bit new to me because I’d never danced before but after a while we threw in a few twirls.' He said he has owned a pair of prosthetic legs for years but never used them because they are agony to wear for long. Mr Stephens said: 'I wanted to dance with Charlene more than anything but not pushing myself along in my wheelchair' But he went through the pain barrier for his new bride and their 130 wedding guests as he danced to their favourite song I Won’t Give Up by Jason Mraz. He said: 'My older brother Andrew burst into tears, I think everyone was crying. 'I have not worn my legs for years and most people at the reception had never seen me standing up out of my wheelchair before. 'We knew it would be a spectacular start to our night. 'I was more nervous walking onto the dance floor than when I competed in the London Olympics. 'But we had rehearsed so well it went off like a dream.' Mr Stephens was playing on his way home from a friend’s birthday party when he tried to jump on a passing freight train when he was nine. He survived only because emergency services got him to hospital in time to stop him bleeding to death. He then spent four weeks in intensive care after having his left leg amputated at the hip and his right above the knee in the accident, but soon rebuilt his life as an athlete. At the age of 16 he broke the British senior records in the javelin, discus and shot put. He represented the Great Britain ice sledge hockey team at the 2006 Winter Paralympics and competed in three events in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. Mr Stephens finished 11th in discus, 8th in shot put and 4th in the javelin. He later broke the world record in the men’s javelin with a distance of 41.37 metres thrown from his wheelchair. After three years together he proposed to his wife, a hospital customer services adviser, at the London Games last year. 'I was more nervous walking onto the dance floor than when I competed in the London Olympics' They were married at the Celtic Manor Golf Resort in Newport, South Wales, on Saturday. He said: 'Charlene’s been my rock, she tells me to stop whingeing and get on with things. 'I am so lucky she is my wife - dancing with her on our wedding day was one of the best moments of my life.' The couple, now living in Cardiff, fly off on honeymoon to Sardinia this weekend and Mr Stephen said he is packing his legs. He said: 'This time we will dance under the stars.' Mrs Stephens, originially from Worcester, said: 'We practised our dance for hours and we carried it off on our big day. I am so proud of him. 'We had it filmed and I will treasure the video for ever.'","Nathan Stephens promised bride Charlene Beard they'd dance at wedding .

The headmaster of Eton College is calling for GCSEs to be abolished and pupils spared ‘Victorian-style’ public examinations until they are 18. Tony Little said he wanted a ‘loosening’ up of what is expected of children at 16 to give schools more freedom over what they teach. His comments come as around 600,000 pupils across the country await their GCSE results tomorrow. Headmaster of Eton College Tony Little is heavily critical of the constraints of traditional examining and believes that the system needs to modernise to equip students for the real world . Mr Little said: ‘It seems to me we’re moving to a period when, as a society, we seem to see merit in all, or at least the majority of students, continuing to the age of 18. 'It rather begs the question why we’re having a major public examination at the age of 16 in the way we do it. ‘I say that because I think there are constraints about a traditional, one might almost say Victorian, form of examining – sitting on your own at a desk for a given period of time. ‘As soon as you go into the world of work, the last thing on the whole you do is sit down on your own without speaking. You’re dealing in teams, you’re dealing in groups, you’re sharing things. ‘What I’d like to see is a more inventive approach, a loosening of what we expect at the age of 16 so one could introduce qualifications based on the shared experience of young people. Personally I’d be very happy with a system with a robust examination at the age of 18 and more freedom for schools about how they get there.’ Candidates could face losing up to 5 per cent of the grades for sloppily written papers . Mr Little highlighted the British Science Association CREST awards, which are awarded at three levels of bronze, silver and gold. He said pupils can gain gold awards by working collaboratively in teams of four and learning that ‘you’re as good as your weakest member’. He added: ‘It’s a tremendous learning experience about collaboratively producing an answer to the problem.’ Prince William at Eton in 2000, both he and his brother Harry were former pupils of the country's most prestigious school . Pupils at Eton sit mainly IGCSEs – based . on the old O-level and regarded as a tougher alternative to GCSEs – and . about half the subjects in the sixth form are Cambridge Pre-U, which is . seen as a return to traditional A-level study before it was divided . into ‘bite-sized’ modules. The school has introduced ‘flipped’ lessons in some subjects, including French, which involves pupils going off researching their own work before class. Mr Little said: ‘The notion of a school is that you turn up to the lesson, the teacher explains a lot of things in your 40 minutes and you go away and do homework to show you’ve understood. ‘A flipped lesson turns it the other way round. The information you would need to have is available online, you’re set all this in advance and what the lesson then becomes is seeing if you have understood the information and can develop it or manipulate it in creative ways. ‘It’s not a question of every lesson suddenly becoming a flipped lesson. But what’s really good for students is seeing there’s different ways of going about things. That I find rather exciting. ‘We’re developing a whole range of different ways of students learning – a lot of which enables them to take greater control for themselves, more independent learning.’","Tony Little was once himself a pupil at the prestigious school .

At the end of the evening Miss Lachowicz went to find her bag and realised it was gone.  It was only when she had another look around the garden in daylight that she discovered it, hidden behind the garden shed with large holes chewed in the leather. She says the fox must have pounced midway through the evening when the friends went inside the house for two minutes to get more wine. Miss Lachowicz, from Colliers Wood, south west London, who works at Absolute Sounds in nearby Raynes Park. said: 'We searched the house and the garden, but with no luck. I knew it hadn't been stolen so it was a complete mystery. 'I got a bit worried, because my house keys, work keys and bank cards were in it.'

The following morning, Miss Lachowicz decided to check the 12ft-long garden one more time, only to discover her ruined bag behind the shed. Ruined bag: Foxes are omnivorous and prefer to eat meat or scavenged food but also enjoy chewing leather . She said: 'It had big holes and teeth marks in it, and my wallet had some chew marks as well, though the fox hadn't touched anything else. 'It was quite annoying as the bag was handmade for me in Thailand so I can't get another.' She says that since the incident, on July 9, her friends have reported a fox creeping into their house and chewing leather belts and sandals.'

Products are seen stacked at one of Amazon's many warehouses. Latest figures show the internet retailer is facing renewed competition from the high streets where many products can now be found cheaper . One item, a shower curtain was $24.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond but cost $32.39 at Amazon representing a 23 per cent difference before any coupon discount, the Wall Street Journal reports. Another item, a Bormioli Rocco Misura carafe, was listed for $4.99 at Bed Bath and Beyond, but $16.61 on Amazon, according to BB&T. The carafe is currently selling on Amazon for $6.95 plus $4.50 shipping. BB&T spokesman Anthony Chukumba who oversaw the analysis told ABC: 'What it comes down to is retailers realize that to remain relevant they’ve got to invest in their prices.

Indica Hudderson's family have launched a full scale search for the teen, who vanished without her cell phone or any money, after police were treating it as a runaway case rather than foul play. Bryan and Andrea Huddleston, from Alpine, said they had a minor argument with their daughter about school on Friday before they found a note saying she had left home. But they said one line in the message made them fear for her safety. Scroll down for video .

'The part that worries me is she says, ""I'm fine; I'm being taken care of,""' Mrs Huddleston said to KSL.com. 'That doesn't sound right to me. It sounds like someone is luring her away.' Her parents said Indica had recently been spending a lot of time online chatting to older men. They believe she could be in danger after searching through her Internet activity and reading conversations she had had with the men over the past few weeks. 'I didn't know she was talking to the kind of people she was talking to,' Mrs Huddleston said. 'I should have done a better job of monitoring, but I didn't.'

"By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 18:57 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:18 EST, 21 August 2013 . Bonuses in the City doubled in April as workers saved themselves £65million in tax. Banks delayed payments totalling £1.3billion in a controversial tax-dodging move, despite public outcry. The ‘bonus season’ in the finance and insurance sector is from December to March, but this year bonuses were ‘unusually high’ in April, official figures revealed yesterday. Pay day: City workers took advantage of George Osborne's tax cut to save an estimated £65million . This is because Chancellor George Osborne cut the tax paid on earnings over £150,000 from 50 per cent to 45 per cent on April 6. By waiting to take their bonuses after the change, bankers slashed their tax bill. The delay of a few weeks could have helped them avoid a total of around £65million in tax, experts say. Overall, £38.6billion was paid in bonuses to all UK workers between May 2012 and April 2013, with more than a third – £14billion – going to those in the finance and insurance sectors. The average City worker enjoyed a bonus of £11,900, nearly double that of employees in other sectors, the Office for National Statistics said. Most workers either do not get a bonus or get one of less than £1,000. City workers hit the jackpot again despite their role in a financial crisis of six years ago which continues to affect the daily lives of millions of ordinary British families. In April 2012, when the 50 per cent tax rate was still in place, City bonuses for the month totalled £600million – less than half the amount this year, which was the largest sum for any April since records began in 2000. Benefit: The Chancellor George Osborne cut tax on earnings above £150,000 from 50 per cent to 45 per cent . Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, accused the Chancellor of ‘showering the super-rich with a gift worth tens of millions of pounds’. She said: ‘The shape of Britain’s recovery looks increasingly like one where the same old elites hog the gains, while ordinary workers are expected to take declining living standards on the chin.’ Chris Leslie, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, said: ‘Millions of pounds of revenue will have been lost as a result [of the deferral] at a time when people across the UK are facing a cost of living crisis. ‘This may feel like a recovery for those at the top, but for everyone else, life is getting harder.’ Simon Chouffot, a spokesman for the Robin Hood Tax campaign, which wants new financial sector taxes to help tackle poverty, said: ‘The Government’s manipulation of the tax code to benefit the super-rich has made a bad situation worse. It should put substance to its phrase that “We are all in this together” and ensure the City pays its dues.’ Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs triggered outrage when it emerged it was considering postponing the payment of bonuses until April 6, to take advantage of the cut in the top rate of tax. It quickly ditched the plan after coming under fire from Lord King, then governor the Bank of England, as well as pressure from the Treasury. Yesterday Royal Bank of Scotland said it did not change its payment dates, continuing to pay the cash element of its bonuses in March and the share or bond element in June. A Treasury spokesman said: ‘These figures are broadly in line with the Budget forecast. ‘Bonuses for the financial services sector are expected to be over 60 per cent lower than last year, and are less than a quarter of their peak in 2007, before the financial crisis.’","City workers took full advantage of George Osborne's tax cut this year .

Campaign of terror: Andrea McWatt, 64, of Didsbury, Greater Manchester, targeted a couple in a series of attacks that made them fear for their lives . A retired employment judge carried out a three-year campaign of terror against her neighbours and threatened to kill them by leaving her gas on. Andrea McWatt, 64, of Didsbury, Greater Manchester, targeted Mark Dale and his wife Helen, who have a 20-month-old son, in a series of attacks that made them fear for their lives. Manchester Magistrates’ Court was told that in one terrifying incident McWatt - also a former solicitor - shouted: ‘I am going to kill you all. I am going to leave the gas on and kill your family’. McWatt also hammered on dentist Mr Dale’s walls, and once stood on her balcony singing to loud music until 7am. She was first given a restraining order against the Dales last October. But she has since breached it twice. McWatt was brought back to court in January but again continued to torment Mr Dale and his family by shouting, swearing and hammering on walls for hours on end, said prosecutor Matthew Siddall. McWatt pleaded guilty to breaching the order for a second time in May. But Mr Siddall said matters came to a head when the Dales heard McWatt shouting threats to kill them and their family. She also opened all her windows and stood on her balcony singing to loud music until 7am. She has now been sentenced for the second breach and was given a 12-month community order to co-operate with the probation service. District Judge David Clarke said the restraining order would continue indefinitely. The judge also ordered her to pay the complainant £100 compensation plus £150 costs and a £60 surcharge. Terrifying: The house on the left belongs to Mark and Helen Dale, while the home on the right belongs to Andrea McWatt. The former employment judge was first given a restraining order against the Dales last October . Mr Dale said because of the threats he had expensive safety checks done on his gas supply. He said in a statement: ‘This has caused us great anguish. We have considered moving but the property is unsaleable due to her behaviour and we would have to disclose this to any buyer.’ Mrs Dale said: ‘McWatt has made our lives unbearable. I am scared for my 20-month-old son and pet dog. I feel I cannot enjoy my own home and garden because I am scared of what she may do next.’ 'McWatt has made our lives unbearable. I am scared for my 20-month-old son and pet dog' Helen Dale . McWatt claimed she had very little contact with the complainants. But the judge told her: ‘I don’t accept you are blameless in this matter.’ McWatt, who has been staying in a hotel in Manchester city centre, said she was going to sell her flat and move to Norfolk. When approached for a comment, she said: ‘You’re finished. You can print what you want, because your energy is blocked by God.’","Former employment judge Andrea McWatt targeted Mark and Helen Dale .

Philip Maine was caught using hidden cameras to secretly capture couples in hotel rooms at motoring get-togethers.

The parents of a teenager who died in hospital four days after he took a legal high imported from Holland, have described him as 'a normal young man who loved music and football.' Adam Hunt was discovered collapsed in his bedroom by his mother Bernadette, and he told her that he had taken Alpha Methyltryptamine, or AMT, which he had ordered from the Netherlands. The 18-year-old is also believed to have taken etizolam, which is also a psychoactive substance. Adam Hunt was discovered collapsed in his bedroom by his mother Bernadette, and he told her that he had taken Alpha Methyltryptamine, or AMT, which he had ordered from the Netherlands . She immediately called for an ambulance and the Adam, from Southampton, Hampshire, was rushed to hospital. Doctors treating him said that his condition was 'life-threatening' after he was admitted to Southampton General Hospital on Wednesday last week. Adam was put in a medically-induced coma and on Sunday - four days after taking the drugs - he died. He was described as a 'much loved son' whose interests ranged from football and music to clothes and girls. 'He loved football and was a Saints season ticket holder. His musical tastes were eclectic ranging from Oasis to drum 'n' bass,' his mother and father, Darren, said. 'He did well at school and just two years ago he left with 11 GCSE A-C passes and had gone on to study electrical engineering at college in an attempt to follow in his dad's footsteps. 'He loved travel as well and was due to go on holiday in the next few weeks with one of his best friends to New York where he had planned an itinerary of sight seeing and restaurant visiting as he was also very keen on food. 'He was very thoughtful and caring and loved his family and friends dearly. One of the things we will always remember though about him was his fantastic sense of humour. It is very hard to think we will not get to laugh or talk with him anymore. His mother immediately called for an ambulance and Adam, from Southampton, Hampshire, was rushed to hospital . The 18-year-old was placed in an . induced coma for four days and died in hospital after apparently taking the . legal high he bought online . 'His life had such potential and was all in front of him, sadly it has been cut prematurely very short.' A police spokesman said that the exact cause of Adam's death is yet to be established. Officers are preparing a report for the Hampshire Coroner on his death. Originally developed as an anti-depressant, AMT is a psychedelic drug which releases serotonin and can have effects similar to LSD and ecstasy. However, it can have side effects such as nausea and anxiety. Since June 2012 two deaths in Hampshire have been attributed to AMT, including trainee doctor Doug Ferguson, aged 19 years, from Chandler's Ford and a 33-year-old Andover man. Detective Constable Jonathan Hyland, of Hampshire police, warned: 'The clear issue is that people who state they have a strong view about not taking controlled drugs are importing and purchasing drugs which they read online are a substitute for controlled drugs. 'People incorrectly believe that these 'legal highs' are then both safe and appropriate alternatives to street drugs. Doug Ferguson is believed to have died after taking the legal high AMT while celebrating the end of term . 'Just because something is not illegal does not make it safe. 'It only becomes clear it is not safe when someone becomes severely harmed by taking it and subsequent investigations reveal substances within the compound can be lethal. 'If you are considering taking any type of non personally prescribed drug, I would urge you to consider for a few minutes - before you use the substance - how your family would feel, finding you in need of critical medical attention.' An MP today called for the Government to spearhead a European bid to prosecute businesses selling deadly 'legal highs' following the deaths of three men in just a year. Southampton Itchen MP and former Home Office minister John Denham wants a united legal attempt to prosecute anyone selling such drugs across Europe. Mr Denham said: 'I would suggest to the Government that we need a concerted attempt to use every legal move we can to bring these people down if they can be identified as selling these drugs. 'We need to take the profit out of it and throw the book at people. 'Only part of the answer is regulation and there does need to be more education. 'The very phrase 'legal high' is dangerous because it gives the impression that it must be OK - otherwise it would be banned.'","Adam Hunt discovered collapsed in his bedroom by his mother Bernadette .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . PUBLISHED: . 19:51 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:33 EST, 21 August 2013 . Drilling is expected to resume within days at a potential fracking site after police gained the upper-hand over a dwindling numbers of protesters. Engineers were carrying out maintenance yesterday in preparation for exploratory drilling for shale gas on the outskirts of Balcombe, West Sussex. Police made a series of targeted arrests around the camps after reviewing CCTV evidence of Monday’s violent protests. More than eight riot-trained policeman jumped out of a minibus before surrounding one female suspect and quickly driving her away for allegedly earlier assaulting an officer. Support: Police in body armour assist a tanker that is heading for the test drill site operated by British energy firm Cuadrilla Resources in Balcombe . Altogether, three people were arrested yesterday, two for offences that happened during Monday’s protests and one for a public disorder offence while a lorry was entering the site. Many of the activists had already decided to leave – with some saying they would focus on other sites that currently have applications for drilling being considered. Hundreds of environmental campaigners had been buoyed by Sussex Police’s advice to energy company Cuadrilla last week that it could not secure the area from incursions. Under watch: The number of fracking protesters has now halved after the police intervention . As a result, the company decided to temporarily ‘scale down’ work to see how much potential energy was buried deep under the ground. This led to accusations the police had given into mob rule and were not enforcing the rule of law. But after a day of action where the protesters were cleared away from the main gate, lorries and workers were yesterday escorted safely by police onto the site. Following the arrest of 29 people – including Green MP Caroline Lucas – campaigner numbers have fallen to a third of the 1,200 present during the weekend. The ‘Reclaim the Power’ camp that was set up two miles away in a farmer’s field was also being dismantled yesterday and due to be completely cleared by tonight. Crackdown: Three more people were arrested at the site yesterday . Sources say Cuadrilla executives now believe they can contain the site with the current police presence and private security patrolling the perimeter. Drilling, which was suspended last week, is provisionally planned to resume by the end of the week. Sussex Police have been joined by more than 10 forces helping to provide a combined force of 400 officers to patrol the site around the clock. Dave Packham, 37, who is unemployed and from London, was trying to hitch-hike back to the capital. He said: ‘I think it’s all over now. I came down last week but numbers have really dropped. ‘It was fun while it lasted and there was a great atmosphere. This has been like a music festival and people have really pulled together. I think the police are now not going to let us carry on so it’s time to move on.’ A statement on the ‘No Dash For Gas’ campaign website said its activists were considering more direct action techniques in Balcombe and other UK sites following the police clamp-down. Back up and running: Drilling at the Cuadrilla site is expected to resume by the end of the week . Cuadrilla had hoped to carry out exploratory drilling to assess if it is worth applying for a licence to extract shale gas that might involve fracking. The overall police operation against the protesters is expected to cost taxpayers more than £2million as it goes into its third week. Fracking pumps liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas to be used as fuel. Campaigners say this might pollute local water supplies and cause earthquakes. Cuadrilla said in a statement: ‘Cuadrilla is rightly held accountable for complying with multiple planning and environmental permits and conditions, which we have met and will continue to meet. ‘Clearly we are held to one set of legally enforceable standards while some protesters believe that they can set out and follow their own.’ Under pressure, David Cameron broke his silence over whether he would support fracking in his Witney constituency, saying he would welcome it. Last week, his spokesman declined ten times to give a definitive answer on the controversial practice. But the same spokesman said on Monday: ‘If locally led planning processes were followed then yes, the Prime Minister would be happy [for fracking to go ahead].’ Mr Cameron has said the whole country should accept fracking as it might potentially cut rising energy bills. Brighton MP Miss Lucas yesterday said she took direct action during a sit-in because ‘the Government isn’t listening’ to campaigner’s concerns. Sussex Police said nine people who took part in protests on Monday had been charged with mainly public disorder offences, five cautioned and 14 bailed until a later date. Last night, Sussex Police said fireworks and drugs had been seized from an area of woodland close to the Cuadrilla site where protesters have been accused of threatening a local landowner who asked them to leave.","Police make targeted arrests after reviewing CCTV from Monday's protest .

A bizarre plan to fine people who 'miss the bowl' in public toilets has been met with derision in China. Officials in the city of Shenzhen are planning to slap anyone guilty of 'uncouth' use of public facilities with a 100 yuan - approximately £10 - penalty from next month. But sceptical Chinese poured scorn on the scheme - joking that it would create new jobs for civil servants tasked with standing behind 'every urinating person to see whether the pee is straight'. Mocking: Portable toilets are seen against the backdrop of skyscrapers in Shenzhen, where officials are planning to introduce a 100 yuan fine for 'uncouth' use of public urinals . The draft regulations did not specify what level of spillage would be regarded as a violation of the new rules, according to a report on the South China Morning Post. 'Such uncouth use of a public toilet will be fined 100 yuan [approx £10] by authorities' from September, a city government official in Shenzhen said yesterday. But critics on Weibo - China's version of Twitter - questioned how the city intends to enforce the new regulations. Bizarre: Critics joked that local authorities would have to employ more civil servants to stand behind toilet users and supervise . 'A number of new civil servant positions will be created. There will be a supervisor behind every urinating person to see whether the pee is straight,' one online sceptic wrote. 'Very good measures. I expect they can create 20 jobs on average for every public toilet,' another said. A more serious observation came from a Weibo user who wrote: 'It's better to have no rule than a rule that cannot be implemented.' A commentary in the Beijing Times suggested the proper use of public toilet facilities was a matter to be guided by 'social consensus', and not law.","'Uncouth' use of a public toilet to be punishable by a 100 yuan fine .

Britain's Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks said the Government had not addressed the need to encourage marriage . Stay-at-home mothers have been let down by David Cameron, Britain’s Chief Rabbi said last night. Lord Sacks said in a parting message to ministers that the Government had not addressed the need to encourage marriage and needed to give ‘more support’ to full-time mothers. George Osborne angered traditional Conservatives earlier this month by suggesting that choosing to stay at home to look after children was a ‘lifestyle choice’. The Chief Rabbi is to step down next month after 22 years in the role. He told The Times: ‘I think the Government has not done enough. ‘Although I don’t take a party political stance . . . I don’t think the Government has done enough at all. The State has an interest in marriage because the cost of family breakdown and non-marriage, the last time I looked at it, was estimated at £9billion a year. ‘[The Government] should certainly recognise marriage in the tax system, it should certainly give more support to mothers who stay at home, or for childcare provision. ‘I don’t believe in getting involved in the details, but the principle is pretty clear.’ Lord Sacks’s comments come after it emerged that mothers who look after their children at home will miss out on vouchers worth up to £1,200 per year to help working parents fund childcare costs. The £1billion scheme is available to families in which both parents work and earn up to £300,000 a year. Households in which one parent stays at home, which includes more than one million families, will be excluded from receiving the childcare vouchers. In further comments, he said allowing ethnic groups to keep to themselves had led to ‘segregation and inward-looking communities’. Chancellor George Osborne angered traditional Conservatives earlier this month by suggesting that choosing to stay at home to look after children was a 'lifestyle choice' He said multiculturalism was like a hotel where ‘nobody is at home’. ‘It doesn’t belong to anyone, we’ve each got our room and so long as we don’t disturb the neighbours we can do whatever we like.’Despite this, he said he understood the difficulties that British Muslim communities faced when trying to integrate. ‘We’ve had 26 centuries of experience, which most Muslims haven’t,’ he said. ‘The norm was for Muslims to live under a Muslim jurisdiction and the norm, since the destruction of the first temple, was for Jews to live under a non-Jewish jurisdiction.’","Lord Sacks said Government should give full-time mothers 'more support'

I bent down to move a plant pot and the dog just bit me.’ Her fiancé, Johnnie Gravil, 43, added: ‘She had cuts on her head, chin and around her eyes. 'We took her straight to Doncaster Royal Infirmary but they said the injuries were so severe we should go to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield. ‘She had an operation to repair her eyelid and the doctors said she might have to have more surgery depending on how her wounds heal.’ The couple - who have been together for 14 years and engaged for 10 years - are now looking at taking legal action against the owners of the dog, Leyland, which was put down after the incident.

A grandmother who booked a dream package holiday to Portugal arrived at her hotel only to find she’d been taken to Spain. Thomas Cook flew June Burns, 66, and friend Susan Jones to Portugal’s Faro Airport - before putting them on a bus and driving them 100 miles over the border to Spain’s Costa de la Luz. When June returned to England, she complained to the tour operator, who has now offered her £200 compensation. Disappointed: June Burns, 66, (pictured) is still waiting for the trip to Portugal that she asked Thomas Cook to book for her, after she was sent to Spain instead . But Mrs Burns, from Swinton, Manchester, is still waiting for the £1,247 Portuguese holiday she paid for. She said: 'The customer service people keep saying, ""What’s wrong? Didn’t you like the hotel?"" And I keep saying the hotel was fine but I wasn’t in Portugal. It’s like booking a holiday to Scotland and ending up in England. 'If I sit in a seat and ask a holiday company to book me a holiday to the Algarve I expect to end up in the right country.' Mrs Burns, 66, booked the break at the Thomas Cook store at Manchester's Trafford Centre. She said: 'I used to work for a cruise operator so I’ve been to most of Europe but had never been to Portugal so I was really keen to go.' The tour operator told Mrs Burns they’d found her a seven-day trip to the Algarve - the southernmost point of mainland Portugal. Armed . with a booking confirmation, she hurried home to pack, her head full of . the region’s beautiful hilltop villages and beaches. But after the . flight to Faro Airport the trip took an unexpected turn. Holiday snaps: The friends said that while the hotel and food was nice, it wasn't what Mrs Burns had asked Thomas Cook to book for them . In Spain: Mrs Burns booked the holiday for her and her friend Susan Jones, right. They wanted to visit Portugal's Algarve, but ended up at the Punta Umbria Beach Hotel, left, on Spain's Costa de la Luz, near Huelva . June said: 'During the journey, people were commenting that there were Spanish road signs but we just dismissed it. Then we arrived at the hotel and it really began to dawn on us that it wasn’t Portugal. 'I went up to the rep and said ""Where are we?"" And she said ""Spain, is there a problem?"" And I said, ""yes, I should be in the Algarve"". She just said it would be difficult to move us because there might not be a free hotel and that we’d definitely enjoy it here.' With no other option, Mrs Burns and her two companions forged ahead with the holiday at the Punta Umbria Beach hotel, near Huelva. She added: 'The food was good and clean but we were stuck in Spain in the middle of nowhere. 'It’s the type of place where everyone just sits by the pool all day. I ended up spending a fortune on day trips to Seville, where I’d been before.' June Burns and her friend Susan Jones were flown to Faro, in the Algarve region of Portugal, then driven 100 miles to a hotel in Punta Umbria, near Huelva, in Spain . Since her return, Mrs Burns has been twice to the Trafford Centre store to complain and made three calls to customer services. Only after the press was alerted was she offered compensation. A spokeswoman for Thomas Cook UK & Ireland said: 'We know how important holidays are for our customers, and would like to apologise for any misunderstanding that may have occurred when Mrs Burns booked her holiday with us. 'While Mrs Burns did not query her holiday confirmation documents prior to travel, whereupon we could have amended her booking, we can confirm that we are speaking to her with a view to resolving this matter to her satisfaction.' Mrs Burns' holiday confirmation document says they are going to ‘Costa de la Luz, Algarve’. Some travel agents do refer to Costa de la Luz as ‘the Spanish Algarve’ - but Punta Umbria Beach Hotel is not in the Algarve. On Thomas Cook’s website it comes under the heading of Spain with no mention of the word ‘Algarve’.","June Burns, 66, booked a dream trip to Portugal as she'd never been before .

David Cameron has injured his back, forcing him to cancel plans to hunt deer during his Scottish holiday. The Prime Minister has had a painkilling injection after suffering a protruding disc in his spine. In an interview on the remote Hebridean island of Jura, where Mr Cameron and his family were on their third summer holiday, he said his ‘phenomenally bad back’ had been a ‘bore’. It has stopped him from doing his favourite activities including stalking deer – which involves crawling through the heather rifle in hand – and waterskiing. Mr Cameron, who was once credited with killing two stags with one shot, denied that he had given up deer-stalking to placate animal rights groups, calling it ‘probably one of the most defendable’ field sports. But said he was unable to do it on Jura, where he was staying on a 20,000-acre estate owned by his wife Samantha’s stepfather Lord Astor. ‘I’ve got a phenomenally bad back so I don’t really think I’ll be able to crawl,’ he said . The interview was apparently designed to show a Prime Minister at ease with himself. But Tory MPs privately expressed concerns that openly discussing his interests in hunting, riding and fishing would do little to combat the charge from some critics that he is out of touch with ordinary voters. ‘Another masterstroke from the man of the people,’ one MP remarked. Mr Cameron left Jura yesterday, after the interview, and travelled to Oxford for treatment. Scroll down for video . Pleased to meet you: Mr Cameron feeding a pony on holiday . The Prime Minister tweeted: ‘I’ve been treated for a bad back/protruding disc at Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre today. The staff say all will be back to normal very soon.’ The Camerons then journeyed on to Cornwall for the final leg of their holiday. Aides said no specific incident had caused Mr Cameron’s bad back but that it had ‘developed over time’. Mr Cameron, 46, said: ‘When you get into your mid-40s stuff like this starts to happen.’ In the interview with BBC Scotland, Mr Cameron said he enjoys activity-based holidays. He joked that he liked horse-riding but ‘not bare-chested’ like Russian premier Vladimir Putin. ‘I walk, I like fishing, I like going for a run.

A student who achieved three A grades in her A'Levels may be forced to move to Romania to study to become a doctor after four universities in the UK turned her applications down. Miriam Bourne, of Bodmin in Cornwall, achieved As in chemistry, biology and geography, but was denied a place at all of the universities she had applied to, including Keele and Manchester. This is despite other students from Bodmin College being offered places to study medicine, even though their grades were not as good as Miriam's. Devastated: Miriam Bourne achieved top marks in her A Levels, but was rejected to study medicine by every university she applied to . Forced overseas: The 18-year-old is hoping to secure a place at Ovidius University in Constanta, Romania . The 18-year-old said: 'Studying medicine is so competitive . and there are only a limited number of places available, I know, but it . has been my dream to become a doctor for quite a few years now. 'I . did have interviews at Manchester University and Keele University but . didn’t get in, which has been really disappointing.' Miriam, who has two GPs within her extended family, now faces the prospect having to move to the Romanian city of Constanta, where she will be able to pursue her ambition at Ovidius University. The qualification they offer is recognised by the General Medical Council and other countries across the world. Counting the cost: Miriam will need to find £60,000 to pay for her course . But if she does decide to move overseas she will need to raise £60,000 to pay for the six-year course at because she will not qualify for the usual student grants or financial help open to other under graduates in the UK. She said: 'I attended a medical student conference at Nottingham University that mentioned the Romanian medical school, and it does appeal to me because it is a very practical course, but with the tuition fees, accommodation, food and travelling expenses it will cost about £10,000 per year. 'Although I do have some savings, I don’t think I will be able to get enough money on my own to go there, but it’s something I am considering.' Miriam originally had ambitions of becoming a midwife or nurse but was encouraged by her teachers to aim higher and become a doctor after they saw her potential. Her mother Jackie said: 'Miriam was devastated to get rejected from the four universities, particularly Keele, where she thought she did well. 'It is so frustrating when some of her friends did get places to study medicine even though their results were not as good as Miriam’s.' A spokesman for UCAS, which handles applications on behalf of universities, said if a student failed to get into the university of their choice this year, they could apply again next year. He added: 'Securing a university place is competitive, and although students may miss out on the place they hoped for, other universities are likely to make them an offer. 'There are still thousands of courses with vacancies in clearing, listed on the UCAS website. If an applicant has their heart set on a particular course that isn’t available, one option is to apply again next year.' Rejected: Manchester University was among the four UK institutions that turned the promising student down . Sadly Miss Bourne is not the first hardworking student to fall of the exacting standards enforced by many top flight universities. Last week Alastair Hernon found himself in the same situation when he was rejected from Oxford despite getting seven A*s in his A-levels. But the teenager from Bangor, County Down in Northern Ireland was more than consoled by the flurry of offers received from across the Atlantic. Having secured top grades in  biology, chemistry, physics, maths, further maths, Latin and Classical Greek he was offered places at both Harvard and Princeton. But he decided to accept a place at Stanford, one of the world’s leading research and teaching institutions in California, where he plans to study chemistry from September. The most famous incident of this kind came in 2000 when northern teenager Laura Spence, hit the headlines. Her rejection from Oxford university ignited a national rows about elitism in the country’s best universities after Magdalen College refused the then 18-year-old a place even though she got five top grades in her A-levels. Prime Minister Gordon Brown - who was Chancellor of the Exchequer at the time - dubbed Oxford's decision a 'scandal' and launched a bitter attack on the university's selection procedures. Dr Spence, from Whitley Bay, Tyne and Wear, was offered a £35,000 scholarship to study Biological Sciences at Harvard where she graduated with honours. She subsequently returned to the UK and completed a medicine degree at Cambridge in 2008.","Promising teenager got top grades in chemistry, biology and geography .

Dr David Kelly, who was found dead a decade ago today after leaking that the Blair government had 'sexed up' the Iraq dossier . Doctors campaigning for an investigation into the death of Iraq weapons expert Dr David Kelly believe he was the victim of a Hillsborough-style cover-up. The group says it would be ‘shameful’ if the truth about the death was suppressed in a similar way to that of the 1989 football stadium tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans died. The doctors claim to have ‘multiple serious concerns’ over evidence used in the case and fear there were ‘serious deficiencies’ in the investigation by police. The group is calling for a full inquest into Dr Kelly’s death in woods near to his Oxfordshire home and a review of the investigation by Thames Valley Police. The chemical and biological weapons expert was found dead a decade ago today, shortly after being exposed as the source of a BBC claim that Tony Blair’s Government had ‘sexed up’ the case for war in Iraq. The Hutton Report later found that Dr Kelly, a member of a UN inspection team sent to Iraq to unearth weapons of mass destruction, had committed suicide. However, many still believe the 59-year-old scientist may have been murdered by the security services. The group of doctors, which is led by the radiologist Stephen Frost and includes Andrew Watt, David Halpin and Christopher Burns-Cox, says Dr Kelly’s death is ‘a matter of continuing public and professional concern’. Their statement said: ‘In the interests of justice, both an inquest into Dr Kelly’s death and an Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into what we consider to be a deficient and dishonest investigation by Thames Valley Police are required. ‘The British public had to wait 23 years for the truth about the Hillsborough disaster to emerge. ‘It would be shameful if the truth about the suspicious death of Dr David Kelly were concealed for a similar length of time.’ Dr David Halpin, a member of the group of doctors that is group is calling for a full inquest into Dr Kelly¿s death in woods near to his Oxfordshire home and a review of the investigation by Thames Valley Police .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:59 EST, 20 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:33 EST, 20 August 2013 . Eddie Ray Routh (pictured) has been arraigned on two counts of capital murder . The North Texas man accused of killing former Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle and another man has been arraigned on two counts of capital murder. Eddie Ray Routh made a brief court appearance today in Erath County, Texas. The 25-year-old is an Iraqi War veteran charged with killing 'America's Deadliest Sniper' Kyle and Chad Littlefield in February at a gun range. After the shooting, Routh fled in Kyle's pickup. He was captured a few hours later at his sister's home in Lancaster. Routh was indicted in July. His trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 21 and he remains jailed in lieu of $3 million bail. Kyle is considered to be the deadliest sniper in American history. His account of life during and after war, 'American Sniper', was a best-seller. In June, Kyle's unforgiving widow, said she refused to accept that PTSD be used as an excuse by her husband's killer. Talking about Eddie Ray Routh, Taya Kyle said that she had no intention of ever absolving him. Taya Kyle, 38, told CBS DFW that PTSD is a condition that does influence a sufferers mood, but 'You're not going to blame someone else, in my opinion when you murder two people in cold blood.' Chris Kyle was the author of the . bestselling book, 'American Sniper' and was writing a new book, . 'American Gun: A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms' at the time of his . death. The book is on general release now. The . sniper was so feared by insurgents in Iraq, that an $80,000 bounty was . placed on his head and he was known by his nickname of 'Al-Shaitain . Rama' - 'The Devil of Ramadi'. Routh, 25, has claimed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and that Kyle was helping him through his condition. However, Taya' scorn for Routh's claims are evident through the manner in which she speaks of those who live with PTSD. Former Navy SEAL and author of bestselling book American Sniper, Chris Kyle (pictured) was fatally shot along with another man on a gun range in February, 2013 . Pain: Taya Kyle spoke at length about the loss of Chris Kyle her husband - and brushed off any suggestion that PTSD could be a legitimate reason for her husband's murder by Eddie Routh . 'They (those with PTSD) worked through their struggles, just like we work through our struggles. They are phenomenal people and it doesn’t change their character,' said Taya to CBS DFW. 'Might change their mood once in a while, might have sleepless nights, doesn’t make them a murderer.' Opening up about how she has learned to cope without her decorated husband, Taya became emotional remembering him. 'I miss everything. He was patient, supportive, funny, loving. I miss his hands, hugs. I miss him laughing with the kids every day. I don’t think there’s much that I don’t miss about him. One of a kind.' During the interview she explained that she still lives with their two children at their Dallas family home and still keeps the house the same as when Chris was still there. And tragically she revealed how just as Chris had accepted and become comfortable with his decision to leave the Navy, be a full time dad and work on his books, she became aware of a sixth-sense that things might not stay this way. Having spent years worrying daily about losing her husband in battle, now she had him home, she became gripped by a 'be careful what you wish for' moment. In an interview earlier this month, Taya said she does not believe that Routh was a PTSD sufferer. 'People who have PTSD don’t talk about it. They don’t use it as an excuse. They carry guns and they do good work and love their families,' she said to the New York Post. 'They struggle, but it doesn’t change their character.' Making the shot: Chris Kyle takes aim from on top of an overturned crib during the Second Battle of Fallujah . Four tours: During his time in Iraq, he gained infamy among the insurgents, who nicknamed him 'the Devil of Ramadi' and put a $20,000 price on his head . Taya is hoping that Routh's trial will shed more light on his alleged motives. 'Chris has a lot of experience with guys with PTSD — hunting, shooting and healing,' said Taya. 'For that reason alone, there was no reason not to take him to the range — there’s a lot more information Chris would have needed to not to make that decision.' Kyle, was a cowboy from Odessa, Texas who grew up hunting deer and pheasant with a rifle and a shotgun his dad bought him. He never realized he was a good shot until he joined the Navy and got into the prestigious SEAL special operations unit. 'I thought to myself, 'Oh, hell yeah!' It was an honor,' he told Texas Monthly magazine when Army intelligence told him about his infamy. Taya Kyle stands during the playing of Taps during a memorial service for former her husband and Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, February 11, 2013 . Long shot: Mr Kyle poses here with the rifle, a .338 Lapua Magnum, he used to kill an insurgent from 2,100 yards away outside Sadr City . But his Navy SEAL companions gave him a different name 'the Legend.' His most legendary shot came outside Sadr City in 2008 when he spotted an insurgent with a rocket launcher near an Army convoy -- 2,100 yards away. At that distance, 1.2 miles, he fired a shot from his .338 Lapua Magnum rifle. It struck home, knocking the man over dead. 'God blew that bullet and hit him,' Mr Kyle told the New York Post. Mr Kyle's preferred weapon, though, was a custom-built bolt action rifle with a powerful scope. It was chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum, a cartridge originally developed for hunting North American big game. However, Mr Kyle said he has found a new use for it -- making long range, highly accurate shots. 'I could hit a target from 1,800 yards, and it would shoot like a laser,' he told Texas Monthly.","Eddie Ray Routh is charged with killing Chris Kyle and Chad Littlefield .

A carriage horse suddenly collapsed on a Salt Lake City street over the weekend and since then the city has become a hotbed of arguments over whether such rides are humane. The 13-year-old carriage horse named Jerry suffered a bout of colic on Saturday, then fell to the ground and refused to get up. Now animal rights advocates both in and outside of Salt Lake City are calling for an end to the ‘cruel industry’ of horse drawn carriage rides. WARNING: GRAPHIC IMAGES . Collapsed: A 13-year-old carriage horse named Jerry collapsed near the end of a tour in Salt Lake City on Saturday. His leg was scraped as rescuers tried to lift him from the street . Jerry was near the end of a tour when he suddenly kicked his stomach and collapsed to the ground. ‘[He] just didn’t want to move,’ city resident Ronald Schulthies told the Salt Lake Tribune. ‘His eyes were open and when we’d move him, he’d neigh and whinny.’ Schulthies was among some 60 concerned passersby. Veterinarians would also soon come to the 1,800 pound horse’s aid. At first, all they could do was try to comfort the animal. Stubborn: Around 60 concerned people gathered at the scene. Each time they tried to get Jerry up he 'whinnied and neighed' and refused to move . Changes? The animal reportedly suffered a bout of colic, which caused the collapse. Animal advocates are now calling for a ban on horse drawn carriage rides in the Utah city . Controversy: A 13-year-old carriage horse collapsed on a Salt Lake City street Saturday, creating an outcry from animal rights advocates. This photo provided by PETA shows Jerry being lifted into a barn with a forklift . ‘It was distressing because lots of people there wanted to do something, but didn’t know what to do,’ Schulthies said. ‘Obviously, the carriage company didn’t have any plan for that type of thing.’ Schulthies said Jerry would attempt to stand but quickly fall back down. He emphasized that the horse was treated with only the utmost concern for his health and well-being. However, the incident has animal rights advocates in a tizzy over the practice they say is unhumane. ‘These horses are trotting along on pavement, their feet are not designed to walk on pavement and their forced to pull carriages in frigid temperatures and sweltering heat,’ PETA spokesman Jeremy Beckham told KTVX. ‘It's really a recipe for injury.’ Jerry’s case has motivated animal . lovers to call for a change to city ordinances that allow horse drawn . carriage rides, animal lovers like Donna Pemmitt. With demands to 'end this cruelty,' Pemmit’s online petition had received over 3,000 signatures as of Tuesday morning. And that has city officials taking note. Happier times: Witnesses at the scene of Jerry's collapse say he was treated with the utmost concern for his safety by caretakers and veterinarians. Here, Jerry is pictured relaxing at his barn before his collapse . Working: Horse carriage opponents say urban environments are dangerous to the animals. Jerry is pictured here outfitted with his working gear before his collapse . ‘I think anytime there’s an unfortunate incident like this, it does get everyone’s attention and it creates a dialogue that I think is good,’ said Salt Lake City councilman, who also cautioned that a change to city rules is ‘not something I take lightly.’ Jerry was eventually lifted into a trailer and quickly sedated. He’s now recovering. Though controversy over horse carriages may be new to the Utah capital, it is nothing surprising to New York City, where the vehicles and the outcries that often surround them are common. 'It is a very inhumane and unsafe trade, particularly to be practiced in such a busy and congested city,' Elizabeth Forel, President of the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages told MailOnline in 2011. '[It is] unsafe to pedestrians, the passengers and the horse.' Forel’s ire came amid several unfortunate incidents involving carriage horses in the Big Apple that year. At least three of the iconic animals collapsed in 2011, while at least one other tossed its passengers and ran wild through the streets before being sedated. National issue: In New York City, where carriage rides are a common site, incidents with the horses and ensuing outcries are nothing new. Here, handlers wrangle a carriage horse run amock in 2011 .","13-year-old Jerry collapsed over the weekend due to a bout of colic .

Scotland Yard was urged to investigate the former head of the Serious Fraud Office yesterday after it emerged that he approved ‘irregular’ taxpayer-funded payoffs to staff worth £1million. Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry asked the Metropolitan Police chief to examine whether the behaviour of Richard Alderman constituted misconduct in public office. She accused the former boss of the corruption watchdog of ‘flying in the face of legal advice’ by sanctioning bumper severance payments without approval. The Metropolitan Police have been asked to examine whether the behaviour of Richard Alderman constituted misconduct in public office . She said: ‘A financial irregularity on this scale is an affront to the standing of the SFO, which is supposed to be the nation’s flagship fraud and corruption watchdog.’ The development came after a report by the Public Accounts Committee found Mr Alderman did not get approval from the Cabinet Office or Treasury before agreeing payouts to three senior civil servants taking voluntary redundancy. One of them, former chief executive Phillippa Williamson, was also allowed to work from her Lancashire home near the Lake District and rack up travel and hotel bills worth £98,946 when visiting the London office for three days a week. Former CEO Phillippa Williamson was also allowed to rack up travel and hotel bills worth £98,946 . MPs on the committee said Mr Alderman, 60, who retired as director of the SFO last April days after Mrs Williamson left, had ‘failed to follow due process’ or ‘to comply with the rules that should underpin the use of public money’. The report described the SFO as a case study in ‘how not to run a public body’. In a letter to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met Commissioner, Miss Thornberry wrote: ‘I fear that Richard Alderman’s conduct with regard to severance packages and ex-gratia payments to senior staff may amount to an offence of misconduct in public office. I would be very grateful  for any assistance that you can offer in investigating this deeply troubling matter.’ The Labour MP said the report made clear that ‘Alderman failed to obtain approval for exit payments totalling over £1million and did so flying in the face of legal advice’. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s deeply worrying that the body charged with rooting out financial malpractice has been found so wanting in its own affairs. It raises questions over how the public can trust a body in such a sensitive position.’ Mrs Williamson was given a payout of more than £464,000, including an ‘irregular’ £407,000 pension top-up that did not go through the proper approval process. Mr Alderman’s failure to obtain the appropriate permission led to the National Audit Office refusing to sign off Serious Fraud Office accounts. Mr Alderman also decided on a £15,000 special payment to Miss Williamson and former chief operating officer Christian Bailes to avoid grievance actions, despite legal advice that there were no such claims to be made. Mr Bailes’s severance package was worth £473,167, and a further £49,885 was handed to the head of technology, Ian McCall. Yesterday there was no answer at the £750,000 detached Georgian property that Mrs Williamson, 51, shares with her husband Peter, 68, and son Thomas, 16, in Arkholme on the border of the Lake District.","Police asked to examine the behaviour of former Serious Fraud Office boss .

Hero: Joseph Hardman, pictured, was giving CPR to a patient, who hasn't been named, last Friday morning when, on the way to the hospital, he began having severe chest pains . His union president Joe Barney said on Saturday: 'He dropped his patient off alive while he was having a heart attack, then went to the ER, where they treated him immediately. He survived, and he's in fact laying three beds over from the guy he brought into the hospital.' Both men had identical stents put in to clear the blockage in their arteries. Doctor Michael Brown told WXYZ that Hardman's blockage was in what they call the 'widow maker' artery. He said the odds of an EMS technician having a heart attack while treating a heart attack patient were 'one in a million.' 'I would have to say one in a million is about appropriate,' Brown said. 'I haven't ever seen it and I haven't heard of it.' ER: His partner drove them both to the Detroit Medical Center's 24/7 Cardiac Care unit, pictured, and the paramedics dropped off the patient before Hardman himself went to the ER . Hardman, who has now been released from hospital, said he did not know how serious a condition he was in until his chest pains grew stronger and he began sweating. He described the pain as 'a sudden explosion-type feeling in my chest.' The 40-year-old is well aware how lucky he was to already be on his way to hospital when he began having the heart attack. 'If I hadn't been in the position I was in, I would have been deceased,' he told 7 Action News on Monday. Hardman should be able to return to work after a couple of months of therapy. However, Barney said the health scare suggests Hardman should slow down a bit. 'He's scared. The stress of the job is getting to be too much,' he said. The other patient is also recovering and no doubt appreciates Hardman's dedication to the job. Hardman has worked as a paramedic for 15 years and has no prior heart health issues.","Detroit paramedic Joseph Hardman, 40, was giving CPR to a patient last Friday morning when he began having severe chest pains .

A Philadelphia woman is accused of tying her disabled cousin to a urine-soaked bed in a scheme to steal her assistance checks. Regina Bennett, 46, was first arrested early Saturday morning after an altercation with her neighbour. Cops doing a walk-through of her home found a malnourished, disabled woman bound by her arms and legs with rags to a urine-soaked bed wearing only a diaper. As the handicapped woman’s caregiver, Bennett had control over her cousin’s finances and received her social security checks, according to reports. Instead of public assistance, Bennett was handed on Sunday a litany of charges ranging from assault, to making terroristic threats, kidnapping, public drunkenness and false imprisonment. Horrific discovery: Regina Bennett is in custody for both the fight and imprisoning her disabled cousin . Police were called just before midnight Friday night after Bennett allegedly got into a drunken brawl with a neighbor, according to WPVI. They were told by neighbors there may be a small child inside. ‘She started snapping on neighbors, using profanity and names,’ Richard Master told Fox 29. Cops searching the house of horrors said they instead found a 36-year-old woman with cerebral palsy, severe malnutrition, bed sores and other signs of abuse being kept prisoner in squalid conditions wearing only a diaper, according to NBC Philadelphia. Officers untied the allegedly tortured woman and sent her to a local hospital. ‘She looked like she was distraught, maybe, out of it – I guess because there was a lot of ambulances and police around her,’ a neighbor told Fox 29. Bennett was appointed caretaker of her cousin in 2009, according to NBC Philadelphia. Her role saw her overseeing the woman's finances. A relative of Bennett’s defended her, saying she never saw any evidence of abuse. ‘She took care of her like she was her own flesh and blood child. Her room was neat and clean, she went to her programs and fed her - that's all I know,’ the woman identified only as Phyllis told local media.

The claimants' solicitors, Irwin Mitchell, say weddings, honeymoons and birthday celebrations were ruined by the devastating food-poisoning outbreaks . Some guests described the hotel as . being like a 'casualty ward', with fleets of ambulances ferrying poorly . guests to hospital day after day. Guests witnessed a waiter vomiting in reception and other staff were seen attending the doctor for treatment. Honeymooners Aonghus Morrison, 35, and his wife Karen, 29, from Darklands in Glasgow had been hoping to spend two weeks enjoying their luxury Caribbean surroundings, but were struck down with the sickness within days of their arrival. Mrs Morrison said: 'The state of the hotel was really awful – we were told we were booking a four-star resort, however the hotel room didn’t even look like it had been properly cleaned. 'The dining area was very off-putting as there were always birds flying around and landing on tables. The food on the buffet was left uncovered for long periods of time, exposing it to the insects that were constantly flying around and we often saw plates covered in flies.' After the honeymoon couple both fell ill, Mr Morrison went to visit the hotel doctor – only to find that there was a huge queue of people also waiting to be seen and who were complaining of the same symptoms. 'Aonghus had to wait for several hours before he was seen. Eventually he was given two different types of antibiotics and pain killers for his stomach and was told to drink electrolytes,' she said. 'He had to bring my dose back to the hotel room for me as by that point I was too weak to move anywhere.' The issues were said to be so bad that one plane flying UK passengers back from the country was quarantined at Gatwick. Another at the same airport and one landing at Manchester were boarded by doctors as guests needed treatment on the runway before they could disembark. Clive Garner, a Partner and Head of the International Travel Law team at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are delighted for our clients that they have now received a fair settlement from the tour operators after enduring such terrible times at the Bahia Principe. 'The long history of guests suffering illness at this hotel makes grim reading. There have been problems at the hotel on and off for 10 years in the lead up to the 2007 outbreak, and we are still receiving complaints from guests 5 years after that dreadful outbreak. 'We remain very concerned that hotels and tour operators have not learned vital lessons and that all too often holidaymakers suffer illness, sometimes with life changing consequences due to inadequate health and hygiene standards. 'We want the general public to be safe while on holiday and we urge the travel industry to clean up its act and take all possible steps to prevent illnesses which can so easily be avoided.' All the companies involved have been contacted for comment, but had not responded by the time of publication. Following Thomas Cook's settlement with customers in 2009, a spokesman for the company said the company it insists on high standards at its partner hotels. The spokesman said: 'We take all reports of illness very seriously and we were very concerned by the outbreak of sickness that took place at the Bahia Principe in 2007. 'We are pleased that the majority of legal cases have now been settled and we want to be able to reassure all our customers that we work with our hotel partners to continually monitor the hygiene standards in their properties.'","First Choice, Thomas Cook, My Travel and Thomson all made settlements .

After 112 years, a stint as a summer house, and a home for pet mice, this horse-drawn tram will soon be carrying passengers for the first time since the Victorian era. The double-decker 'Leeds horse car 107', built in 1898, has been painstakingly renovated after more than a century out of use. The tram, which was being used as a garden summerhouse until the 1970s, was transformed back to its former glory by 10 volunteers from the Leeds Transport Historical Society (LTHS). This Leeds horse drawn tram was built in 1898 and ended life as derelict summer house. It has now undergone a painstaking renovation to restore it to its former glory . The car ran until 1901 when a new bridge was opened to road traffic and the electric cars were able to run . It took the team eight years to get the contraption, which went out of service the year Queen Victoria  died, running again. Now their meticulous restoration is going on display over the Bank Holiday weekend where horses will be used to carry passengers for the first time since 1901. The tram, which carried 34 passengers along the tramways in Leeds, West Yorkshire, was shut down when a new bridge was opened to road traffic before being carefully converted to a static mess hut for the council Highways Department. In the 1920s, the carbody was declared redundant by the Highways Department and was given to a council employee for use as a summerhouse. It was then moved to a garden in the East End Park area of Leeds. At one point, the owner's nephew and his wife lived in the car until the 1970s. It was fitted out with a stove and given several coats of paint to keep it weatherproof. The tram was then carefully converted to a static mess hut for the council Highways Department . In the 1920's, the carbody was declared redundant by the Highways Department and was given to a council employee for use as a summerhouse . The house then changed hands and the Wilson family became the owners. Their sons used the car as a home for their collection of pet mice. The car body was seen by LTHS member Alex Brown and was identified as the last remaining Leeds Horse Car. The Society negotiated with the Wilsons who generously donated the car to the Society. The labour of love was initially salvaged by the society in 1977, and the car was then placed in a garage, where it stayed for another 28 years. The 20ft long and 7ft tall tram, which cost £45,000 to restore to its former glory, will go on display at Middleton Railway in Leeds .

Project manager Jamie Guest, 60, of Leeds, said: 'It's quite a momentous occasion - it's the last remaining Leeds horse tram. 'The bodies of other trams would have been sold off as storage sheds and the scrap metal recycled. 'When . I first saw it at the back of a garage covered in blue paint as just a . shed, even then I felt it wanted something doing to it.

A church organist was battered to death with a pickaxe handle by two laughing killers as he walked to midnight mass on Christmas Eve, a court heard yesterday. Alan Greaves, 68, had his head and face smashed to pieces in the ‘motiveless’ beating and was left for dead on the pavement. The devoted family man had simply been in the wrong place at the wrong time when he bumped into Jonathan Bowling and Ashley Foster – who were out looking for a random target, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Alan Greaves, a popular church organist, suffered 'unsurvivable' head injuries in the attack . Jonathan Bowling, 22, who has already admitted murdering Mr Greaves . Robert Smith, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘These two men were walking the streets looking for a suitable victim. ‘If it had not been Mr Greaves it would have been someone else. ‘They both intended to inflict really serious bodily harm to Mr Greaves and that was exactly what was done to him.’ The 22-year-olds went out in the High . Green area of Sheffield armed with a pickaxe handle and a hammer or . similar weapon after spending hours drinking lager and Bacardi and Coke, . said Mr Smith. CCTV footage showed them following Mr Greaves closely as . he walked to St Saviour’s Church, where he had played the organ for . more than 40 years. The pair then started to run at him before launching an attack at a dimly-lit spot near a park, the court heard. But the motive was not robbery as their victim’s briefcase was left and his pockets not searched, the jury was told. Mr Greaves, a grandfather and father . of four, was found by a delivery driver a short time later with . ‘catastrophic’ head injuries. He died three days later in hospital. The suspected killers ran off through the park and Mr Smith told jurors that witnesses heard them ‘laughing together’. When police later released CCTV . footage taken of two suspects near the scene, friends and relatives of . the men – described as ‘virtually brothers’ – recognised them. Foster . was ‘faced with no choice’ but to hand himself in at a police station, . jurors were told. Mr Greaves was attacked yards from St Saviour's Church in High Green, Sheffield, where he was organist . Alan Greaves and his wife Maureen (pictured) lived in the same suburb as Ashley Foster . Following his arrest he blamed Bowling for the killing, telling detectives he only witnessed the crime. However, Mr Smith said both men ‘were . in this together’, causing injuries to Mr Greaves similar to those seen . in road crash victims. His skull and the bones in his face . were fractured by ‘prolonged’ blows with two weapons – causing . ‘unsurvivable’ head and brain injuries, said Mr Smith. A pickaxe handle . allegedly used in the assault was later found by police at an address . linked to Bowling. Foster is said to have approached a . police officer near the scene four days after the killing and said the . crime was a ‘disgrace’ and he hoped whoever was responsible would get . ‘hammered in prison for beating up an old man’. Foster, who lived in the same suburb . of Sheffield as Mr Greaves and his wife Maureen, also allegedly told an . officer he would ‘grass up’ the killers if he knew who they were. After the CCTV footage was released, . he claimed Bowling threatened to ‘torture and kill’ him and his children . if he told the police what had happened, the court heard. Foster told police in a statement he . was ‘just a witness’ and Bowling had battered the victim. ‘I didn’t . anticipate he would suddenly assault a complete stranger,’ he told . detectives. The prosecution insist Foster is equally guilty. Mr Smith said Mr Greaves ‘loved music and his life was surrounded by it’. He played piano at a primary school . and was involved in a local choir, he said. On Christmas Eve last year . he followed his usual routine of leaving home on foot to church. But he . was ‘never to return home’, added Mr Smith. Bowling has admitted murder, while Foster denies the charge. His trial continues.

In a resort once wildly popular with British tourists, sun beds lie empty, restaurant tables are disturbed only by the wind and pristine beaches are eerily silent. This time last year the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt was heaving with holidaymakers keen to enjoy the tail end of the summer, but fears over the escalating violence in the country are driving sun-seekers away. The turmoil that has wracked Cairo has not affected the Red Sea destinations – such as Sharm El Sheikh, Taba and Dahab - and Egyptian military personnel have . been stationed at the key holiday resort of Sharm El Sheikh as the the bodies mount in Cairo. Take your pick: Holidaymakers are shunning Red Sea resorts like Sharm El Sheikh because of the violence in Egypt . Empty: A once-bustling restaurant is empty of customers as the military and supporters of ousted President Morsi clash . But the security presence at Sharm El . Sheikh’s airport – the main point of arrival for visitors heading to the . region – has done little to reassure skittish tourists. The escalating crisis in Egypt - where authorities today continued their crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood and its allies by arresting two more high-profile Islamist figures - has led to the deaths of more than 850 people - including 70 policemen and soldiers. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) reports that soldiers have also been positioned at the entrance to the resort portion of Sharm El Sheikh, and at the exit to the resort area of Dahab. Routine security checks are also being performed on entry into the airport, and police are carrying out vehicle checks in and around Sharm El Sheikh. The more southerly Red Sea resort of Hurghada witnessed clashes linked to the political storm on 14 August – although in an area away from tourist resorts. One man was killed. Quiet: The FCO is still not ruling out travel to Sharm El Sheikh, but soldiers have been placed at the airport . Looming fears: These sun loungers should all be filled, but many lie empty . The FCO stresses that the situation in the Red Sea holiday spots remains stable. 'There . have been no violent protests in the South Sinai resorts during recent . disturbances in Egypt,' a statement says. 'The resorts remain calm.' The . FCO is also maintaining its stance that British holidaymakers are safe . to travel to the Red Sea areas, even though other nations have altered . their advice to citizens. Germany has joined a growing band of concerned countries in warning against travel to the Red Sea resorts – joining the USA, Sweden and Finland in urging caution. The FCO’s stance leaves British holidaymakers and travel agents in limbo. Muslim Brotherhood leaders warned of further protests as security forces clamped down . Worried tourists who decide to cancel their trip cannot claim a refund from their operator because the government has not ruled against 'all but essential travel' to the Red Sea. Equally, tour operators are concerned, because bookings have dropped significantly since the current crisis in the country – sparked by the removal of president Mohammed Morsi and his replacement by an interim military government on 3 July – began. 'Let’s face it, nobody wants to book a holiday and then have it cancelled at the last minute due to possible danger, because it then means that you’ve got a problem trying to find something to substitute, and, of course it’s likely to be rather more expensive,' Steve Pattenden – the owner of Double S Travel in Luton – has told Travel Trade Gazette. 'It is better for us as a travel agency to recommend somewhere other than Egypt until things start quietening down a bit.' Unstable: Egypt has been wracked by demonstrations and violence since Mohammed Morsi was deposed . Adventure travel specialist Explore has gone further, cancelling all tours to Egypt for the rest of 2013. The company has little choice – many of its itineraries focus on the history and culture of the country, and with the FCO currently advising against all but essential travel to most of Egypt, Explore has been left in a difficult position. 'The vast majority of clients were happy we have made the decision in good time for them to rearrange,” operations director John Telfer told Travelmole. 'Clients want some certainty – which is one of the reasons that we need to make the decision about cancellation about three months in advance. 'Cancelling until the end of December is a clean psychological break – it gets rid of Christmas and the New Year. I’m very happy with the decision we’ve made.'","Pictures show abandoned beaches and restaurants in Red Sea resort .

The skinny: New York City's narrowest house, which is 9.5 feet wide and 30 feet deep, has found a buyer . It may only be 8ft 4 inches wide, but one of New York's thinnest houses has sold for $3.25million dollars. While the three story town house may not seem value for money with a measly 990 square foot of space in all. But this home has a history. The property, on Bedford Street in Greenwich Village, is where playwright and poet Edna St Vincent Millay wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning Ballad Of The Harp-Weaver in the early 1920s. Since Ms Millay vacated the property, a host of other celebrities have lived at the property including actors John Barrymore and Cary Grant. Other well-known former residents of the house, which has become something of an attraction on the tourist trail, include children's writer Ann McGovern and anthropologist Margaret Meade. The house even inspired Ms McGovern, who lived there for seven years, to write Mr Skinner's Skinny House, a children's book about a man who struggles to find someone to live with him in the city's thinnest house. She said on her website: 'Once I saw a man who was standing in front of the house with arms outstretched. ‘""Hey,"" he said. ""I’m as big as a house,"" and he was.' Despite its tiny size, the house boasts three bedrooms, two baths, four wood burning fireplaces and a secret garden. A narrow spiral staircase runs through the house. It was originally built by its neighbor around 1850, simply to fill in a carriage entrance way that led to the stables behind the property. Since then, it has served as a shoemaker's shop and a candy factory, before being transformed for residential use. The now-legendary skinny house, which is a regular attraction on New York walking tours, came close to demolition in 1950, before a lawyer stepped in to save it and its neighbors from being razed. Pickle in the middle: 75 1/2 Bedford Street is swamped by its normal-sized neighbors . Home sweet home: The kitchen, which has modern appliances and marble tabletops, looks out onto the large, narrow back garden which is 42 feet long and nearly ten feet wide . Notable residents: The three-story townhouse is legendary for its size and its famous past inhabitants, which include actors Cary Grant and John Barrymore, poet Edna St Vincent Millay and anthropologist Margaret Mead . Greenery: A private balcony in the master bathroom look onto the back garden, which dates back to 1850 . It was sold for $2.175million in 2010 before being put on the market for nearly double - $4.3million - after a renovation in 2011. The asking price was cut to $3.495 last year. A description of house on the Town Real Estate website, where the house was listed, says: 'The Millay House exemplifies the artistic heritage and cultural fabric of this fabled neighborhood. 'The residence has just been meticulously renovated with beautiful modern finishes, yet retains its original character and pedigree.' It continues: 'Whether cozying up by the fireplace or enjoying the garden as a summer respite, this is truly a house for all seasons.' Design: Photos of the one-of-a-kind home, which is a regular attraction on many New York walking tours, show its sleek interiors, with exposed beams and large French windows .

The mother of Trayvon Martin spoke out Sunday against the stop-and-frisk police practice in New York City, saying neither police nor civilians have the right to stop someone because of their race.Critics say the stops target black and Hispanic people who aren't doing anything wrong. Earlier this week, a judge told New York City that its policy was racial discrimination. The city plans to appeal. 'You can't give people the authority, whether civilian or police officers, the right to just stop somebody because of the color of their skin,' Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton said on NBC's Meet the Press. Bereaved: Sybrina Fulton appeared on NBC's Meet the Press to speak out against the stop-and-frisk policy that she says is racial profiling . Victim: Trayvon Martin was fatally shot by self-appointed neighborhood watch rep George Zimmerman as he walked home last year in what supporters say was a case of racial profiling . Over the past decade, New York police have stopped, questioned and sometimes patted down about five million people; 87 per cent were black or Hispanic. About 10 per cent of the stops spur an arrest or summons. Police find weapons a fraction of the time. Race based: Here, plain clothes police detectives search suspects on the street in Harlem, New York City, as part of the police department's stop-and-frisk practice . Racial targeting: Fulton's lawyer Benjamin Crump (right) said that the stop-and-frisk policy targets people based on the color of their skin . Fulton's attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the stop-and-frisk policy targeted people by race and noted it was still being used as the 50th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 'I have a dream' speech approached.'It actually takes us away from his poignant words of, ""I dreamed my children would be judged by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin,""' Crump said. Healing: Sybrina Fulton is trying to create positive action following her son's death by fighting against gun violence . Fulton has said neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman 'got away with murder' in the 2012 killing of her son, largely because of Florida's self-defense law.Protesters had been occupying part of the Capitol in Tallahassee, calling for an examination of the Florida law since Zimmerman was acquitted last month. Zimmerman claimed self-defense in shooting the 17-year-old Martin during a fight; Martin's supporters say Zimmerman profiled and followed him because Martin was black.","Sybrina Fulton, mother of slain teen Trayvon Martin spoke out against New York's stop-and-frisk policy .

Ivan Marcano, 27, got down on one knee to propose to girlfriend Hilda Molina, 25, as they attended Shakespeare in the Park on Saturday - 10 months after she witnessed him being shot in the chest. The nearly 2,000 spectators gave the couple a standing ovation after Marcano presented the diamond and sapphire ring - and Molina, who is six months pregnant, promptly accepted. 'She's been there through thick and thin,' Marcano told the New York Daily News. 'Through the tears, I heard a ""yes"".' Romantic: An instagram picture shows the moment hero NYPD cop Ivan Marcano proposed to his girlfriend Hilda Molina during a performance at Shakespeare in the Park on Saturday night . She added: 'I was crying like a baby. I'm very excited. It's every girl's dream come true.' The proposal was witnessed by 20 relatives and friends, including Marcano's mother and step-father. He said the idea came to him as he watched the company's 'Comedy of Errors' earlier this summer. His brother, Victor, had helped with the big surprise by contacting Shakespeare in the Park and asking if Marcano could pop the question after Saturday's performance of Love's Labour's Lost. After the play, Marcano was introduced and called to the stage where he said, 'I'm one hell of a lucky guy', before calling up his girlfriend to the stage. Celebrated: Marcano and his now fiancee are pictured with Police Commissioner Ray Kelly in April . 'I loved him before that happened,' Molina said of the shooting. 'It brought us closer together.

The happy news comes 10 months after Marcano, who was off-duty, was driving near Bronx Community COllege with his girlfriend when he spotted two men apparently robbing a cab driver. After getting out of his car and showing his credentials, Mr Marcano was shot in the chest. Despite sustaining injury, he managed to follow one of the suspects, eventually shooting him dead.

Irritating pains in her head were just something Zoe Spain had learned to live with, ever since falling off her horse in 2008. And in October 2011 - having just competed in the British Cross Triathlon Championships at Hawley Lake in Surrey - the personal trainer and a triathlon coach, 29, felt like fitness personified. But that month Zoe, from Surrey, would be given the devastating news that she not only had cancer, but that there was a tumour the size of a satsuma growing on top of her spine, just beneath her brain. Over the next year Zoe would undergo surgery that involved her face being cut in half to remove the tumour, followed by gruelling radiotherapy. Yet nothing has stopped the sports fanatic; having now made a full recovery she is back at the top of her athletics game and determined to one day compete for Great Britain. Personal trainer and triathlete Zoe Spain, 29, from Surrey, was diagnosed with cancer in October 2011, and as soon as she was given the all-clear she signed up for the London Marathon . Zoe now, left, and when she was in hospital undergoing treatment for cancer in 2011 and 2012, right . Speaking to Jessica Bradley in Triathlon Plus magazine, Zoe said: 'I'll never forget the life-changing moment when my doctor told me I had cancer. 'I was so young and had so many things I still wanted to do with my life. So many dreams that I had yet to fulfil. I felt so helpless, lost and alone. I just cried - I thought I was going to die.' At the time of her horse riding accident Zoe had had an MRI scan, but doctors missed the tumour and Zoe continued to control the pain using painkillers and private physiotherapy treatments. But eventually a trip to an NHS doctor flagged up the tumour. 'Weirdly, my tongue was the big giveaway: whenever I stuck it out, it used to rotate 90 degrees to the left. It was normal to me, but the nurse seemed pretty shocked and gave me a CT scan.' When doctors informed her about the satsuma-sized tumour Zoe says the hardest part was not being told whether she would live or die. No one knew. 'I was so young and had so many things I still wanted to do with my life. So many dreams that I had yet to fulfil. I felt so helpless, lost and alone. I just cried - I thought I was going to die' Over the next year, Zoe underwent two major operations to remove the tumour - the first of which involved cutting her face in half to access the huge lump. 'Thankfully my face didn't look too bad after the operation, and I was just grateful I was alive,' she said. After a second operation fluid began leaking out of her spine - which would have been potentially lethal if it reached her brain - so surgeons had to insert a drain in her back, leaving her in agonising pain and unable to walk for a month. Eight weeks of radiotherapy followed, sapping Zoe of all her energy, but in July 2012 she was finally given the all-clear... and immediately signed herself up for the London Marathon to raise money for Children with Cancer. 'Life may seem awful but tomorrow is . another day and you'll get through it. Life is precious and you really . don't know when your time will be up, so it's importortant to make every . day count' 'Sport is my solace, my savinggrace,' she said. 'I needed a new focus. Cancer had consumed my life for the previous 18 months and I wanted something to look forward to. I guess I wanted to test my body again, too.' Zoe finished the marathon in 4:20 and raised over £5,000. 'I was so emotional when I crossed the finish line,' she says. 'I couldn't believe that just 10 months previously I couldn't walk. It just goes to prove that anything really is possible.' Zoe, who is soon getting married, is now determined to qualify as an age-grouper for the Xterra WorldChampionship and represent Great Britain. And her advice for young sportsmen? 'Never give up,' she says. 'Life may seem awful but tomorrow is another day and you'll get through it.

BBC Scotland newsreader Sally Magnusson had an on-air meltdown yesterday after the lunchtime news bulletin descended into chaos. A series of technical hitches hit Reporting Scotland’s afternoon programme leaving the experienced presenter in a flap. Her nightmare began when a live link to reporter Phil Goodlad at the Open Golf championship at Muirfield broke midway through. Scroll down for video . Something is amiss: The news reader awkwardly shuffles her notes after technical hitches start to plague the show . Newsreader Sally Magnusson was left without any information and news segments that were meant to play failed to materialise. She began to look embarrassed about the blunders . Then a pre-recorded report about an exhibition by artist Ken Currie wouldn’t start. Sally went on to introduce a story about new Andy Murray stamps to celebrate his Wimbledon victory. However the screen then flashed to stills of Ken Currie and his new exhibition. Magnusson, 57, struggled to contain her composure and burst into laughter as production workers scrambled to fix the blunders. Pressure: The experienced newsreader shakes her fists at the frustrating delays . Blowing her top: Magnusson shouts at the end of the broadcast as it all gets too much. But viewers felt she handled the situation with good humour . She told viewers: 'Oh, it’s a wee bit of a dog’s breakfast. 'I do apologise. Let me wait for instructions. I think we are going to go.... 'They’re having a little argument behind me. They’ll tell me what they want me to do.' The exasperated host’s autocue also seemed to be playing up and at the end of the five-minute bulletin, she threw her hands in the air and let out a scream. Twitter user Tom Leslie said: 'Tom Leslie added: 'Poor Sally Magnusson - she coped well with the lunchtime Reporting Scotland falling apart' However, she won sympathy from viewers for her handling of the situation . On Twitter, James Christie wrote: 'Sally Magnusson on BBC Scotland just showed why it’s useful to have an experienced anchor when the news disintegrates into technical chaos.' Pamela Dobbie posted: 'Hilarious lunchtime #reportingscotland...think #sallymagnusson will be killing somebody in editorial around now!' Tom Leslie added: 'Poor Sally Magnusson - she coped well with the lunchtime Reporting Scotland falling apart.' Sally, the daughter of the late Mastermind host Magnus Magnusson, began her broadcasting career on BBC’s Breakfast Time in the 1980s. Today's comedy of errors is not the first time technical problems have hit Reporting Scotland. In 2011, presenter Catriona Shearer introduced the weather report - and footage of Adolf Hitler’s deputy Rudolf Hess ranting at a Nazi rally popped up instead. That fiasco followed a piece about the 70th anniversary of Rudolf Hess’ landing in Scotland, which showed a picture of the Scots Christian missionary Mary Gardner, killed in a Jerusalem bomb blast in March. And in 2008, BBC workers were warned about making for obscene gestures behind newsreaders’ backs on air. Beeb bosses took action after eagle-eyed viewers started complaining about seeing staff pulling dodgy hand signals during Reporting Scotland trailers.

Then brace yourself for the funniest joke of this year’s Edinburgh Fringe Festival... It comes courtesy of little-known stand-up comedian Rob Auton and goes: ‘I heard a rumour that Cadbury is bringing out an oriental chocolate bar. Could be a Chinese Wispa.’ His one-liner hit a spot with voters in a public poll and secured him first place ahead of the efforts of more famous funny men including Tim Vine and Marcus Brigstocke. Scroll down to watch . Winner: Rob Auton's joke won the fans' vote at this year's Edinburgh Fringe . Actor and comedian Vine, who is best known from the sitcom Not Going Out and is the brother of broadcaster Jeremy Vine, could only manage fourth place with: ‘My friend told me he was going to a fancy dress party as an Italian island. I said to him ‘Don’t be Sicily’.’ Brigstocke, a regular on TV panel shows like Have I Got News For You and QI, scraped seventh with: ‘You know you are fat when you hug a child and it gets lost.’ Former paintbrush salesman Auton, 30, from York, who has been doing stand-up since 2008, won almost a quarter of the votes (2,570) in the annual Funniest Joke of the Fringe award, run by the television channel Dave. A panel of judges sat through hours of material at 60 shows at the festival before drawing up a short-list of 20 jokes which were then put to the public vote. Auton said: ‘I’m honoured to receive this award and just pleased that a joke that tackles the serious issue of the invention of a new chocolate bar can be laughed at by the people of Britain.’ Comedy gold: Tim Vine, left, made it back into the top 10 having won last year and Nick Helm, right, won for his Snow White and the Seven Dwarves joke . Second place went to Alex Horne with: ‘I used to work in a shoe-recycling shop. It was sole-destroying.’ Alfie Moore came third with: ‘I’m in a same-sex marriage... the sex is always the same’ - proving a touch of ‘Carry On’-style sauciness can still tickle Britons’ fancy. Perhaps the most cerebral, and certainly the shortest, gag came from Liam Williams: ‘The universe implodes. No matter’ - but that only managed eighth place. There was also a list of shame, featuring the worst jokes in the judges’ opinion. These included: ‘I thought ex-pats were people who used to be called Pat’, and: ‘My wife said to me recently, ‘Do you fancy going gay clubbing?’ I said, ‘No, it sounds violent’.’ Tim Vine also featured among the groanworthy gags with: ‘I once did a gig in a zoo. I got babooned off.’ Previous winners of the funniest joke award, now in its sixth year, include Dan Antopolski for: ‘Hedgehogs. Why can’t they just share the hedge?’ and Nick Helm for: ‘I needed a password eight characters long so I picked Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.’","Former paintbrush salesman Rob Auton from York told funniest joke .

Nursery owner Dusty Beesley, 81, has challenged the country's ambitious gardeners to top his mammoth hanging basket, saying: 'If anyone can come up with anything bigger then I'd like to see it.' Mr Beesley threw down the gauntlet today when his 5.5-tonne plant was hoisted into the air. The hanging basket contains more than 2,500 plants and measures 21 feet wide and ten feet deep. The keen gardener, who owns a nursery in Ravenstone, Leicestershire, started making giant arrangements in 2001 to celebrate his golden wedding anniversary with his wife Betty. If Mr Beesley wants to tend the basket he has to be hoisted 20 feet into the air while standing inside the bucket of a digger. To create the floral arramgement, he buried an H- shaped girder in the ground which he buried in four metres of concrete. The basket is made from steel greenhouse hoops suspended by chains held together with a central pin. Mr Beesley said: 'When you're inside It does move and it gives a funny sensation. Its a bit like being at sea. 'I tried to get the basket in to the Guinness Book of World Records but I was told they don't do records for these. 'So I've decided I'm going to claim the UK record because I've not heard of anyone who's got a bigger basket than mine.' The basket has raised almost £20,000 for charities over the years, as people pay to guess the number of flowers in the basket. This year money will go to prostate cancer charities. The giant basket is planted up with begonias, fuschias, geraniums, marigolds and pansies and is watered by an automatic sprinkler system twice a day. Flower power: The 5.5-tonne basket is supported by a beam that has been buried in four feet of concrete. The basket is made from steel greenhouse hoops suspended by chains .

First-time buyers are being priced out of the areas where they grew up by a North-South divide on property values. Just one in 10 homes in parts of the south are within financial reach of people on average local wages trying to get on the property ladder. But further north in areas like Hull, Middlesbrough and Bradford where up to 80 per cent of houses are within budget. Divide: First-time buyers struggle to get on the property ladder in the south but many more homes are within their reach in the north, according to a survey . The survey by search engine Adzuna.co.uk showed that Chichester in West Sussex is the least affordable place in the UK. Only 11 per cent of properties are considered affordable, assuming joint mortgage multiple of 2.75 times average salaries and a 25 per cent deposit. With so few houses available to first-time buyers, many are forced to move to cheaper areas. A couple earning an average wage in Chichester could afford more than half of properties in Portsmouth 30 miles away or 40 per cent of homes in Bournemouth, 60 miles down the road, the survey found. Andrew Hunter, of Adzuna, said: ‘With rates of pay falling and property prices rising, it's clear that homes in Britain are becoming less affordable and that we are in a renters' not a buyers' market.’ The most affordable cities for house-hunters are almost exclusively in the North, with average prices of around £125,000 in Hull, Middlesbrough and Bradford, 2.2 times an average couple's earnings. Chichester, Oxford and Guildford were found to be the least affordable places in the country, while properties in Ipswich, Cambridge and Wolverhampton have become more unaffordable in the past year than in any part of the UK. Lending to first-time buyers has hit its largest quarterly total since 2007 with 68,200 purchasing their first home in the second quarter of 2013 . House price increases were higher for people buying their first home than for those already on the property ladder . Young . buyers are crucial for a thriving housing market, with sales to this . group acting as a trigger for purchases all the way up the property ladder. However, house prices are rising faster for first-time buyers than for those people already on the property ladder.

In an interview conducted for an upcoming documentary film about the 2012 terror attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya at the consulate in Benghazi, Florida Senator Marco Rubio slams then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her agency's failure to protect Americans assets in the turmoil-prone North African country. If she runs for president, he warns, she will have to explain what happened and how her agency failed. 'I think that ultimately, if Secretary . Clinton runs for office in the future,' Rubio says, 'she is going to have to explain . why, during her helm at the State Department, one of two things . happened.' 'Either, number 1, they were aware of a security situation in . Libya and failed to act accordingly, or, number 2, they had such a bad . operation that they were not aware of it.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . In a segment released by the filmmakers, Rubio predicts that Hillary Clinton's performance as Secretary of State in the wake of the Benghazi attack will present a barrier to her presidential aspirations . In congressional testimony, Hillary Clinton said she never handled security requests for the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya. But the Republicans' report found a diplomatic cable that indicates otherwise . The film, titled Benghazi 9.11, also includes interviews with Arizona Senator John McCain and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. All three are Republicans. 'They're stonewalling us,' Graham says of the State Department in the movie trailer. The trailer also features Rubio calling Obama administration's failure to produce information to Congress an 'outrageous effort to not allow us' in the Senate 'to see the full record' on the terror attack. Republican members of Congress have also been critical of the administration for not allowing survivors of the attack, who number more than 100, to testify on Capitol Hill or talk to lawmakers. On Tuesday, House Republican leaders of five congressional committees released a scathing 46-page report castigating the Obama administration for its performance in Benghazi before and after the Sept. 11, 2012 attack. The report singles out Clinton for a special level of scorn, accusing her of facilitating a government coverup. The ranking Democratic members of the five committees wrote to House Speaker John Boehner and urged him to withdraw what they said was a 'partisan report.' 'You are unnecessarily politicizing our national security,' they wrote. In the report, Republicans allege that the administration scrubbed references to al Qaeda from talking points about the Benghazi attack without justification, in order to protect Obama in the middle of an election campaign from allegations that he wasn't adequately protect American interests for terrorists. White House officials and their State Department counterparts 'altered accurate talking points drafted by the intelligence community in order to protect the State Department,' according to the report. An armed group of Libyan terrorists attacked the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on Sept 11, 2012. On Tuesday a group of Republican House committee chairman blamed the Clinton-led State Department . The report quotes e-mails from State Department officials just three days after the attack which expressed worries that earlier drafts of the talking points had already been circulated. Comparisons between the two drafts, the emails conceded, could cause 'serious concerns' in the White House that lawmakers would dress down the State Department for 'not paying attention to agency warnings' about security threats to the Benghazi consulate. The White House has said it removed the references in order to prevent the release of classified information from compromising the FBI's investigation into the attack, but the Republicans' report said there was no evidence to support that claim. 'There were no concerns about protecting classified information in the email traffic,' the report says. U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in the Benghazi attack. The Obama administration originally claimed the terrorist attackers were protesters angered by a low-budget film that lampooned the Muslim prophet Muhammad . It also described a diplomatic cable that Clinton signed on April 19, 2012, proposing to reduce security at the State Department's facilities in Libya, including the one in Benghazi. The cable 'acknowledged then- [Ghana] Ambassador [Gene] Cretz' formal request for additional security assets but ordered the withdrawal of security elements to proceed as planned.' In her January 23, 2012 testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Clinton claimed she never personally handled security requests that impacted Benghazi . 'I didn't see those requests,' she told the House committee. 'They didn't come to me. I didn't approve them. I didn't deny them.' Clinton has been rumored as a possible Democratic presidential candidate since her retirement from the State Department on February 1. WATCH THE MOVIE TRAILER .

This is despite Network Rail missing all of its passenger train punctuality targets in 2012-13 and being warned by watchdogs that it is steaming towards a £75million fine by Spring next year over fears it will miss future targets for long distance services. Pay day: Network Rail bosses are in line for millions of pounds in extra bonuses by 2015 under a deal agreed today . Angry critics and unions condemned the bonuses as 'rewards for failure' and 'a gravy train', branding the five top directors of the taxpayer-funded track operator 'fat controllers' presiding over crowded trains, late-running services and inflation-busting fares. The five directors' income is made up of three distinct pots - their annual salaries, their annual bonuses, and a 'long term incentive' payment paid at the end of three years and worth a maximum of a full-year's salary. The total potential bonuses might have been closer to £6million, but the directors were docked up to £1million from their annual bonuses last year because they failed to hit some targets. The new long term bonus element- worth £2million alone - was rubber-stamped at Network Rail's annual general meeting in Cardiff. It was voted on by Network Rail's 44 'members' - the company's equivalent to shareholders - whose job is to hold the board to account. However, as a company limited by guarantee, Network Rail's members do not have any financial interest in the company. It means that over three years: . The annual bonuses pays bosses up to 60per cent of their salary provided they meet targets on punctuality as well as train company and passenger satisfaction. But with these targets missed last year, executives received just 17 per cent rather than the maximum 60 per cent of salary. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association's (TSSA) described the bonus vote as 'rewarding failure' amid concerns about service punctuality, rising train fares and a number of rail-related deaths. Cash: Network Rail chief executive David Higgins (left) is on track for £3.1million over three years while Simon Kirby, managing director of infrastructure projects, could receive £1.9million . TSSA's general secretary Manuel Cortes said the union was 'bitterly disappointed' by the plan: 'Once again public members of Network Rail have put the interests of bosses ahead of passengers. These bosses will be on board a very lucrative gravy train while the poor passengers pay through the nose with annual above-inflation fare rises.' But Network Rail defended the bonuses and said they would only be achieved - in part or in full - if 'tough' targets were met. Last year, following political pressure, bosses waived a bonus package and instead allocated their windfall to a safety improvement programme - which has seen Network Rail placed in the spotlight following a series of high profile incidents. Earlier this year, Network Rail was handed a £450,000 fine for failing to ensure the safety of 52-year-old Jane Harding killed who was killed when her car was hit by a train at a level crossing in Herefordshire, in January 2010. Network Rail 's Australian-born chief executive Mr Higgins told members at its annual meeting that 750 crossings had been closed noting: 'In my opinion the only good level crossing is a closed one.' Mr Higgins also conceded that more could have been done to prevent the death of 26-year-old rail worker Scott Dobson, who died after being hit by a train near Lincoln last December. TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes condemned the 'unfair' long-term bonus scheme . Before the vote TSSA union general secretary Manuel Cortes wrote to the voting members urging them to reject the 'generous' but 'unfair' long-term bonus scheme. He told them: 'Long term and annual bonuses could produce total bonus payments of £5.8million in the three years ending in April 2015. That huge amount would be on top of an annual salary bill of some £6million for the same period for the same five executives, giving potential total earnings of over £11 million between the period 2012 and 2015.' He noted: 'We regard those sort of payments at a tax payer funded infrastructure firm as wholly wrong, especially in view of the executives missed punctuality targets and safety record in recent years.' Network Rail said the long term bonus is 'to recognise outstanding and exceptional performance over the three years to 2015.' It said any future awards will be measured against train performance, savings made for the taxpayer and the successful delivery of congestion easing projects. Network Rail chairman Richard Parry-Jones, who does not receive any bonuses said: 'Network Rail executives are rewarded only when exceptional performance exceeds tough targets, which have been approved by our members through an open and transparent process. 'If targets are not met, or safety comprised, no bonuses are made.' He insisted the firm had made exceptional progress over the past 12 months with passenger numbers rising to 1.5 billion and £4.4billion worth of improvement on 'Victorian' rail network. The long-term bonus plan targets include: taxpayer savings (50% of total), train performance and punctuality (25% of total), and its management of capital projects (25% of total). Network Rail said: 'Under the scheme, pay-outs would commence at 25% of annual salary if performance was deemed to have exceeded expectations using the above measures.'","Controversial new incentive scheme for five top executives .

Apple's current iPad Mini has a 7.9-inch 1024x768 resolution screen - this gives the tablet's screen 163 pixels per inch (PPI). By comparison, Google's new Nexus 7 has a PPI of 216 and Apple's 9.7-inch iPad with Retina Display has 264 PPI. The lower resolution screens on the current iPad Mini are supplied by LG and Taiwan's Au Optronics. For its upcoming device, component manufacturers in Asia have reportedly been told Apple is planning to use screens from Samsung, LG and Sharp. The move is aimed at fending off increasing competition from Google, which recently revealed its new Nexus 7 tablet, which has a high resolution screen. The device runs the new Android 4.3, has a 7-inch, high-resolution display, a 5MP camera and will cost £150 when it goes on sale on 25 August .

The move comes as Apple faces increased competition in the tablet market. Apple still sells more tablets than any other manufacturer, although its overall market share has dropped and Google's Android-based devices now dominate, with 62.6 per cent share of the market in the second quarter of 2013, compared to just 38 per cent of the market in the same period last year, new data from International Data Corporation shows. However, Apple still calls the shots, even though its market share declined rapidly to 32.5 per cent from 60.3 per cent, according to IDC. Experts say the release of a new iPad could boost the tablet market as a whole. ‘A new iPad launch always piques consumer interest in the tablet category and traditionally has helped both Apple and its competitors, said Tom Mainelli, a research director at the International Data Corporation. ‘With no new iPads, the market slowed for many vendors, and that’s likely to continue into the third quarter.

Sunday night’s legal drama Law & Order: UK conjures images of pulsating glamour, where barristers duel with words across hallowed courtrooms. They are defending the very fabric of civilisation, even as they’re falling in love with their bitterest opponents. Here’s the reality, on The Briefs (ITV): a bearded solicitor in a horsehair wig sucks at a ciggie on the steps of a magistrates’ court in Manchester. Not so glamorous: The Briefs offers viewers an insight into British justice from the perspective of the defence . Ahalf-smile of weariness flickers through the fag smoke — he’s seen it all, and he knows there’s not a shred of romance anywhere in the system. It’s a tawdry, depressing treadmill. Nearly three-quarters of the defendants who get legal aid from law firm Tuckers are repeat offenders. Some of them return dozens of times: one youth on a charge of armed robbery has been a Tuckers client since he was 11 — ten years later, he was ready for his 36th court appearance. He didn’t seem to think he had done anything wrong, though his solicitor reproved him: ‘If you brandish an  axe in a public place, that would constitute a breach of your Asbo.’ The youth walked free, because Tuckers stirred up confusion about his identity. Afterwards, the solicitor, dragging hard on his cigarette, muttered something about the burden of proof. He had got his client off, but he didn’t look proud of it. Legal aid work looks soul-destroying: this programme certainly was. We met a professional thief called Alex who was furiously indignant to be charged with a crime that, for once, he hadn’t committed. Accused of criminal damage, Alex’s self-righteous defence was clear-cut: ‘I am a thief, right, and if I’m going to do something, I’m going to do it for financial purposes.’ To hear Alex tell it, he was a modern-day Robin Hood who, under this unjust accusation, had become the British Nelson Mandela. The courts sent him on his way, presumably to burgle more businesses. To the perma-tanned senior partner at Tuckers, Franklin Sinclair, revving into the court car-park in his open-top sports car, repeat clients were meat and drink. Food for thought: We spend £2.4 billion annually on biscuits, Britain's Favourite Supermarket Foods presenter Cherry Healey informed us . Sinclair was full of praise for one regular, a fat scar-faced yob called Kyle who was constantly getting into fights. ‘He’s the perfect client,’ Sinclair insisted. ‘He takes our advice and he’s never any trouble.’ The courts disagreed after 23-year-old Kyle threatened a police officer with a knife. Kyle’s defence, that a friend had dropped the knife and Kyle had picked it up for safekeeping, perhaps wasn’t their most watertight. Kyle got four-and-a-half years. If the statistics for repeat crime in Manchester were grim, the figures trotted out on Britain’s Favourite Supermarket Foods (BBC1) were wholly head-spinning. As a nation, we drink 60 billion cups of . tea a year. That, presenter Cherry Healey informed us, was enough to . fill the Albert Hall 150 times over. Legal aid work looks soul-destroying: this programme certainly was . Cherry looked humbled by this statistic. But images like this aren’t helpful, because they divert the mind from the facts and start us puzzling about irrelevant problems. Such as, how would you empty the Albert Hall, once it was filled with tea? If you simply opened the doors and let it pour down the steps, the surrounding streets would be awash. The nearby Royal College of Art would be flooded. There’d be hell to pay. Cherry was not deterred. The statistics cascaded on. We spend £2.4 billion annually on biscuits, we eat 11.5 billion sandwiches, every one of us gobbles 128 packets of crisps each year, and if you lined up all the soup tins produced by a single factory, they would stretch from Wigan to Chicago. But how could you line up cans across the ocean, Cherry? They’d sink. Were you proposing some sort of platform linking the continents, like a transatlantic Millennium Bridge? Have you considered the practicalities? Cherry is a distracting presenter generally. She has the brisk demeanour and exaggerated facial expressions of a primary school teacher. Frowning, gaping, goggling, blinking and gasping, she threw herself at the cereal aisles and the fruit-and-veg section. Full marks for trying, at any rate. Which is much more  than you could ever say for Tuckers’ clients.","The Briefs (ITV)

Police . ran a number of searches of the home on Monday morning as they looked . for Long, but it wasn't until Monday night when he finally surfaced, . breaking into the small one-storey house. The .

Somehow, although officials have not said how exactly, Jerome Mauderly was able to grab hold of his gun and shoot Long. Police were on scene almost immediately and found him laying face down with a single gun shot wound. The Mauderlys were uninjured. Long, who is originally from southeast Iowa, was serving time for third-degree burglary. He was sentenced earlier this year and was due to be released in September 2014. On the run: Authorities say Long, an escaped inmate, shot a southwest Iowa sheriff's deputy .

U.S. scientists have 'grown' a beating mouse heart from human stem cells, leading many to hope that human organs could one day be created. The heart - which had been removed from the mouse and stripped of its cells - was treated with human stem cells and started to beat again. The breakthrough could lead to the development of transplant organs for patients thanks to stem cells produced from simple skin biopsies. Scientists have 'grown' a beating mouse heart from human stem cells, leading many to hope that human organs could one day be regrown. This image shows a closely packed layer of cells in the cardiac muscles . These specialised cells - induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells - are adult stem cells which act like embryonic ones, gaining the ability to become any cell in the human body. But embryos do not have to be destroyed to create a supply. In principle iPS cells could be used to treat a wide range of disorders, from diabetes to Parkinson's. Rather than managing the symptoms of the disease, the cells would be used to regenerate the affected parts of the body. The research, published in Nature Communications said It was the first time that scientists . have managed to make a mouse heart beat again after its own cells were . stripped and replaced with the human heart precursor cells. The findings may lead to personalised iPS cells being used in organ transplants one day, while hearts and other organs could also be made to test drugs in the lab. Heart disease is the UK's biggest killer, causing almost 74,000 deaths each year, about 200 every day. The mouse heart, which was removed from the mouse and stripped of its cells, was treated with human stem cells and started to beat again, as shown in figure a. Figure c and e shows the staining of the mouse heart. Figure d shows powerful microscope images of hearts . In the U.S. one person dies from heart disease every 34 seconds and more than 5 million people suffer from heart failure, meaning a reduced ability to pump blood. Dr Lei Yang, of the University of Pittsburgh, said more than half of heart disease patients do not respond to current therapies and there is a scarcity of donor organs for transplant. He said: 'Scientists have been looking to regenerative medicine and tissue engineering approaches to find new solutions for this important problem. 'The ability to replace a piece of tissue damaged by a heart attack, or perhaps an entire organ, could be very helpful for these patients.' Dr Yang's researchers first removed all the cells from a mouse heart, a process that takes about 10 hours using a variety of agents.

Then they replaced the remaining heart framework with MCP (multipotential cardiovascular progenitor) cells produced by engineering iPS cells from a small human skin biopsy and treating them with special growth factors to further encourage differentiation. 'This process makes MCPs, which are precursor cells that can further differentiate into three kinds of cells the heart uses, including cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells,' said Dr Yang. 'Nobody has tried using these MCPs for heart regeneration before. 'It turns out the heart's extracellular . matrix, the material that is the substrate of heart scaffold, can send . signals to guide the MCPs into becoming the specialised cells needed for . proper heart function.' A beating engineered heart construct is pictured. Induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPS cells - are adult stem cells which act like embryonic ones, gaining the ability to become any cell in the human body and were used to replace cells from the mouse's heart . After a few weeks, the mouse heart had not only been rebuilt with human cells, it also began contracting again, at the rate of 40 to 50 beats a minute. The researchers added that more work must be done to make the heart contract strongly enough to be able to pump blood effectively, and to rebuild the heart's electrical conduction system correctly so the heart rate speeds up and slows down appropriately. Dr Yang said it may be possible in the future to take a simple skin biopsy from a patient to derive personalised MCPs that can be used to seed a biologic scaffold and regenerate a replacement organ suitable for transplantation. The model also could be used as a lab based method to preclinically test the effect of new drugs on the heart or to study how the foetal heart might develop. Added Dr Yang: 'One of our next goals is to see if it is feasible to make a patch of human heart muscle. We could use patches to replace a region damaged by a heart attack. That might be easier to achieve because it will not require as many cells as a whole human sized organ would.' The findings of the study may lead to personalised iPS cells being used in organ transplants one day, while hearts and other organs could also be made to test drugs in the lab. Heart disease is the UK's biggest killer, causing almost 74,000 deaths each year, about 200 every day .","U.S. scientists removed the heart from .

It is famed as an iconic weekend break destination – especially at this time of year, when its Fringe and Art Festivals turn it into a colourful mass of laughter and cool culture. Throw in some of Britain’s best-loved tourist sights – the historic stretch of the Royal Mile; the 12th century Castle rising high on its bluff; the rearing hilltops of Arthur’s Seat – and you have a splendid location that pulls in holidaymakers in their thousands. Pretty damn steep: Edinburgh has great scenery, in the form of Arthur's Seat - but a visit may cost you . But tourists heading to Edinburgh this summer will have to pay for the privilege – as, according to a new survey, the city is the most expensive in Britain for a mini-break. According to research released by reviews website TripAdvisor, the Scottish capital is the priciest of 20 key UK cities when it comes to both the cost of a four-star hotel room and a one-night break (with accommodation, pre-dinner drinks, meal for two and a taxi home). Edinburgh topped the poll for the average price of a four-star hotel booking, at £207.51 for a single night’s stay – proving over £20 more costly than its nearest competitor Brighton (£180.12) and over £30 higher than third-placed Cambridge (£173 per night). Perhaps surprisingly, TripAdvisor’s statistics suggest that London is only the fourth most expensive city in the UK when it comes to the fee for a four-star hotel – with the average price for a one-night stay revealed as £159.94, almost £50 less costly than Edinburgh. Edinburgh also headed the list when it came to the overall price of a one-night break. The combined tally for a night’s holiday in the city – including hotel, two dry martinis to start the evening, a meal of steak and chips with a bottle of house wine for two, and a cab back to the hotel at the end of the evening – leaves just small change from £300, at £298.46. Daylight robbery: Cambridge (left), with its famous university and studious atmosphere, is also ranked as a costly option for a UK break - but Nottingham, the 'home' of Robin Hood (right), is listed as the best-value city . Visitors can find slightly better value in second-placed Cambridge, where the same price equation came up with a total sum of £275.32, and in fourth-placed Brighton, where you are likely to pay £261.41 – exactly £3 less than third-placed London, at £264.41. However, holidaymakers visiting Britain – or spreading their wings within it – can find better deals if they look to some of the country’s less heralded weekend-away options. Nottingham – home to the legend of Robin Hood and the lovely open space of Wollaton Park – is apparently the UK’s cheapest major city for a mini-break. A one-night stay in a four-star hotel will set you back an average £73.21 – nearly enough for three nights in Edinburgh – while the full cost of the stay, with food and drink, tallies to ‘just’ £164.73. Other ‘bargain’ possibilities include Cardiff (£81.87 for a four-star hotel room, £167.51 for a complete one-night package), Sheffield (£83.86 for the hotel, £175.81 overall), Leeds (£83.82 per room, £179.59 in all) and Bristol (£84.85 and £180.32 respectively). The figures also suggest that Birmingham has grown in popularity as a getaway possibility in the last 12 months – and has raised its prices to match. The Midlands metropolis – with its . dramatic industrial heritage, numerous canals, rising restaurant scene . and lively nightlife – was ranked as the best-value option in the survey . conducted in 2012, when a complete-package one-night break was . available for £139.54. Canal plus: Birmingham, with its restored industrial heritage, is another cheap option - though rising in price . Twelve months on, that figure has leapt to £183.82 – although that still leaves Birmingham as the sixth cheapest city for a UK mini-break in 2013, according to the poll. “With the great summer we’ve been enjoying, staycations are sure to be a popular choice for UK travellers over the August bank holiday,” says TripAdvisor’s James Kay. “But where you go will have a big impact on how much you are likely to spend. “Generally, the further north you go, the less you need to fork out for hotels and dinner. “But there are some notable exceptions to that rule. So make sure you plan ahead.”","Survey finds Scottish capital is the most pricey UK city for one-night stay .

Urban beekeepers who set up hives in cities could be harming honey bees, scientists claim Pictured is a hive on the roof of Mitre House in Regents Street, London . British scientists claim urban beekeepers who set up hives in cities - in a bid to help the ailing honey bee population - could actually be harming the creatures. Research has revealed that bees living in city hives cannot find enough flowers to feed on locally and can end up sick or starving to death. The scientists suggest people living in cities who want to help the bees should grow bee-friendly flowers instead of setting up hives for the insects. Spurred on by widespread coverage of . declining bee numbers, urban beekeeping has never been more popular, . particularly in London. But scientists at the University of Sussex have warned the boom could be bad for honey bees and . other flower-visiting insects as it risks overtaxing the available . nectar and pollen supply, and potentially encourages the spread of . diseases. Professor Francis Ratnieks and Dr Karin Alton from the Laboratory of Apiculture and Social Insects (LASI) at the university, explored the trend and public perception of honey bee decline. They also looked at the various awareness campaigns that have called on the public to get involved and help the bees, in a study published in The Biologist. The duo noted that most of the promotion of beekeeping is directed at urban areas, especially London. Data from BeeBase, a register of apiaries maintained by the UK’s National Bee Unit, showed that in  five years - from 2008 to 2013 - the number of beekeepers in Greater London tripled from . 464 to 1,237 and the number of hives doubled from 1,677 to more than . 3,500. There are now approximately 10 hives in every square kilometre of London compared to one hive in the same area across England as a whole. Data from BeeBase, a register of apiaries maintained by the UK's National Bee Unit, showed that in five years - from 2008 to 2013 - the number of beekeepers in Greater London tripled from 464 to 1,237 and the number of hives doubled from 1,677 to more than 3,500 . The biologists said many restaurants, galleries, businesses . and shops use rooftop hives as a means of visibly greening their . business or as a team-building exercise for staff. Professor Ratnieks said: 'Both honey bees and wild bees have been declining. Although the causes are complex the most important one seems to be loss of flowers and habitat. 'Since World War Two, the spread of intensive farming has greatly reduced areas rich in wildflowers, such as hay meadows. 'In the UK, 75 per cent of the total land is now agricultural, so the lack of flowers is a major problem for our bees.' He believes planting more flowers is a better way of helping the honey bees instead of building more hives. He said: 'If the problem is not enough flowers, increasing the number of hives risks making that problem worse. The honey bee (pictured) is just one of many insect species which feed on nectar and pollen. Having a high density of honey bee hives in a city is not only bad for honey bees, but may also affect bumblebees and other species feeding on the same flowers, scientists warned . 'The honey bee is just one of many insect species which feed on nectar and pollen. Having a high density of honey bee hives is not only bad for honey bees, but may also affect bumblebees and other species feeding on the same flowers.' The scientists said that as the number of urban hives increases, there needs to be sufficient food and there may not be enough flowers in the parks situated in built-up areas. They believe the high colony density in London and an influx of inexperienced beekeepers also runs the risk of spreading certain honey bee diseases, especially American foulbrood, a highly contagious bacterial infection of honey bee larvae. The infection is rare in Britain, but a high density of hives managed by novice beekeepers creates a situation in which it could easily spread if it got started and the only 'cure' is to burn hives, they warned. The researchers calculated each new hive in London would need the equivalent of one hectare of borage, a plant that attracts mainly honey bees, to live comfortably. A beekeeper is pictured on the roof of Mitre House in Regents Street, London . Co-author Dr Karin Alton said: 'Our calculations indicate that each new hive placed in London would need the equivalent of one hectare of borage, a plant that attracts mainly honey bees, or over eight hectares of lavender, a plant that attracts mainly bumblebees but some honey bees.' 'We need to bear in mind that the honey bee may have declined but is in no imminent danger of extinction, unlike some other critically endangered insects in the UK. 'There are better ways to help our declining honeybee population than encouraging beekeeping to the point of overstocking certain areas.' She said: 'Rather than encouraging more hives, a better alternative would be to translate the concern that people have for bees by providing more flowers and habitat.' Professor Ratnieks said that he does not want to discourage people taking up beekeeping as a hobby, but it should not be seen as a way of helping bees in busy, built-up areas.","British scientists have warned that inexperienced beekeepers could risk spreading certain honey bee diseases .

MPs said the internet search giant – which has the informal motto ‘Don’t be evil’ – used ‘devious, calculated and unethical’ tricks to minimise its liabilities. Last year its UK turnover was £3billion yet it paid just £7.3million in corporation tax. In stark contrast, families lose more than half of their wages to income tax and national insurance. Google vice president Matt Brittin floundered during the grilling by MPs, admitting that committee chairman Margaret Hodge knew more about his firm than he did . During heated questioning in the . Commons yesterday, Labour MP Margaret Hodge asked Google executives: ‘If . you are a hard-pressed family who pay all their taxes, or if you are a . struggling business who feel very bullied by HMRC and certainly hassled . by them, how do you think they feel? ‘Every time they switch on to Google . ... it reminds them of your rather devious, if I may say so, calculated . and in my view unethical behaviour in deliberately manipulating the . reality of your business to avoid paying your fair share of tax to the . common good? How do you think ordinary people feel?’ Referring to the ‘Don’t be evil’ slogan, Mrs Hodge added: ‘I think you do do evil. That is, you use smoke . and mirrors to avoid paying tax.’ Matt Brittin, a vice-president of Google, had been summoned by MPs for a second time to give evidence. He was accused of trying to ‘disguise’ the truth with the testimony he gave last November. Google claims all its sales are made . in Dublin, rather than in the UK. This allows the firm to pay tax in . Ireland, which has a corporation tax rate of just 12.5 per cent against . Britain’s 23 per cent. Mr Brittin told MPs last November: ‘No one in the UK is selling.’ Furious: Committee chairman Margaret Hodge warned Mr Britten that misleading Parliament was a 'very serious offence' as she accused him of being 'devious' During more than an hour of intense questions, exasperated MPs called on Mr Britten to 'call a spade a spade' and give straight answers to their questions . But MPs said new evidence suggests almost 70 per cent of Google’s sales revenues come from deals that have involved UK staff. Those staff are largely paid by commission and have monthly ‘sales’ targets – suggesting they are in fact selling in the UK. MPs said they had been contacted by a ‘stream of whistleblowers’ and had seen invoices sent out from British addresses. Mrs Hodge, who chairs the public . accounts committee, said she had seen a presentation given to UK staff . giving sales targets for 2012. ‘It was quite clear from all that . documentation that the entire trading process and sales process took . place in the UK,’ she said. During a two-hour interrogation, Mr Brittin eventually admitted that ‘a lot of the aspects of selling’ do take place in the UK. But he insisted all sales were processed and billed in Ireland. He said: ‘Literally 99 per cent of our UK customers spend their money without ever talking to anyone in Google UK.’ But the remaining 1 per cent are the group’s largest customers, and account for more than two thirds of its total sales. Labour leader Ed Milliband said people would be 'shocked' by Google's tax arrangements while Business Secretary Vince Cable said 'public outrage' was justified .

This is the hilarious footage of a very curious penguin trying to gobble up an expensive GoPro camera. When the penguin on the Falkland Islands caught sight of the camera, he just could not help going in for a closer look, and a firm peck. British photographer Aniket Sardana captured the video while working as a vet in the Falkland Islands. Leading the charge of the penguins, one brave one comes forwards out of the pack on the beach to approach the camera . The curious penguin coyly made his approach towards the camera at first . Eyeing up the expensive camera, he goes in for a close inspection of the lens, encouraged by his friends . His curiosity gets the better of him and he swoops in for a preliminary peck, as the others keep a watch . The footage shows the mischievous bird waddle over the camera and nibble it. The greedy bird then tries to pick up and eat the small device before giving up and walking off. Aniket said: 'I was expecting them to come in to take a close look. I was very surprised when he tried to eat the camera. 'The previous year the penguins seemed fascinated by their reflections in my camera lens, but clearly they are more mischievous than I thought.' The emboldened animal goes for a full-on bite as he tries to take a chunk out of the camera . Wrestling with the device on the beach, the penguin unsuccessfully tries to eat it with his beak wide open . Puzzled at his lack of success, the penguin looks disappointed that he has not made any progress . 'I spent two days at Bleaker Island where that sequence was shot, in the evenings the penguins would return to their nests after feeding out at sea and stop to investigate anything unusual in their path. 'It's interesting to watch, they look at the camera and then at each other as if to say 'are you going or shall I?' 'One is tempted but then walks on. His neighbour then can't resist and comes in for the kill.' Despite penguins' image as only inhabiting ice and snow a million of them come every year to the sandy beaches and sheep paddocks of the Falklands. Penguins are a big feature on the Islands. Its only newspaper is even called Penguin News. Having pecked the camera, the penguin had a quick scout around to see if anyone had caught him in the act . Aniket, 30, has been a photographer for 14 years and got into photography after falling in love with nature. His passion for spending hours watching plants and animals around him drove him to buying his first camera at the age of 16. 'I have been near-fanatical about wildlife and the natural world since I could crawl. The penguin looked the picture of innocence as he waddled away to join the others . The cheeky penguin is in good company on the Falkland Islands as 1million of them head there every year . When the camera was not being pecked it was able to catch many of the penguins going about their usual business, such as this one taking a shower . 'I've spent the past 13 years exploring and photographing various wilderness locations, both in the UK and abroad. 'It . was just luck that I had the opportunity to spend some time working in . the Falklands - surely one of the world's most spectacular wildlife . destinations.

On the mend: Isabel Manchip has restricted use of the left side of her body but is learning to walk . A girl who suffered a stroke at just one year old is managing to defy medical predictions by learning to walk and talk. Isabel Manchip from Portsmouth is one of the youngest children in Britain to suffer a stroke, which damaged  75 per cent of the right side of her brain. Isabel, now two, still has little use of the left side of her body and wears a splint every day to support her left arm. Unlike adults, for whom the greatest stroke risks are known to be smoking, poor diet and high cholesterol, the causes of childhood strokes are less clear-cut. Her parents Rebecca, 45, and Eddie, 48, believe Isabel's was brought on by chickenpox. Eddie, an IT consultant said: 'Isabel had a high temperature for eight days solid. 'Doctors thought it was an infection which caused it, but the likelihood is that she had chicken pox because our son Matthew came down with it shortly afterwards. 'Instead of having a bleed on the brain which can sometimes happen in a stroke, her brain was starved of oxygen. Isabel had the stroke on December 28 2011 and was in intensive care for five days. Doctors told her parents to be prepared for the worst: 'We were told not to expect her to survive and the first 48-hours were critical. 'They got her in intensive care soon enough to try and preserve as much of her as possible. 'Me and Rebecca were told 95 per cent of the right side of her brain was damaged and her chance of survival was pretty slim. Brave: Despite Isabel's ordeal, she and her parents Rebecca and Eddie are determined that she should live as normal a life as possible . 'It was a horrible time - we didn't expect her to survive.' When Isabel came round she only recognised her mother Rebecca, causing more heartbreak for the family. Eddie said: 'She didn't recognise me, so Rebecca spent the first week at the hospital comforting her. 'It was extremely hard for me because . Isabel was a daddy's girl beforehand, and she is again now she is . recovered, but she just stared blankly at me. Critical: Isabel in the intensive care unit at Southampton General Hospital in December 2011, two days after her stroke . Memory loss: When Isabel came round she could only recognise her mother, much to her family's heartache . 'I kept going into see her at hospital and eventually she came round to remembering me again.' Three months later Isabel had another MRI scan which showed the damage had reduced to 75 per cent as the bruising and swelling had gone down. One year on she has now defied doctors' expectations not only to live, but to see, walk, run and cycle. Her father said: 'She's happy, cheeky and full of life. Fighting for her life: Isabel's parents were told 95 per cent of the right side of her brain was damaged and her chance of survival was slim . 'The right hand side of the brain which . affects understanding has been tested and her intelligence and she is . beyond where she should be for her age.' Injury to the left side of the brain, known as hemiplegia, will cause paralysis on the right side of the body and injury to the right side of the brain, like Isabel's, affects the left. Determined: She still has little use of the left side but she has persevered with her movement and speech . Eddie explained the extent of her injuries: 'She was completely blind in her left eye but she can now see across the room and walk, run, cycle. 'Although we are still trying to get her to use her left hand, arm and foot more, I think the main part of the recovery has been done. 'Her recovery has been way beyond anyone expected. 'We are so grateful she is almost back to normal - she's our little miracle.' Rebecca, a book keeper, said: 'Isabel has come so far and we are thankful she is still with us. 'She is a determined little girl who likes learning off her six-year old brother Matthew by copying what he does. 'There isn't much more we can do for her now but her recovery has been amazing.' Although strokes are normally associated with older people, research shows that around 350 children and babies have a stroke each year in the UK. Stroke side effects for children can include epilepsy, visual impairment or speech difficulties. Some children also develop specific learning difficulties or emotional and behavioural problems.","Isabel Manchip had a stroke aged one, damaging the right side of her brain .

These extraordinary pictures capture one of Britain's rarest animals - an albino squirrel. The red-eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan, 66, in a park near his home almost three months ago. But despite regularly stalking the woodland he was never able to capture the rare animal on camera. Spotted: The red-eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan, 66, in a park near his home almost three months ago but he didn't spot it again until the other day . The pensioner spent days re-stocking his bird feeder only to be greeted by half a dozen of the animals' grey cousins. Disappointed Mr Sullivan was about to give up on ever tracking down the rare animal, but last week his luck changed. He glanced outside to check on his bird feeder and was stunned to see the red-eyed albino squirrel staring back at him. The former publisher said he was delighted to have finally caught the animal on film. Mr Sullivan, from East Grinstead, Sussex, said: 'When we saw the white squirrel a few months ago darting through the trees, we couldn't believe our eyes. Rare: Mr Sullivan said the squirrel is more nervous that other squirrels so the picture was quite difficult to take . 'We thought, 'That can't be right'. They jump around, but they are gone in a flash. 'We've seen him a few times since then, so when we put in a bird feeder we were pleasantly surprised to see him visit. 'He is a lot more nervous than the other squirrels, so it was not easy to get the picture. The feeder is mainly for the birds, but I'm a nature lover and I'm happy to see him.' Though relatively uncommon, the rare creatures can be seen in a few parts of the South East, and the British Wildlife Centre, in Newchapel, has its own resident albino squirrel. Liza Lipscombe, from the British Wildlife Centre in Newchapel, Surrey, said: 'It's not just squirrels that can be albinos. 'Bank voles, badgers and even white blackbirds are not unknown in this area. 'Albinos have quite a tough time in the wild, losing any natural benefits of camouflage, or they may be rejected by others of their kind. 'But as they are tree-dwelling and very quick on their feet, squirrels have very few natural predators and albino squirrels often survive as long as the grey ones. 'Our squirrel was cared for by Folly Wildlife Rescue, near Tonbridge, and is now too tame to release, and has been given a permanent home here.'","The red-eyed rodent was glimpsed by wildlife enthusiast Patrick Sullivan .

When they are not strutting down the catwalk or on photoshoots in exotic locations, what do models do in their spare time? If you believe the gossip columns, you might imagine the majority live it up at parties and on luxury yachts. But male model Gerard Smith proves there are exceptions. When he has his downtime, he likes nothing better than donning his overalls and indulging in his passion for DIY. Rock star crib: Gerard and Mei-an in their kitchen which boasts tiles from a London Underground station, cabinets made from Spitfires and a table which once belonged to Mick Jagger . Gerard, 39 – who has worked with Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Bono in a 20-year career that has seen him modelling for Calvin Klein and Gucci – has applied these handyman skills and a talent for spotting classic furniture to turn his bijou  flat in Clapham, South London, into a retro palace. The fact that he and his partner, Mei-an Collier, 32, an art director at clothes store White Stuff, both trained at art college and obviously have aesthetic sensibilities helped transform the property. When they bought it in 2010, it was a ‘mouse-infested dump’, but the couple recognised the ex-council home’s potential. It is on the third floor of Grant House, a 1930s estate built to provide accommodation for auxiliary staff such as cleaners and engineers working at the Houses of Parliament. It was later acquired by the London Borough of Lambeth to provide council housing. Now about 40 per cent of the properties are privately owned. The flats surround a large well-tended communal garden, have off-street private parking for only £30 a year, and included in a modest service charge of £1,200 is a permanent supply of hot water. Modelled by model: The bathroom follows the same retro-style with a cast-iron bathroom, recycled Underground tiles and the black-and white chequered theme . Gerard and Mei-an’s flat has two bedrooms and is split over two floors. It has the advantage of a large balcony space. The couple paid £210,000 for it and have now put it on the market for £335,000 as they plan to move out of inner London to buy a bigger property to raise a family. Gerard spent about £60,000 on the flat – meaning the couple will make a £65,000 profit – but this pales into insignificance when you consider  the imagination, not to mention the hard graft, he has put in. His most eye-catching addition is the former London Underground station tiling in the kitchen/diner and bathroom. The blue tiles in the kitchen once adorned the walls at Edgware Road station, while the white ones are from Northern line stations. But the work probably most far removed from his day job was laying the teak flooring, which he acquired on eBay. ‘It’s laid on tar so it was a very messy job,’ he recalls. Other retro items also found on eBay are a 1960s G-Plan wooden cabinet in the sitting room, glass bricks, a cast-iron bathtub, a Smeg fridge, chunky cast-iron radiators and a kitchen table ‘that once belonged to Mick Jagger’. Commons touch: The £335,000 two-bedroom flat is located in Clapham's Grant House, which was originally built to home staff working in Parliament . ‘I bought it from an old manager  of the Stones. I had to go to Somerset to pick it up. In fact possibly the hardest work involved was getting the stuff – I had to go all over the country,’ says Gerard. Perhaps the most interesting additions, however, are the kitchen cabinets, which have been crafted out of the fuselages of Second World War Spitfires. ‘They come from a firm called English Rose, but I bought them on eBay. At the end of the war, English Rose bought up a whole lot of planes no longer in use and turned them into cabinets. They come as units and fit together like Meccano.’ Gerard has generously decided to leave his eBay acquisitions for the new owners. The couple will miss living in such a central location when they move – the flat is a short walk from Clapham Common and Clapham Old Town, while to the north, the Nine Elms  area is in the process of regeneration thanks to the imminent arrival of the US Embassy. With his modelling career not as busy as it once was, Gerard sees his future in property development. Tom Crabtree, of Marsh & Parsons, Clapham, said: ‘The property has been converted to become an amazing space. ‘This reflects Clapham, which has become one of the most interesting and vibrant of places to live south of the river.’ Marsh & Parsons, 020 7501 3666 .","Ex-council flat in Clapham,South London converted into retro haven .

Leaving a trail of smoke in the skies above London, a stricken jet is just seconds from a potential disaster as it descends for an emergency landing with one engine damaged and the other on fire. Shocked passengers yesterday described watching as the British Airways jet’s port-side engine covering ripped off on take-off from Heathrow, exposing its inner workings. Just minutes later the plane’s starboard engine exploded into flames, leaving a trail of black smoke. The Daily Mail can reveal that passengers had reported vibrations and whistling in the cabin – over the wing area where the engines are located – during the plane’s previous flight on Thursday night. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Both runways at Heathrow Airport were closed after a British Airways plane had to make an emergency landing . Smoke can be seen coming from one of the plane's engines while it is still in the air . Emergency services attended to the aircraft following the emergency landing . And critics have demanded why the stricken plane was allowed to fly back to base, over millions of homes in Western Europe’s most densely populated city on one of the busiest flight paths in the world. Alternative routes over countryside to airports such as Gatwick, Farnborough or Marston in Kent were possible. British Airways confirmed that air accident investigators were looking at technical faults involving both engines. The most likely theory at the centre of the investigation is that maintenance crews simply failed to properly lock the metal cowls which protect the engines before take-off. If engines are not properly encased by locking the metal cowls, debris can enter the engines. This can cause fires, experts said. All 75 passengers and five crew were evacuated via the emergency chutes from BA762 to Oslo yesterday, with ambulance crews treating three people for minor injuries. Passengers on the crippled 150-seat jet told how the cabin ‘glowed orange’ after the Airbus A319’s right engine caught fire. The drama happened as the flight returned to Heathrow – about 15 minutes after air traffic control had alerted the pilot at take-off to smoke coming from the plane and debris on the runway, possibly from one or both engines. Passengers said the casing of the left engine started to break away from the plane during take-off. A picture taken from inside the aircraft which shows the engine on the port side of the plane. Passengers have said the fire could be seen coming from the starboard engine . The starboard engine appears charred as the plane sits on the runway after making the emergency landing this morning . Jon Chaplin, a company director, said: ‘As the plane started to gather speed on the runway for take-off, the engine casing came loose and started flapping and at the point of take-off it snapped off with a loud bang. ‘On the descent back into Heathrow the right engine burst into flames, creating an orange glow visible throughout the cabin. ‘People were relatively calm until the engine blew, and then they started to panic.’ Another passenger, David Gallagher, tweeted a picture of the loose left engine cowling. He said: ‘About eight or nine minutes into the flight there was a loud . popping sound, not an explosion but definitely not usual sounds. ‘The captain came on very calmly, said he was aware of the situation and . that everything was running normally and he was going to run some . tests. ‘Then another five minutes after that there was a loud sound, and this . time the right engine was clearly on fire. 'I mean, big flames, very . visible from the rest of the cabin and lots of black smoke.’ Eyewitnesses have described hearing 'a blowout' and seeing one of the engines on fire while it was in the air . The British Airways aircraft, which was bound for Oslo, is seen sitting on the northern runway at Heathrow . He praised the ‘outstanding’ cabin . crew and ground grew for bringing the plane down safely. Passengers had . reported vibrations and whistling in the cabin during the plane’s . previous flight returning from Stavanger in Norway on Thursday night. Bird strikes can cause huge problems for planes and airports will use a variety of methods to keep flight paths clear. Commercial pilot and instructor Ian Hollingworth, spokesman for the British Airline Pilots Association, told MailOnline bird strikes can cause 'significant damage' to engines. He said: 'If they have had a bird or a number of birds ingested into the engine then it can cause significant damage to the engine, particularly if the engine is on a high power setting, such as at take-off. 'There's nothing definite until the investigation is completed, quite obviously, but if the plane was to ingest a number of birds which hit the front fans in the engine as it rotates at high speed, and it causes damage there, then what that leads to is an imbalance in the engine. A source said: ‘The noises were . reported to the flight deck but the crew did not seem to be too . concerned. The captain even came out to speak to the passengers and . reassure them that everything was fine.’ David Learmount, of Flight Global magazine, said engine fire was the most serious incident pilots face but also the one for which they practise the most. He said two-engined planes such as the Airbus A319 were perfectly capable of flying on one engine. BA said the request to return to Heathrow had been made because it was ‘the most suitable’ location to deal with the problems identified. The airline confirmed both engines suffered damage but said it would be for accident investigators to determine what caused the damage and determine which engine was compromised first. BA said in relation to the jet’s Stavanger flight, it would be ‘inappropriate to discuss the previous technical status of this aircraft’ while it was subject to an Air Accident Investigation Board probe. However BA did not deny the  testimony of witnesses on that flight made to the Daily Mail. Passengers at Heathrow's Terminal One have been forced to endure severe delays following the incident . British Airways cancelled all of its short haul flights until 4pm following the incident . The airport has seen 188 cancellations, the vast majority of which were short haul flights . The airport was seeing delays of 38 minutes for departures and 23 minutes for arrivals, on average, following the emergency landing . Mark Freeman, Heathrow Airport Duty Manager said: 'Incidents like this are extremely rare but the team trains constantly to ensure we are prepared when they occur. 'I’d like to thank the fire and airside team, emergency services and BA for their calm professionalism in assisting passengers and making the aircraft safe. 'We were able to reopen the northern runway within two hours of the incident and we are now focused on returning the airport to normal as quickly as possible.' Captain Mark Searle, chairman of . airline pilots’ association Balpa, said: 'This was a professional job . done by professional people. As pilots we spend our whole career . training to manage incidents such as this in order to avoid an incident . becoming a disaster. 'Balpa . representatives will be assisting the pilots involved in this incident . and providing whatever support they need. And, as always, we will all . learn whatever lessons we can.' The plane was surrounded by emergency vehicles after it made the emergency landing this morning . The plane had been due to fly to Oslo and had been carrying 75 passengers, British Airways has said . Passengers at Heathrow have been warned to expect delays of 30 to 60 minutes following the emergency landing . The airport has said all of the passengers were 'safely evacuated' and 'accounted for' The plane with emergency services surrounding it after it landed at Heathrow this morning . An engine fire is the most serious incident air pilots face but also the one for which they practice the most. Today's successful landing of the stricken British Airways plane was another example of just how well cockpit crews deal with such events, said David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight Global publication. He added that air accident investigators will have 'a pretty shrewd idea' almost straightaway about what happened. If the plane ran into a large bird or a flock of birds, as has been speculated, then the evidence would be obvious, Mr Learmount said. He went on: 'The BA pilots today would have got some kind of mechanical damage which led to some kind of fire. 'This is the most serious event you can have, but engine failure that leads to a fire is the emergency for which crews practice more than any other event. 'If you don't deal with events like this quickly and effectively then it is disastrous. Thankfully, in nearly every case pilots take appropriate action.' In such incidents, pilots go through an engine shutdown drill, with a two-engined plane such as the Airbus A319 involved in today's incident perfectly capable of flying on one engine. The crew cut off the fuel to the stricken engine and if the fire does not go out they push buttons or pull handles to activate the fire extinguisher system which is in the engine itself. Mr Learmount said: 'Crews get retrained twice a year. One thing that happens in every single simulation exercise is engine fire incident.' He said the simulation exercise would often involve an engine fire at the two most critical times - at take-off or landing. Heathrow and other airports employ bird-scaring tactics but Mr Learmount said that airports are powerless to cope with, say, a flock of geese which may decide to fly over an airport. He went on: 'If planes fly into a flock of birds or a large one such as an adult Canada goose, then engine blades can break up and get ingested into the engine.'","British Airways plane was forced to make an emergency landing .

After a summit to discuss unusual weather patterns, it was widely reported that we could be locked in a decade of soaking wet summers. We should have known better. Our forecasters are even less reliable than our weather. More recent predictions said we would suffer a ‘colder-than-average’ July. The reality has so far proved very different, with the longest heatwave for seven years set to continue. Scroll down for video . Meteorologists had talked about a cycle of soggy summers . Blistering heat: Emma Highley, 23, went for a swim in Lumb Fall's waterfall and pool hidden away in the Pennines above Hebden bridge, West Yorkshire, to cool off in the hot weather . And despite there being standing room only on beaches, and our  gardens – as well as our throats – being parched, one Met Office expert was still insisting this weekend that the summer could yet be a washout – and this spell of hot weather could be ‘a blip’. But these are the facts: . Sunshine is here to stay: Despite forecasters' predictions, the UK will bask in more sunshine next week . Busy beach: The seafront at Brighton as Britain basking in another day of hot temperatures - and it is set to last until next week . Summer sun: People relax by the fountains in Marble Arch, central London, as a Met Office level three heatwave warning remains in force . Police and fire services have also warned people to be careful when swimming in open water following several deaths in recent weeks, including that of a 69-year-old woman in the sea off Skegness, Lincolnshire, on Friday. So how could our forecasters have got it so wrong? Reports of a gloomy forecast came after a . climate summit at the Met Office HQ in Exeter last month, when . Professor Stephen Belcher, head of the Met Office’s Hadley Centre for . climate research, said the country may be involved in ‘a cycle of wetter . summers’. A week later, the Met Office’s June 27 forecast predicted a cool and wet month – despite the fact that we are now, happily, on course for the driest July since records began in 1910. The Met Office said the comments had been misinterpreted and denied that there had been a prediction. So on Friday I managed to catch up with Prof Belcher at Reading University to seek an explanation. Prof Belcher, who heads the university’s meteorology department was doing his best to enjoy the heatwave, rolling up his shirt sleeves, and wearing slacks and trainers. Living on the edge, he even opened his window. Perhaps it was my Hawaiian shirt, lobster-red forehead and flip-flops but he was beyond tight-lipped when I offered him a courtesy sombrero and beachball. Our other gift – a Zoom lolly – might have lured him but sadly it had long since melted into a sticky mess. ‘No,’ he said tersely, as I invited him to embrace summer with The Mail on Sunday, before escaping to the shadows behind the university bike shed. Even though temperatures are forecast to touch 95F this week, scientists and weathermen still fear our summers could be   doomed – blaming the rain on warmer North Atlantic sea temperatures. Professor Belcher’s colleague Dr Peter Stott – a leading climate change expert who also took part in June’s meeting – said he still believed 2013 could prove to be a washout. He said: ‘There is a difference between climate and weather. This heatwave could just be a blip and will soon be over in any case – in about two weeks. And if we have a really wet August, this could still go down as a wet summer.’ But he added: ‘There are other factors involved so it’s very hard to predict. Land temperatures are – because of climate change – generally rising.’ Blaze near the beach: A fire, at the beauty spot of Ham Common, on Poole Harbour, Dorset, burned for several hours, destroying giant swathes of protected nature reserve . Heath fire: Sunbathers were forced to flee a beach in Poole, Dorset, as a fire breaked out close to where they were lying. Firefighters said the blaze was a suspected arson attack . Britain's roads struggled to cope with an extra seven million motorists yesterday as sun-seekers headed for the coast and theme parks. Some areas saw tailbacks of up to 20 miles, with the South of England hit hardest. About 100,000 sunseekers packed Bournemouth’s seven-mile beach and there were similar scenes at Brighton. The great getaway coincided with the start of the school holidays in many areas. ‘Our breakdown call-outs are up by about . 10 per cent and most of the calls are to cars which have overheated,’ said the RAC. ‘Clearly, everybody has been heading to the beach.’ Heat melts tarmac: A melted road surface in the centre of Cambridge after a prolonged spell of hot weather across Britain. It has gathered around the raised central reservation, which was recently resurfaced for £300,000 . Meltdown: Britain has basked in several consecutive days of temperatures higher than 30C - and in Cambridge the road has melted . Meanwhile, a fleet of snow gritters were in action across Hampshire yesterday. A fine stone dust was being sprayed on the roads to stop them warping after the asphalt became sticky in the heat. However, the scorching hot weather has taken its toll on the UK. Soaring temperatures are believed to have caused up to 760 premature deaths, and the British Red Cross has launched two call centres in Norwich and Ipswich to check on elderly and vulnerable people in the region. There have been grass fires in several areas of London, mountain blazes in the Welsh valleys. and a large area of Tentsmuir Forest in Fife has been devastated. l A post-mortem is under way after a teenage girl collapsed at Hinksey Park, Oxford, which was packed with families enjoying the sunshine. The girl was airlifted to the John Radcliffe Hospital but could not be saved. Too hot for the road: A long stretch of tarmac in Cambridge will now have to be resurfaced after being melted by the hot weather .

Lawsuit: Nancy Silberkleit, 59, of Archie Comics, claims Sam Levitin turned against her for rejecting his 'unwanted and improper sexual advances' A comic book chief executive accused of harassing staff two years ago is now suing her liaison to the company and friend of 40 years over alleged sexual advances. Nancy Silberkleit, 59, co-CEO of Archie Comics, which is based in Mamaroneck, New York, claims Sam Levitin, 73, turned against her for rejecting his ‘unwanted and improper sexual advances’. But Mr Levitin alleges in return that Mrs Silberkleit is ‘unstable’ and ‘will greatly damage the business’ if she remains in a position of power, reported the New York Daily News. He also claims she even once plotted to make Betty and Veronica - the love interests of the comic book’s main character Archie Andrews - more provocative, according to court documents. The long-running feud began last year when former schoolteacher Mrs Silberkleit - who took over the co-CEO position from her late husband Michael - made Mr Levitin her liaison. She needed his help as a ‘go-between’ in a court battle with Archie Comics Productions and her fellow CEO, Jon Goldwater - who wanted to fire her, reported the Daily News. They had alleged she was often unreasonable and would explode into tantrums - such as once surging into a meeting, shouting about male genitalia and storming back out again. But their relationship broke down last winter when he turned on her for rejecting his sexual advances, according to court papers filed at Westchester Surrogate’s Court in White Plains, New York. Popular series: Mr Levitin claims Mrs Silberkleit even once plotted to make Betty and Veronica - the love interests of the comic books' main character Archie Andrews - more provocative, court documents said . Headquarters: Archie Comics Productions is based at these offices (pictured) in Mamaroneck, New York . Mr Levitin threatened her and asked if she was intending to get breast implants, Mrs Silberkleit claimed, adding that he once warned her: ‘Mess with me, lady, (and) you’re playing with fire’. He admitted telling her she was ‘playing with fire’ when talking about rebranding the traditional characters of Betty and Veronica - but denied calling her ‘lady’, reported the Daily News. ‘Nancy is incapable of working with anyone,’ Mr Levitin said in an affidavit. ‘She lacks functional communication skills and has an unstable temperament.’ Mr Levitin and his lawyer did not return a request for comment, ACP said it was ‘not a party in the litigation’ and Mrs Silberkleit’s lawyer said the allegations against his client were ‘just not true.’ Gay wedding: Life With Archie #16 issue last year featured for the first time a same-sex wedding . The hit comic, which was first published in 1941 in 'Pep Comics', has sold more than 1.5billion and is published in a dozen foreign languages. The Life With Archie series - a spin-off from the original - follows the lives of the Riverdale High School students as they enter their 20s. In the original series, the characters were at high school and the comic itself is aimed at 16 or 17-year-olds, although many fans continue to read it into their 20s. In 2010, the Life With Archie series was revived as a magazine-sized comic devoted to stories that grew out of the main character's wedding to his high school sweethearts Veronica and Betty. Archie marries both in parallel universes, so readers get to enjoy two different storylines. One issue last year featured for the first time a controversial same-sex wedding between characters Kevin Keller and Clay Walker.","Co-CEO Nancy Silberkleit, 59, claims Sam Levitin, 73, turned against her .

A disabled Iraqi war veteran is suing a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant in the Bronx for refusing him service when he brought in his service dog. 50-year-old Charles Hernandez says he entered the location on Fordham Road and Jerome Avenue on February 26 to buy a two-piece chicken meal with fries in order to take some prescribed medication. But he was refused service when the employees behind the counter saw that he was accompanied by his service dog, Valor. Turned away: Charles Hernandez (second left) and his dog Valor (black) meet Senator Chuck Schumer (center). Hernandez filed a lawsuit yesterday against a KFC in the Bronx for refusing him and Valor service . 'Papi, there are no dogs allowed,' Hernandez recalls an employee saying. Hernandez tried to explain that Valor is a service dog and according to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Valor is allowed to accompany him anywhere. 'OK, but you still cannot have the dog in the store,' the employee responded. Hernandez even says that the store's manager, Sade Clark, saw the 'discrimination' happening and did nothing about it. 'I was frustrated, angry and more, depressed,' Hernandez told the New York Post. 'No one was helping. Rather than understanding the needs of a person, they shut me out.' So Hernandez is now suing the employee, Clark, the restaurant's owner and the company's principal owner for $1million. Sued: This KFC in the Bronx was slapped with a $1million lawsuit yesterday for refusing Hernandez and his dog Valor service last February . In a lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Hernandez alleges that the KFC worker broke federal, state and city laws and caused him distress. Hernandez won a similar case in 2011 after being cursed out by a McDonald's store manager in Times Square for entering with his service dog. 'It's unfortunate that when disabled veterans return from war...they are confronted with ignorance and discrimination,' Hernandez's lawyer David Lackowitz told the New York Daily News. Hernandez was deployed to Iraq from 2004 to 2006 and sustained multiple injuries to his shoulder and his back. A spinal chord injury led to his early retirement. Hernandez also worked at Ground Zero for three months after the September 11th attacks and was named 'City Council Veteran of the Year' in 2011. In 2010 he was given Valor to held him with balance and prevent his panic attacks.","Charles Hernandez says he was refused service at a KFC in the Bronx last February when he brought in his service dog .

A top Fox News executive was fired following a bitter fall-out with channel president Roger Ailes that had been brewing 'for more than a year', according to sources today. Brian Lewis, the executive VP of corporate communications, was escorted from his office and fired after an investigation into 'financial irregularities'. Mr Lewis, widely considered to be Mr Ailes' right-hand man and chief advisor, had worked alongside the Fox News Channel since the network was founded 17 years ago. However, in a statement yesterday, Fox News reported that he was found to be in breach of contract. And a source told MailOnline today: 'This is connected to a falling out between Brian and Roger that has been brewing for more than a year, my sense is that it's over money. 'I know there was a salary negotiation dispute.' Meanwhile, New York Times writer Bill Carter backed up this theory, as he claimed a senior Fox executive had told him the relationship between Mr Ailes and Mr Wilson had 'soured badly within the last year or so,' adding: 'This has been coming for a long time.

Mr Carter added: 'The executive said that Mr. Lewis, who for most of the existence of Fox News occupied an office just down the hall from Mr. Ailes, had within the last year been moved to another floor. “It had gotten really nasty and acrimonious between the two of them,” the executive said. Today, Brian Lewis to say it had been an 'honor and privilege to work for Roger Ailes' and said he could not talk about the reason for his sacking 'for legal reasons'. He told mediabistro's TV Newser that he was upset by the speculation over his dismissal, saying: 'Some stories are ludicrous'.

'He was terminated for cause on July 25.' Brian Lewis acted as a spokesperson and trusted lieutenant at Fox News for Mr Ailes, 73, who was handpicked by Rupert Murdoch to helm the fledgling news channel.

This was the moment two aardvarks crashed into each other as they tried to follow their noses to each other in the glare of the day. The nocturnal creatures are rarely spotted in the daytime but had woken up and were snuffling around in tall grasses for food. Smells interesting... The aardvarks pick up each other's scents with their long snouts . I don't THINK it's an ant... The animals edge closer and closer to one another until... Oof! The two bemused aardvarks crash into each other amid the grass in the South African reserve . The animals used their acute sense of . hearing and smell to walk closer to each other, but failed at the last . hurdle and crashed headlong. The . two anteaters, which can see no further than the end of their noses in . daylight, then stood up on their hind legs and greeted one another. The . moment was captured on camera by British amateur photographer Cameron . Pearce, at the Tswalu Kalahari reserve in South Africa. It . is incredibly unusual to capture two aardvarks together in the same . picture due to their secretive nature and nocturnal habits. Mr Pearce, 27, from Newquay, Cornwall, said: 'I was with a group of tourists when we saw an aardvark. Fancy meeting you here! Photographer Cameron Pearce wondered if the two creatures were being aggressive, but decided they were just making friends . Hidden away: It is very unusual to see aardvarks together in the wild, especially during the day, as they are nocturnal . 'We followed it but it darted in and out of a thicket, so we went to leave when we saw it come out of the other side. 'Then . I realised there was another aardvark there and I was really excited. I . grabbed my camera because it's something you don't normally see. 'Aardvarks . can only see to the end of their noses and they were moving towards . each other, so much that they almost bumped into one another. 'They . then started doing movements which must have been for greeting one . another, although I did wonder if it was aggressive at first. 'I think they were showing friendship. 'Although . aardvarks are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa they have a . pretty low density and are rarely seen because they are nocturnal. 'They are hard to photograph because of this and it is almost unheard of to get a picture of two.' Anteater antics: The animals were spotted at the Tswalu Kalahari, a private game reserve in South Africa that spreads over more than 100,000 hectares . The word aardvark (Latin name orycteropus afer) comes from the Afrikaans and loosely translates as 'earth pig' or 'ground pig'. The animals can grow to up to 140lbs in weight and 4.3ft long and have an elongated snout which they use to find food. Aardvarks survive on a diet of ants and termites which they catch using their extremely long, sticky tongues.","Rare pictures taken by British photographer in South African reserve .

President Nixon defiantly declared to Henry Kissinger 'the POTUS is not going to resign over this chickensh*t stuff' in the midst of the Watergate scandal, according to newly released tapes. The fascinating audio recordings, made public today by the National Archives and Records Administration, capture some 3,700 hours of taped conversations between February 1971 and July 1973, with the most interesting those regarding the scandal that did, ultimately, see Nixon's head roll. President Nixon is also heard in the tapes, referring to the media as 'a law to themselves' with regards to the leaks. 'Press gets so concerned about this... bugging... why should they be a law to themselves? Why should they have a license to steal?' The recordings reveal that, in the hours after Nixon delivered a public Watergate address as the scandal exploded, two future presidents called him to express their private support - Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. Scroll down for audio . Tapes: In this April 29, 1974, file photo, President Richard M. Nixon points to the transcripts of the White House tapes after he announced during a nationally-televised speech that he would turn over the transcripts to House impeachment investigators, in Washington . The April 30, 1973, calls were . captured on a secret recording system that Nixon regularly used to tape . discussions with colleagues in . Washington as well as his foreign counterparts. The . final chronological installment of those tapes — 340 hours — were made . public by the National Archives and Records Administration, along with . more than 140,000 pages of text documents. Seven hundred hours remain . sealed for national security and privacy reasons. Reagan, then-California Governor, called late in the evening of April 30 to support Nixon after the 37th president delivered a landmark speech about the Watergate scandal, which was rapidly ensnaring him. Two top White House staffers and close Nixon confidants, H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, had resigned earlier in the day, as well as Attorney General Richard Kleindienst as the scandal picked up speed. White House counsel John W. Dean III was also fired that day. Reagan told Nixon the speech was the right one to make and sympathized with the staff exodus. 'I just want you to know, we watched and my heart was with you. I know what this must have been and what this must have been in all these days and what you've been through,' Reagan said. 'You can count on us, we're still behind you out here and I wanted you to know that you're in our prayers.' Reagon went on: 'I know how difficult it was, and I know what it must be with the fellows having to do what they did-' before Nixon cut him off: 'That's right, they had to get out.' Pals: The tapes also include conversations between Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, left, and President Richard M. Nixon from 1973 . Audio Source Nixon Presidential Library & Museum . At the end of the call, Reagan added . to the President: 'This too shall pass,' to which Nixon responded . 'Everything passes.' But it didn't. That . same evening, George Bush Sr., who had recently been appointed chairman . of the Republican National Committee, called to say he had watched the . speech with 'great pride.' This time, however, an angry and exhausted-sounding Nixon complained to Bush about the reaction from TV commentators. 'The folks may understand,' Nixon said, before adding later: 'To hell with the commentators.' Other interesting quotes pulled from the tapes by Nixon biographer John Aloysius Farrell include a conversation between the President and Kissinger in which they discussed what J. Edgar Hoover, the first director of the FBI, would have done had he been alive for Watergate. Kissinger said: 'If J. Edgar Hoover had been alive he would have handled Watergate for you in a way in which it would never have surfaced.' To which Nixon replied: 'Hoover would have had these clowns nailed for misdemeanors and given them a few weeks in the hoosegow and out!' Kissinger then added: 'And started blackmailing a few newsmen and this thing would have worked out.' 'Yeah. He (Hoover) blackmailed,' Nixon responded. Evidence: The original Nixon White House tape and original tape recorder are shown in an undated file photo from the National Archives. The last 340 hours of tapes from President Richard M. Nixon's White House were released Wednesday, August 21, 2013 . Of his adviser Leonard Garment, Nixon is heard saying: 'Goddamn his Jewish soul!' Wednesday's tapes also include topics . such as Vietnam, energy and a lengthy recording of Nixon and Soviet . leader Leonid Brezhnev chatting warmly in the Oval Office before a . historic summit in June 1973. Nixon . and Brezhnev met one-on-one with only an interpreter present for an . hour on June 18 and chatted about personal topics, including their . families. The . conversation happened before the start of a historic seven-day summit . that was part of Nixon's larger strategy of detente with the Soviet . Union. 'We must recognize, the two of us, . that ... we head the two most powerful nations and, while we will . naturally in negotiations have some differences, it is essential that . those two nations, where possible, work together,' Nixon told Brezhnev. 'If we decide to work together, we can change the world. That's what — that's my attitude as we enter these talks.' The . conversation is remarkable because of the camaraderie that is evident, . said Luke Nichter of Texas A&M University-Central Texas in Killeen, . who runs a website cataloging Nixon's secret recordings. Both men . discuss their children and Brezhnev even talks about his grandson's . attempts to pass college entrance exams. 'These are Cold War archenemies who are talking like old friends,' he said. 'This is very unusual.' The recordings were released at the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda and cover April 9, 1973, to July 12, 1973, the day before the existence of the covert recording system was revealed to a Senate committee probing Watergate. Previous tape releases show the president as a paranoid man who was not afraid to use bare-knuckle tactics to crush the enemies he saw all around him. Tapes released in 2009 show, in particular, Nixon's obsession with the Kennedy family. He considered Ted Kennedy such a political threat, for example, that he ordered surveillance in hopes of catching him in an affair. Nixon's second term was quickly overrun by the Watergate scandal, which began in 1972 when burglars tied to his re-election committee broke into the Democratic headquarters to get dirt on his political adversaries. Faced with impeachment and a possible criminal indictment, Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974 — a little more than a year after the tapes end — and retreated to his native California, where he was pardoned a month later by his successor, Gerald Ford. The Nixon Foundation released a statement regarding the release of the latest installment of tapes defending his presidency. 'Today's release of White House Records from the National Archives offers a classroom on major achievements of the Nixon Presidency,' the Foundation wrote.","The tapes include intimate discussions between President Richard Nixon, his aides and his colleagues in politics regarding the Watergate scandal .

Photos have emerged of the tragic final moments before an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer - in Las Vegas for his bachelor party - was killed on Sunday after his truck was stolen with him and his brother-in-law stuck in the truck bed before it was crashed into an oncoming car, throwing the two men to their deaths. The man who allegedly hijacked the vehicle, 29-year-old James Robert Montgomery, of Tustin, California, was staying in another hotel on the Vegas strip with his girlfriend when authorities say he jumped into Magdaleno's truck - which had the keys in the ignition at the time - and drove off. Montgomery, whose attorney, Michael Becker, describes as a 'lawful person' who works at a Whole Foods grocery store, told police after his arrest that he has no recollection of stealing the truck - he says he remembers walking around the Flamingo Hotel and being in a car crash, but that he can't remember anything in between, according to his arrest report. Doomed: Jesus Magdaleno and Feliz Cruz just before Magdaleno's hijacked truck collides with another vehicle . Mourned: Jesus Magdaleno Jr., 33, was an eight-year veteran of the California Highway Patrol. He was set to be married next month and was in Las Vegas for his bachelor party . According to authorities, Magdaleno Jr. was loading . his suitcases into his Ford F-150 with his brother-in-law Felix Cruz to . return home on Sunday, when Montgomery jumped into the running vehicle and . took off with Cruz still in the bed. Magdaleno, . 33, ran after the pickup, shouted that he was a CHP officer and jumped . into the cargo bed with his sister's husband, Mr Cruz, while the driver . sped wildly away from the Flamingo hotel-casino, according to a police . report. 'They were heading home after an enjoyable time, and they became victims of a horrible crime,' Las Vegas police Lieutenant Ray Steiber said. 'A vehicle is being stolen. His friend is in the bed of the vehicle. He runs to the aid of his friend who is in danger,' Steiber said of Magdaleno. 'He gave his life for someone else.' A witness on the 17th floor of a nearby casino heard the commotion and told police she saw the white 2009 Ford F150 accelerate away from the Strip, mow down construction cones and speed through red lights on an Interstate 15 overpass. The woman heard the two men in the back of the truck shouting for help before the pickup collided with a 2001 Ford Escape SUV and slammed into a traffic signal pole about 11 a.m. Sunday in front of the Rio All-Suites Hotel & Casino, about a mile west of the Flamingo. Magdaleno and Cruz were thrown from the bed of the truck. Amnesia: James Montgomery claims he has no memory of stealing Magdaleno's truck before crashing it into another vehicle . Magdaleno, an eight-year CHP veteran from Visalia, was killed. He was due to be married in September. Montgomery was arrested at the scene and hospitalized after the crash. He was booked into the Clark County jail on felony murder, kidnapping, auto theft, battery and robbery charges pending an initial court appearance. Three people in the SUV were treated for minor injuries, police Officer Laura Meltzer said. Death Trap: Magdaleno's truck (far right) collided with both another vehicle and a traffic signal pole before it came to a tragic stop . Montgomery spoke with a taxi driver before climbing into the driver's seat of Magdaleno's pickup, the arrest report said. Surveillance footage showed Magdaleno chase the vehicle and jump in the bed when it stopped for traffic. The videos were impounded as evidence and not made public. Flamingo owner Caesars Entertainment Corp. spokeswoman Debbie Munch issued a statement extending sympathy to the families and friends of the two men. She said the company was cooperating with the police investigation. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson . said the charges against Montgomery could make him eligible for the . death penalty, but a decision about that is weeks away. Becker said outside . court on Wednesday that he's not talking anymore about the case against Montgomery until he sees evidence police have collected since the Sunday . morning crash. ""This case, I think there's more to it than meets the surface,"" Becker said.

Fountains of purple dye shower the streets of Srinagar in Kashmir - but this isn't a festive occasion. These protestors engulfed in coloured water are government employees who took to the streets of the Kashmiri summer capital today to demand better employee rights, including retirement age enhancement and an end to pay anomalies. The police weilding the water cannons use the brightly-coloured dye for one reason only - to identify and arrest dissidents. Defiant: Hundreds of furious government employees gathered this afternoon at the Sher-e-Kashmir Municipal Park to begin their demonstration demanding better working conditions . Police used high-velocity jets of water and batons to break up the march, which began in the afternoon at the Sher-e-Kashmir Municipal Park. Reports said some two dozen employees had been arrested during the protest. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has seen a rise in violent protests recently, with a revival of . anti-Indian sentiment among the Kashmiri Valley population seeing . attacks on security forces and a growing level of tension across the . Indian-controlled region. Many Kashmiris feel India has not made enough concessions to the region, and security sources say the rise of more conservative strains of Islam and high unemployment have fuelled unrest. Laws protecting security forces from . trial are still in place, access to new technology is limited - . including basic methods such as text messaging - and there is a heavy . military and police presence in the state. In recent years, the government has been accused of trying to criminalise protesters and curb public speaking. Flood: The demonstrators marched towards the high security residence of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah at Gupkar Road . Demands: Reports say dozens of protestors were arrested as they called for an increase of the retirement age from 58 to 60 years, a release of arrears, a salary boost and regularisation of their jobs . All this adds to the territorial dispute across the former princely state of Kashmir, that sees it split between Pakistani, Indian and Chinese rule. Now an approaching general election has led some to accuse the government of manipulating this instability. Following the deaths of five Indian soldiers on the Pakistani-Indian border through Kashmir on August 6, Pakistani Prime Minister called for better relations with India in an attempt to ease the strain across the region. In today's protests, government employees marched towards Jammu and the high-security Gupkar Road residence of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah.","Hundreds of protestors take to streets of Srinagar .

Humphrey has run a consultancy in China called ChinaWhys since 2003. In the past he has carried out work for GSK, though it is not yet clear if the pair’s arrest is linked to the UK drug company. Probe: Peter Humphrey and his wife, Yu Yingzeng, were detained in Shanghai on July 10 as police looked into bribery allegations against GlaxoSmithKline, whose headquarters in south-west London are pictured . Last month Chinese authorities said GSK had funnelled £312m through travel agencies to bribe doctors and officials. China is also investigating French drug firm Sanofi over corruption allegations. In China, an arrest . typically means police believe they have enough evidence for a case to . be brought to trial. Detentions can last for weeks and end in release . without charges being filed. China has taken a tough stance on corruption and high prices in the pharmaceutical industry as it unrolls wider healthcare access and faces an estimated £650billion healthcare bill by 2020. A British Embassy spokesman said: ‘We can confirm the arrest of a British national, Peter Humphrey, in Shanghai on Monday the 19th of August. We are currently providing consular assistance.’ Operations abroad: A flag bearing the logo of GlaxoSmithKline flutters next to a Chinese national flag outside a GSK office building in Shanghai . A statement issued by one of Humphrey's relatives said lawyers told the family that the couple had been detained last month because they broke a law related to buying private information. ChinaWhys is a business risk advisory firm co-founded by Humphrey and Yu that has done work with drugs companies, including GSK, separate sources have said. Humphrey worked as a journalist for Reuters in the 1980s and 90s. The ChinaWhys website says he has been a risk management specialist and corporate detective for 14 years. Four executives from mining giant Rio Tinto were jailed for taking bribes and stealing commercial secrets in 2010. Three of those executives were Chinese. The fourth was a Chinese-born Australian.","Peter Humphrey and Yu Yingzeng detained by Chinese police since July .

A California professor facing up to 18 years in prison for setting off a series of fires after his son killed himself is pleading for leniency, saying he was overwhelmed with grief. Rainer Reinscheid apologised for his actions on Tuesday during a three-hour sentencing hearing. It included speeches from his friends and colleagues, as well as school officials who said the fires - and threats written in Reinscheid's emails - terrorized them. Rainer Klaus Reinscheid is facing up to 18 years in prison for setting a series of fires after his son killed himself . The former UCI professor watches with his attorneys, Joshua Glotzer, center, and Dan Leib, left, as his wife Wendy Reinscheid walks into court to give a statement . The hearing is set to resume Wednesday afternoon. Reinscheid, a pharmaceutical sciences professor at the University of California, Irvine, whose private emails described graphic plans to attack his late son's high school and kill students, told the court that the irrational thoughts that drove his behavior in the weeks after his 14-year-old son committed suicide have disappeared. Now, Reinscheid said he wants to return to his native Germany and find work to support his family and care for his younger child, acknowledging his academic career is over, the Associated Press reports. Reinscheid, 49, is on unpaid leave from UC Irvine.'I lost my son, and then I lost myself,' Reinscheid told the court. 'Now, I am asking you, your honor, and many other people, to forgive me and show mercy.' Reinscheid faces a prison sentence that could range from three to 18 years after he pleaded guilty last month to six counts of arson, three counts of attempted arson, and resisting or obstructing an officer. Claas Stubbe, pictured on a class trip to the Grand Canyon, hanged himself in March 2012 after getting in trouble at his high school . Reinscheid, who set fires at his late son's school, a school administrator's home and a nearby park, said he was so overwhelmed with grief after his son killed himself that he wrote and did things he would not normally do . Reinscheid walks to the podium to read a statement of remorse to the court . Colleagues and friends described Reinscheid as a brilliant scientist, a dedicated researcher, a trustworthy friend and devoted and doting father who was distraught after his son's death. The teen hanged himself with a belt in an Irvine park in March 2012 after he was disciplined by an administrator at University High School for allegedly stealing from the school store. School officials and teachers, however, said the series of fires Reinscheid set - and the emails that described Reinscheid's plan to buy machine guns, shoot students, commit sexual assaults and burn the school before killing himself - drove people in the 2,800-member campus to live in fear.'That tragedy (his son's death) cannot serve as justification for terrorizing a school community and staff members who have dedicated their lives to helping others,' Irvine Unified Superintendent Terry L. Walker wrote in a statement read aloud to the court by a fellow administrator. Prosecutors previously filed with the court three emails that they say detail Reinscheid's plans for a mass murder at University High in revenge for his son's death . Orange County Superior Court Judge Gregg Prickett listens to a victim impact statement. Reinscheid faces a prison sentence that could range from three to 18 years . No charges were filed directly related to the emails. Reinscheid's wife, Wendy, told the court she and her husband were encouraged to write down their thoughts by a therapist to help them get out negative feelings after the boy died. But prosecutor Andrew Katz told the court these writings can't be brushed off as mere musings. He noted they came after two high school students kept a journal chronicling their plans to attack Columbine High School, and after a shooter told a therapist about his violent thoughts and later sprayed gunfire on patrons at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo. Reinscheid has worked at UC Irvine for about a dozen years. His research included studying molecular pharmacology and psychiatric disorders, including studies of schizophrenia, stress, emotional behavior and sleep.","Rainer Reinscheid faces 18 years in prison for setting a series of fires .

Bradley Manning has revealed that she wants to live as a woman named Chelsea and intends to undergo hormone therapy to begin her transition to a female. The 25-year-old soldier, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison on Wednesday for leaking thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks, made the shock announcement through her attorney on the Today show on Thursday. 'As I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female,' Manning wrote in the statement entitled, 'The Next Stage of My Life'. 'Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition.' Scroll down for video . New identity: Bradley Manning has announced that she wishes to be referred to as Chelsea Manning. In this undated photo provided by the U.S. Army, Manning poses for a photo wearing a wig and lipstick . New life: Manning, pictured outside the Maryland court on Tuesday, said she has felt she is a woman since her childhood. On Wednesday, she was sentenced to 35 years behind bars for leaking documents . She added that she now wishes to be referred to as Chelsea and as a 'she' rather than a 'he'. On Thursday, Manning's lawyer David Coombs denied she was making this announcement for the attention or because she was a narcissist. 'Chelsea didn't want to have this be something that overshadowed the case,' Coombs explained. He added that Fort Leavenworth, where Manning is serving her term, does not provide hormone therapy for soldiers, but that he hoped the facility would 'do the right thing' and provide it. 'If not, I am going to everything in my power to make sure everything is done to force them,' he said. On Thursday morning, an Army spokesman told CBS News: 'The Army does not provide hormone therapy or sex-reassignment surgery for gender identity disorder.' Military inmates have access to mental health professionals, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and behavioral science specialists, she said. Coombs added that he had not yet spoken to Manning about gender realignment surgery - or whether she expected Fort Leavenworth to cover the costs of the operation. He also did not expand on whether Manning would eventually be moved to a female facility. Announcement: Manning's lawyer David Coombs released his statement on the Today show on Thursday . Support: David Coombs said he will force Fort Leavenworth to pay for the hormone therapy treatment . 'The ultimate goal is to feel comfortable in her skin,' he said. During the 12-week trial, the Army . released an image showing Manning wearing a . blonde wig and makeup in a photograph she had taken herself. Manning had . sent the picture to her therapist in an email with the subject 'My . Problem' as she struggled with her gender identity in April 2010. Below is the full statement Manning shared with the Today show on Thursday: . Subject: The Next Stage of My Life . I . want to thank everybody who has supported me over the last three years. Throughout this long ordeal, your letters of support and encouragement . have helped keep me strong. I am forever indebted to those who wrote to . me, made a donation to my defense fund, or came to watch a portion of . the trial. I would especially like to thank Courage to Resist and the . Bradley Manning Support Network for their tireless efforts in raising . awareness for my case and providing for my legal representation. As . I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know . the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I . feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as . soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition. I . also request that, starting today, you refer to me by my new name and . use the feminine pronoun (except in official mail to the confinement . facility). I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and . having the opportunity to write back. Thank you, . Chelsea E. Manning . 'She never really wanted this to be public,' Coombs added of Manning's identity and the photograph. 'Now that it is, unfortunately, you have to deal with it in a public manner.' Throughout the trial, her lawyers had argued that Manning was under incredible stress at the time of the leaks as she struggled with gender identity disorder in the masculine environment of the Army. 'The stress that he was under was mostly to give context to what was going on at the time,' Coombs told Savannah Guthrie on Today. 'It was never an excuse because that's not what drove his actions. What drove his actions was a strong moral compass.' A psychiatrist, Navy Reserve Captain David Moulton, testified during Manning's trial that she suffered from gender dysphoria, or wanting to be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Defense lawyers had argued that Manning had been increasingly isolated and under intense stress when she leaked the files, and that her superiors had ignored warning signs. They cited erratic behavior, including sending a picture of her dressed as a woman to a superior and punching another soldier. On Wednesday, Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking an unprecedented volume of classified documents to WikiLeaks. Coombs added on Thursday that he did not expect Manning to serve her full sentence - and even expected President Obama to pardon the soldier. The first class Army private appeared not to show any emotion when her long-awaited fate was read out, though spectators gasped inside the military courtroom at Fort Meade, Maryland. Because of the 1,294 days she has already spent in custody, Manning will immediately shave three and a half years off her 35-year term. She is eligible for parole after serving at least one-third of the sentence, which means she could be free in eight years, when she's 33 or 34 years old. Troubled time: Manning was isolated and alone in the Army because of her desire to dress in female clothing . 'Red flags': Defense attorneys said superiors should have recognized issues Manning was having . Manning also learned she will be reduced . in grade to the rank of private E1, dishonorably discharged from the . military and forfeit all pay and allowances. In . a press conference following the hearing, Coombs . said he was saddened by the sentence, adding that it didn't represent . the harm his client had caused. He . said: 'When I heard the sentence I thought to myself ""I have . represented hundreds of clients some of them have committed murders and . some have molested children and those clients received less time than . private Manning.""' Manning's sentencing, lasting just a . couple of minutes, capped off a 12-week trial and a much longer legal . battle over the former intelligence analyst's intentions when she reached . out to WikiLeaks. Following . the hearing, Manning was quickly ushered out of the court where she was . met by supporters who shouted 'we'll keep fighting for you Bradley' and . 'you're our hero.' Younger years: Manning, who was apparently considering transitioning to become a woman when she returned from the warzone, has said she does not like seeing pictures of herself as a young boy . Struggle: Manning, pictured as a child, was bullied throughout school for being gay, friends have said . The . sentence was more severe than many had expected, and is much longer . than any punishment previously given to a U.S. government leaker. The . soldier's supporters are planning protest rallies in cities including . Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Chicago, Denver, . Minneapolis, New York and Boston. The . former intelligence analyst was found guilty last month of 20 crimes, . including six violations of the Espionage Act, as part of the Obama . administration's unprecedented crackdown on media leaks. But . the judge acquitted her of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, . an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole. Prosecutors portrayed Manning . as 'the determined insider,' an anarchist hacker and traitor who started . working within weeks of his 2009 deployment to provide WikiLeaks and . its founder Julian Assange with exactly what they wanted. Emotional: In this courtroom sketch made Wednesday, Manning is escorted from the courtroom as spectators gasp and cry. She will be eligible for parole after eight years . The government had urged the military . judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, to sentence her to 60 years in prison for . crimes that include six Espionage Act violations, five theft counts and . computer fraud. Manning . and her defense team maintain she was an idealistic soldier with a pure . motive - to expose brutal truths about America's military and . diplomatic corps. Manning's . mother in Wales, Susan Manning, who is in poor health following a . stroke, said she cried out and ran from the living room in her home . after hearing the sentence. 'I . hope it will be reduced,' his uncle Kevin Fox added BBC television. 'To be honest, . he shouldn't have been given any time at all. In my eyes, he is a . hero.' In a statement, . WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge at the Ecuadorean . Embassy in London, decried Manning's trial and conviction as 'an . affront to basic concepts of Western justice.' Fight: A Manning supporter holds a sign as she demonstrates in front of the White House on Wednesday . Speaking out: Groups gathered in front of the White House after the lengthy jail term was announced . But he called the sentence a 'significant strategic victory' as Manning could be free as early as 2021. The . leaked material included video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed . at least two civilians -- a Reuters news photographer and his driver. 'I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people,' Manning said in a courtroom apology. The 700,000 leaked documents . endangered the lives of U.S. intelligence sources and prompted several . ambassadors to be recalled, reassigned or expelled, prosecutors showed.","The Army private, 25, said in a statement that she has known since childhood that she is female and wishes to be referred to as a woman .

Incoming freshmen at Georgia Tech in Atlanta got the most memorable welcome speech of all time from an upperclassman who encouraged the class of 2018 to not just stand on but ‘CRUSH the shoulders of giants!’ To the slowly building theme music of 2001: A Space Odyssey theme, Nick Selby’s speech began as most typically do but crescendoed into a convocation address so epic and inspired that each fresh-faced student in attendance is sure to walk into their first class ready, in Selby’s words, ‘to do the impossible.’ Even if that means building the Iron Man suit. Scroll down for video... Starts slow: Georgia Tech sophomore Nick Selby's freshman welcome speech began with typical advice then became an unforgettable address like none other . Selby is part infomercial salesman, part evangelist, and Georgia Tech school spirit. He gives a typical uplifting speech quote: 'If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.'

'Brace yourselves for a hell of a ride on your way to becoming a hell of an engineer.' Applause: The yellow beanie-wearing crowd of future engineers first gave confused, nervous applause, but eventually gave Selby the standing ovation he deserved . Selby’s popularity has quickly skyrocketed since his speech hit Youtube. He’s even a caught the eye of some female fans who see great potential in the humorous and brainy sophomore.
