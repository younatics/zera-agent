The arrival of Prince William’s first child is to be marked with a commemorative coin. The £5 silver coin will feature an image of St George and the Dragon first seen on a sovereign designed by Italian engraver Benedetto in 1817. It was used last year on a limited edition coin to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. Celebration: The arrival of Prince William's first child is to be marked with a commemorative coin. He is pictured with the Duchess of Cambridge last month . A source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The . Royal Mint’s plan is to announce it will be bringing out the silver coin . when the royal baby is born.’ The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge do not know the sex of their baby, which is expected imminently. Photographers and reporters have been camped for days outside St Mary’s hospital in London, where the Duchess is imminently due to give birth to the future heir. The Royal Mint has already revealed that babies born on the same day as the new prince or princess will be given a ‘lucky’ silver penny. Bookmakers have revealed they have taken a large number of bets on the potential name of the Royal couple's child. Excitement: Photographers and reporters have been camped for days outside St Mary's hospital in London, where the Duchess is imminently due to give birth to the future heir . Interest: The press ladders of photographers can be seen outside the hospital . One of the names which many members of the public believe the baby could be called is George. Bookmakers give the odds of the baby being called George at 10-1. If William and Kate named their child George, it would become King George VII. It is believed the Royal Baby could result in a £250 million boost for Britain's shops. Speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge was expecting an early birth was quashed earlier this week after it emerged that Prince William plans to play in a charity polo match tomorrow. The father-to-be will take part in the game at Cirencester Polo Club in Gloucestershire but he will not be accompanied by his heavily pregnant wife. She will not want to leave her London ‘safety zone’ so close to her due date. Kate herself let slip earlier this year that their baby was due in mid-July, a fact which has since been confirmed by palace officials.","Image first seen on sovereign designed by Italian engraver Benedetto .

A father-of-three discovered he was suffering with the early stages of skin cancer after he cut his face while shaving. Stephen Hinchliffe, 59, from York, was urged by his wife to get checked after a razor nick failed to heal. His GP immediately sent him for a biopsy which diagnosed the cancer and he has now made a full recovery. Initially, Stephen wasn't concerned when he cut himself. But over several days his cut grew, became raised and changed colour. When his GP saw his face he ordered an immediate biopsy which revealed cancer . Stephen, who is married to Sue, 60, and has three daughters, Lauren, 31, Suzanne, 30 and Leah, 27, said: 'I was having a shave and nicked my skin. 'There was a slight cut and it bled but it wasn't anything unusual so I didn't think anything of it. 'I thought it would heal in a couple of days. I thought I'd just taken the top layer off my skin but over the course of a few days it started to change colour.' The wound also started to change shape, grow bigger and become slightly raised. 'Although I thought it was unusual, I was just going to leave it and see if it healed over time. It was my wife who urged me to get it checked out. I thought I would be wasting the doctors' time but Sue told me that it couldn't harm and it's best to know about these things. Stephen had always worn sunscreen while holidaying abroad, but it was doing everyday activities like gardening that caught him out . Stephen, accounts manager for an international tyre company, was sent straight to York Hospital for further tests. 'I was given a biopsy at the hospital that very same day. No one seemed to know what was wrong so they took some cell samples from my cheek.' Ten days later, when the results came back, Stephen was diagnosed with skin cancer. Doctors told him that he has a very thin melanoma which was around 1mm in depth. Stephen went for an operation a few days after he was diagnosed, where 1cm of skin surrounding the cut was removed from his cheek. Since the operation, Stephen has been given the all clear and now must attend a check-up every six months. He said: 'They said it's less common than other skin cancers but it much more dangerous if it's not found early. 'They think it is likely that it was triggered by the sun. 'I was in complete shock when I heard the news. I thought the doctor was going to say it was nothing, maybe just an infection or something, and never expected anything like that. 'I am so grateful to my wife that she encouraged me to get checked. God only knows how long I would have waited if she hadn't said anything. 'The fact it was caught earlier means it was much easier to treat. I'm so happy that I've been given the all clear now but I know that, had it not been for cutting myself and Sue's persistence, things could have been a lot worse.' He is now urging people to use sun tan cream and is backing a campaign by national charity Macmillan. Stephen said: 'I tell everyone now to wear a high factor sun cream when they're outdoors - even when they're doing everyday things like gardening. It's now part of my daily regime to put cream on - I've learned the hard way about the consequences of not being careful in the sun' Stephen said he had always been careful to wear sunscreen while holidaying abroad, but it was doing everyday activities like going out walking, gardening or playing sport when people can get caught out. 'I tell everyone now to wear a high factor sun cream when they're outdoors. It's now part of my daily regime to put cream on - I've learned the hard way about the consequences of not being careful in the sun. 'I've realised that you can't be too careful. UV rays are there all the time, even if it doesn't seem sunny. 'I hope that my experience can in some way help others and encourage people to take more care in the sun.' The number of people diagnosed with malignant melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, in the UK is on the rise with 35 people diagnosed every day. Carol Goodman, skin cancer nurse specialist on the Macmillan Support Line, said: 'Research shows that, despite being aware of the health risks, people are still burning themselves in the sun in order to get a tan. 'As we start to look forward to summer after one of the coldest winters yet, it is alarming that staying safe in the sun is not a priority for many people. 'Sunburn will cause serious damage to your skin which can lead to cancer. A diagnosis of malignant melanoma can be just as fatal as some other cancers. 'It is vital to protect your skin when out in the sun by using sun tan lotion, wearing sun protective clothing including hats and sunglasses or staying in the shade between the hours of 11am and 3pm.""

A speech written for President Kennedy which was scooped up out of an aeroplane rubbish bin has come to light. The speech dates back to the days before JFK became the 35th President of the US and was serving as senator for Massachusetts. It was found by cleaner Arne Swanson as she tidied an American Airlines plane after he had landed at Chicago Midway Airport in September 1960. The manuscript was penned by one of JFK's speech writers but has numerous scribbles and annotations from the future president scrawled across the page . '[...We boast to] foreign visitors of our great dams and cities and wealth but not our free religious heritage. We have become missionaries abroad of a wide range of doctrines - free enterprise, anticommunism, and pro-Americanism - but rarely the doctrine of religious liberty.'This is not a party issue. 'It is not a matter of legislation. But it calls for leadership . dedicated to our Nation's spiritual ideals - leadership inspiring in its . sense of moral values - and leadership passionate in its devotion to . the American heritage of liberty. 'It calls for a President whose every . utterance will lift the hearts of those around the world who thirst for . power or plenty - but who thirst even more for a leader of conviction . and courage and compassion. 'And it calls, finally, for a whole . Nation willing to recapture the spirit of 1847, willing to commit itself . once again to great ends, willing to dedicate itself to the enrichment . of our society as well as our lives. 'I have called that challenge the New . Frontier - for it represents - not the comforts we seek - but the tasks . we must all perform, if we are to live up to our trust and our . heritage. 'Tonight I ask the people of Utah to . join me on that frontier - to work with me, and with Americans of every . creed and section, in building a still greater Nation - and in building a . world where the strong are just and the weak secure. 'Then - but only then - can we truly heed the command which Brigham . Young heard from the Lord more than a century ago - the command he . conveyed to his little band of followers: ""Go as pioneers .... to a . land of peace."" Mrs Swanson took the speech home with her and it remained in her attic for almost 50 years. It was delivered by JFK at the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake . City, Utah on September 23, 1960, during his presidential campaign. It ran to four pages, . the last of which was found by Mrs Swanson,  and concentrated on the threat . of Communism to world peace and its 'implacable, insatiable, unceasing . in its drive for world domination'. In it JFK also thanked the Mormons 'for their pioneer spirit, their devotion to culture and learning, their example of industry and self-reliance.' John F. Kennedy, 1960 Democratic Presidential nominee, thanks the Democratic National Convention for selecting him. Kennedy told the convention: ""We shall carry the fight to the people... And we shall win."" JFK was the youngest president elected to office at the age of 43 and served from January 20, 1961, to November 22, 1963 - when he was assassinated in Dallas. The speech, written on a sheet of yellow lined paper, is set to fetch £3,000. Max . Hasler, a book and manuscript expert at Bloomsbury auctions in London, . said: 'It is an early draft of the speech and is very different from the . speech that was actually delivered by Kennedy, presumably that's why it . ended up in the bin. The speech was found by American Airlines cleaner Arne Swanson after JFK disembarked at Chicago Midway Airport in September 1960 . 'Arne Swanson worked for American Airlines and her job was to remove all of the waste from the plane. 'She held onto this for quite some time. 'This will likely appeal to collectors of Americana as well as institutions, possibly the Library of Congress. 'He has crossed a few things out and made lots of amendments so he obviously wasn't very happy with it.' President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, at 12.30pm on November 22, 1963, while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over unrest in the Democratic Party. State funeral of John F. Kennedy took place in Washington, D.C. over the three days that followed his assassination on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas . He was shot once in the upper back and killed with a shot to the head.The president was taken to the Parkland Hospital but pronounced dead half an hour later. Aged just 46, JFK died younger than any US president to date. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder of a local police officer and was subsequently charged with the assassination of Kennedy. He denied shooting anyone . and claimed he was being made a scapegoat for the murder but was . himself killed by Jack Ruby two days later before he could be brought to . trial.

Labour media spokesman Harriet Harman is employing a political adviser recruited from the lobbyists pushing for statutory regulation of the free Press. Gavin Freeguard was until recently working for the Media Standards Trust and its spin-off Hacked Off campaign which is spearheaded by actors Hugh Grant and Steve Coogan, and Formula 1 tycoon Max Mosley. The trust was founded by Sir David Bell, controversially chosen to be one of the assessors assisting Lord Justice Leveson to write his report on the future of newspapers. It will be published tomorrow. New boss:  Harriet Harman, left, is employing political adviser Gavin Freeguard, right, who has been recruited from the lobbyists pushing for statutory regulation of the free Press . As the Mail recently revealed, Bell is at the heart of a powerful nexus of left-of-centre individuals, many of whom are linked to the Leveson Inquiry. He is also a trustee of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which was behind the disastrous BBC Newsnight report that led to the smearing of former Tory Party treasurer Lord McAlpine as a paedophile. Freeguard’s presence in Miss Harman’s team chimes with her already declared support for an end to any kind of Press self-regulation. The deputy Labour leader spoke at a Hacked Off meeting at the recent Labour Party Conference. Freeguard, who now describes himself as Miss Harman’s ‘political adviser’ and a ‘sad media geek’, had worked for the Media Standards Trust since shortly after he left Oxford University in 2007. He was a ‘senior editor’ as well as the administrator of the MST-run Orwell Prize. As such he oversaw the Johann Hari debacle, in which the coveted political writing award was given to a serial liar, plagiarist and Wikipedia profile hacker. Lord Justice Leveson, pictured, will publish his report on the future of newspapers tomorrow . Hari returned the prize money only after a storm of protest and irrefutable evidence of his misdeeds, which had been exposed by publications such as Private Eye long before the award. Freeguard’s most notable public role to date came long before that when, aged 17, he became the youngest-ever contestant on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? He won £32,000. Freeguard’s Twitter feed, which ended within weeks of his joining Miss Harman’s office, is instructive. Last October he was in charge of Hacked Off’s Twitter coverage of the Leveson Inquiry. The same month there was a snipe at media commentator Ray Snoddy, for suggesting that Sir David Bell’s place on the Leveson assessor panel was wrong given his role with the MST. (From the left) Steve Coogan, Hugh Grant and Max Mosley pictured at an inquiry into journalistic ethics . In contrast, pronouncements by Professor Brian Cathcart, founder of Hacked Off and arch-critic of the popular Press, were variously described by Freeguard as ‘brilliant’, ‘excellent’ and ‘remarkable’. In January Freeguard re-tweeted a report about his future boss: ‘Harriet Harman declares she is going to be a champion of Press freedom.’ In February, following the announcement of his imminent transfer to the Harman team, he declared: ‘Absolutely pathetic backtracking from Cameron on Leveson. Utterly pathetic.’ Last night Freeguard said of his role under Miss Harman: ‘I provide her with briefing, research and advice on issues within the DCMS brief.’ A spokesman for Miss Harman said of Mr Freeguard’s appointment: ‘The post was advertised. Gavin was the most qualified for the job.’","Gavin Freeguard worked for Hugh Grant's Hacked Off campaign and Media Standards Trust founded by Sir David Bell - assessor assisting Leveson .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:36 EST, 13 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:39 EST, 13 April 2013 . Police are handing out on-the-spot tickets - for good behaviour. Officers in south Manchester have started dishing out the tickets to children and teenagers they see behaving well on the neighbourhood's streets. The 'positive tickets' have so far been given out when officers see youths using pedestrian crossings, putting their litter in the bin, riding their bike on the road instead of the pavement or using bike lights at night. The scheme is currently being trialled around Didsbury and Chorlton - with the aim of encouraging good behaviour among youngsters. So far around 20 tickets have been given out by police officers and PCSOs, with plans to extend it to other areas if successful. It is hoped vouchers for activities like the cinema, or to spend in shops, could be given out if a sponsor for the tickets can be found. Police are handing out on-the-spot tickets for good behaviour . And the scheme has been welcomed. Mario Culpeper, 21, served a year in a young offenders' institute for a violent street robbery and was well-known to police growing up in Chorlton. Mario, who now lives in Withington, said: 'I used to think badly of the police and think I was always getting picked on by them. I think if they had done something like this scheme when I was younger it might have helped. Hopefully, it will change other peoples' opinions of police."" But other teenagers weren't so impressed by the scheme. Ryan O'Flaherty, 18, from Withington said: 'I have been stopped by the police a couple of times for no reason. 'When they do, you immediately think you've done something wrong and are guilty. 'Positive tickets' can be given . out to youths putting their . litter in the bin . 'This idea might make people think about their actions and encourage good behaviour but maybe there are better ways they could do it, like going into schools."" Callum Woodworth, 16, from Northern Moor, said: ""I don't see the point of this, I think it's a waste of time. 'People should be putting litter in the bin anyway. 'It would be good to get to know your local police better, but maybe in another way.' Sergeant Tariq Butt, who is based at the Elizabeth Slinger Road police station in West Didsbury and who came up with the idea, said: 'As police officers and PCSOs, we only ever issue tickets in negative situations, so this is refreshing not only for ourselves, but also for youngsters who get to see a different side to us. 'When officers first approach people they assume they must have done something wrong, but when we explain the reason for issuing the ticket they are pleasantly surprised and think it's a great idea. 'Then if we see them again they always acknowledge us. 'Handing out these tickets allows us to engage with young people in a really positive way, and so far they have appreciated us stopping to speak to them. 'I believe this scheme will help to reinforce positive behaviour, and I plan to extend it by encouraging local businesses to donate items such as cinema tickets and discount vouchers which can be handed out with the tickets.'","The scheme is currently being trialled around Didsbury and Chorlton .

If you thought the weather forecast was too good to be true, you were probably right. The BBC has been forced to apologise on air for ignoring official weather predictions and forecasting sun when rain was on the way. Forecasters stuck to their own assessment of the weather and disregarded stormy warnings from the Met Office –  and as a result, many viewers were caught unawares when the heavens opened in parts of the country yesterday. Wet: Festival-goers at the V Festival in Staffordshire endured soggy conditions while temperatures soared across southern Britain to 30C. Weatherman Philip Avery made an embarrassed apology for the errors . Yesterday afternoon, weatherman Philip Avery made an embarrassed apology for the errors on the BBC News channel. He admitted: ‘There are thunderstorms which were not represented in our  forecasts over the past couple of days or so. 'I have to say we can’t even blame the computers, the computers actually wanted to put those thunderstorms in there but forecasters thought that it wasn’t supported by enough evidence and so we went for the dry, hot option. ‘Having said that, apologies to anyone who has had their next few hours ruined.’ Ominous: Dark clouds were seen as rain delayed play during the Third Investec Test Match at Lord's Cricket Ground in London yesterday . Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘The weather team always endeavour to be open about forecasting and it was right to explain why today’s forecast didn’t capture weather events in some regions. ‘This was done following discussions with Met Office colleagues.’ While those in the south yesterday might not have minded the odd refreshing shower, those in the north were probably less thrilled. Temperatures soared to 30C (86F) in southern areas, but the rest of the country had a gloomy day of cloud and showers. An estimated half a million flocked to beaches at Brighton and Bournemouth to enjoy the hottest weekend of the year. The mercury hit 32.4C (90.32F) at the village of Cavendish in Suffolk on Saturday, and early indications were that yesterday was not far behind in the south east. A high of 30.6C (87.1F) was reached in Cambridge, and 30C (86F) in London. Wet revellers: After yesterday's sunshine the weather turned bad at the V-Festival in Weston Park, Staffordshire as a heavy band of rain swept across the West Midlands .

But across the north, west and Wales, temperatures were just 22C (72F) at best, although still above the 21C (70F) average for the time of year. There was surface water flooding in places, and a heavy band of rain over the Midlands in the afternoon left the 150,000 attending the V Festival in Staffordshire drenched. Yet back in the south, supermarkets saw bumper sales of ice cream and barbecue meat. In London, tourists jumped into Trafalgar Square to cool off, and England’s cricketers sweltered against South Africa at Lord’s. In Wigan and Manchester, however, conditions were rather breezier for footballers playing their first match of the season. It will remain very warm in the south east and east of England today with a high of 25C (77F), but will again be slightly cooler in northern and western areas. Temperatures will fall back to a more typical 22C (72F) across southern England by Wednesday and rain will be moving in towards the Bank Holiday weekend.","Temperatures soared to 30C (86F) in southern areas, but the rest of the country had a gloomy day of cloud and showers ."

A senior editor of Rolling Stone has been forced to apologize after he tweeted a sarcastic and profane comment in response to the controversy stirred up by the cover of the latest issue featuring suspected Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. 'I guess we should have drawn a d*** on Dzhokhar’s face or something?' Christian Hoard wrote on his Twitter account Wednesday morning. The comment was later removed from the page, and Mr Hoard issued an apology Thursday for his online outburst. Lashing out: Senior Rolling Stone editor Christian Hoard had to apologize on Twitter after making a sarcastic comment about the controversial magazine cover . Flippant: Hoard's tweet was in response to claims that the magazine glamorized Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on the cover of the latest issue . Walk-back: Hoard later removed the offensive comment and issued an apology for his tweet - but not for the cover . ‘Yesterday I made a sarcastic remark here in response to the RS cover controversy. I stand by our cover, but not my tweet - it was inappropriate and disrespectful. I'm sorry,’ the tweet said, according to Fox News. Some Twitter users were dissatisfied with Hoard’s reaction to the scandal surrounding the cover. ‘Have some conviction. If you felt that way, let it stand. And the cover is awful,’ wrote Rob Katz. The cover has sparked a nationwide backlash, with Rolling Stone's critics accusing the magazine of glamorizing the 19-year-old suspected terrorist by presenting him as a tousled-haired, brooding heartthrob in the mold of The Doors frontman Jim Morrison. Boston Mayor Tom Menino and Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick accused the magazine of offering Tsarnaev 'celebrity treatment' and called the cover 'ill-conceived, at best' in a letter written by Menino to Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner. 'The survivors of the Boston attacks deserve Rolling Stone cover stories, though I no longer feel that Rolling Stone deserves them,' the letter stated. Members of law enforcement have slammed Dzhokhar's softly lit 'selfie' featured in the issue now on on newsstands as an affront to anyone who has ever worn a uniform. One of them, Massachusetts State Police photographer Sgt Sean Murphy, was so incensed with Rolling Stone's glitzy treatment of the suspected bomber that he ended up leaking a series of previously unseen photos of Tsarnaev's dramatic arrest in Watertown, Mass. The images, which Murphy handed over to Boston Magazine, show the alleged bomber bruised and bloodied with his hands in the air as he emerges from his final hiding place.

Murphy's actions have received a lot of support on social media platforms, with more than 7,000 people having 'liked' a 'Save Sgt. Sean Murphy' Facebook page .

'I hope that the people who see these images will know that this was real. It was as real as it gets,' wrote Murphy in a posting on the magazine’s website. 'This may have played out as a television show, but this was not a television show.' Murphy has been suspended for the unauthorized release of the gory images and is now facing a possible termination. However, the police photographer’s plight has sparked an outpouring of support nationwide, which has led to the creation of a 'Save Sgt Sean Murphy' Facebook page. By Saturday evening, the page has drawn more than 20,900 'likes.' The social media portal has been launched with the intent to help save Murphy's job with the state police. 'He did what I think most of us would have liked to do or would have done had we had the same resources,' the creator of the page wrote. Widespread support: The 'Save Sgt Sean Murphy' Facebook page created to help a state police photographer save his job after he had released photos of Dzhokhar has drwan more than 21,000 'likes' Speaking to the New York Post Saturday, the woman behind the page explained that she has been deeply touched by the predicament of the officer, even though she does not know him personally. 'It just hit me very hard that this poor guy, Sgt. Murphy, is getting reprimanded and could lose his job,' she said. 'What Sgt. Murphy did was something all of us wish we could have done.' The beleaguered photographer’s champion, who identified herself to the Post as ‘Lisa,' said that she has been getting support from retired police officers, and most importantly, even from within the state police. According to the creator of the Facebook page, officials from the law enforcement agency have told her that while Sgt Murphy may face a penalty, he does not deserve to lose his job over his actions, which some cops have touted as heroic. ‘I'm getting people wanting to support his family or give him a job if he is fired, people offering free legal counsel,’ Lisa said.

'We have spoken with the Massachusetts State Police, who have assured us that the release of the photos was unauthorized and that they are taking action internally in response.'

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 10:20 EST, 11 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:21 EST, 11 July 2013 . Boston Marathon bombing victim Jeff Bauman has revealed how he was so certain Tamerlan Tsarnaev was one of his attackers that he tried to tell staff in the ambulance on his way to hospital. Authorities have praised the 27-year-old, who lost his lower legs and much of his hearing in the blast, as key to stopping Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar after he helped identify them as the suspects. Bauman, who is learning to walk again with prosthetic limbs, has now spoken out about how he was determined to identify Tsarnaev after seeing him acting suspiciously before the April 15 blast. 'He wasn't with anybody, he was standing right next to me,' Bauman told Brian Williams on NBC News. He 'looked kind of -  wasn't laughing, wasn't having fun.' Speaking out: In his first TV interview, Jeff Bauman said he told ambulance staff who was responsible for the Boston bombings. 'I had a hunch,' he said after seeing one of the suspects in the crowd . Recovery: Speaking to Brian Williams, Bauman said he is stronger than ever following his devastating injuries . This was noticeable among the crowd of people who were soaking up the celebratory atmosphere, said Bauman, who was at the finish line with two friends to cheer for his girlfriend as she raced. After noticing Tamerlan Tsarnaev sullen faced, wearing a heavy coat, sunglasses, a cap and standing alone silently, he said he left a backpack behind. Moments later, there was an explosion. Bauman was thrown by the force of the blast and opened his eyes to find himself in a pool of blood. He saw one of his friends look at his legs in horror and looked down to see his limbs were shredded. A man applied tourniquets to his legs and then he was scooped into a wheelchair by Carlos Arredondo - a man in a cowboy hat - who helped rush him to an ambulance. Spotted: He said he noticed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, right, as he did not fit in with the rest of the crowd. Tamerlan, who was killed after a police shootout, is pictured with his younger brother Dzhokhar . Identified: He helped authorities identify Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and his brother Dzhokhar, right, as suspects . Life-changing: Carlos Arredondo pinches Bauman's femoral artery as they rush from the blast site moments after the April 15 bombing in Boston. Bauman lost both lower legs and much of his hearing . A photograph of the moment - showing Bauman gray-faced with nothing but exposed bone below his knees - has become an iconic image of the terror inflicted on the city that day. Once in the ambulance, he tried to explain what he had witnessed. 'Even in the ambulance ride I was trying . to say something, trying to say, like, ""I knew who did it, I knew what . went on"",' he said. 'And then I think they were kind of thrown back by that.' He said that his first thought was to make sure no one else fell victim to the men. He became emotional as he mentioned Sean Collier, the MIT police officer allegedly shot dead by the brothers. 'I just wanted to get a face out there,' he said. 'And just to help. I just wanted to help.' Bravery: Bauman is now learning how to walk with prosthetic legs, left, and right, he is pictured with the man he credits for saving his life - Carlos Arredondo. They have become close friends since the attacks . Closer: Carlos told Brian Williams that they are forever connected through their experiences. They speak daily . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died following a police shootout on April 19, several days after the bombings. On Wednesday, his brother Dzhokhar pleaded not guilty to the 30 charges against him. Bauman added that he is now looking forward and, while he could wonder how differently he could have acted that day to avoid the blast, there is no point. Instead, he is focusing on his recovery and said that he was nicknamed 'Wolverine' because he has healed from his wounds so quickly. 'It's insane,' he said. 'I'm a quick healer. They were calling me 'Wolverine'. It’s an X-Men, the guy that heals really quick, because I have burns... But [after] four weeks… my burns were almost gone.' Throughout the weeks since April 15, he has also shared his physical recovery and emotional struggles with the New York Times. Resolve: Bauman acknowledges cheering fans before throwing out the ceremonial first pitch at Fenway Park . For more videos, please go to MLB . His right eardrum was destroyed when . the bomb detonated, and his left one suffered a sizable hole, which . doctors have said is unlikely to heal. On . the day of the bombings, he underwent an emergency amputation to remove . his legs at the knees, and two days later, flesh was amputated until . four inches above the knees. In the weeks after the explosion, Bauman struggled with pain and boredom. Two weeks on, and he was still being kept awake by burns on his back and by the pains in his thighs. He told the Times that he felt as if someone was hitting his knees. He also struggled to adjust to his loss of hearing, and said he felt as if he had something held over his ears. The frustrations and echoes still mean he can only play music for a few minutes and is uncomfortable in large rooms. Reunited: Bauman and Arredondo are pictured together in hospital just days after the deadly bombings . But he has refused to undergo surgery to close the hole in his left eardrum because he cannot face anymore operations, he said. As . he started to heal from his operations, he spent days in hospital . undergoing physical therapy, watching television and getting visits from . friends and his girlfriend - the highlight of the day. He said that in those following weeks, he accepted what had happened and while he couldn't look at his legs, he would surprise people by joking about them as a way to cope. He added that he didn't think of the bombers and only called them cowards when someone asked. Bauman left the rehabilitation center around four weeks after the bombings and returned to his mother's home in Chelmsford, Massachusetts. He would spend all day with his mother, with the only change in pace coming from his cousin, who came over to play computer games, and from his girlfriend, who would visit after work. Staying strong: Bauman is pictured with his girlfriend, Erin Hurley. He said her visits to hospital or to his home are the highlights of his day and that he is looking forward to a future with her . Together: The couple had been together for around a year before the Boston bombings . Support: Bauman (left), who still enjoys playing the guitar for as long as his damaged ears can take it, and Hurley are pictured with another Boston bombing victim in hospital . Eventually, he began to venture out more . - but said he would rarely pay for anything because people recognized . him and would shower him with praise and pick up his tab. He has also made appearances at local games, including throwing the first pitch at Fenway Park - and has become firm friends with Carlos Arredondo, whom he was reunited with in hospital. And he is also learning to walk after being fitted with the prosthetic legs. Images taken on the day of his first walk show him grinning as he tries out his first steps. His girlfriend stood nearby and watched apprehensively as he moved forward, but he assured her that he felt balanced. Now Bauman is looking to the future - and hopes to one day buy a house with his girlfriend. He said that the tragedy has brought them much closer and made them more affectionate. On his feet: Bauman stands with his rescuer Carlos Arredondo as they were honored before the start of a game between the Bruins and the Chicago Blackhawks in Boston on June 24 . Before the bombings, Bauman worked in the delicatessen at a local Costco. He told the Times he had intentions of returning but that he was worried about being able to stand up all day. He said he had also thought about a career helping other people. Online fundraisers have helped raise enough money to cover his medical costs - and he has received nearly $3 million from donations and from the One Fund, which helps the Boston victims. But while he is becoming more independent and appreciating the attention he has been given, he added that he would trade it all just to have his legs back.","Jeff Bauman, from Chelmsford, Massachusetts, lost both of his lower legs and much of his hearing in April 15 bombings in Boston .

A Cleveland 911 dispatch tape released on Wednesday gives a revealing insight into how the situation unfolded for dispatchers and police after they received Amanda Berry’s call for help. Police were initially dispatched at 5:51pm on Monday after a report of a 911 call from a female ‘who says her named is Amanda Berry and that she had been kidnapped ten years ago.’ The dispatcher sent officers to 2210 Seymour Avenue where Berry had said she fled after escaping her captor's home at 2207 Seymour Avenue, where she had been held captive for a decade. By 5:55 p.m., police arrived at the scene and immediately recognized the seriousness of the situation. ‘This might be for real,’ an officer can be heard saying. ‘Georgina DeJesus might be in this house also.’ Then at about 5:59 p.m., an officer confirmed what no one was expecting to happen. ‘We found ‘em. We found ‘em,’ said the officer while cries from the women can be heard in the background. An officer then called for ambulances to respond to the scene, as one of the women was having trouble breathing. Within a short period, Cleveland police confirmed they had located missing women Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, as well as Berry’s six-year-old daughter. All three were taken to the hospital. 2207 Seymour Avenue, Cleveland, where the three girls have been held captive for the past decade . Found: Michelle Knight (right) and Gina DeJesus (left) were found alive in Cleveland on Monday afternoon . Cleveland officials have revealed . they are reviewing the actions of the 911 dispatcher who took Amanda . Berry’s call seconds after she fled the Cleveland dungeon where . she and two others had been held captive. The 911 dispatcher - one of the first . people Miss Berry spoke to after her decade long captivity - has been . criticized for not comforting the distressed caller and not keeping the . 26-year-old on the phone until the police arrived. Miss Berry's phone call on Monday evening from a neighbor's phone lasted less than two minutes. Miss Berry, who disappeared in 2003 aged 14, is heard screaming down the phone to an Ohio police operator: 'I've been kidnapped and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.' But multiple times the . dispatcher’s response was 'Talk to the police when they get there,' before asking the name of Miss . Berry’s captor, as well as his age and ethnicity. Brothers: From left, Ariel, Onil and Pedro have all been arrested in connection with the abduction of Gina DeJesus, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight almost ten years ago . In the 911 call Miss Berry implores . the dispatcher that she needs the police immediately, but she is told . authorities will be sent as soon as a 'car becomes open.' At one point when Miss Berry says 'I'm . Amanda Berry. I've been on the news for the last 10 years,' the . dispatcher replies 'I got that, dear.' In the recording the emotional cries from DeJesus and Knight can be heard. As Miss Berry becomes more frantic the dispatcher says 'The police are on their way; talk to them when they get there.' The dispatcher, whose identity has not been revealed, repeats again  'I told you they're on their way; talk to them when they get there, OK.' Combing: Cleveland police and FBI agents search a yard. There were apparently signs that dirt had recently been moved in the backyard of the house . 'One of the things that jumped out . was that after the dispatch took the information, she moved on to the . next call. I think that realizing the gravity of the situation, the . dispatch might have stayed on the call with that person,'  Gary Allen, a . dispatcher for 20 years in Berkeley, California told the Daily Beast. 'You generally want to hold the person on the phone and try to make a personal connection until law enforcement can get there.'

"By . Richard Pendlebury . PUBLISHED: . 03:19 EST, 16 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:26 EST, 16 November 2012 . The Orwell Prize, which advertises itself as ‘Britain’s most prestigious prize for political writing’, was first awarded in 1994. In 2007, the Common Purpose offshoot, the Media Standards Trust (MST), became the lead partner in running the prize. The Orwell no doubt chimed with the Leftish political leanings of the MST’s founders and would be a beacon for the journalistic excellence and integrity that they espoused. For the 2008 prize — the first to be awarded under David Bell’s MST’s auspices — the three judges were Annalena McAfee, novelist and formerly a journalist on the Financial Times and The Guardian, former BBC executive Sir John Tusa and Albert Scardino, Guardian journalist, MST trustee and husband of Marjorie Scardino, boss of the Labour-donating Pearson Group, friend of Common Purpose’s founder Julia Middleton and financial backer of the Media Standards Trust. Compromised: Journalist Johann Hari returned his Orwell Prize after it emerged that he had invented eyewitness accounts . Their award of the prize to Independent journalist Johann Hari was the start of a farce that was to badly compromise both the MST and Britain’s most high-minded paper. A youthful, Left-wing polemicist with a taste for grandstanding, Hari was seemingly the perfect fit for the MST’s first foray into journalism awards. (Hari’s admiring boss Simon Kelner would be invited by the MST to join its ‘non-partisan’ review panel later that year.) Hari’s award was given in spite of serious and long-standing concerns about the integrity of his work. Private Eye ran a long piece in early 2003, which identified several Hari reportage pieces for The Guardian and Independent in which he had simply invented his eyewitness accounts. Criticised: Sir David Bell's journalism-improving projects have hardly been entirely successful . But Hari’s offences against journalism were much wider than simply making up ‘facts’. Plagiarism, the use of old quotes as if they were new in interviews, alteration of Wikipedia biographies of enemies and ‘sock puppetry’ — the use of false identities to attack people on the internet — were also part of his modus operandi. By June 2011 the evidence against him became so overwhelming, that the MST had to act and instructed the Orwell Prize council to launch an inquiry into the allegations. Within a month the Orwell Prize issued a statement, in which it said: ‘No allegations have been made against Johann Hari’s 2008 Orwell Prize-winning pieces.’ Given the clear evidence of Hari’s dishonesty, this was disingenuous. In any event, both Private Eye and the Telegraph brought new allegations that Hari had made up parts of one of the Orwell Prize-winning pieces, about atrocities in the Congo. In September 2011, Hari announced that, though he stood by the articles which had won the Orwell Prize, he would be returning it as an act of contrition for the errors he had made elsewhere. The Council later confirmed that he would have been stripped of the prize because of evidence of wrongdoing in one of his articles. The result? A bitter blow to the journalistic integrity of Britain’s so-called quality Press. But also to the credibility of the organisation which has given itself the role of determining the way the free Press is regulated. Worse, much worse, was to follow with another of Sir David Bell’s journalism-improving projects. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism was launched in 2010, funded by a £2million grant from Psion computer millionaire and Labour donor David Potter and his David and Elaine Potter Foundation. Sir David Bell, champion of what he regards as an ethical Press, became a trustee. The BIJ was run out of London’s City University, which three years earlier had awarded Sir David an honorary degree. Power: Bell is a trustee of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and an assessor for Leveson Inquiry into the Press. (From left to right) George . Jones, Shami Chakrabarti, David Bell, Lord Justice Leveson, David Currie, Paul Scott-Lee and . Elinor Goodman . As we have reported, the BIJ proclaimed itself as the ‘gold standard’ by which other journalism could be measured. Its output and reportage ‘should be as close to incontrovertible as is possible’. There were a number of experienced journalists with good track records on board. But while the BIJ won acclaim in some quarters, there was also criticism. Six months after launch, the BIJ was working with The Guardian and other news organisations in preparing the WikiLeaks release of classified American military documents. But in giving an interview to an American magazine, BIJ managing editor Iain Overton leaked ‘major details’ which, The Guardian said this weekend, ‘put the entire project in jeopardy’. An investigation of the Help for Heroes charity was also described by its subject as ‘misleading’. Damaged reputation: Former managing editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, Iain Overton, has stepped down this week following the McAlpine scandal . Earlier this year, one of the Bureau’s staff confided that the original seed money had almost run out and the BIJ needed to secure new revenue sources. They have even turned to very unlikely benefactors such as Oxfam. But there was an ever greater need to find paid work at relatively wealthy channels such as the BBC. Which is how they came to be working with Newsnight on a child abuse investigation. The subsequent disaster was heralded by Overton’s now infamous tweet: ‘If all goes well, we’ve got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile.’ On Tuesday, Bell and his fellow BIJ trustees had a letter published in The Times. The tone was defiant rather than chastened. ‘The BBC required and had full editorial control throughout the production of the Newsnight programme,’ they said. And they further qualified the Bureau’s role in the scandal: ‘We regret that a tweet by the Bureau’s managing editor in advance of the programme helped to feed inaccurate speculation about the identity of a political figure.’ The letter ended: ‘The Bureau’s work has won awards by disclosing important information in the public interest and, with only this recent exception, by maintaining high standards of journalism. The Bureau remains absolutely committed to that aim.’ Whether the Bureau — of which Leveson assessor Bell is a trustee — will survive to maintain those ‘high standards’ is a matter of some considerable doubt.","Independent journalist Johann Hari received the Orwell Prize for his writing .

Gerard Depardieu, 64, did not turn up to court in Paris today because he was filming in New York . French film star Gerard Depardieu will find out today if he is going to jail for crashing his scooter while drunk - but he didn't bother turning up to court to hear his fate. The 64-year-old actor, who also failed to attend court for the last hearing in January, was more than three times over the drink-drive limit when he came off his moped near the Champs-Elysees in Paris last November. Today he was due to attend a 'correctional tribunal' in Paris to face a charge of drink-driving, but he did not turn up because he was in New York filming his new role as Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the shamed former boss of the International Monetary Fund. A judge said the case would go ahead in Depardieu's absence, and the Oscar-nominated star of Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac risked being sentenced to a maximum of two years behind bars and a £3,500 (Euro 4,500) fine. Depardieu, who has courted controversy in his native France after moving to Belgium and taking Russian citizenship to avoid a new 75 per cent tax rate, was held in custody for five hours until he had sobered up after the incident on November 29. Police tested his breath at the scene and found he had a blood alcohol level of 1.8g per litre - well over the 0.5g per litre legal limit. The Oscar-nominated star failed to appear at his first court appearance in January because he was discussing a new film project in Montenegro.  He is now making that film, hence his non-appearance today. Today's court hearing is the latest in a catalogue of drink-related incidents involving the star - who once admitted to drinking up to six bottles of wine a day. Last August, Depardieu was quizzed by police for punching a driver who collided with his scooter on a Paris street. The actor, seen here leaving the Tribeca Grill restaurant in New York yesterday, is currently filming in the U.S. The man made an official complaint for asssault but charges were later dropped. Two years ago, Depardieu was also arrested for smashing up a car parked outside a swingers' club near his Paris home. And he was involved in a separate scandal in France in 2011 when he urinated in the aisle of a plane in full view of disgusted passengers. Horrified travellers told how the actor called out 'I need to p***' as the City Jet flight from Paris to Dublin was preparing for take-off. After a stewardess barred him from using the loo, he unzipped his flies and soaked the carpet, before cabin crew ordered him off the plane. Depardieu was drunk when he came off his bike in a street near the Champs-Elysees, pictured, last November . He later apologised for the 'humiliating incident' which he blamed on prostate problems, and admitted that he could 'often behave like a complete a***hole' in public. When Depardieu announced his plans to move abroad to avoid paying high tax rates, he was branded 'shabby and unpatriotic' by prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault. The defiant screen legend retaliated by declaring he would also hand back his French passport, and wrote an angry open letter to the French government, saying: 'All those who have left France have not been insulted as I have been.' He then told French president Francois Hollande in a personal phone call that he was 'sickened at how France spits on success'. Depardieu is one of the few French stars known throughout the world, and has made more than 100 films, many in English. He also notorious in France for his battle with alcohol and his turbulent love life. Over the past ten years he has devoted much of his time to producing wine at his Lys-de-Volan vineyard near Lyon.","64-year-old French actor risks maximum two years in prison and £3,500 fine .

The 1980s New Wave rockers Flock of Seagulls lost $70,000 worth of guitars and other music gear to a car thief who stole their van as they slept at a Downey, California Comfort Inn. On Sunday following a gig, surveillance footage shows someone driving off from the group’s hotel with a van filled with everything they were about to take with them on a European tour. Now the band, best known for the their 1982 hit I Ran (So Far Away), have left for UK tour dates without custom-built guitars, stage clothes, and other items—some of which they’ve had since their early 80s heyday. Then: Flock of Seagulls had their biggest hit in 1982 but still perform. After a recent California show, a car thief stole $70,000 worth of their music equipment . It was just after a Bellflower, California show. The group returned to their hotel to rest prior to a final show in Southern California before jetting off for a performance in Scotland. Though one night’s accommodations in the Comfort Inn run $99, the group left about $70,000 poorer—the cost of their treasured one-of-a-kind guitars, drum kit, and keyboard. As they slept, surveillance tape shows a man break open their door and drive off with the equipment-filled vehicle. Big loss: While the Comfort Inn room cost just $99 per night, the band's custom guitars and other equipment--worth $70,000--was the loss that truly hit them where it hurt . Doesn't gel: Mike Score (left in 1983, right at present) believes someone who attended their Bellflower, California show knew what he was doing when he drove off with a van full of expensive gear, though a local police officer does not believe the band was targeted specifically . Origins: Formed in the late 70s in Liverpool, England by brothers Mike Score (center) and Ali Score (right), the band continues to be active, though with a different lineup . Now: Lead singer Mike Score has lost the trademark hairdo, and while he slept in a Downey, California Comfort Inn on Sunday he lost all his band's equipment and a recently recorded solo album to a car thief . ‘Joe’s guitar was hand-built. I use a couple of Fenders that are customized,’ lead singer Mike Score, who now opts for a clean-shaven head instead of his former trademark pointy bangs, told KTLA. Also stolen in the van were hard drives that contained an entire new solo album recorded by Score. ‘That's like a year and a half worth of work that I can't replace,’ Score told KABC. Lead guitarist Joe Rodriguez was also hit hard by the theft. Creeper: Footage shows a man creep up to the van as it sat parked outside the Comfort Inn's reception area . Get away: The thief then drives off, along with $70,000 worth of equipment . ‘It gives you a sick feeling inside knowing that that equipment that you own and used to play shows and that you've been using for,’ Rodriguez told KABC. ‘Twenty years have just disappeared.’ They’ve now left for Europe sans their gear, but hope to improvise a way to perform without it. Seasoned: After 30 years, the band still tours, though they now get much smaller crowds than in their early 80s heyday . Not the same: The band is seen, at left, performing with rental equipment on the day following the theft instead of their treasured instruments. at right, they perform in their 1980s heyday . '20 years have just disappeared': Lead guitarist Joe Rodriguez said he felt violated after the theft Sunday. 'It gives you a sick feeling,' he said. 'It's going to ruin our shows': The group has now flown off for European tour dates, but must use rental equipment . ‘For us, it's going to ruin our shows,’ Score said. ‘Our gear is specifically programmed for us.’ The man drove away in the band’s white 1999 Ford E-350 van with Florida plates. It was parked in front of the Comfort Inn’s reception area. The band is hoping the thief or thieves don’t get away with selling the equipment.

It is thought that Kate was 41 weeks pregnant today and comfortably within the normal margin for giving birth. She is pictured shopping in London last month . THE Duchess of Cambridge was definitely overdue when she went into labour yesterday, according to Kensington Palace sources. It is thought she may have been 41 weeks pregnant — a week overdue – but comfortably within the normal margin for giving birth. In fact, fewer than one in 20 women give birth on their due date. Around half go into labour up to two weeks after this point, the expected date of delivery given at the start of the pregnancy. Some mothers have their labour medically induced during this period because of concerns about their health and that of the baby. Professor Andrew Shennan, an internationally renowned specialist in obstetrics, says it is more accurate to talk about a ‘due month’ of birth because each woman’s circumstances are different. The professor, who is based at St Thomas’ Hospital, London, said his unit’s policy is not to intervene until a woman is two weeks overdue, unless there is cause for concern. Professor Shennan explained: ‘Most women want to give birth naturally when possible and if there is no reason to induce, we’d rather not because it involves using drugs. Only about 4 per cent of women deliver on their due date, so it’s better to talk about a due month, because when they are giving birth naturally around half will deliver later.’ The placenta, the baby’s support system in the womb, is equipped to last for between 40 and 42 weeks.

Fewer than one in 20 women gives birth on their 'due date' - the expected date of delivery given at the start of pregnancy .

She would have had instructions to . contact her medical team when they were strong and regular, coming at . the rate of two or three every ten minutes, or if she was worried. Professor Shennan, a leading . researcher for the baby charity Tommy’s, said: ‘It’s OK to stay at home . at this stage and there is some evidence that women do better as a . result. ‘When they increase to three or four . every ten minutes then normal labour has started and she will need to . set off for the hospital, allowing for the time of day and traffic.’ Professor Andrew Shennan says it is more accurate to talk about a 'due month' of birth as each woman's circumstances are different.

A 57-year-old deaf woman heard her baby granddaughter laugh for the very first time with the help of a cochlear implant while cameras rolled on the Today show. As America watched this morning, Sarah Campbell, of Norristown, Pennsylvania had her implant activated for the first time and, as if on cue, her one-year-old granddaughter giggled with excitement. It was a monumental moment for Campbell, who has suffered from hearing problems since childhood and had gone completely deaf in the last five years. Grandmother: 57-year-old Sarah Campbell of Norristown, Pennsylvania got a cochlear implant three weeks ago and it was turned on for the first time on the Today show . Miracle: As if on cue, Campbell's granddaughter giggled just as the implant activated, which was the first time she ever heard the one-year-old laugh . ‘I'm hearing her! Woo! Baby! She was laughing, I think,’ Campbell told her audiologist Michelle Montes as host Matt Lauer stood by with Campbell’s family on Today. Though Campbell correctly identified her granddaughter’s laughter, there was no way to know if the implant would work as cameras rolled. ‘It's noise ... noise,’ is how Campbell described the sounds at first. Then, Montes turned the volume up on her implant. Questions: Cameras were rolling, but as Campbell waited for her implant to activate, she didn't know how well, if at all, it would work . Success: Thankfully, as Today host Matt Lauer and her whole family watched, the implant worked and Campbell heard her granddaughter's giggle . ‘I'm hearing you. It's very low. I'm even hearing me! I'm hearing me talk,’ said the thrilled Campbell. Before getting the implant, life had become a lot less exciting for Campbell. Ever since childhood, she’d had hearing problems. Hearing aids helped her get by in school and even allowed her to become a special education teacher. However, as her hearing become fainter over the last few year, it became harder to work and to interact with other people. Fortunate: Miraculously, her granddaughter's laughter was one of the first things Campbell heard . ‘So, I zone out,’ she said. ‘And go into my own little world.’ In that world, Campbell loved to enjoy nature and watch the birds in her back yard. Though, she could never hear any of it. ‘You know, the creaks in your house, the baby crying,’ Campbell said before the implant was activated. ‘Different sounds that you take for granted, and I've never heard 'em.’ And now she has, thanks to the cochlear implant she received three weeks ago at the University of Pennsylvania. High-tech: Campbell wore hearing aids for years, but they'd stopped working in recent years. Advanced cochlear implants, pictured, are implanted within the ear itself, with a microphone-like device worn outside the head . The microphone and processor worn on the outside are connected to implements that stimulate the bones inside the ear . The implant is made up of a receiver and stimulator implanted on the bones inside the inner ear. They connect to a magnetic transmitter work on the outside of the head which acts as a microphone. As the audiologist turned on the implant, she explained that the technology will continue to improve, even in the minutes following the activation. How good her hearing will become remains unknown, but Campbell will be happy just hearing the birds in her yard. ‘Do I expect miracles? No,’ she told Today. ‘I just want to hear better.’ Small wonder? Campbell says she doesn't expect miracles, she just wants to hear things like the birds and the wind in her back yard and more laughter from her granddaughter .","Sarah Campbell's grandaughter giggled as cameras rolled and her family and Matt Lauer stood by on Today .

Dame Janet Smith will speak to the star’s victims and explore whether the ‘culture and practices’ at the broadcaster ‘enabled the sexual abuse of children to continue unchecked’. Former Sky News chief Nick Pollard has been appointed separately to investigate the decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Savile and to see if ‘inappropriate managerial pressure’ was applied. Former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith . (right) and ex-Sky News executive Nick Pollard (left) are to lead the BBC's independent . reviews stemming from the Jimmy Savile sex abuse allegations . A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them . A third independent review will look into sexual harassment claims which have surfaced in recent weeks. The Smith Review will see Dame Janet . investigate how much other staff knew of Savile’s predatory behaviour . and speak to those who claimed to have raised concerns within the BBC at . the time. She will then consider whether the . corporation’s current child protection and whistle-blowing policies are . ‘fit for purpose’ and what lessons need to be learned. The Pollard Review will establish . whether there were any failings in the BBC’s management of the Newsnight . investigation, and will consider whether the scheduled broadcasts of . tributes to the dead presenter had any impact on the decision to drop . the BBC2 probe. It will also look at how the . broadcaster handled material ‘derived from the investigation’ which . could have been of interest to police. Announcing the inquiries, the BBC’s . senior independent director,  Dame Fiona Reynolds, said: ‘These reviews . will demonstrate the BBC’s determination to open itself fully to . scrutiny from independent experts, emphasising our belief that the basis . of the public’s trust is full openness and accountability.’ Sex scandal: Jimmy Savile at Madame Tussaud's in London in 1987 . Dame Janet, 71, previously led the . multi-million pound Shipman Inquiry, which examined the activities of . the Manchester GP who was convicted of killing 15 elderly patients and . suspected of murdering hundreds more. News of the BBC’s inquiries came as ministers said they may order a full independent inquiry into the scandal. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg told . MPs there was ‘certainly a case for an inquiry’ into the ‘deeply . shocking and troubling revelations’. A senior Tory MP added that the BBC’s . new director-general, George Entwistle, had questions to answer about . why he commissioned tributes to Savile at a time when serious . allegations about his conduct were being investigated by Newsnight. John Whittingdale, chairman of the . culture, media and sport committee which will quiz Mr Entwistle about . the scandal next week, described his apparent lack of curiosity about . Newsnight’s findings as ‘very surprising’. ‘You would expect that if he was told . that Newsnight was looking at Jimmy Savile that he would have asked . what it was about in order to avoid precisely the kind of embarrassment . the BBC is now in,’ he said. ‘If it was shown that he was aware, . particularly when he has told a press conference that he wasn’t, then I . think that would put him in a very difficult position.’ MPs will also question Mr Entwistle about the BBC’s decision to shelve the Newsnight investigation. Mr Clegg said a wide-ranging police . investigation should take precedence – but suggested a wider inquiry may . also be needed if a series of internal BBC reviews fail to quell public . disquiet about the scandal. Police believe the DJ and television presenter's alleged catalogue of sex abuse could have spanned six decades . ‘I constantly ask myself how on earth . is this possible on such a scale over such a long period of time in so . many different settings,’ he said. ‘It is in many ways the sort of . thing, the dark side of the cult of celebrity which maybe intimidated . people from speaking out earlier.’ Mr Clegg’s intervention came as MPs, . including Labour leader Ed Miliband, warned that the BBC could not be . left to investigate claims that senior managers turned a blind eye to . allegations that Savile was abusing young women and children, sometimes . on BBC property. Tory MP Philip Davies, a fellow . member of the Commons culture committee, last night urged the media . watchdog Ofcom to investigate whether the BBC remained a ‘fit and proper . organisation to hold a broadcasting licence’ in the light of the . allegations. In a letter to Ofcom’s chief . executive Ed Richards, he said it was ‘inconceivable that nobody in . senior positions [at the BBC] was aware of the allegations surrounding . Savile or other inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour’. Labour’s Harriet Harman will meet Mr . Entwistle today to warn him that any inquiries into the scandal must . look at the role played by managers and presenters, and must consider . whether rules on sexual harassment are tough enough to prevent a repeat.

Tragic: Paul Franklin Dart, pictured right with friends, was trying to calm down the gunman when he was shot in the head . A married army veteran was shot dead in front of his wife and stepson during an annual family rafting trip on Saturday after a relative urinated on the river bank, enraging the landowner. James Robert Crocker, 59, confronted the group of family and friends with a 9 mm handgun after they stopped for a quick break at a gravel bar in Meramex, and one of the revelers walked into the woods to relieve himself. After a brief altercation over whether the gravel bar was private or public property, Crocker shot Paul Franklin Dart, 48, in the head from just a few feet away, as his wife Loretta and her son Josh Kling, 24, watched in horror. Dart, a union carpenter from Robertsville, died in an ambulance on the way to hospital less than five hours after setting off on the annual trip the group had organized every summer for the past five years. 'I watched him be shot in the face and fall down,' Loretta Dart sobbed in a telephone interview with The St. Louis Dispatch on Monday. 'I watched my husband bleed to death. He was a wonderful man. He didn't deserve this.' Crocker told police the shooting happened after he accused the group of trespassing on his land and they claimed the gravel bar was public property, leading to a dispute. The laws in Missouri are extremely vague about property rights along streams and rivers and who can legally access them. Crocker said during the altercation, one of the men, although not Dart, approached him with rocks in his hands so he fired. 'I just shot the one closest to me,' Crocker said, according to police. Authorities on Sunday charged Crocker . with second-degree murder. He was being held on Monday in lieu of $650,000 . bail at the Crawford County Jail. Scroll down for video .

She claims he waved his weapon around, firing shots into the air and into the ground near her husband and her cousin, who was the one who had urinated. According to the Dispatch, the gunman told a detective that men were yelling at him 'stating that they weren't going to leave and that the gravel bar was public property.' Kling said Crocker told him: 'I have the power here. I have the power,' to which he replied, according to his mother, 'put that gun down and we'll see who has the power.' As the argument escalated, Loretta Dart's cousin picked up at least one rock and, in an effort to diffuse the situation, Paul Dart stepped between the two men.

A friend and neighbor of Crocker, Herb Smelser, said the 59-year-old appeared in the front yard of his home with the right side of his face, neck and torso splattered with blood. 'I just shot a guy down at the river,' he told Smelser, according to the Dispatch 'This is his blood. You better call 911.' He said Crocker was a courteous, hardworking man but was ferociously territorial about his property. In recent months, he had become increasingly irritated by people urinating, drinking and partying on the gravel bar. The Missouri Conservation Department said property rights on the river were a complicated aspect of Missouri law and, typically, the question was answered on a case-by-case basis by county prosecutors. 'This is an area of Missouri law still up in the air,' the spokesman added. Harry Styron, a lawyer from Ozark, Missouri, and an expert on property rights along streams and rivers, said such cases were extremely confusing. 'They are difficult to interpret,' Styron said. 'You are on private property, but you have a right to be there if it's a navigable stream and as long as you are on a gravel bar that is submerged during parts of the year, because it's part of the stream bed.' He added, that despite the confusion: 'It obviously doesn't have anything to do with people shooting people. We don't have a stand-your-gravel-bar law yet.'","James Robert Crocker, 59, shot Paul Franklin Dart, 48, in the head from just a few feet away at around 2 p.m. on Saturday .

After completing just one month of his one-to-three year sentence, Anthony Marshall may be getting out of prison as early as August 19. Marshall, the 89-year-old son of Brooke Astor, was convicted last month of stealing millions from his family's estate when his mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in her last years, and since then has been serving his time at Fishkill Correctional Facility in Elmira, New York. However, his lawyers have applied for medical parole, and a Department of Corrections spokesman confirmed to the New York Daily News that Marshall was approved. A . judge will decide whether or not the Parkinson's disease patient should . be released on early parole at a hearing on August 19. Emotional: Anthony Marshall's wife Charlene, cried and hugged him, as the heir to Brooke Astor's estate was jailed last month . Kenneth Warner, Marshall's attorney said his lawyers 'are hoping for Mr Marshall's release on medical parole as soon as possible.' A Manhattan district attorney's office spokesman declined to comment on the possible early release. A source told the New York Post: . 'Anthony is dying, and he is in a lousy state prison. He has a new . doctor's letter stating he is even worse than a few months ago. 'He has very bad heart concerns. He is incontinent. It could be weeks or months or days.' When sentenced last month, Manhattan's Supreme Court Justice A Kirke Bartley said: 'I take no pleasure in following my duties', as he ordered Marshall to serve the minimum sentenced handed down to him in 2009. Bartely said he'd rather not jail the World War II vet, but prosecutors argue that his state of health and war record shouldn't mean he gets released early for grand larceny. Marshall's lawyer, William B. Zabel, said his client should be allowed to die in peace at his home with his wife Charlene by his side. When Marshall was wheeled out of court to begin his prison term last month, his wife wept and hugged him. He had previously lost a series of requests to avoid prison because of his failing health. Distraught: Charlene Marshall seen leaving court in June after her 89-year-old husband was ordered to serve his sentence . Astor had been a fixture of New York society before her death at the age of 105, in 2007. Her charitable largesse was recognized in 1998 with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's top civilian honor. Astor . inherited the money from her third husband, Vincent Astor, a . great-great-grandson of real estate and fur magnate John Jacob Astor, . who was one of the first multimillionaires in the U.S. When Marshall arrived in the courtroom in a wheelchair, his wife Charlene cried and caressed his shoulder. He declined to speak during the brief proceeding last month, looking downward but showing little reaction. In . earlier trials his wife, who one of Marshall's sons blames for the . family's troubles, had been accused by prosecutors as being the motive . for Marshall taking money from his mother. Elizabeth Loewy, a prosecutor, said Marshall defrauded his mother 'because of his 'preoccupation for getting money for Charlene', according to the New York Times. The . original trial was also told that Astor disliked her daughter-in-law . and one of her nurses referred to Mrs Marshall as 'Miss Piggy'. Her dislike for Mrs Marshall was allegedly shown in her will, when she left her two second-hand mink coats in a size 6, knowing she would never be able to wear them. Court date: Anthony Marshall arrived in court last month, helped by Charlene, as a Judge prepared to sentence him to prison . Sentencing: Anthony Marshall seen in court with his lawyers on sentencing day . At Marshall's sentencing, the judge . read parts of a letter from one of his twin sons, Alec, urging the court . to spare him prison. 'Please . consider all the good that my father has done for this country ... My . father once said, about the events that happened before the case, that, 'you . can't change the past', Justice Bartley quoted the letter as saying. He . urged Marshall to allow his son to get back in contact with him. Marshall's twin sons from an earlier marriage, Alec and Phillip, had testified against their father in the 2009 trial. And . it was Philip who brought the original guardianship case against his . father in 2006, charging him of misusing Astor's funds, according to Vanity Fair. The civil case was settled but a criminal case quickly followed. Prosecutors said Marshall, a decorated Second World War veteran and former U.S. ambassador, exploited his mother's failing mind to loot her millions. After her Alzheimer's diagnosis, Marshall bought himself lavish gifts, including a $920,000 yacht, with her money. High society, Anthony Marshall with his mother, Brooke Astor, at the Plaza Hotel in 2002 . He also took valuable artwork off her . walls and engineered changes to her will that gave him control of most . of her estate, including millions previously earmarked for her favorite . charities, the Manhattan district attorney's office said. Astor had devoted her life to . philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of money to the St Regis Hotel, . the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Art Museum. However, . the multimillionaire was left to spend her last days in allegedly . heart-breaking conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue . apartment while she napped in her own urine with no one to help. She died in her 64-acre Holly Hill . estate in New York, in August 2007. The estate, and her Park Avenue home . in Manhattan, were later sold. When the wranglings over her $100 million estate were settled in March last year, it was reported that Marshall was ordered to pick  $74,680 worth of her possessions. He chose a mixture of items, from a $30 wall bracket shaped like a tortoise to a $40,000 painting of a donkey by Giovanni Tiepolo, Vanity Fair said. In the settlement, the Metropolitan Museum agreed to a settlement of $3 million for the Childe Hassam painting Flags Fifth Avenue, 1917, which had been bequeathed to the museum but sold by Mashall for $10 million in 2002. The Astor family made their money in the fur trade in the 1700s. Marshall's step-grandfather, John Jacob Astor, was the wealthiest passenger to die on the Titantic, where he was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. Art collection: Brooke Astor's staircase of her Holly Hill manor was adorned by paintings of dogs . Luxury: The Park Avenue home in Manhattan had 14 rooms and six terraces . Socialite: Brooke Astor loved to entertain in her Park Avenue home, when she wasn't attending gala dinners . Marshall's lawyers said she knowingly changed her will to benefit her only child, and that he had legal authority for the gifts he gave himself from her money. His lawyers and doctors said a prison term could kill Marshall, who has Parkinson's disease, depends on a wheelchair and cannot get out of bed, go to the bathroom, bathe, or dress himself without help. After losing a series of appeals, lawyers for Marshall and his co-defendant Francis Morrissey Jr -  a former estates lawyer convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will - filed papers last week seeking a new trial and asking that both remain free. Justice Bartley rejected that request and sent Morrissey, 72, to prison. Morrissey was convicted of forging Astor's signature on a change to her will. His defense argued that if the signature was phony, he knew nothing of it. Morrissey's lawyers indicated that . they would continue an appeal that hinges on a sworn statement from . juror Judi DeMarco, who said she felt threatened when another juror made . hostile gestures, cursed at her and started toward her during . deliberations. Ms DeMarco said she felt . demoralized when she asked to get off the jury, but Justice Bartley . instead told the panel to keep deliberating civilly. 'I was tired and beaten and felt . totally alone' and finally 'acquiesced in guilty verdicts that I did not . in good conscience believe were legitimate,' Ms DeMarco, who is also an . attorney, said in the June 8 statement. Her claims were part of Marshall's and Morrissey's unsuccessful appeals. The . state court's Appellate Division concluded the jury tensions 'appeared . to resolve themselves, and there is no reason to believe that the . ultimate unanimous verdict, confirmed by polling [asking whether each . juror agreed with the verdict], was the result of coercion'. However, the defense lawyers argued that the new statement merited at least a hearing.

Relief: Marte Deborah Dalelv said she was given back her passport on Sunday by the public prosecutor's office and that her 16-month sentence for having sex outside marriage has been dropped . Pictured left Marte can be seen arriving at the Norwegian Seamen's Center in Dubai with her laywer, and right, she can be seen sharing a moment with ambassador to the UAE, Afe Elin Bjerke .

They . took her passport away and she was convicted and sentenced on charges . of having unlawful sex, making a false statement and illegal consumption . of alcohol. Her alleged rapist was sentenced to three months less prison time than she got. Norwegian businesswoman Marte Deborah Dalelv, 24, was sentenced to 16 months in prison for extramarital sex after she reported being raped . Ms Dalelv said the attack happened after she had been out at a bar with her colleagues and friends. She told CNN that she had a male co-worker to escort her to her room as the hotel was 'large and confusing' and she did not want to be wandering aloe as she had been drinking. She said she realised the room was not hers, and after initially objecting when he pulled her inside by her handbag, she agreed to go in 'to calm the situation down'. Her next memory, she says, is waking up on her front while he was raping her. When the hotel wake-up call knocked on the door, she dressed and went down to reception to call police. Up to a dozen make officers arrived and took statements from Ms Dalelv and her alleged attacker. When she arrived at Bur Dubai police station, she said police asked her of events to officers, 'Are you sure you called the police because you just didn't like it?' She replied: '""Well of course I didn't like it."" That is when I knew, I don't think they are going to believe me at all.' She was then examined and tested for alcohol and locked in a prison cell for four days without explanation. Eventually she was able to contact her . parents on the third day and ask them to contact the Norwegian Embassy . who arranged her release.

Dozens of top military generals are living like kings in government-supplied villas - many costing taxpayers more than $100,000 a year - while the rank-and-file in the military struggle through billions spending cuts, a new report reveals. A secret Pentagon report scrutinized 32 mansions owned or rented by the military for its top brass and found that many are too costly and too lavish - even by the generous standards of the Pentagon. It is estimated that the Defense Department owns or rents hundreds more such homes for its top officers. Many of them are in exotic locales like Brussels, Belgium, and Naples, Italy, where its officers are posted. Many of the mansions are outfitted with professional chefs and gardeners. All of them have costly security measures like armed guards, gates, blast walls and blast-proof windows. Posh: The home of General John F Kelly in Coral Gables, Florida, costs taxpayers $160,000 a year in rent and another $402,000 this year in renovations . U.S. Marine General John Kelly, 62, will take up residence in October in the posh home - one of hundreds of luxury accommodations owned or leased by the military . The Los Angeles Times reports that Marine General John F. Kelly, the commander of all U.S. forces in Mexico, the Caribbean and Central and South America, lives in a mansion called Casa Sur in Coral Gables, Florida, that costs $160,000 a year in rent. Taxpayers have spent an estimated $402,000 in security improvements and renovations that are currently underway. When work is finished, the upgrades will include a professional kitchen, two new bathrooms, a redone master bedroom, blast-resistant windows and a vehicle barrier. The Pentagon says the age-old practice of billeting generals and . admirals in top accommodations is necessary. Generals move frequently . and it would be inefficient and impractical for them to find new housing . at every new posting. Additionally, any accommodation for a top general must include secure internet and phone lines, as well as security measures to protect the high-value officers. Top generals and admirals need professional chefs and gardeners because they must frequently entertain visiting state guests in their official capacity at their homes. Still the Defense Department is in the grips of a dealing with emergency spending cuts from the multibillion-dollar sequester deal. Sharing the pain? The pool at the Officers Club at Fort Myer, Virginia, - home to most of the top military brass - is now closed once a week as a result of sequester cuts . The Pentagon has been forced to reduce services, cut training and missions, and furlough 680,000 civilian employees - costing them 20percent of their salaries. The pain appears to have trickled up to top officers only a little. A spokeswoman for Fort Myer, the Virginia military base that houses most of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and their deputies, told the Los Angeles Times that the pool at the  Ft. Myer Officers Club was forced to cancel swim lessons on Tuesdays because it has to close for one day a week. Air Force General Philip M. Breedlove, the commander of NATO, lives in a military-supplied 15,000-square-foot chateau in Belgium that dates to the 1800s. Admiral Bruce W. Clingan, the commander of U.S. Navy forces in Europe, has an official residence in Naples, Italy, that costs taxpayers $220,000 a year in maintenance . Lieutenant General Steven A. Hummer, the head of Marine Forces Reserve, resides in a 19th century plantation home listed on the National Register of Historic Places in New Orleans. Rear Admiral Robert Burke, who commands the submarine group that patrols the Mediterranean Sea, calls home to Villa de Lorio in Naples, Italy - a 6,600-square-foot mansion that costs taxpayers $172,000 a year in rent. His boss, Admiral Bruce W. Clingan lives in 12,000-square-feet of luxury in Villa Nike nearby. The mansion - which the Navy owns - has been costing taxpayers $220,000 a year in maintenance costs and needs $3million more in repairs. All of the top officers who work at the Pentagon enjoy billeting in historic housing in the Washington D.C. area - with the size and grandeur of the home commensurate to the rank and standing of the office.

The biological father of the 3-year-old girl who a South Carolina court ruled last week should be returned to her adoptive parents has made it clear he isn’t giving up his daughter without a fight. The state Supreme Court ruled last Wednesday to terminate Dusten Brown’s parental rights and return three-year-old Veronica to adoptive parents Matt and Melanie Capobianco who had looked after the girl from birth until 19 months ago when they were forced to hand her over to her biological father. But Brown, who previously secured custody based on his Cherokee Nation  ancestry, now has several Native American special interest groups - the Native American Rights Fund, the National Congress of American Indians and the National Indian Child Welfare Association - working to fight the court’s decision. Daddy's girl? Brown pictured with daughter on Veronica on Monday, she is set to be returned to her adoptive parents . South Carolina court officials are set to transfer custody of Veronica back to the Capobiancos within days and when they do these groups intend to file a federal lawsuit that they claim is on Veronica's behalf. ‘We strongly believe that her federal civil rights are being violated,’ John Echohawk, a director for Native American Rights Fund, a law firm specializing in Indian rights, told Tulsa World. Tribes across the country see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions. In the middle of the increasingly . complex custody battle, Brown has released a photograph of him together . with his daughter taken on Monday before he had to leave for mandatory . Oklahoma National Guard training. Matt and Melanie Capobianco were in the delivery room when Veronica was born in Oklahoma in September 2009 . 'The decision contributes to the long and sordid history of Native American children being removed from their families without any consideration of their best interests,' said Jacqueline Pata, the executive director of the National Congress of American Indians. Brown also has gone before a Cherokee Nation court to have other family members declared joint guardians of Veronica, including his wife, Robin Brown, and his parents, Tommy and Alice Brown. Last Wednesday the state Supreme Court ruled in a 3:2 decision that the Capobiancos are the only party properly seeking to adopt Veronica in South Carolina and ordered a Family Court to finalize the couple's adoption. 'We are thrilled that after 18 long months, our daughter finally will be coming home,' the couple said in a statement at the time. Native American tribes across the U.S. see the case as a test of tribal sovereignty which could set a precedent for other adoptions . 'We look forward to seeing Veronica's . smiling face in the coming days and will do everything in our power to . make her homecoming as smooth as possible. 'We also want to thank everyone who has supported us throughout this ordeal. Our prayers have been answered.' South . Carolina courts originally said the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act — a . federal law intended to keep Indian children from being taken from their . homes and typically placed with non-Indian adoptive or foster parents — . favored her living with her biological father. A . member of the Cherokee Nation, Brown had never met his daughter and, . after the girl's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, . played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the . girl was born. Veronica, her biological father Dusten Brown, feed their geese and ducks at his home in Oklahoma where she has lived for the past 19 months . But . when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted, he objected and . said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning . tribal traditions. Brown took custody in 2011 and has been living with his daughter in Oklahoma since then. But . the Capobiancos — who were present at the girl's birth and even cut her . umbilical cord raised Veronica for the first 27 months of her life — . appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. Last . month, the nation's high court ruled that South Carolina courts should . decide who gets to adopt the girl, a determination the state court made . yesterday. 'We think the . Supreme Court plainly contemplated an expeditious resolution of this . case, and we believe the facts of this case require it,' the South . Carolina high court wrote, ordering a Family Court to finalize the . Capobiancos' adoption and to terminate Brown's parental rights. 'There is absolutely no need to compound any suffering that Baby Girl may experience through continued litigation.' In the middle: Veronica Brown has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . Earlier this month, Brown filed a petition to adopt the child in Oklahoma. 'As . you can imagine, we are shocked and saddened at this development,' John . S. Nichols, a South Carolina-based attorney for Brown, wrote in an . email. 'There is no . mention, or apparent consideration, in the majority decision of the . child's best interest, as the dissenters point out.' Separately, . Justices Costa Pleicones and Don Beatty wrote that, while the case's . details should be hammered out in Family Court, the transfer of the girl . should be handled delicately so as to be least disruptive to her. 'The . majority orders the immediate transfer of the child, no longer an . infant or toddler, upon the filing of the family court's adoption order, . without regard to whether such an abrupt transfer would be in the . child's best interest,' the two justices wrote. 'This . is a situation where the decisions that are in the best interests of . this child, given all that has happened in her short life, must be . sorted out in the lower court(s).'

But while the Queen decided to return to London, Charles remained more than 200 miles away in the North of England, showing . that not even the most exciting family drama can stop him carrying out . his Royal duties. He arrived at the National Railway Museum in York by steam train as he began a two-day visit to Yorkshire. The Prince stepped off the Royal Carriage through clouds of steam, to applause and cheers from the crowd. The . carriage was pulled into the museum by Bittern, the sister engine of . Mallard, which marked 75 years as the world's fastest steam train . earlier this month. Visit: While his daughter-in-law went into labour, Prince Charles tried out a steam train at the National Railway Museum in York . Out and about: Prince Charles greeted crowds in York as he continued his official visit despite the impending birth of his first grandchild . Dedicated: The Prince was not distracted from his Royal duties by the news the Duchess of Cambridge had gone into labour . Tribute: The Prince of Wales was visiting the centre to mark the success of the Mallard Locomotive . As he alighted, he spoke to well-wishers who had turned out to welcome him. Alex Dickinson and her sons, Thomas, seven, and Freddie, five, . travelled from nearby Church Fenton to catch a glimpse of Charles. She wished the Prince well with the birth of his grandchild as her children gave him a picture of a giraffe for the baby. She said her son Freddie had said the royal baby was coming in six hours, to which Charles replied: 'Yes, it may well be.' Asked by another bystander whether . there was any news from the hospital, the Prince replied: 'Absolutely . nothing at the moment - we're waiting.' Gift: The Prince was handed a teddy by members of the crowd outside the museum . On his visit Charles blew the whistle . of the Doncaster-built Mallard, which broke the world record for steam . when it reached 126mph on the East Coast Main Line in July 1938. It is . now a permanent exhibit at the museum. He met retired Mallard driver Bernard . Bell, 89, who once transported the Queen on a royal visit when he was . working as a fireman on another locomotive. Mr Bell, from York, who drove Mallard, . Bittern and similar engines for decades, said: 'He was very interested . in the locomotives and he asked me all sorts of questions about my . driving. It's the first time I've met him and he seemed very nice.' Charles also looked round the museum's . collection of royal carriages, including Queen Victoria's favourite . carriage, King Edward's saloon and Queen Elizabeth's saloon, used by the . Royal Family during the Second World War. The visit was the first event of the . tour of Yorkshire by the Prince, who will be joined by the Duchess of . Cornwall tomorrow when he will visit rural communities before ending up . in the seaside town of Bridlington. Record: The Prince is the patron of celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the day the Mallard broke the world speed record when it reached 126mph on the East Coast Main Line in July 1938 . Tour: The Prince of Wales was shown the Doncaster-built Mallard and the museum's collection of royal carriages . Engagements: Charles will visit several sites in central Yorkshire today before finishing with a reception for Prince's Trust supporters at Harewood House, near Leeds . He then moved on to York Minster, where he was greeted by cheering crowds and the Archbishop of York, John Sentamu. He walked through the magnificent interior of the Gothic cathedral with the Archbishop as tourists stopped to take photographs. He . was given a private tour of a recently opened state-of-the-art visitor . attraction, Revealing York Minster, in the Undercroft before moving on . to the workshops to talk to the craftsmen and apprentices restoring the . building. Charles even had a go with a chisel and a hammer as he talked to the stonemasons. The . Dean of York, the Very Reverend Vivienne Faull, said: 'We're proud and . excited that he's come today - but especially today because, in the life . of his family, this is going to be such an important day.' The Dean said she was especially pleased the Prince took such an interest in the apprentices working at the Minster. Exhibits: The Prince of Wales was shown around the museum's collection of royal carriages . Smiling: The Prince seemed happy and relaxed will looking around the museum's collection of trains . Train fan: Charles was apparently very interested in the vintage locomotives he saw in the museum . As the Prince left the workshops, in glorious sunshine, he was greeted by crowds shouting 'congratulations'. One York resident, John Dowson, had a joke with the Prince, shouting out 'It's triplets!' as a joke and receiving a generous laugh in return. During his visit to an abattoir, Charles joked about becoming a grandfather, saying: 'I'm very grateful indeed for the kind wishes for my rather slowly approaching grandfatherhood.' He added: 'Some of you may realise that with grandfatherhood comes, in four months' time, old-age-pensionerhood.' The Prince's comments came as he toured Dovecote Park, a food processing plant near Pontefract, where owner Richard Canvin said: 'We'd like to wish you a speedy and safe arrival of your first grandchild.' Technical director Peter Boyes said that Charles had been keen to discuss issues such as sustainability and animal welfare, especially since he keeps his own cattle. On duty: Prince Charles, pictured in York today, . and the Queen, pictured last week, are carrying out their schedules as . normal despite the Duchess of Cambridge going into labour today . Couple: William and Kate drove to the hospital around 6am today to prepare for the birth of their child . Hospital: Kate was in labour in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London . Scrum: The media had gathered outside the hospital awaiting the birth of the future monarch . Charles has rarely commented publicly on the impending birth, but earlier this month he asked a women's group if they had any tips on being a good grandparent during to a trip to Kenfig in Wales. One 74-year-old grandmother told him, 'Spoil them - enjoy it,' leading him to reminisce about happy memories of his own grandmother, the Queen Mother. The Queen was kept informed about Kate's condition when she was at Windsor castle, and travelled to Buckingham Palace early in the afternoon. Prince Harry is at RAF Wattisham in Suffolk, where he is based with his squadron of Apache helicopter pilots, and is said to be very excited about becoming an uncle for the first time. The Earl of Wessex is currently in Devon. The whereabouts of the other Royals is . not known, but it is believed that William is the only relative to have . joined Kate in hospital today. Birth: Charles with Princess Diana and their newborn son William outside St Mary's in 1982 . Last week, the Queen suggested that she was keen to see the baby - her third great-grandchild - as soon as possible. During a trip to the Lake District, 10-year-old Fay Batey asked Her Majesty whether she wanted the child to be a boy or a girl. The Queen replied that she did not mind, but added: I would very much like it to arrive because I'm going on holiday soon... I wish it would hurry up.' Her Majesty is apparently set to travel to her private Balmoral estate in Scotland for her summer holiday in the next few days. The Duke of Cambridge, who has temporarily been off duty from his role as an RAF rescue pilot, will take two weeks of paternity leave after the birth.","Prince of Wales visited the National Railway Museum and York Minster .

Starbucks plans to jump into the thriving Greek-style yogurt market by teaming up with a yogurt maker Danone. Together they'll create a ready-to-eat yogurt cup they hope will compete with brands like Chobani that are flying off shelves. The Seattle-based Starbucks and the French food and drink company will have their collaboration on Starbucks store shelves in Spring 2014. New offering: Starbucks has announced it will have a line of Greek yogurt on its shelves by 2014 . They'll be called Evolution Fresh inspired by Dannon, part of Starbucks’ mounting push into the health and wellness arena. Distribution to grocery stores is planned for 2015, with global expansion to follow, the companies said. Financial terms of the multiyear deal weren't disclosed. Greek yogurt, which is thicker and has a tarter taste, has surged in popularity in recent years and now accounts for more than a third of the market, according to Bernstein Research. The U.S. retail market for yogurt is estimated at $7 billion, according to Euromonitor International, a sales tracking firm, having grown an average 8.5 percent during the last five years. Lucrative: Starbucks will team with Dannon to create their new yogurt and nudge into the booming U.S. Greek-style yogurt market . Fans like that Greek yogurt tends to have more protein and less sugar than the sweeter, thinner varieties traditionally sold in American supermarkets. The popularity of brands such as Chobani and Fage has prompted makers of traditional supermarket yogurt, such as General Mills' Yoplait, to scramble to introduce Greek varieties. Danone makes Dannon, Stonyfield and Activia yogurt in the U.S. It introduced Oikos Greek yogurt in 2011. Starbucks Corp. and Danone say distribution will eventually expand to targeted markets outside the U.S. The companies did not provide any details on pricing or the products. The move also builds on Starbucks' push to improve its food. It has been introducing Evolution Fresh juices and plans to roll out new baked goods in the year ahead. New sandwiches and salads were also recently introduced.",The new offering will be part of the coffee chain's growing Evolution Fresh product line .

The relaxed gathering in front of a fireplace in Roger and Sarah . Lande's living room in Muscatine was a stark contrast to the more . subdued, party-line approach Xi had while meeting with U.S. leaders in . Washington earlier this week. During talks with President Barack Obama, members of Congress and others, Xi, 58, said little new - . and did little to narrow the differences that exist between the U.S. and .

Inside, he sat on a couch in front of a fireplace . as the Iowa residents recalled their memories of his trip. He stood to speak - through a translator - when it was his turn and . told Eleanor and Tom Dvorchak he remembered sleeping in their Muscatine . bedroom in 1985, their curious daughter who asked him lots of questions . and the popcorn they gave him as a gift. Tom Dvorchak asked whether Xi remembered the liquor he'd given them - and he did. He also recalled one young girl asking whether he'd seen American movies, and being shocked when he told her he'd watched 'The Godfather.' 'It's inappropriate, but I love that man,' a beaming Eleanor Dvorchak . said after the meeting, recalling how he'd even said she hadn't aged . since they last met and invited the Iowans to visit him in Beijing. 'He's just such a people person. When I see him, I have so much hope for . the future. I really do.' She said he seemed to be the same man he was in 1985: handsome, friendly and ambitious. And he had that same smile. Twenty-seven ago Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping had travelled there to met a group of Iowa farmers and business leaders during a diplomatic exchange to this Mississippi River town in the American heartland. In his returning Iowa visit,  Xi had . the opportunity to show a more personal side away from the tough . questions on policy, trade and international relations. Down memory lane: The Muscatine Journal ran a photograph of Xi Jinping's visit to the Iowa farm town as an agriculture official in 1985. The man tipped to be China's next leader is pictured centre back . A pleasure to have around: The family who looked after Xi Jinping remember a handsome and polite 31-year-old who was 'very undemanding' Those . who attended the 45-minute reunion in the two-story Victorian home said . Xi enthusiastically introduced Chinese government leaders traveling . with him, shook everyone's hand and even made a couple light remarks. They . were struck by his charm, described him as genuine and hoped his . friendly approach to Midwesterners is a positive sign for the future of . U.S.-China relations. 'The . guy has a clairvoyant memory. It was unbelievable,' said vegetable . farmer Tom Hoopes, who showed Xi his asparagus and sweet potatoes during . his stay in Muscatine in 1985. 'I can't imagine anyone carrying himself any better. I was absolutely overwhelmed. He carries himself like a true gentleman.' His . return to Muscatine in the middle of his U.S. trip comes as he is . preparing to become party leader this autumn and assume China's . presidency in 2013. Xi showed little spontaneity during . the tightly scripted Washington leg of his visit, particularly when . compared with his wisecracking host, Vice President Joe Biden. But he . did appear confident and at ease - certainly more so than the current . Chinese President Hu Jintao, who comes across as remote and aloof. Xi . looked attentive, nodding and smiling when meeting Obama and other top . officials. Demonstrations: Tibetans rally before a protest march outside the Iowa Statehouse prior to visit of Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping yesterday . During talks with President Barack Obama, members of Congress and others, Xi, 58, said little new - and did little to narrow the differences that exist between the U.S. and China on issues such as human rights . Xi used his . ties to the small, rural state of Iowa to show a personal connection . with everyday Americans. In his main policy speech of the U.S. visit, . delivered in Washington before he departed for Iowa on Wednesday, he . made a strong call for more people-to-people ties between the U.S. and . China, and referred to his 1985 trip to Muscatine. 'I'm . going to tell my old friends there that the golden keys presented to us . by Muscatine city hall symbolized the opening of local exchanges . between our two countries,' he said. The . local newspaper, the Muscatine Journal, reprinted a photograph of him . accepting the key to the city Wednesday and saying then, 'Relations . between the American people and Chinese people are deepening day by . day.' Xi also wooed Iowa . residents during a state dinner Wednesday night at the Capitol, where . officials and lawmakers praised him for his charisma and ability to . connect with people. On . Thursday, he will attend an agriculture conference in Des Moines and . meet with a soybean farmer before heading to Los Angeles for the final . stop of his tour. While the tone of Xi's visit reflects a different style to Hu, the vice president did not break any new ground on policy, emphasizing the fact that he is not yet empowered as leader. He has restated China's standard positions on issues such as Taiwan - the self-governing island that Beijing asserts belongs to the mainland - and Tibet, where it faces unrest by supporters of exiled Buddhist leader, the Dalai Lama. He has also reiterated a demand that the U.S. lift restrictions on high-tech exports to China. He did concede China needed to do more to improve human rights in his country - a longstanding U.S. demand and constant thorn in relations between the two powers. But his comments mimicked those made by Hu during his state visit to Washington in January 2011. Evans Revere, a former senior State Department official on East Asia, said through his visit to Iowa, Xi was seeking to convey a sense of his personal engagement in the U.S. relationship and that he takes it seriously. 'I think Americans appreciate that kind of gesture, as the Chinese would of an American leader telling a personal story. It pulls at the emotional heart strings a little,' he said.","'For me, you are America,' Xi told a group of about 16 people he referred to as 'old friends'

Kate's girl: The Duchess' private secretary Rebecca Deacon at the Lindo Wing on Monday . The Duke and Duchess will not be hiring a nanny to help them with their young son, but there is no doubt that their team of trusted advisers that supported them through Monday's Royal birth will be there every step of the way. Including the medical team, their private secretaries and their security guards, the Cambridges have a close group of people to stand by them. THE GIRL FRIDAY . No twin-set and pearls for Rebecca Deacon, a vicar’s daughter who has worked as the duchess’s private secretary since her engagement was announced in 2010. When the Mail bumped into her yesterday, she was, as almost always, a virtual ‘copy Kate’, in skin-tight skinny jeans, sling-back canvas wedge heels and a pair of over-sized sunglasses. But don’t let her casual get-up fool anyone. Becca, as she is known to her friends, is Kate’s indispensable Girl Friday. The 30-year-old is typical of the young team who have set up shop at Kensington Palace, where blue blood counts for remarkably little. The youngest of three sisters, she was brought up by her mother, Selina, after her father, Michael, an army major, died in 1986. After working as a house mother at Port Regis prep school in Dorset, her mother was ordained as a priest and is now a vicar at St John’s Church, in the tiny Wiltshire parish of Upper Studley. Rebecca was a pupil at the exclusive Royal School in Bath before studying English at Newcastle University. Her ‘big break’ came when she worked behind the scenes on William and Harry’s 2007 Concert For Diana as a producer’s assistant and won plaudits for her coolness under pressure. She was subsequently absorbed into . William and Harry’s private office and, when William’s engagement was . announced, moved to work for Kate. Last year she was officially promoted to private secretary, the most senior role in the duchess’s household. ‘In a very short time, Rebecca has become one of the central figures in the duchess’s life,’ said a source.

Affable but sharp as a tack, Miguel Head is William’s private secretary and is at the heart of a core band of advisers guiding the couple through the early stages of their public life together. Educated at Bancroft’s, a small public school in Essex, the 34-year-old is not much older than his employer but brings to the role a wealth of experience outside of royal circles. He joined the Ministry of Defence press office in his early 20s and worked his way up, serving as the liaison with Clarence House when Harry went to war in 2007. Editors agreed a media blackout to allow Lieutenant Wales to serve in Afghanistan, but he had to be pulled out when foreign media broke the embargo. Miguel’s performance in handling such a delicate situation – not least because of Harry’s ire – hugely impressed the princes, who hired him to head their press office. In the role, Miguel, who owes his name to his Portuguese mother, managed to earn both the respect and trust of his principals. As a result he was promoted to the coveted position of private secretary to the Duke of Cambridge last year after his long-standing predecessor Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton (a more traditional ex-army and ex-courtier figure) withdrew to an overseeing role. Mig, as he is known to his friends, is believed to be the first senior royal aide to enter into a civil partnership with his long-term partner in 2011, the same year his boss wed. Like many members of William, Kate  and Harry’s ‘unstuffy’ private office, Miguel  and his staff prefer to undertake their team bonding sessions over karaoke and chardonnay. THE MEDICAL TEAM . 'He was this big!' Obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston and Surgeon-Gyneacologists Marcus Setchell and Alan Farthing depart the hospital after delivering the baby boy of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . The Queen’s own Surgeon-Gynaecologist, Marcus Setchell, was in charge of the birth. A devoted grandfather himself, the 69-year-old has attended the Queen for more than 20 years. He also delivered both of the Countess of Wessex’s children, Lady Louise, nine, and James, Viscount Severn, four. The countess collapsed and was close . to death when Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the . placenta ruptured the lining of the womb. Mr Setchell also led the . medical care following Sophie’s ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and performed . the Duchess of Cornwall’s hysterectomy in 2007. Obstetrician .

Yet the intricate and other-worldly detail belongs to something a bit closer to home - a golf ball. The unexpected bright centers found in something quite mundane have been documented by photographer James Friedman. Despite the rings of color, this is the inside of a golf ball and not a new planetary discovery . A space oddity: Mr Friedman did not expect to find beauty in the middle of a golf ball . Photographer James Friedman decided to slice his golf ball collection in half to see what lies beneath . The core of a golf ball affects how quickly it spins and how far it will fly through the air . Sheer curiosity led him to cut his golf ball collection in half to see what was inside. Beneath the dimples lies the core of the ball, made from dough, which affects how quickly it spins and how far it can fly. There are strict rules on how golf balls are made, set by the R&A, based at the world's oldest golf club in St Andrews, Scotland, and they must not be heavier than 1.62oz. The dough, usually made from about a dozen raw ingredients, is color-coded depending on its intended effects on a golfer's game. Despite his collection, Mr Friedman, from Columbus, Ohio, is not a golfer himself. Not every golf ball has a colorful interior, with some looking more futuristic than their bright counterparts . The golf ball project made photographer James Friedman more excited about taking abstract pictures alongside his documentary work . Friedman was delighted to find 'elegant formal qualities' in the most mundane of places - inside a golf ball . Beneath their plain exteriors, there's a riot of color to be found and each color stands for a different impact . The raspberry interior of this golf ball is created out of dough, which is blended from a dozen ingredients . Instead his pictures, which appear under the title Interior Design, have given him a new appreciation of photography beyond his award-winning real-life work. Mr Friedman, who gained his master's degree at San Francisco State University, said: 'To my surprise, . what I found inside inspired me to consider that I could discover, in . the unlikeliest of places, elegant formal qualities and surprising . metaphorical possibilities. 'Interior Design has moved me to be . enthusiastic about abstraction, an exciting corollary to my work as a . documentary photographer.'

'Brute': Jeremy Brent Cramer, 38, of Lacey, Wash., is accused of deliberate homicide after his 3-year-old son's body was found in Montana . A Washington state man told his father during a chilling jailhouse phone call that he killed his 3-year-old son after taking pills and running out of gas on a remote road in southwestern Montana, according to new court documents. Excerpts from the transcript of the call recorded the morning after Jeremy Cramer's arrest on July 8 depict the 38-year-old Lacey man as rambling and sometimes incoherent. 'I killed my own son and I don't know why,' Cramer said. He also repeatedly refuted his father's hopes that Brody Cramer may still be alive. Cramer told his father that he started walking down the road, with Brody on his shoulders, after running out of gas. The boy became 'like some other kid when he was on my neck,' then he remembered looking at his son's face and 'I just died right there,' Cramer said, according to the transcript. 'The thing was, it wasn't like I had a few beers or it was like something was up inside. Why did I take all my pills? Did I take all my pills?' The charging documents and affidavit were filed Friday by Anaconda-Deer Lodge County Attorney Ben Krakowka. They provide the most details released to date on what happened between the morning of July 8, when Cramer's wife reported him and his son missing, and late that night, when Cramer was arrested in an Anaconda gas station washing blood off his clothes and body. Cramer has been charged with deliberate homicide. His court-appointed attorney did not return a call for comment on Monday. If convicted, Cramer could face death or life in prison. Krakowka did not return a call for comment on whether he will pursue the death penalty. Brody Cramer's beaten and stabbed body was found in a field the morning of July 9. Innocent toddler: Brody Cramer, 3, was found slain in a field not far from his father's truck . Investigators found a knife and two rocks covered with blood and hair next to the body, along with a blanket and a global-positioning satellite unit, according to the court documents. Police found bloody keys and a knife on Jeremy Cramer, along with an empty container for a generic substitute of the drug Adderall. The container for the stimulant said the prescription was filled July 3 with 60 pills, and only two pills were supposed to be taken per day. Cramer's brother, Jon Cramer, told police that his brother was a former methamphetamine addict who had been 'doctor shopping' in Washington state for a physician who would provide him with Adderall. Nataliya Cramer reported to Lacey police on July 8 that her husband had not responded to numerous phone calls and text messages. Jeremy Cramer's credit card was used that day in Post Falls, Idaho, and that night, a security company noted Cramer's truck parked near a power plant east of Anaconda. Crime scene: Cramer's car was discovered 5 miles southeast of town on Montana Secondary Highway 569 . Austin Howell told police Cramer . offered him and Trenton Zolman first $50, then $100, for a ride into . town, saying he had run out of gas. They . gave Cramer a ride and asked about the blood on his pants, shirt and . tie, to which Cramer responded, 'I had a traumatic experience and no one . is dead,' according to the documents. When . they arrived at a gas station, Howell went inside and warned the clerk . 'there was something off about this guy,' the documents said. Outside, Cramer held Zolman's hand, saying, 'You are clean,' prayed and then went inside to the bathroom. The . clerk called police, and an officer found Cramer in the restroom with . his pants off attempting to wash away the blood. He told the officer . that he had broken up a fight at a rest area. He . was arrested when he refused to put his clothes back on. Cramer's wife . confirmed her husband's identity and asked police to 'find my son.' Resting place: Officers discovered the boy's body in this field outside of town . Cramer . refused to provide information about his son or the location of his . truck. Cramer, a Mormon, asked to speak to somebody high in The Church . of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, saying 'the adversary,' or devil, . 'is out.' The church president for southwestern Montana spoke with Cramer for an hour, but Cramer did not reveal the boy's location. At . 5:27 a.m., Cramer called his father from the jailhouse near a sign that . says all calls are recorded. He also asked an officer whether phone . calls are recorded, the documents said. His father suggested over and over that Brody may still be alive. 'Dad, Brody's dead,' Cramer said.'Are you sure?' his father responded. 'My son is dead, 100 percent, my son is dead, yes I did it, something did it of me but I didn't do it,' Cramer answered. 'He could be laying in a field still alive,' his father said a moment later. New beginning: The Cramers moved into this home in Lacey, Washington, just over a year ago, but the couple fought over money because Jeremy Cramer had lost his job . 'Dad, . he's dead, dead, dead, dead because I know he is. I just know it. I see . a vivid picture of him looking at him before ahhh. He's dead, OK,' Cramer said. Investigators . found Brody's body at 6:15 a.m. in a field off Mill Creek Road, about 5 . miles southeast of Anaconda. The cause of death was sharp- and . blunt-force injuries, according to an autopsy. Cramer . told investigators that morning as they were trying to read him his . rights, 'You gotta understand something. I killed my best friend.' The . officer told him to quit talking until he was advised of his rights. The interview ended soon afterward as Cramer said he'd need an attorney, . according to the documents.

"By . Paul Harris . UPDATED: . 23:04 EST, 23 December 2011 . Hitting back: Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul . Turkey deepened its acrimonious rift with France yesterday by accusing the country of genocide. Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan claimed French forces burned people in ovens during their colonial occupation of Algeria. He told President Nicolas Sarkozy he should ask his ex-Foreign Legion father about atrocities carried out during French imperial rule in the 1940s and 1950s. The charge was a bitter retaliation against French MPs’ decision 24 hours earlier to make it a crime to deny that the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 constituted genocide. But the widening gulf between France and its strategic ally and trading partner looks set to have repercussions far beyond settling accounts over some of the bloodiest episodes of the last century. France invaded Algeria in 1830 and subjected its largely Muslim inhabitants to 132 years of colonial rule. Backlash: Turkish riot police stand guard in front of the French Consulate in Istanbul after France approved a bill which would make it illegal to deny the mass killing of Armenians in 1915 by Ottoman Turks was genocide . Fury: Protesters outside the consulate in Istanbul. Turkey has withdrawn its ambassador and promised further action after the bill was passed today . Mr Erdogan said that from 1945, an . estimated 15 per cent of the population was massacred by the French. Going home: Turkish ambassador to France, Tahsin Burcuoglu, after being recalled . Some were ‘mercilessly martyred’ when they were burned in ovens, he . said. ‘What the French did in Algeria was genocide,’ Mr Erdogan added on . live television. ‘If Mr Sarkozy doesn’t know about this genocide, he . should go and ask his father, Pal Sarkozy. ‘His father served in the French Legion in Algeria in the 1940s. I am . sure he would have lots to tell his son about the French massacres in . Algeria.’ Mr Sarkozy senior dismissed the comments as ‘completely ridiculous’. He . told French TV: ‘I have never been to Algeria. I’ve never been beyond . Marseille and I was in the Foreign Legion for just four months.’ His son, speaking in Prague, where he attended the funeral of former . Czech president Vaclav Havel, responded calmly to Mr Erdogan’s comments. ‘I respect the convictions of our Turkish friends,’ said Mr Sarkozy. ‘It’s a great country with a great civilisation, [but] it has to respect . our convictions.’ Controversial: French riot police outside the National Assembly building in Paris . French foreign minister Alain Juppe described Turkey’s reaction as ‘in . all likelihood excessive’, but said: ‘There are many reasons to keep . alive a relationship of trust and friendship.’ French MPs voted . overwhelmingly on Thursday for a draft law outlawing genocide denial . over the Armenian massacres. Although nearly a century has passed since the killings in the middle of . the First World War, the vast majority of Turks feel the charge of . genocide is an insult to their nation. Turkey argues that killings took . place on all sides during a fierce partisan conflict. Mr Erdogan condemned the French bill shortly after the vote, recalled . Ankara’s ambassador to France for consultations and cancelled all joint . economic, political and military meetings. Yesterday he said: ‘We will . take gradual measures as long as the current French attitude is . maintained. ‘The vote . . . has shown how dangerous racism, discrimination and Islamophobia have become in France and Europe.’ Almost from the day in 1830 that the French seized it as a colony, Algeria’s story was one of brutality and repression. Bent on exploiting the country for its natural resources, the colonial rulers regarded their Muslim subjects as an inferior species and responded to any resistance with a policy of indiscriminate slaughter. In one particularly hideous early episode, French forces trapped civilians in caves and set bonfires at the entrances, so they had to choose between dying from smoke or flames. French troops tend to an injured demonstrator in Algiers in 1962 . Over the first 30 years of French rule, . the population shrank from a pre-colonial peak of 4million to an . estimated 2.3million, and fresh outbreaks of violence were common . throughout the next century. They culminated in the 1950s  in an eight-year war of independence that . still ranks among the bloodiest conflicts of the last century. France has never accepted that atrocities carried out in the 1954-1962 . war, when thousands were tortured and massacred, were acts of genocide. The seeds of the rebellion were sown between the two world wars, when . Algerian resistance groups and nationalist movements grew stronger. In 1945, demonstrations throughout Algeria called for independence. French security forces put them down with the usual brute force, and . shot dead a protester waving a banned Algerian flag, sparking  a . reaction that engulfed the country in riots. In the violence that . followed, 45,000 Algerians were killed over a few days, according to . Algerian figures. Many were burned in ovens, it is alleged, to destroy . the evidence of carnage. Turkey appeared to suggest yesterday that some were thrown into the . ovens while still alive, though there is no validated evidence for this. By 1950, French Foreign Legion troops were helping to track down and . eliminate revolutionaries, and an ‘uprising’ compelled France to commit . 400,000 soldiers. In a chilling echo of another war that had only recently ended, they set . up concentration camps, tortured prisoners and carried out mass . executions of civilians suspected of aiding the rebels. The bloody war continued until 1962, when the French withdrew. Algeria suffered a death toll variously estimated at between 500,000 and 1.5million. And there was more atrocity to come. Thousands of Muslim Algerian . ‘Harkis’ – pro-French volunteers – who had fought alongside French . troops were abandoned to face bloody reprisals in their homeland. Estimates are that at least 30,000, possibly as many as 150,000, were . slaughtered by republican supporters after the Evian peace accord was . signed in March 1962. France, it is alleged, turned a blind eye.","'They were mercilessly martyred,' claims Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 13:07 EST, 22 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:37 EST, 22 July 2013 . The American soldier who entered a village and murdered 16 civilians in Afghanistan may now have documents that directly link his alleged crimes to use of the antimalarial drug mefloquine. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales pleaded guilty last month of slaughtering village people in the country’s Kandahar province in March 2012. It has since been suggested that Bales’ previous head injury, paired with use of the common drug, contributed to his homicidal actions but no direct link had previously been uncovered. Now, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration ‘adverse event’ notification has been discovered from 2012 in which the pharmacist refers to a soldier who killed over a dozen Afghani civilians after taking the mefloquine, which is known to adversely affect 5-10 percent of users and comes with a warning that those with previous brain trauma should not use the drug. Link? An FDA 'adverse event' report has been uncovered that may link antimalarial drug mefloquine to a U.S. soldier's murder of 16 Afghani civilians in 2012 . Cold blood: Army Staff Sergeant Robert Bales pleaded guilty last month to entering an Afghani village and murdering 16, mostly women and children . As Bales faces a potential life . sentence, his attorney John Henry Browne has publicly brought up his . history with the controversial malarial drug—which is linked to . paranoia, hallucinations and psychosis—while on a previous deployment in . Iraq. However, Browne has not said if he intends cite mefloquine as a . contributing factor to his client’s crimes. Browne . did admit he had no indication that the pharmacist's notification was . filed by anyone with direct knowledge of Bales' use of the drug in . Afghanistan. Army . officials have not commented on whether Bales took mefloquine in . Afghanistan leading up to the attack, citing confidentiality laws that . protect a patient's records. The defense has argued that Bales, . the father of two from Lake Tapps, Washington, was suffering from . post-traumatic stress disorder and a brain injury even before his . deployment to Afghanistan. Some experts urge against blaming the drug completely, however. 'Tens of millions of people take it,' Dr. David Sullivan of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute told ABC News. 'Honestly, you cannot implicate any one thing. To put it all on . mefloquine is not fair. [Bales] already has a predisposition because of a . traumatic brain injury and he has taken this drug in a stressful . situation. You have to put it in context here...but you can't exclude . it.' The pill's fault? As Bales awaits sentencing, new documents link his behavior to the use of mefloquine, though he also admits to steroid and alcohol use . FDA spokesperson Stephanie Yao told ABC the anonymous report was authentic, though it's impossible to know who submitted it. 'These are voluntary reports,' she said. 'They are anonymous mainly because of the regulations protecting patient information, so names are not included.' Dr. Remington Nevin, an Army major and epidemiologist called mefloquine a 'zombie drug.' 'It's dangerous and it should have been killed off years ago,' said Dr. Nevin, who has published research that he said showed the drug can be potentially toxic to the brain. He called it 'probably the worst-suited drug for the military' and noted that its side effects can closely mirror symptoms of stress disorders related to combat, making diagnosis of neurological problems difficult. Bales slipped away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early on March 11, 2012, and attacked compounds in nearby villages. Most of the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were piled and burned. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily stopped combat operations in Afghanistan. Previous issue: Bales had a history of brain trauma, which should have precluded his use of the controversial, yet widely used, antimalarial drug . Previous use: Bales' attorney John Henry Browne (2nd from left) has already claimed to have documents showing his client was given mefloquine in Iraq, though no proof he took it in Afghanistan . Under questioning from the judge, Army Colonel Jeffery Nance, Bales said that his use of illegal steroids, which he admitted taking to improve muscle tone and recovery time from missions, also ‘increased my irritability and anger.’ During a nine-day pre-trial hearing last fall, witnesses testified that Bales had been upset by a bomb blast near his outpost that severed a fellow soldier's leg days before the shootings. Gruesome: Staff Sergeant Bales admitted to shooting, and even burning his victims. Men are pictured standing over where their loved ones were torched in March 2012 . One corporal recounted that in the hours before the rampage he, Bales and a third soldier had been drinking whiskey together while watching the Hollywood film ‘Man on Fire,’ which stars Denzel Washington as a former assassin bent on revenge.

An Australian woman has described the moment a 'love rival turned her into a human fireball' because she believed the blonde was having an affair with her estranged husband. Dana Vulin, 28, claimed Natalie Dimitrovska, 29, stormed uninvited into her flat last February and demanded to know where her on-off spouse Edin Handanovic was hiding. But when convicted drug user Vulin said she didn't know, Dimitrovska allegedly hurled a bottle of methylated spirits over her while she was holding a lamp used for smoking crystal meth. Vulin said the alleged attack followed a campaign and harassment, including one phone call in which Dimitrovska told her: 'I'm going to ruin your pretty little face.' 'I was pretty much instantly on fire,' a weeping Vulin told Western Australia's District Court. 'I was a human fireball.' 'The moment I was on fire, [Dimitrovska and a male accomplice] just laughed and ran out of my apartment,' she added. The horrifying incident took place on February 16 this year.

Seventy Olympic athletes and coaches who claimed political asylum after the Games last year are still in Britain. Half have already been granted refugee status by the Home Office and will be allowed to settle. The rest are still in the country fighting for the right to remain. Police have admitted they are also looking for several other Olympic visa holders whose right to be in the UK expired seven months ago. They have ‘simply wandered off to make a better life’ in Britain, according to a senior officer. At the end of the Games, reports suggested around 21 athletes and coaches had disappeared from the Olympic Village and failed to return home to countries including the Ivory Coast, Guinea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Cameroon and Sudan. But the Daily Mail has learnt the true total is much higher. Some 70,000 Olympic Games Family Member visas were issued to give coaches, athletes and team officials a limited right to stay in Britain until last November. A Freedom of Information request to the Home Office about how many stayed on after that was not answered for seven months, despite a legal deadline of 21 days. Sources said officials had been ‘running around desperately’ to find as many illegal Olympic over-stayers as possible before answering questions. When the request was finally answered, officials said they believed the ‘great majority’ of the 70,000 had left the country. But they admitted asylum applications had been submitted by 79 Olympic visa holders, just nine of whom had been removed from the country. Another 22 have been refused asylum but are engaged in lengthy appeals, and decisions are pending in 13 cases. Separately, the Metropolitan Police has admitted four African Olympians have been classed as missing people in the London borough of Newham. Staying: Scores of Olympians remained after the closing ceremony last summer . Disappearance: Mandembo Kebika Cedric, 29, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo judo squad, has been reported missing by London Police . Detective Chief Inspector Dave Rock told the Newham Recorder: ‘We’re working with the UK Border Agency to find them, but I think we can assume they have simply wandered off to make a better life for themselves in this country.’ They were named as Aissata Toure, 20, a sprinter from Guinea; Drusille Ngako Tchimi, 25, the Cameroon women’s football team reserve goalkeeper; Mandembo Kebika Cedric, 29, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo judo squad; and Yves Olivier Adje, 30, an Ivory Coast wrestling coach. Two other Guineans and two other Ivorians were also reported missing at the end of the Games. Among those believed to have claimed asylum are the Congolese judo coach Ibula Masengo, athletics director Guy Nkita and boxing trainer Blaise Bekwa. The Eritrean athlete Weynay Ghebresilasie, 18, was one of four from his country to claim asylum before the Games finished. He said he was doing so because of ‘harsh conditions’ and ‘lack of basic human rights’ in Eritrea. Officials have refused to give a full breakdown of the asylum seekers’ nationalities because, they claimed, it risked identifying them, but it is thought the vast majority are African.","Half of Olympians applying for asylum have been allowed to settle .

Ecstatic: Heather Carroll today said her sextuplets look 'wonderful' - and revealed how she had to eat 6,000 calories a day to keep them nourished . The mother of a set of sextuplets born in Alabama over Father's Day weekend today revealed how she had to consume 6,000 calories each day just to keep them nourished. Looking ecstatic but exhausted, Heather Carroll, who is just 5'2"" tall, said the tiny babies - five girls and a boy - all 'look wonderful'. She and her husband Mitchell also revealed they have named the six alphabetically, after the letters doctors gave them when they were still in the womb: Abbie, Brooklyn, Chloe, David, Ellie and Faith. The couple gave a press conference at Brookwood Medical Center in Birmingham today, where they were joined by gynaecologist Bill McKenzie, who proudly described the diminutive Mrs Carroll as 'country tough.' Mrs Carroll said: 'The babies look . great. I was expecting them to be just real weakly looking and real . tiny. They're not. They look wonderful.' She . gave birth to the sextuplets by planned Caesarian section on Saturday . morning, 28 weeks and one day into her pregnancy, after a month of . strict bed rest - including her 30th birthday. They . arrived in the space of just three minutes, the eldest, Abbie, at . 8.05am and the youngest, Faith, at 8.08am, and weighed between 1lb 10oz . and 2lbs 5oz. Dr McKenzie told the Birmingham News: 'All of them were born very healthy, and that weight spread is a good sign that there was not one baby that was lagging behind, that all of them had grown and developed well. I'm extremely proud of Heather.' The babies were welcomed into the . world by a team of 51 medical staff, who had rehearsed the delivery six . times before. Each baby had their own group of doctors and nurses. Today neonatologist Vick DiCarlo said all six had been taken off their ventilators and were doing well. Scroll down for video . Number three: A doctor holds up baby Chloe, born at 8.06am on Saturday and weighing 1lb 15oz. The babies were delivered by a carefully-planned Caesarean section at Brookwood Medical Center in Alabama . His colleague, Dr McKenzie, paid tribute to Mrs Carroll, saying: 'Heather is country tough, she has a strong faith, they were very committed, despite very pessimistic odds about their success.' The 30-year-old provoked laughter from the assembled press as she described her 6,000 calorie-a-day diet. She said: 'It was very hard. They had me keep a sheet of everything I ate, and they . would always do the calories for it. The sextuplets were born by Caesarian section in just three minutes on Saturday.

'And all of the snacks, every day . they would start bring me snack foods and desserts. I mean, it was very . good, but I can't imagine doing that again.' Mrs Carroll is 115lbs, but she put on an extra 35lbs during her pregnancy, a weight she could barely carry. The week before she gave birth, she said she could feel exactly where each of the babies were sitting: one on each hip, three lower down on her pelvis and another which moved up and down. The Carrolls, who live in the tiny town of Plantersville in Dallas County, Alabama, already have an older son, Grant, who is 22-months-old. The couple had struggled for years to . have children, and Mrs Carroll had four miscarriages before being . diagnosed with polycystic ovaries. To have Grant, Mrs Carroll underwent . intrauterine insemination, in which she took fertility drugs to boost . her own egg production before her husband's sperm was injected directly . into her uterus. She went through the same process for her next pregnancy. It can sometimes result in twins or triplets - but rarely sextuplets. Hello, world! Doctors gently lift up the first of the six, Abbie, who was born weighing 2lbs 5oz. All the babies are doing well and were taken off their ventilators today . In an interview shortly before the . babies were born, she described her five-week scan to the Birmingham . News. She said: 'I thought the nurse was going to faint. Then she said, . ""Oh, no, there's six,"" and started apologizing.' Once the shock wore off, Mrs Carroll . said she just started crying. She said: 'All I could think about was, . ""how are we going to take care of six . babies?"" because we had a hard enough time with our first.' But her husband, a maintenance mechanic at a paper plant, said the family would manage. Their close-knit community has already . rallied round the couple. Friends have begun extending their log home, . local firms have promised to supply diapers and formula milk and a car . dealership may donate a van. The town's church, where Mr Carroll . helps out as youth pastor, has promised to expand its nursery, and her . doctor's office threw her a baby shower. A month before the babies were born, Mrs Carroll was admitted to Brockwood Medical Center for round-the-clock monitoring. She drank a nutrient-packed milkshake . with every meal and was given extra supplements using an IV drip to . make sure she consumed enough calories to keep the babies healthy. For the last few days, she was experiencing regular contractions and had to take medication to stop the babies coming too soon. All smiles: Heather and Mitchell Carroll at today's press conference with gynaecologist Bill McKenzie, left, and neonatologist Vick DiCarlo, right . Doctors said their chance of survival grew by four per cent every day they stayed in the womb, allowing their organs to develop. Dr McKenzie said: 'It's just a very unique demand on a woman's body and she is a little . hiccup of a girl. But she's got a very big heart.' In the end, the babies arrived just in time for Father's Day, and Mr Carroll spent the day rushing from incubator to incubator, sporting five pink ID bands and one blue, to show he could visit the babies. He told the Birmingham News he was 'on top of the world'. He said: 'Everything this morning was perfect.' In a statement, Dr McKenzie said: 'Heather and Mitchell Carroll were committed to this journey, their family and community were supportive, and God was faithful.‘ .

"Wandering Dago owners say the name honors Italian American culture .

Track officials claim they received several complaints from people offended by the name . By . Daily Mail Reporter and Ap . PUBLISHED: . 14:16 EST, 22 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:33 EST, 22 July 2013 . New York Racing Association officials say they've banned a food truck - which the organization previously lauded as 'one of the country’s top barbecue fusion trucks' - from Saratoga Race Course after customers complained that the name of the business was offensive. The co-owners of the Schenectady-based Wandering Dago tell local media that they were informed Friday night by NYRA officials that they had to remove their truck from the track Saturday morning, a day after it opened for its 40-day season. NYRA officials say they received complaints about the use of a word that's considered derogatory to Italian-Americans. Banned: The 'Wandering Dago' was banned from an Upstate New York racetrack after officials decided the name was offensive to Italian Americans . Heritage: Wandering Dago owners Brandon Snooks and Andrea Loguidice say the name celebrates Italian American culture . The truck's owners say they're both of Italian descent and consider the term a tribute to their hardworking immigrant ancestors. One of the owners of the food truck business, Brandon Snooks, told the Albany Times Union that he was told he had to remove the truck from the track's grounds or it would be towed. The business has a contract with the racetrack that lasts the duration of the track's 40-day season. Part of the contract stipulates that the track has to provide a 30-day written notice of cancellation. The owners say they were given no such notice, and that there were no concerns raised about the name in the six months they spent negotiating their contract with NYRA. 'We had to turn down several weddings and a few festivals to make this . commitment to the race track, not to mention the food product already . purchased,' Snooks told the paper. Centerplate, the company that supervises food service at the track, says it will not charge Wandering Dago for the food it purchased. But that doesn't begin to cover costs the company already has incurred, including equipment purchased for track season and lost revenue from track sales . and from catering engagements Wandering Dago turned down because of its . contract in Saratoga, its owners say. A spokesman for the racetrack said it had received multiple complaints about the name, which led to the company getting the boot. Saratoga: the race track is considered one of the finest sports venues in the world and brings in big names and loads of cash for the vendors who work the 40-day season . 'We received several complaints' on Friday, said NYRA spokesman Eric Wing. 'This should have been handled before Friday, but once we received . complaints, we took immediate action on behalf of our customers.' Snooks says he - as an Italian American - doesn't consider the name offensive and cites the origin of the term as a sense of pride for Italian Americans. The term 'dago' is derived from Italian immigrants who worked as laborers and asked to be paid 'as . the day goes.' That evolved into 'dago,' the owners say. 'That’s how we make . our money, as they day goes. It might be 50 people, or it might be 100; . there’s no guarantee. And since we wander to different cities during the . day, we thought the name was perfect,' the owners said. Wandering dago had a previous run-in with the state when it was denied a food vendor's license at the Empire State Plaza in downtown Albany. 'It is ridiculous that we are a licensed New York state corporation, yet . we are being blocked from doing business by state officials,' Snooks said.","Wandering Dago owners say the name honors Italian American culture .

Meanwhile, gun owners are flocking to Shooters in New Milford, Connecticut, the nearest shooting range to Newtown. According to The Gaurdian, Shooters was doing brisk business. On Sunday, the range was open and it was business as usual as customers lined up outside waiting to take turns to squeeze off rounds in one of the 12 stations where shooters take aim at targets at up to 50 feet away. The range rents out guns too, and advertises revolvers and semi-automatic . handguns and rifles from .22 to .45 calibers. Adam Lanza used a Bushmaster .223 semi-automatic rifle in the Sandy Hook shootings on Friday.

Police say it was an overpowering smell pouring from the Oceanside home that prompted neighbours of Anna Maria and Frederick Hengl, 68, to alert them to the residence on Friday. 'About a week and a half ago, I noticed a pretty gross smell,' next-door neighbour Erick Chavez, 21, told NBC San Diego. Scroll down for video . Grisly find: The dismembered body of a 74-year-old woman was found in this Oceanside, California home on Friday morning with the woman's husband arrested on suspicion of murder . Unusual couple: Neighbours of the couple say they were extremely strange with the victim frequently seen with her pants down on the street while holding a knife and her husband seen cross dressing . By Friday morning, it had grown absolutely unbearable he said, prompting him to report it. Entering the home police discovered what remained of Mrs Hengl whom they said had been dead for at least one day. Arrested outside a downtown bar was her 68-year-old husband with police questioning neighbours on possible power tools or heavy machinery heard coming from the home as of late. 'I just thought somebody was working in their garage,' neighbour Nancy Wells, one of several who confirmed such sounds told CBS8. In addition to the loud sounds, Mr Chavez said Hengl had shown a particular attachment to his trash cans as of late. 'The . man was taking his trash cans back and forth,' Mr Chavez told News10. 'He’s been going around the block, up and around, taking pieces of her . and putting them in the trash; going around the block? I don't know,' he . guessed.

Tipped off: Next-door neighbour Erick Chavez, 21, said he alerted authorities after a horrible smell poured from the home for the last week and a half . Adding to his and others’ concern Mrs Hengl hadn't been seen for roughly a month. It was an irregularity they said because of the kind of bizarre show she regularly put on for people on the street. ‘My neighbour was just telling me she'd chase her down the street with a knife or she'd have her clothes off, pants down; you could tell she was a little bit out of it,’ neighbour Brett Lord told 10News. 'She'd stand there, feed the birds, talk to folks walking by and her pants would fall. She didn't seem to notice, ever,' neighbour Jerry Parnell told 10News. But her husband, whom she was described having a hostile relationship with, allegedly had his quirks too. 'The husband is actually known for dressing up like a woman and walking around the neighbourhood. It's just a permanent fixture, I guess. It doesn't freak us out anymore,' Jason Chandler told NBC San Diego. Odd behaviour: Mr Chavez said that in addition to hearing power tools as of late, the victim's husband Frederick Hengl was seen frequently carrying his trash cans to and from the house, the backyard seen . In one instance a neighbour described seeing him wearing a floor-length purple dress coupled with a long pearl necklace and earrings. In his hand he held a purse, reports UT San Diego. ‘He would cross-dress and you almost couldn't recognize the guy,’ Mr Parnell said.

"By . Harriet Arkell . PUBLISHED: . 08:10 EST, 23 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:10 EST, 23 July 2013 . Majorca is planning to kick out the drunken tourists and attract instead better behaved - and higher-spending - holidaymakers. The Spanish holiday island, which has long been a favourite destination for binge-drinking Brits and Germans, is to introduce a 24-hour public drinking ban in a bid to get rid of the boozing, brawling tourists. Instead, Majorcan officials wish to turn the island into an upmarket holiday destination like St Tropez or Miami and attract well-heeled visitors from China and Dubai. Drunken: Scenes like this will be a distant memory under Majorca's plans to take the holiday island upmarket . Alvaro Gijon, deputy mayor of the island's capital Palma, said he wanted to transform Majorca's image by upgrading hotels, building new, smarter, restaurants, and developing a glitzy new casino. In particular he wants to target the four-mile Playa de Palma strip just outside the capital, banning drinking there and turning it into a destination for gastronomy and sports facilities rather than drinking buckets of sangria on sunloungers. In an interview with the German newspaper Bild, Sr Gijon said: 'Booze tourism is out of date: if people want to get drunk they should do it in the discos, not on the beach in public. 'We want people who are going to spend a lot of money.' A ban on drinking in public has been introduced this summer between 10am and 1pm, and Sr Gijon said he hoped it would send the right message to the drunken tourists he intend to get rid of, particularly in the Ballermann zone of bars favoured by binge-drinking Germans. 'There are other places in the world for them', he said. 'I wouldn't go to Ballermann with my six-year-old daughter, I wouldn't feel safe, not least because of the shards of glass.' Beautiful: The deputy mayor of Palma, pictured, wants to attract higher-spending tourists to the holiday island . Under the plans for the island, a consortium will oversee a five or six-year development of Playa de Palma, closing down many of the budget hotels and replacing them with more expensive, luxurious accommodation.

After four years of legal battles, a tranquil village thought it had finally won the right to evict a travellers camp from a local field - only to be thwarted at the 11th hour because the travellers claimed the eviction was a breach of their human rights. The locals of Hardhorn in Lancashire, thought they had won their case to have a group of 78 Irish travellers moved on after the fight went all the way from district council meetings to the High Court. But although an enforcement notice demands the group leave by July 31, a mother living on the site has now taken the travellers' case to the Court of Appeal in London saying the decision 'violates' the human rights of the 39 children staying there. Angry villagers in Hardhorn wrote to local councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices . Around 70 travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the the dead night in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation' Now it is feared the group - who villagers accuse of being 'terrible neighbours' - will be able to remain for several more months whilst an official appeal court judgement is made out. It is believed local council inspectors have been advised to delay forcing the travellers to move on whilst three top judges decide what happens next. Local parish councillor Maxine Chew, who has been fighting on behalf of villagers, said: 'It is very very disappointing that the appeal has brought the enforcement notice to a halt. 'All of the people of Hardhorn feel very hard done to. These travellers have made a small village of their own on the green belt. 'The fact that they claim their children’s human rights would be violated is ridiculous because I understand that there are no children at all on the site at the moment anyway. 'The numbers of travellers there changes all of the time. At times there has been up to 60 caravans on the land but through the summer most of the families go off to Europe for work.' The trouble began in November 2009 after a field in the village was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire . 'The residents in Hardhorn have been very understanding and patient. But the problems they have had to put up with have been non-stop. 'It is nothing to do with the fact that they are travellers. They are illegally there and their behaviour has been hugely disruptive. 'If these people had been good neighbours then we would have been happy to accommodate them but the fact is they have been terrible neighbours. 'The site is a terrible mess, their dogs are forever barking and they have generators running all night. 'The villagers have complained about these people poaching rabbiting and roaming all over their land then harassing them and being rude when told to behave.' The trouble began in November 2009 after a field in the village - which featured in BBC's Gardeners World - was sold by a farmer to a travelling family from West Yorkshire. Days before the council's deadline for the travellers to move, an appeal has been lodged meaning that they are now likely to be able to remain for months until an official judgement is made . Around 70 travellers then set up camp after sneaking in during the night in what neighbours described as a 'military-style operation' and after council offices had closed for the weekend . The group of 30 adults and 40 children - mainly from Irish and Scottish families - immediately began work laying foundations under outdoor spot lights. Angry villagers wrote to local councillors, raising concerns about noise, road safety and a potential drop in house prices with one saying he and his wife had not been able to sleep due to noise from the site. Officials at Fylde District Council later went to court to stop the group laying hardcore foundations to make their 2.4 hectare site more permanent. They were granted an injunction banning the travellers from bringing more caravans onto the land but were ordered to allow them to bring water to the site and to use power generators. In 2010 a county court judge then told the authorities to 'use their best endeavours' to help the travellers get a post code for the Land from the Post Office. Not welcome: The travellers' presence at the site has upset locals . At the time the travellers argued they needed a postode to help fire and ambulance crews find them if they were in need of an emergency - and the ruling meant they could also apply for state benefits, plus utilities including gas electricity and water. The travellers then applied for planning permission to stay on the fields for good and proposed to install further utility buildings, cesspools, fencing and hardstandings. Fylde Council refused the group retrospective planning permission and issued an enforcement notice demanding that they move off the site. An inspector at a planning inquiry also ruled that they had to leave. A travellers group representative, Elizabeth Collins, then appealed and took the matter to the High Court last September - but another judge ruled the planning inspector's decision should stand. He also ordered Miss Collins to pay £8,000 in costs. Now, just days before the council’s deadline for the travellers to move, an appeal has been lodged meaning that they are now likely to be able to remain for months until the Court of Appeal has heard the case and made a decision.","Locals of Hardhorn in Lancashire, fought to have 78 Irish travellers moved .

A psychiatrist broke the rules of patient confidentiality to expose one of her patients as a dangerous paedophile to police. Dr Ruth Bagshaw feared Gareth Jordan, 55, would kidnap or attack a child after he confessed his sexual urges to her during medical treatment. A court heard the doctor decided her duty 'over-rode' the strict medical rules of patient confidentiality - and contacted police to warn them about her patient's fantasies. The doctor felt that her duty over-rode patient confidentiality, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard . Police raided Jordan's home and found photographs he had taken of children walking to a nearby primary school. They also discovered children's clothing and underwear Jordan had bought to 'replicate' his fantasies. Prosecutor Nicola Harris said: 'Dr Ruth Bagshaw approached police with concerns over Jordan. 'He had been to see her and she was extremely concerned by what he had told her. 'Her duties under the Children Act overrode patient confidentiality.' Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Jordan was already on the sex offenders register after admitting 26 charges relating to indecent images of children. Police had found 844 static images between levels one and three and 62 movie files between levels one and four. He was ordered to sign as a sex offender for five years and made the subject of an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order. Jordan was also prohibited from buying female underwear. Miss Harris said: 'There were also 46 pictures of children walking to school in Cardiff which Jordan had taken with his own camera. 'There was also a DVD of a beauty pageant at a nudist or naturist camp focusing on naked female participants.' Jordan, of Tylorstown, Rhondda, admitted three counts of possessing indecent images of children, one of making indecent images of children, and breaching the Sexual Offences Prevention Order. Judge Richard Twomlow made Jordan the subject of a community order to run alongside the existing order, which expires in June 2016. He was also ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge. Judge Twomlow told him: 'The breach was flagrant and deliberate. Any further breach will result in imprisonment.' The General Medical Council advises that it is incredibly important to offer a confidential medical service - but says that must be balanced with the public's interest. Their guidance states: 'Confidential medical care is recognised in law as being in the public interest. 'However, there can also be a public interest in disclosing information: to protect individuals or society from risks of serious harm, such as serious communicable diseases or serious crime; or to enable medical research, education or other secondary uses of information that will benefit society over time. 'Personal information may, therefore, be disclosed in the public interest, without patients’ consent, and in exceptional cases where patients have withheld consent, if the benefits to an individual or to society of the disclosure outweigh both the public and the patient’s interest in keeping the information confidential.'","Dr Ruth Bagshaw feared Gareth Jordan, 55, would kidnap or attack a child .

Mr Cameron looked gap-toothed as he declared the birth ‘an important moment in the life of our nation’. Scroll down for video . Mind the gap: Viewers watching David Cameron's statement on the royal baby thought it looked like he was missing a tooth . Senior government sources insisted the PM had not suffered a chipped tooth in the hours before news broke that the Duchess of Cornwall had given birth to a boy. But viewers watching his statement were struck by what appeared to be a hole where his top left incisor should be.

Distracting: Even people focussed on the news of the royal baby could not take their eyes off the PM's mouth . Shortly after news broke last night that a prince had been born, Mr Cameron emerged from Number 10 to add to the wave of congratulations. The PM said: ‘It is wonderful news from St Mary’s, Paddington, and I am sure that right across the country, and indeed right across the Commonwealth, people will be celebrating and wishing the royal couple well. ‘It is an important moment in the life of our nation but I suppose above all it is a wonderful moment for a warm and loving couple who have got a brand new baby boy. ‘It has been a remarkable few years for our Royal Family - a royal wedding that captured people’s hearts, that extraordinary and magnificent jubilee and now this royal birth - all from a family that has given this nation so much incredible service. ‘They can know that a proud nation is celebrating with a very proud and happy couple tonight.’ Questions: The Prime Miinster's appearance outside Number 10 sparked a flurry of speculation about his teeth .

A travel agency manager who tricked Take That fans into paying for tickets to a sold out Wembley gig that never existed has been jailed. Symon Webb, 46, made £65,000 from customers he tricked into paying for concerts and holidays at his travel agency and then failed to deliver. Take That fans only found out when their coach to Wembley didn't arrive that they had been ripped off. Sell out: Take That perform onstage at Wembley during one of their tours in the last few years . Missing out: Fans of Take That never got to see the band - despite paying the travel agency for tickets. Pictured from left to right) is Jason Orange, Robbie Williams, Howard Donald, Gary Barlow and Mark Owen . The conman, who traded as Lowestoft Travel from June 2009, was jailed for 16 months yesterday and banned from being a director for seven years after admitting fraudulent trading. The director pocketed £36,109 alone from Take That fans for gig tickets, Norwich Crown Court heard. David Wilson, prosecuting, said: 'The concerts went ahead, but for the customers due to travel via Lowestoft Travel they were to be disappointed. 'Many customers were left standing in vain for coaches which did not arrive. 'Had such tickets existed then of course irrespective of the absence of coach travel, the customers would still have had the concert tickets available to them. 'The absence of provision of such tickets indicates that no such tickets ever existed.' The travel agency scam started to unravel after Webb and two drivers were arrested in Dover, Kent, on June 30, 2010, for drug smuggling. Victims: Ashley and Gloria Lake, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, saw their £758 holiday to Spain's Costa Brava in September 2011 collapse after they were conned by Webb . Webb was jailed for four years in March 2011 for trying to import cannabis worth £68,000. Mr Wilson said: 'His arrest appears to have been a trigger for further acts of a dishonest nature with Lowestoft Travel.' Holidaymakers who had paid Webb to go to to Spain were due to leave on March 18, 2011. But they found the hotel had not been booked and the cost of just the accommodation alone topped what they had been charged. Mr Wilson said the trip would never have been viable. On March 16, 2011, Lowestoft Travel stopped operating. Webb lied that customer deposits were protected, said Mr Wilson. 'Had a bond in reality existed then customers would have had the opportunity of refunds on purchases for trips and excursions they had paid for,' he said. Jailed: Webb, 46, was locked up for 16 months by a judge at Norwich Crown Court . Judge Coleman told Webb, of Slough, Berkshire, yesterday: 'It was a series of dishonest acts and it took place over a long period of time and there was a significant loss in excess of £60,000. 'All those disappointed people must even now be cursing under their breath for what you did. One can forgive them that feeling.' Claire Davies, defending, said that he had ran a successful business but as he got into debt he struggled to keep going. She said: 'He would wish to compensate people but at the moment he cannot do so.' Ashley and Gloria Lake, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, paid £758 to go on a holiday to Spain's Costa Brava with the crooked travel agent in September 2011, but it never happened. Mr Lake, 67, said: 'I was so angry. He just took our money and was going to rip us off for the very beginning.' He added after Webb was jailed: 'That has made me feel really good. He should have known what would happen when he took our money.'","Symon Webb, 46, is jailed for 16 months for travel agency con .

A MOTHER was acting on her ‘instincts’ on the day she abducted four of her five children in a tug-of-love battle to prevent them living with their father in Spain, the High Court heard yesterday. Jennifer Jones had been due to hand over the children last October, but two of them became so ‘traumatised’ that she instinctively decided to keep them with her instead, she said. She then went into hiding with all four of them – and as a result she now faces jail for allegedly breaching a High Court order to return them. Tug-of-love: Jennifer Jones went on the run with four of her five children during a bitter custody battle. They are (from left to right) David, eight, Eva, 10, Tomas, 12, Sarah, 16, (who was not missing) and Jessica, 14 . Tug of love: Mother Jennifer Jones, who went on the run with her five children, pictured with her new partner John Williams . Children's father: Spanish army officer Tomas Palacin Cambra . Spanish courts had granted her former . husband, Tomas Palacin Cambra, custody of the five children to live in . Majorca when the marriage ended in 2008. Last summer the four youngest spent a . holiday with Miss Jones, 47, in Britain. But at the end of the holiday, . rather than send them back to Spain, she enrolled them in schools in her . home town of Llanelli, South Wales, while she started custody . proceedings. She then went on the run for 30 hours . after the High Court ruled they should be returned to their father . following an application from a Spanish court using child abduction laws . under The Hague Convention. Yesterday lawyers for the Solicitor . General argued at the High Court that Miss Jones was in contempt for not . upholding the order and returning her children. But Miss Jones told the court that on . the day the children were supposed to be handed over to her former . husband in Cardiff, two of them were ‘traumatised’ and had run to the . local police station in Llanelli. Her lawyers argued that this meant she . had been unable to comply with the court order. Miss Jones said: ‘I was very worried about everything. Those children didn’t want to go back [to Spain]. It was pretty clear. ‘All I knew was that my daughter and my son had run away and escaped. I was very concerned about my children. ‘I was so frightened because I knew I . was supposed to be in Cardiff. I was going through a lot of emotions. As . a mother you go by your instincts.’ The Family Division of the High Court . had ruled that the children should be returned to their father in . October last year. When Miss Jones failed to return them to Spain, judge . Mr Justice Wood ordered that the children should be taken from her home . by police and social services.

But when they arrived Miss Jones and . the four children had packed up and gone. They were found in Blackwood, . Gwent, 60 miles from her home, just over a day later. English language teacher Miss Jones . and her boyfriend John Williams, 48, a builder, were held in custody and . the children taken to foster carers. Colonel Cambra, 53, a Spanish army . officer, flew from his home in Majorca with their eldest daughter, . Sara, 17, to collect all of the children. But they returned home with only Eva, . ten, and David, eight. Jessica, 15, and Tomas, 13, remained with their . mother as the court decided their future. Speaking outside court, Miss Jones . told the Daily Mail she was ‘devastated’ by the ordeal and had not seen . her other three children since they returned to Spain. The family have previously revealed . handwritten letters by the children begging family court judges not to . be sent back to Spain with their father. In one, Jessica writes to the judge: ‘I am not happy at all… I do not want to go to Spain’, underlining the word ‘not’. Miss Jones met Colonel Cambra when he . was a captain while she was teaching English in Tenerife. They were . married in 1996 and lived in the Canary Islands  and Ibiza but . frequently returned to Wales to stay with Miss  Jones’s family. The family were in the process of . building a luxury home in Catalonia in 2008 when Miss Jones and the . children returned to Llanelli for ten months. Colonel Cambra claims their mother made the children make false allegations about his treatment of them. Miss Jones was spared jail after being . found guilty of ‘flagrant breaches’ of court orders to return them by . the Family Division of the High Court in October. But the matter was referred to the . Solicitor General, Oliver Heald, who decided that she should face . contempt of court charges for breaching the order.

Radio Times interview about the trials she has faced in . the male-dominated world of sports journalism . Sports presenter Gabby Logan has slammed Sky Sports for using female presenters as 'window dressing'. She suggested that Sky Sports - where . she first cut her teeth on TV - played on the looks of female presenters . but failed to give them a 'career path'. Asked . in a Radio Times interview about how the broadcaster appears to use . some women as 'window dressing', Miss Logan said: 'The girls are . basically wearing a leotard while the bloke's in a suit and a tie. 'It's . fine if they're given a career path but there have never been any big . breakthrough women on Sky. We all have to go to other places.' In the interview the TV personality claims she was once chided by a superior at the BBC for looking 'too glamorous' after he spotted her sporting a pair of high-heeled boots. The presenter, who has occasionally faced criticism herself for how she appears on screen, said she does not want to distract people from sport but wants to look her best. The 40-year-old sports presenter defended . her glossy appearance on screen, saying that viewers want to see . something 'aspirational' on their television screens. 'A boss at the BBC once told me that I was too glamorous and pointed to my high-heeled boots. I said, 'I've just come from a radio show, it's what I wear',' she said. 'He said, ""You don't wear them when you do the dishes, do you?"" Does he want me to look like I'm doing the dishes? I'm not here to look like a housewife. Glamorous Sky Sports presenters include Kirsty Gallacher (right) and Charlotte Jackson (left). Logan has hit out at the broadcaster for treating the women like 'window dressing' 'If I'm at home in my pyjamas I want to see something a bit more aspirational on TV. It's right that people on primetime look after their appearance.' Ms Logan, one of the BBC's key presenters during last year's Olympics coverage, is soon to be seen in a new BBC1 panel show I Love My Country and wants to broaden her scope into more entertainment programmes. 'The Games showed that sport is a very good grounding. It probably opened doors. I want to try lots of other areas,' she said. 'I'm not saying I want to be the next natural history presenter, but I'm 40 years old. I don't want to get to 58 and think, ""Oh, I should have tried that"".' The 40-year-old sports presenter defended her glossy appearance on screen, saying that viewers want to see something 'aspirational' Ms Logan and co-presenter Dominic Holyer on Sky Sports in 1996: She suggested that the broadcaster, where she began her career, played on the looks of female presenters but failed to give them a 'career path' In response to Ms Logan's comments Sky Sports insisted its presenters are there on merit and that many have built successful careers at the broadcaster. 'While we respect Gabby's opinion and her work, we're surprised by the comments as there are many talented women who have developed successful presenting or reporting careers at Sky Sports,' a spokesman said . 'They include trained journalists, passionate and knowledgeable about sport, who work on our most high-profile sports including football, golf, cricket and Formula 1.' 'And there are a huge number of female colleagues working behind the scenes, including 30 per cent of the production team at Sky Sports News. 'It would be disrespectful to those women if we didn't challenge the idea that they are there for any reason other than merit.'","Sports presenter defends her glossy appearance on screen in interview .

Jason Owen, one of a trio jailed over Baby P's death, who is said to be back in prison after breaching his parole . One of the three people jailed over the death of Baby P was back behind bars last night after breaching the conditions of  his parole. Jason Owen was freed on licence in 2011 after serving half his six-year sentence for causing or allowing Peter Connelly to die. It emerged yesterday that the 41-year-old was returned to prison after being caught in an area from which he had been banned. Police have refused to reveal the circumstances surrounding his arrest, but Peter’s relatives have demanded an explanation. One said: ‘It is hardly a surprise. The authorities should now come clean and tell us exactly why he is back inside.’ Baby P suffered 50 injuries, including a broken back, before he died in August 2007 at the age of 17 months. The attacks took place while Owen, a convicted arsonist and crack addict was lodging with his brother Steven Barker and the boy’s mother Tracey Connelly in Tottenham, north London. The case sparked a national scandal after it emerged how social workers, police and doctors all missed a string of warning signs that could have saved the youngster’s life. Officials assigned to Peter did not ask about Barker,  who was Connelly’s boyfriend, even when she listed him as next of kin. Had they done so, they would have discovered he had been suspected of torturing his grandmother. Social workers considered the child’s care to be ‘a routine, low-risk case’ and were too scared to confront Connelly. Owen, who was jailed in 2009 along with Barker and Connelly for ‘causing or allowing’ Peter’s killing, is now in his own cell at Category C Stafford Prison. The prison has a special wing holding 84 ‘vulnerable’ inmates, including sex offenders and child abusers. After his release two years ago, Owen was photographed walking down the street in smart new clothes, looking relaxed, slim and fit. Peter's mother, Tracey Connelly (right), and her . boyfriend Steven Barker were also jailed in . 2009 for causing or allowing the toddler's death . As he headed back to a hostel for . high-risk offenders, a provocative tattoo could be read on his right arm . that said ‘only God can judge me’. Sources said he threw himself into an extreme fitness regime behind bars, including runs of up to eight miles. Owen had demanded plastic surgery and a . new identity on his release from Wandsworth Prison. He also wanted a . seaside council house with his ex-girlfriend, the mother of his five . children. But none of his demands were met and he has struggled to keep a low profile in a bid to avoid reprisal attacks. His return to jail is another painful turn in one of the darkest chapters in the history of social care. Inquiries, official reports and court . hearings have laid bare how Baby Peter was failed by the authorities at . every turn, despite 60 visits to his home. Peter Connelly was just 17 months old when he died in his mother's north London flat. He was found dead in his bloodied cot in August 2007 after horrific abuse despite being on a council 'at-risk' list . Sharon Shoesmith, the former . children’s services chief at the London borough of Haringey, waged a . long battle to clear herself of any personal responsibility. She expressed ‘sorrow’ for Peter’s death, but has never apologised for her role in her department’s failings. Harry Fletcher, of probation union Napo, said Owen could end up serving the remaining years of his sentence. ‘Because of the notoriety of Jason . Owen, the Parole Board would have to be absolutely certain there was no . chance of the decision backfiring before releasing him,’ he said. ‘He’s at the last chance saloon. He . has to comply to the regime in prison and prove to the Parole Board that . he’s not going to breach his licence again, which could be very . difficult.’ A spokesman for the Ministry of . Justice said public protection was a ‘priority’ and insisted that . offenders released on licence were subject to strict controls. ‘If they fail to comply with their licence conditions, they are liable to be returned to custody,’ she added.","Jason Owen, 41 back in prison after breaching conditions of bail .

Two young women have died after apparently overdosing on substances after a weekend of drug-related tragedy which has left three families mourning young women. Jennifer Whiteley, 27, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of Saturday morning after taking a party drug but died after suffering a cardiac arrest at 5am. And a 29-year-old, named locally as mother-of-one Gemma Hurst, died in hospital in Newcastle yesterday morning having suffered a serious reaction to what police believe was an ecstasy tablet. The incident, which came on the same weekend as a teenager died in an Oxford park after allegedly taking ecstasy, brought the death toll by the drug to 13 this year, prompting police to warn of the dangers of taking drugs which may be stronger than expected or adulterated with poisonous substances. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Tragic: Gemma Hurst has died after suffering a serious reaction to what police believe was an ecstasy tablet . Investigation: Police guard the Newcastle home of Gemma Hurst, 29, who is believed to have died after taking ecstasy . The 27-year-old woman, from the Sale area, was rushed to hospital in the early hours of Saturday morning but died a short time later. Police are now investigating whether she had earlier taken the banned legal high Benzo Fury. Officers originally believed she may have taken ecstasy pills. They have not ruled out the class A drug but said they will not be able to confirm the cause of death until further toxicology tests have been carried out. It is understood Jennifer had taken the drugs with her partner at her home. It is thought both needed hospital treatment but Jennifer's partner later discharged himself. As part of the police probe some Benzo Fury powder had been recovered by officers. Detective Inspector Frank Morris said: 'Our thoughts go out to the family of this young woman following this tragedy. We will not be able to confirm the cause of this woman's death until we get toxicology results, and we are also working with HM Coroner. Response: Police and paramedics were alerted to a house in the east of Newcastle after concerns were reported about a woman inside . Scene: Officers inspecting Miss Hurst's home after she died in hospital after being taken ill at the weekend . 'However, we recovered a powder which is a ""legal high"" known as Benzo Fury, the legality of which is the subject of ongoing attention by the relevant authorities. Taking drugs can not only have dire consequences for the person taking them but also for their family and friends. 'Police officers do not want to make the house visit and inform them that they have lost a loved one. If you experience any adverse effects, please seek urgent medical assistance.' Benzo Fury, a mild stimulant that acts like amphetamines, is one of two legal highs which was banned for one-year by the government last month. 'Our thoughts go out to the family of this young woman following this tragedy' - Detective Inspector Frank Morris . The government's advisory council on the misuse of drugs will assess whether the ban on the two drugs should be made permanent. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said it was being done to 'protect the public' and prevent 'misery'. In the incident in Newcastle, police and paramedics were alerted to a house in the east of the city after concerns were reported about a woman inside. The 29-year-old woman was taken to the city's Royal Victoria Infirmary after suffering a serious reaction to what police believe was an illegal substance. Today neighbours named her as Gemma Hurst, who is believed to have had a young son and who is said to have been hosting a party in memory of her brother Paul, who died five years ago. Friends posted tributes on Facebook today, with one from Shelley Marie Bias, saying: 'Seriously cannot believe it. All my love to Sheila and family. Gemma, you were a beautiful friend. You and Paul look after each other. Gone way too soon. RIP.' Chief Constable Sir Peter Fahy, left, issued a warning about the danger of ecstasy after a weekend in which two people died having apparently taken types of the drug including 15-year-old Martha Fernback, pictured right . The young woman died in hospital in . the early hours of this morning and police have arrested two people in . connection with the incident. Officers seized a number of what are believed to be ecstasy tablets and . eight other men and women from the address were taken to hospital to be checked over before being arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs. A number of what are believed to be ecstasy tablets have been seized by police, who this afternoon bailed ten people pending further enquiries. Two people, a man aged 33 and a woman aged 23, have been arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs and are helping police with enquiries. The new tragedies come after three deaths in . Macclesfield, two in Bolton, two in Wigan, two in Buxton, Derbyshire, . and further fatalities in Salford and Warrington. Chief Constable Peter Fahy, of Greater Manchester Police, warned partygoers that criminal gangs were mixing the drugs with poisonous substances to make more money. The latest deaths mean 13 people have died this year from the drug, and have prompted a police warning about its dangers - they are particularly worried about super-strong 'pink ecstasy' (file image) He said: 'We have been concerned about deaths . due to drugs and overdoses and at the same time particularly concerned . that criminal gangs are mixing and adulterating drugs with poisonous . substances. 'People who take drugs need to be . extremely careful and if they have any information about who may be . producing this stuff they need to get in touch with us. 'It goes without . saying it’s being produced by criminal gangs and a lot of them are . reckless about what they put in there and are quite prepared to put in . all sorts of substances and mixing it just to make more money.' Further south, 15-year-old Martha Fernback died on Saturday after allegedly taking a super-strength 'pink ecstasy' tablet, also known as Dr Death or PMA. Martha, an only child, was found by a lake in Hinksey Park, south Oxford.  She was airlifted to the John Radcliffe hospital but pronounced dead soon afterwards. A 17-year-old boy who was arrested in connection with the investigation has been bailed until September 5. 'These drugs have become more available and they are a much dirtier form: they are highly potent and potentially lethal.' - Dr JS Bamrah, consultant psychiatrist . PMA is an ecstasy-style amphetamine which can be five times stronger than ecstasy and can kill by causing a potentially fatal increase in body temperature.  It can be an ingredient in ecstasy tablets. Last week, an inquest into the death of 19-year-old fitness instructor Travis Barber, from Salford, Greater Manchester, found he had died after overdosing on PMA. His mother Dr Louise Barber warned other drug users they were playing ‘Russian roulette with their lives’ by experimenting with the drug. Dr JS Bamrah, consultant psychiatrist at Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust, said the health service across the region had witnessed a spike in drug users falling ill after taking ecstasy, particularly PMA. He said: 'The problem is these drugs have become more available and they are a much dirtier form of the drug; they are highly potent and potentially lethal. 'What we are noticing is that users are becoming younger and younger. The drugs have a very strong stimulating effect and cause heart rates and temperatures to rise dramatically which can result in medical complications.'

A man has been charged with the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock who died during the Broadwater Farm riots in 1985, prosecutors said today. Nicholas Jacobs, 44, is accused of killing the 40-year-old officer, who was stabbed dozens of times as he tried to protect firefighters tackling a supermarket blaze during the height of the unrest in north London. Alison Saunders from the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'Following a thorough investigation by the Metropolitan Police Service, we have decided that Nicholas Jacobs should be charged with the murder of Pc Keith Blakelock during the disorder at Broadwater Farm in October 1985. 'This decision was taken in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors. We have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest to prosecute. 'We have also concluded that no further action should be taken against five other individuals suspected of taking part in the death of Pc Blakelock as there is insufficient evidence to warrant a prosecution.' Jacobs will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court tomorrow. Three men - Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip - were convicted in March 1987 of Pc Blakelock's murder but all three convictions were quashed four and a half years later. Disorder: Police on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, north London, during the riots in which Pc Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death . Scene of the killing: Residents and children lay flowers in memory of Pc Blakelock after he was stabbed to death in Tottenham, north London, in 1985 . Funeral: PC Keith Blakelock's coffin, draped in the blue Metropolitan Police flag, is carried by six policemen into St James' Church, Muswell Hill, north London . Forensic tests on pages of key interview records suggested they had been fabricated. In 2003, Scotland Yard reopened the murder investigation after a review indicated there were possible new lines of inquiry. In 2010 14 men were arrested in connection with Pc Blakelock's death and the attempted murder of his colleague Pc Richard Coombes. Nine were told in August 2011 that they would face no further action, and Scotland Yard today that another four had also been released from bail. A statement released on behalf of the police officer's family said: 'The family of PC Keith Blakelock have never given up hope in getting justice for him. 'We welcome this news, and extend our eternal gratitude to the Metropolitan Police Service.' Wrongful conviction: Winston Silcott who was one of three men jailed in 1987 for the killing of Pc Blakelock. Their convictions were later quashed amid claims that evidence had been fabricated .

A university student has been banned from an entire county and branded 'pure evil' after she launched a hate campaign against a man with learning difficulties. Melissa Thomas, 21, threatened to kill 31-year-old David Parnell despite already being put under a restraining order after targeting him over the course of 11 months. A court heard how she had previously falsely accused innocent Mr Parnell of assaulting her and then was said to have created a Facebook page in his name so she could post abusive messages to her own account - and pretend they came from him. Melissa Thomas, pictured left, who launched an 11-month-long hate campaign against David Purnell, 31, pictured right, has admitted breaking a restraining order by going to his home and threatening to kill him . As a result of her lies, Mr Parnell was arrested four times, charged with common assault and wrongly spent a total of 30 hours in a police cell before police found evidence which backed up his denials. Last March Thomas - a tourism student - was given a suspended prison term and banned from contacting Mr Parnell under the terms of a restraining order. But just two months later she ignored the court order and turned up drunk on his doorstep making threats towards him and kicking at his front door. When police came to arrest her Thomas shouted: 'That fat ugly Parnell, I’ll f****** stab him when I get out I will say he raped me'. She later added: 'I hope David Parnell drops dead.' Thomas, from Eccles, yesterday admitted breaching the restraining order at Manchester Crown Court, but escaped jail again after saying she had a 'very tough' childhood. She was also ordered to live in a hostel in Liverpool and was banned from entering Greater Manchester for 12 months. Her sentence of four months in prison suspended for two years will continue. Lies: David Parnell, pictured left, has revealed how Thomas, pictured right, made his life a misery after she falsely accused him of a string of offences - leading to his arrest four separate times . After the case Mr Parnell said: 'It is an absolute disgrace that she has not been sent to prison. I’m in a living hell. When is it going to end? Melissa is pure evil and the last few months has been a nightmare. I don’t understand why she has been doing this.' He said in recent months he had been the victim of mysterious, bogus and anonymous tip offs about his home in Eccles. The RSPCA had been called to his home amid false reports a dog was being mistreated at the property. A large food delivery was ordered to the address and police were called to reports that there were offensive weapons at the home. Detectives hunting a man wanted over the murder of a local barmaid also visited his home after a report came in the fugitive was hiding out in the property. Mr Parnell’s friend Roy Townley said: 'This woman is a compulsive liar and a menace and she has made David’s life a misery for a very long time. It is so upsetting that she has not been sent to jail. 'We have had to put up with so much at her hands and there is no reason for it at all. She had made threats to David in the past and on that night I am certain that she came to David’s home to carry out those threats. 'He is now scared to go out. He just doesn’t leave the house anymore in case something happens. We are struggling to understand how she has possibly avoided jail.' In court: Melissa Thomas admitted breaching her restraining order not to contact David Parnell at Manchester Crown Court, pictured, and has now been banned from entering Greater Manchester so she can no longer harass him . The court was told Thomas and the victim used to be friends but had fallen out in June when she was arrested and cautioned for damaging plant pots outside Mr Parnell’s home. The following day Mr Parnell was arrested and bailed for common assault after wrongly being accused of hitting Thomas about the head. She then made a series of bogus complaints to police between June and August, falsely claiming that he had breached his bail conditions by contacting her. Mr Parnell was left feeling suicidal for fear of being falsely sent to prison suffered panic attacks and also became fearful of leaving the house amid fears he might be evicted. All allegations made against him by Thomas were later dropped. She later pleaded guilty to four counts of perverting the course of justice. But in May, Mr Parnell called the police after she began hurling abuse yards from his front door. Prosecuting Mr Jonathan Dickinson said: 'The defendant went outside Mr Parnell’s house shouting various insults at him. She had been drinking in Manchester and got drunk and was put into a taxi and sent home by friends. 'Her mother received a message to go and collect her but when the taxi arrived, Thomas was abusive and walked away. She spoke with a landlord, a friend of David Parnell and that she was on her way to stab him. 'She arrived outside Mr Parnell’s house and standing seven or eight metres away from his door said ‘come on you fat c***’. He looked out and saw the defendant staggering around and could tell that her speech was slurred and rang the police. 'He heard a bang on the front door which transpired it was her kicking at the front door. He waited for the police and when they arrived she had left, they searched the area and found her in the town centre shouting and screaming around. 'It was obvious to police that she was drunk.' Thomas later claimed she couldn’t remember the incident due to her intake of drink and prescription drugs. Her lawyer Martin Callery said: 'Melissa Thomas in her formative years endured a very tough time and it is very much to her credit that she managed to obtain a place at university.'

Prize-winning photography of life-threatening illnesses will be on display in Times Square, New York, at the GE Healthcare’s annual competition showcasing the beauty of cells and a close-up view what deadly diseases look like. One of the winning images was a cervical cancer cell captured in the process of cell division, taken by Dr Markus Posch of the Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression, University of Dundee. It shows the role that the very latest imaging technology can play in helping scientists to understand the inner workings of human cells. Red alert: Jane Stout from the School of Medicine, Indiana University was the overall winner of the GE Healthcare 2012 Cell Imaging Competition, with her close-up shot of cancer cells . This is playing an important role to aid the discovery of new, more effective and targeted drugs to treat diseases such as cancer by stopping diseased cells from replicating. This  groundbreaking technology, known as ‘super resolution microscopy’,  enables structures inside a cell, which play a crucial role in cell division (‘microtubules’ coloured yellow in the image), to be seen more clearly than ever before, although their diameter is in fact just 1000th of the thickness of a human hair. Disease in detail: This image of Huntingdon's disease won Anushree Balachandran from Australia first place in the high-content analysis category . This technology is special because it allows things to be seen at a greater level of detail than before. It is an example of some of the innovations being developed by GE Healthcare which are shaping the face of medicine of the future. The University of Dundee is one of the first universities in the world to invest in this imaging technology. Cervical cancer is the 11th most common cancer among women in the UK, and the most common cancer in women under 35. Scary beauty: The cervical cancer cell is brought into focus by Markus Posch from the University of Dundee . Cervical screening saves approximately 4,500 lives per year in England. The winners of the GE Healthcare 2012 Cell Imaging Competition  include Jane Stout from the School of Medicine of Indiana University, in the microscopy section. Her image was in the disease focus of cancer, a Metaphase epithelial cell stained for microtubules (red), kinetochores (green) and DNA (blue). Anushree Balachandran from Australia won first place for his image for Huntingdon’s disease stem cells. Huntingdon’s disease becomes noticeable in mid-adult life and is the most common genetic cause of abnormal involuntary writhing movements called chorea. Under the microscope: A beautiful but deadly image of HIV, a progressive failure of the immune system that allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive . Incredible images of cervical cancer cells won Markus Posch, from the Centre for Gene Regulation and Expression at Dundee University, the award of regional winner in the microscopy section. Eric Roman, General Manager of Research and Applied Markets, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, said: 'This year’s winning images are as beautiful and compelling as ever. Neurological disorders: Conditions include paralysis, muscle weakness, poor coordination, loss of sensation, seizures, confusion, pain and altered levels of consciousness . 'Not only can they be appreciated from an aesthetic point of view, but they remind us of the cellular complexity behind disease and why the study of cells is so important. 'We were delighted to receive so many outstanding entries to the competition, which highlights how high-content and super-resolution cell imaging are helping scientists explore the universe of the cell, and so advance our understanding of so many life threatening and life-limiting diseases.' Starting in the mid-1990s, the emphasis in clinical cancer research shifted towards therapies derived from biotechnology research, such as immunotherapy and gene therapy.Most funding for cancer research comes from taxpayers and charities, rather than from profit-making businesses. In the US, less than 30 per cent of all cancer research is funded by commercial researchers such as pharmaceutical companies.[15]Per capita, public spending on cancer research by taxpayers and charities in the US is seven times as much as public spending by taxpayers and charities in the European Union. As a percentage of GDP, the non-commercial funding of cancer research in the US is four times the amount dedicated to cancer research in Europe.[15] Half of Europe's non-commercial cancer research is funded by charitable organizationsThe number of teenagers and young adults dying from cancer in Britain has fallen from around 580 per year in the mid-70s (1975-77) to around 300 today (2008-2010), according to a new Cancer Research UK report.The cancer death rates of teenagers and young adults have fallen by almost a half - from 74.5 to 37.7 per million 15-24 years old in Britain in the same time period.The focus on specialisation in teenage and young adult care has brought increasing awareness of this group’s specific needs. Experts believe that the change in the way that some teenagers and young adults are treated - in a similar way to children rather than adults – means that they are now doing better for some cancers, such as the leukaemias.  In the last fifteen years in Britain, the largest drop in deaths was in the leukaemias - from an average of 54 deaths per year in 1995-1999 to 39 deaths in 2006-2010 in young males. In females, it fell from an average of 38 to 21 deaths per year4.Also there are now fewer young males dying from non-Hodgkin lymphoma than there used to be, dropping from an average of 20 deaths per year in 1995-1999 to 14 deaths per year in 2006-2010.","Cervical screening saves approximately 4,500 lives per year in England .

Inspired by the hit cartoon films, this contraption can produce your breakfast in one minute, and it's just in time for Shrove Tuesday. Commissioned by the happy egg co., the aptly-named 'Pancake-omatic' took a team of four design engineers more than 200 hours to construct and a further 100 to test. The device will go on display at the Design Museum later this month and uses a wide selection of household objects including an old-style gramophone and an electric whisk and features a luxury nest throne for the hen to lay her egg in. Eggstra-special! Inventors have designed a contraption that Wallace and Gromit would be proud of which turns freshly laid eggs into pancakes in a matter of minutes . The happy hen, sitting on her throne, lays her eggs, which then roll down the chute towards the pancake-making part of the apparatus . The pancake-making process starts with the hen laying an egg in her five-star nest. The egg drops down from the throne and rolls down the wooden chute. Reaching the bottom of the chute, the egg pushes a wooden spoon, which winds up a gramophone. When the music starts, the egg is dropped into a holder on the spinning record, then swung around and cracked into a bowl containing other pancake ingredients. The egg, laid just seconds before, is poised above a fearsome-looking blade before being cracked and dropped into the bowl and mixed into the batter . When the music starts, the egg is . dropped into a holder on the spinning record, then swung around and . cracked into a bowl containing other pancake ingredients. The bowl moves down a conveyor belt . where the mixture is whisked and then released slowly into a hot pan. The pancake is cooked for 30 seconds, flipped and placed on a plate. The machine may look like it was invented by Aardman character Wallace but another similar egg contraption appeared in children's classic Chitty Chitty Bang. Shrove .

As Lent is a time . of fasting, it became traditional to use up rich food - milk, butter and . eggs - before switching to the more austere diet deemed appropriate in the period of fasting ahead of Easter. The bowl moves down a conveyor belt where the mixture is whisked and then released slowly into a hot pan. The pancake is cooked for 30 seconds, flipped and placed on a plate. Here's how to make the perfect pancake if you don't have a Pancake-omatic at home. Make the batter by mixing 4oz plain flour with two eggs, 7fl oz of milk diluted with 3fl oz of water, a pinch of salt and 2oz of butter. Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Begin whisking the eggs. Gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking. Whisk until all the liquid has been added and the batter has the consistency of thin cream. Melt the butter in a pan. Spoon two tablespoons of it into the batter and whisk it in. Use the rest of the butter to grease the frying pan before you make each pancake. Get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium. Ladle 2 tbsp of the batter into the hot pan all in one go. Tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. After about half a minute, and when the bottom is golden in colour, flip the pancake over. The other side will only need a few seconds to cook. Slide the pancake out of the pan on to a plate. Shrove Tuesday takes its name from being shriven, or forgiven of all your sins. It is the day before Ash Wednesday, when the sombre season of Lent begins. As Lent is a time of fasting, it became traditional to use up rich food - milk, butter and eggs - before switching to the more austere diet deemed appropriate ahead of Easter. One of the best recipes for using up those rich foods is pancakes, and so the tradition was born. In other countries Shrove Tuesday is known as 'Mardi Gras' - or Fat Tuesday - and is marked by carnivals, a final chance to let your hair down before the solemn season of Lent. Claire Jappy of the happy egg co. said: 'Pancake Day is a much-loved tradition so we wanted to do something that would celebrate this annual festivity - and champion the role our hens play in making pancakes. 'Hen happiness is at the heart of everything we do - because happy hens lay tasty eggs - so our contraption is the ultimate for pancake lovers wanting to enjoy a truly fresh pancake.' Dermot Doyle, design engineer of Helix design production, said: 'It's no mean feat to create a machine that will break an egg let alone flip a pancake so this project has been a really exciting challenge for the team. 'We hope we've cracked it and our machine encourages others to make their very own egg-inspired inventions.' The inspiration? Before the Pancake-omatic was Wallace and Gromit's Cracking Contraption .

Tiny but powerful: The key-ring size Fuel Micro Charger provides 20 to 30 minutes of extra talk time, or up to a few hours on standby . According to its Massachusetts-based creators Devotec Industries, it's ‘perfect for when you have had an unexpected delay, or haven't been able to fully charge your phone, and need to make a few calls, send a work email or use your GPS and maps function to find your way home.’ Measuring 1.3 inches by 0.9 inches by 0.5 inches, creators say they believe the device is the world's smallest cellphone charger, which can fit into your pocket or even hang off your mobile. The Devotec Fuel Micro Charger is fully rechargeable, and is able to keep its charge for at least one month before needing to be recharged. Coining it in: Developers hope to make a success of the phone charger - shown here alongside a £1 coin . Inner workings: Most of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by a lithium-ion rechargeable battery . The device is powered up from the supplied cable or any AC micro-USB wall plug. To use, you turn on the power switch and plug into your phone, the same way you would with an ordinary charger. Devotec Industries spent months searching, testing and evaluating the smallest and most efficient parts to use with the Fuel Micro Charger. The components are the smallest available, and they have used features like flexible-PCBs to shrink component size, in order to make Fuel as small as possible, and to have as big an internal battery as possible. The body of the product is pure die-cast aluminium. This means it is incredibly strong but still light weight. The aluminium is painted, lacquered and then baked to give a semi-gloss finish. The majority of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by an energy dense lithium-ion rechargeable battery. This battery is a 5C battery, rated at 220 milliamp hours.

A woman who hired a private eye to catch the vandal trashing her family grave was sickened when she discovered the culprit was - her cousin. Sue Pullin, 67, called in a surveillance expert after her mother Mavis Budd’s resting place was repeatedly damaged over a three year period. But she was disgusted when covert camera footage captured her cousin Amanda Lester trampling on flowers, pulling up blooms and pouring dirty water over the headstone. Scroll down for video . Hidden camera: Footage captured with a hidden camera showed the vandal was Mrs Pullin's cousin, Amanda Lester, pictured . Lester was caught on film pouring dirty water over the gravestone of Mavis Budd . Mrs Pullin called the police and Lester, 57, has now been convicted of criminal damage and given a conditional discharge. Devastated Mrs Pullen is still unclear what motivated her cousin, but suspects she was unhappy that Mrs Budd’s ashes were scattered on the same plot as her own mother. She said: 'It was horrible. I just didn’t know what I was going to find when we set up the camera. 'I was having sleepless nights and was so upset. It was tearing the family apart. 'When I saw it was Amanda it made me feel sick and I had to go outside to get myself together. 'The tape showed her putting all the flowers in a bag and throwing them into a copse.' Mrs Budd was 89 when she died on December 27th 2009. Sue Pullin was shocked to find that her cousin was the one who was trashing her mother's grave after she hired a private investigator . She was cremated and the ashes were spread at St Anne’s Church graveyard in Oldland Common, Bristol, in March the following year. Mrs Pullin, a supermarket trainer, explained: 'As soon as we put mum’s ashes down and put some floral tributes down, the trouble started. 'Everything was being damaged, taken away or destroyed. 'It was devastating for us and we had no idea who was doing it. We just assumed it was children. 'There was a bend in the graveyard I would go around and my stomach would lurch, because it was then I would see if anything had happened.' She was also caught trampling on flowers left by the headstone for Mrs Pullin's mother . Mrs Pullin and her retired husband Michael, 69, were so distressed that they contacted police who told the couple they would need evidence before they could act. She said: 'We had no idea who was doing it so hired a private eye.' The couple spent £250 on a private detective, who recorded footage of Lester bagging flowers from the grave and dumping them in a nearby copse. Mrs Pullin handed the video to police and Lester, whose mother is also buried at the site, was handed a caution. But when the damage continued Mrs Pullin and her husband spent £100 on a motion sensor camera which they concealed in a hedge at the site. Again, they caught Lester pouring dirty flower water over the headstone and stamping on flowers. Lester, from Bristol, pleaded guilty to criminal damage when she appeared at North Avon Magistrates’ Court on July 9. She was handed her a six-month conditional discharge and ordered her to pay £85 costs, a £15 victim surcharge and £8.50 compensation to Mrs Pullin. Mrs Pullin says she has never received an explanation of Lester’s actions but believes it is down to the shared burial plot. She explained: 'What’s really sad is that when Amanda’s mum died she asked my mum whether it was okay to bury her in the family grave and she said yes. 'At that time my mum said that is where she would like to buried as well. We can only assume she didn’t like that mum was buried there. Caught: Lester was convicted of criminal damage and was handed a six-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £85 costs, a £15 victim surcharge and £8.50 compensation to Mrs Pullin . 'As far as we were concerned there was a good relationship between Amanda and my mother. 'Her mother would come and help me look after mum when she was bed-bound and take in her meals to help me out. 'The relationship is irreparable now. How can you forgive someone who has done that?'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 02:41 EST, 9 December 2011 . It's been called the laminated book of dreams but now the Argos catalogue can take its place alongside more historical documents. Because as these photos show, the trusty Argos tome so popular with children in the run up to Christmas, can provide a fascinating insight into the changing tastes and aspirations of the nation over the past 35 years. When artist and vintage lava lamp collector Anthony Voz found the 1976 catalogue at a recent car boot sale in London he decided to scan every single page and upload every one to the internet. Look back in time: The Argos catalogue from 1976, found at a car boot . sale in London, is providing an insight into how we used to shop .. and live . It was only when the 27-year-old was inundated . with the recollections of people who saw the online version of the . catalogue that he realised just how the humble book could unlock the . years. The vintage . memorabilia collector had originally uploaded the pages to act as a . reference for others with a love of old fashioned items. How times have changed: The Argos catalogue 2011 edition boasting 1000 pages compared with just 250 in the 1976 edition . But as soon as the pages went live the London-based collector was overwhelmed by hundreds of messages of nostalgia from web users. He said: 'The images act as a way to connect with people to discover their stories, their past and their memories. 'For example, people see teddy bears . that they owned, or games consoles that they longed to own as a teenager . and the catalogues also shed light into how it was to live back then. 'Looking at the catalogues makes people remember parts of their life that they had forgotten.' Even . a glance at the front cover of the glossy book from 1976 and today's . brochure shows just how far technology has come both in terms of what is . inside and how the Argos catalogue looks today. The 1970's version shows a happy . family on the front cover while the 2011 edition features a tablet PC . displaying the Argos website and a range of online purchasing options. Typewriters, . adding machines, cassette players and ashtrays are just some of the . things that either no longer appear or have a minimal amount of space . now dedicated to them. Writing on the wall: Typewriters, with their range of features listed in the catalogue, are virtually a relic of a past age with the advent of personal computers and now tablets like the iPad . Sound investment: Handheld portable radios were on the up in 1976, but today music on the move can be accessed and stored on mobile phones. But technology is not only an area of British life that has changed. The . pages from 1976 show just how far the nation's obsession with personal . grooming and fitness has developed. In the 1970s the contents page lists . just one page of 'Keep Fit Equipment', today there is an amazing 40 . pages of sports gear. Male . grooming in 2011 requires an electric razor which moisturises the skin . during shaving while a sideburn trimming feature was the unique selling . point for rugged 1970s man. Isabelle . Szmigin, professor of marketing at The University of Birmingham, said . that the range of products available today shows a change in attitudes . and lifestyle. Before the keep fit revolution: Home gym equipment was less popular with fewer products on offer than in 2011 . She said: 'We will always see products that reflect the concerns of the day both socially and economically - there is lots of money to be made out of keep fit as we are all struggling to keep our weight down. 'The fact of the matter is that the amount of high fat and sugar foods were just much less in the 1970s so some products really do change to reflect the changed environment.' The toy pages of the issue could be seen to show how we have developed a more PC attitude towards our kids. Blast from the past: Six Million Dollar Man toys were all the rage and an action figure cost only £3.99 in 1976 . Family brands: Lego and Meccano were favourites in 1976 with a Lego train set retailling at just £11.95 . Modern-day kid’s bikes are plastered with images of popular cartoon characters, and feature a ‘parent handle’, which worried mums and dads can use to prevent wayward toddlers from straying. And the replica guns and Wild-West dress up sets missing from today’s catalogue, suggest that a Saturday game of ‘Cowboys and Indians’ is a thing of the past. Former household names, such as Matchbox and Tonka, are also conspicuous by their absence from the newer edition. But there are also a number of similarities between the older catalogue and its brightly-coloured modern-day counterpart. Toy story: The toys of the age paint a portrait of a life long past for the UK with Tonka trucks and Stockcar Smash Up on every boy's wishlist. Hairstyling . products for women feature prominently in both catalogues, although . hair straighteners rather than curling tongs dominate the modern-day . version. And a surprising number of household . names make appearances in both catalogues.  Kodak, Phillips and Lego are . still as popular as they were 35 years ago, although today’s . suspension-equipped Lego sports cars make the humble train and ambulance . sets of 1976 look more than a little outdated. But . Professor Szmigin said that there are echoes of the 1976 catalogue in . the modern day version, particularly when it comes to their . presentation. She said: 'In some ways I think it is surprising how similar the items and ways of presenting them are. Well groomed: The lady of the 1970s had a vast array of products at her disposal to ensure she achieved the look of the age. Close shave: The gentleman of the 1970s was being encouraged to look . after his appearance with the 'Philishave De Luxe' boasting 12 blades and . an integral trimmer for £15.75 . 'In marketing we talk about the product life cycle and it is fascinating to watch how toys go or don’t go through this cycle. 'Barbie and Lego have stayed more or less the same for years. Others, such as Action Man tendto come and go but toys remain largely the same.' One thing that is very different between 1976 and 2011 is the number of products on offer - the old catalogue was just 250 pages, while this year’s contains over 1,000. Professor Szmigin added: 'Whatever we hear about Austerity Britain the fact of the matter is that we just have a lot more stuff now than ever before - in some ways many of us don’t know the meaning of the word austerity.' Timely reminder: In 1976 a ladies dress watch retailed for just £13.95 with Argos . Jewellery gifts today: Accessorize and Alexandra Burke gifts are on sale . in this year's Argos catalogue but more indicative of the times is the information line at the bottom . which allows buyers to text or log in .","Artist scans and uploads every page of 1976 catalogue prompting wave of nostalgia from web users .

Paramedics were told they could not rush to the aid of a BBC staff member who appeared to be having a cardiac arrest in the newsroom because of strict rules designed to regulate on-screen behaviour, it has been reported. When the paramedics reached the newsroom at Broadcasting House in London after a 999 call about a worker who was believed to be seriously ill, it is claimed that security denied them access because they would have been seen by viewers in the large open plan space, forcing the stricken journalist to make his way to them. The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) has now made a complaint to senior BBC management about the incident. Insiders at the BBC say paramedics were prevented from reaching a seriously ill journalist in the newsroom by strict on-screen rules . Sue Harris, of the NUJ, said: 'The member of staff had to struggle out of camera shot to get to the paramedic as the crew weren’t allowed to walk across the newsroom to them because of their high-vis jackets. 'This cannot be allowed to happen again. A more sensible solution has to be found, such as putting screens up. Fortunately on this occasion the person in question was not critically ill, but the BBC cannot let petty rules potentially put lives in danger.' A spokesman for the BBC denied that emergency services were hindered and insisted the patient walked to reception. He said there was 'no ban on medical staff attending to patients in the newsroom'. There are reported to be wider concerns among BBC staff about strict guidelines over their behaviour in the newsroom. Rumblings: There are also reports that BBC workers are unhappy with strict instructions dictating how they should behave . When it opened in March, the 3,000 journalists who work there were issued with a list of guidelines, including avoiding large gatherings, clearing away coats and avoiding bright or garish items of clothing. They were also given maps of the newsroom floor, showing them where to walk to avoid being caught on camera. The BBC spokesman told the Daily Telegraph that guidance 'was issued to staff working in the transmission area ahead of the first live broadcast', adding that wearing high-visibility clothing, congregating directly behind the live shot or eating at desks was discouraged, but not banned. Insiders quoted by the paper also claim that staff have been tasked with monitoring what appears on screen and issuing instructions to colleagues, including 'stop yawning' and 'put that sandwich down'. One BBC member of staff said: 'There are signs everywhere warning staff they could be on camera. 'Some people find it an intrusion, particularly the older hands, but for anyone in their 20s starting out in broadcast journalism its just the reality of life.'","It is alleged security staff would not let paramedics into newsroom .

"By . Richard Luscombe In Miami . PUBLISHED: . 06:43 EST, 18 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:51 EST, 18 March 2012 . Fidel Castro had advance knowledge that President John F Kennedy was about to be killed, according to an explosive new book about the 1963 assassination soon to be published by a retired CIA agent. Rumours about the Cuban dictator’s involvement in a plot to murder his fierce adversary have swirled for almost half a century since communist sympathiser Lee Harvey Oswald shot the US president during a trip to Dallas in November that year. Now author Brian Latell, who studied Cuban affairs as a CIA analyst in the 1960s and later became the agency’s chief intelligence officer for Latin America, says he is certain that Castro at least knew the attack was going to happen. Adversaries: Cuban dictator Fidel Castro told staff he was going to murder President Kennedy to prove his allegiance to the communist cause, according to a new book by a retired CIA analyst . On the morning of November 22, 1963, the day Kennedy was killed, Castro ordered a senior intelligence officer in Havana to stop listening for non-specific CIA radio communications and concentrate instead on 'any little detail, any small detail from Texas,' Mr Latell claims in his new book Castro’s Secrets – the CIA and Cuba’s Intelligence Machine, set for release next month. Four hours later, the airwaves came alive with news that Kennedy was dead. Mr Latell also claims that Castro was aware that Oswald, who had been denied a visa to visit Cuba at the country’s embassy in Mexico City, told staff there that he was going to murder Kennedy to prove his allegiance to the communist cause. 'Fidel knew of Oswald’s intentions and did nothing to deter the act,' Mr Latell writes in the book. In an interview published today in The Miami Herald, Mr Latell, now a respected senior lecturer on Cuba at the University of Miami, says he discovered the information in interviews with former Cuban intelligence officers, backed up by declassified US government documents. 'I don’t say Fidel Castro ordered the assassination, I don’t say Oswald was under his control. He might have been, but I don’t argue that, because I was unable to find any evidence for that,' he said. '[But] everything I write is backed up by documents and on-the-record sources. 'Did Fidel want Kennedy dead? Yes. He feared Kennedy. And he knew Kennedy was gunning for him. In Fidel’s mind, he was probably acting in self-defence.' That fateful day: President John F. Kennedy rides through Dallas moments before being assassinated on November 22, 1963 . Mr Latell’s book, billed as the first in-depth study of Castro’s intelligence operations in the years after the Marxist revolutionary seized power in a 1959 coup, says there is other strong supporting evidence. It claims, for instance, that CIA wiretaps of Cuban intelligence agents in the immediate aftermath of the assassination revealed that they already had surprising level of knowledge of Oswald’s background when only scant details had been reported by the media. But it is Mr Latell’s interview with former Cuban intelligence officer Fiorentino Aspillaga Lombard, who was in charge of Castro’s listeners at his Havana compound, which will raise eyebrows. Claims: The new book by former CIA analyst Brian Latell . Aspillaga, who defected to the US in . 1987, told the author that he informed the CIA at his debriefing that . Castro personally issued the order to listen specifically for anything . about Texas. But that information was never revealed publicly, and he . never repeated it until he was interviewed for the book. After his defection, Aspillaga lifted the lid on Castro’s lavish lifestyle, giving details of his fleet of luxury yachts, numerous lavish properties in each of Cuba’s provinces and a secret Swiss bank account containing millions of dollars. But he said that while the population realised that 'Fidel has ruined Cuba', a fear of their leader meant few would ever speak up. 'Who can sanction Castro? What parliament or national assembly can ask for an explanation of what is done with that money?' he said. The claim that Castro was aware of Oswald’s promise to Cuban embassy officials that he was going to murder Kennedy comes from several sources, including a former FBI informant and 'superspy' Jack Childs, who penetrated the dictator’s inner circle. Childs said that Castro told him that Oswald 'stormed into the embassy, demanded the visa, and when it was refused to him headed out saying, ‘I’m going to kill Kennedy for this’.' Meanwhile, Castro was claiming publicly that Oswald’s visit to the embassy was 'a minor matter' that had not been noticed by senior officials in Havana. Subsequent investigations by the US security agencies, and the official Warren Commission inquiry into Kennedy’s assassination, looked at Castro’s possible involvement but concluded that Oswald was a lone gunman acting independently. Among other issues discussed in Mr Latell’s book are the CIA’s own attempts to assassinate Castro using a variety of methods, including exploding cigars and poison pens. He says the efforts were called off after Kennedy died.",Cuban dictator 'told staff he was going to murder the President to prove his allegiance to the communist cause'

As crowds of jubilant well-wishers mobbed the front of St Mary's tonight to celebrate the birth of the new third-in-line to the throne, the Royal couple's bodyguards made another important delivery out of view. Royal close-protection officers were seen delivering two pizzas to the rear entrance to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge gave birth to her son this afternoon. The snacks will be well-needed. Kate endured a labour of nearly half a day to deliver the baby boy, who was born at 4.24pm GMT weighing a healthy 8lb 6oz. A much needed delivery... One of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's close-protection officers turns up with two pizzas from Zizzi's at 8.45pm, after leaving 10 minutes before the announcement of the Royal birth . She earned it: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge pictured in December. She will be in need of carbohydrates to build up her depleted energy reserves after 11 hours in labour giving birth to their son . The plain-clothes policeman arrived at the discreet back entrance to St Mary's at 8.45pm, having left ten minutes before the Palace made the announcement of the Royal birth. His timing suggests that, having given themselves several hours private time after the birth of their son, the Duke and Duchess are now ready to settle down and observe the national celebration their happy arrival has prompted. After her 11-hour labour, Kate will need to stock up her body with carbohydrates, with a pizza the ideal source of sustenance to top up her depleted energy reserves. Without eating soon after the struggle of giving birth, there is the risk her body could go into ketosis - where the body starts burning fat for energy - which can lead to nausea, vomiting and headaches. William, Kate and their child are to spend the night together on the private Lindo Ward at St Mary's, where specialists can make sure everything is okay. Meanwhile, at the front of St Mary's: Self-proclaimed Town Crier Tony Appleton celebrates among the crowd outside the hospital after the birth of the Cambridges' new son was revealed to the world . Big day for Britain: Well-wishers wearing outfits emblazoned with the national flag celebrate the birth of the new Royal baby outside the Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in Paddington .

Self-appointed town crier Tony Appleton stood in full ceremonial dress to lead the party as dozens of others dressed in Union flag regalia danced and sang in the streets. The first indication many of those waiting in the streets may have had was when Royal aide Ed Perkins emerged from the front doors of St Mary's carrying a document in a folder which he passed to a waiting driver. The document was then rushed across central London to Buckingham Palace, where the Queen's Press Secretary Ailsa Anderson with Badar Azim, a footman, placed the official document on an easel in view of crowds waiting there. But in a digital age where news travels almost instantaneously, waiting well-wishers had an advance warning of the revelations. The waiting crowds cheer as the Queen's Press Secretary Ailsa Anderson with Badar Azim a footman place on an easel in the Forecourt of Buckingham Palace a notification, to announce the birth of a baby boy . One man shouted: 'It's a boy,' prompting crowds to erupt into spontaneous cheering, ahead of the easel being placed in the forecourt. There were three cheers of 'hip hip hooray,' as the crowd outside the palace gates swelled to more than 10 deep. Euphoric fans sang happy birthday, welcoming the new prince into the world. But unaware of the the scenes of jubilation he has caused, the newest addition to the Royal family will be in the loving arms of his parents as they come to terms with their new life as a family.","Officers seen arriving with pizza at 8.45pm, having left ten minutes before the announcement of the birth .

A man narrowly avoided an abduction arrest after he picked up the wrong little girl at school and drove away with her. Art Deaner was supposed to pick up six-year-old Courtney Fetters yesterday at her Gloucester City, New Jersey school as a favor to her mother. Instead, he drove away with nine-year-old Courtney Durr -- and almost wound up in jail. Durr vaguely resembled the little girl he was supposed to bring home, Deaner said, and since she answered to the name Courtney, he assumed it was her. Courtney Durr, 9, (left) was supposed to go home with her mother's friend while Courtney Fetters, 6 (right) was supposed to go home with Art Deaner after school. Deaner took the wrong girl home and nearly got arrested. 'I told her I was looking for Courtney,' Deaner told NBCNews. 'And the young girl said her name was Courtney.' Courtney Durr, who was also expecting one of her mother's friends to bring her home that day, climbed into Deaner's car. 'I got off the bus and he pulled up and he asked if there was a Courtney,' she told NBC News 10. 'I said, 'Yeah.' My crossing guard let me go and I went with him.' The two of them drove away, with Deaner unaware that Courtney Fetters, who he was supposed to pick up, was still patiently waiting for him. Deaner hadn't seen her in several weeks and she'd recently gotten a haircut, so he didn't recognize her. Deaner didn't realize he had the wrong Courtney until they'd driven several blocks. Art Deaner got the scare of his life when he picked up the wrong girl after school. But he knew he'd made a terrible mistake when he asked her about a recent family vacation. Courtney said she had no idea what he was talking about. 'He was like, ""You weren't with Aunt Mary in Maine?"" No, I would never have been in Maine,' Courtney said. Deaner stopped the car and told Courtney they were going back straight away. 'I know Courtney was in Maine for two weeks,' said Deaner. 'I had to turn around and take her back. I got the wrong Courtney.' But police, alerted by the sharp-eyed crossing guard who saw Courtney climb into an unfamiliar car, were already on the prowl for him. The crossing guard had even jotted down his license plate number to give to police. Police pulled Deaner over in his car and nearly arrested him for abduction. But after asking him and Courtney several questions, it became clear it was a simple mix-up. No charges were filed. Meanwhile, the friend who was supposed to pick up Courtney Durr was waiting at the bust stop and unable to find the little girl. She called Courtney's mother, who had a few moments of panic before learning her daughter was alright. 'My girlfriend called me and said, ""Where's Courtney?'' said Courtney Durr's mother, Pam Durr. 'I said, ""Well she's supposed to be at the bus stop waiting for you."" She said, ""She's not here.''' Both Courtney Fetters and Courtney Durr were reunited with their mothers after police untangled the comedy of errors. Although the situation ended happily, there was also a lesson learned for the girls. 'Don't go in someone's car when you don't know 'em,' said Courtney Durr. As for Deaner, he says he'll have no problem recognizing the right Courtney in future. 'I won't forget,' he said.

'This is some of the toughest country you can experience,' Johnson said. 'That plane is all over the place up there.' After the crash, a 12-person rescue team began hiking . to the site, but the combination of the terrain and the . darkness meant it took six hours until workers were able . to reach the crash site. At first light yesterday morning, a 40-person recovery team began searching the mountainous terrain for bodies.

The . plane involved in the crash, the Rockwell Aero Commander 690, is almost . identical to the aircraft in which Senator Ted Kennedy cheated death on . June 19, 1964. Kennedy (pictured right following the crash) was a passenger in an AC 680 which dropped into an apple orchard in Southampton, Massachusetts - killing the pilot Edwin . Zimny and his aide Edward Moss. The twin engine light aircraft (similar to the one pictured below) plunged, in bad weather, on the final approach to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. Kennedy, . who was 32 and in the middle of campaigning for re-election to the . Senate, escaped with a punctured lung, broken ribs, shattered vertebrae . and internal bleeding. The . accident came just seven months after Kennedy's brother John had been . assassinated in Dallas. Kennedy later told Civil Aeronautics Board investigators: 'I was watching the altimeter and I saw it drop from 1,100ft to 600ft. 'It . was just like a toboggan ride, right along the tops of the trees for a . few seconds. Then there was a terrific impact into a tree.' The . plane crashed in an orchard three miles short of the runway. Kennedy . spent five months in a Boston hospital, where his staffers set up an . office room from where he could work on his re-election. The . recovery team, which Babeu said comprises 'some of the best-trained . pros in the country', worked to find the five remaining bodies and . evidence before 4 p.m yesterday. 'There's a window because of some storm concerns,' he told ABC.com. 'Some of the evidence and wreckage is strewn for some distance.' On Wednesday night, helicopter rescue teams reported seeing two debris field on fire, suggesting the plane broke apart on impact with the jagged rocks. 'The fuselage is stuck down into some of the crevices of this rough . terrain, and we're doing our best at this point in the darkness,' Babeau . said. 'This is not a flat area. This is jagged peaks, almost like a . cliff-type rugged terrain.' The private aircraft was a twin-engine Rockwell AC690, authorities said. Its registered owner is Ponderosa Aviation Inc. of Safford, Arizona, according to FAA records. A video uploaded to YouTube from a . greyscale webcam shows a small white light moving from the left side of . the screen to the right. About 50 seconds into the footage the light . disappears. A few seconds later there is a sudden flash of light, then more light remains as the fires burn on the mountain. A local resident took the video from his home in Gold Canyon, roughly seven miles away from the crash site, ABC News reported. Graham . said 911 calls began coming in around 6.30 pm on Friday after an . explosion near the Flat Iron area close to Lost Dutchman State Park. 'People said it sounded like fireworks going off,' Graham said. One witness told CNN that a mushroom cloud of flames lit up the evening sky. Another local observer Ronnie Brant told KPHO TV the plane seemed to be having engine trouble. Some witnesses said they heard a plane trying to rev its engines to climb higher before apparently hitting the mountains. The Superstition Mountains' elevation is about 5,000 feet at their highest level. The photogenic area near Lost . Dutchman State Park and the Superstition Wilderness is filled with steep . canyons.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 09:39 EST, 14 December 2011 . Cash-strapped: Increasing numbers of students are turning to prostitution to fund their studies, it has been claimed (picture posed by model) More and more students are turning to work in the sex industry to pay their way through university in the face of rising tuition fees and living costs, it was revealed today. The National Union of Students has warned that as well as sex work, students are turning to gambling and medical experiments to pay for their education. Government reforms mean universities can start charging up to £9,000 annually in tuition fees from next year. In addition, the education maintenance allowance (EMA) for 16 to 19-year-olds has been scrapped. It is these reforms that are causing students to turn to the 'informal' sector for money, according to the NUS. Estelle Hart, the NUS national women’s officer, told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast: “Students are taking more dangerous measures. 'In an economic climate where there are very few jobs, where student support has been massively cut, people are taking more work in the informal economy, such as sex work. 'It’s all dangerous unregulated work, simply so people can stay in education. The NUS also told BBC 5 live Breakfast it estimated about 20% of women working in lap dancing clubs were students. A Department for Education spokesman said: 'We are targeting £180 million a year financial support at the most vulnerable 16 to 19-year-olds to help them continue their studies - with transitional funding for the students who were getting the top rate of EMA and partway through their studies. Clare, . 18, (not her real name) turned to escorting during her A-levels when . her EMA (educational maintenance allowance) faced being cut. She . told the BBC: 'I began looking for jobs, but the hours were unsociable. A lot of my friends have gone on to shop work, and have ended up . leaving college. I didn't want that to be me.' 'I . had a friend who'd been trying to get me to join his escort agency . since I was 16. He told me how much I could earn, how the hours would . fit around me, that I could control who I saw, when I saw them and how . often. 'It just sounded . more desirable. I couldn't see any other option. I did this so I could . go to college, go to university, for it to have a positive effect on the . rest of my life.' 'It is down to schools and colleges themselves to award bursaries to young people who need the most help. 'If students are really struggling financially, they need to speak directly to their tutors.' A . spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: . 'Under the current university funding system, no student has to pay in . advance for tuition. 'There is a generous package of financial support . to help with living costs in the form of loans and non-repayable . grants. 'Our reforms will . make the system even fairer, with more financial support and lower . monthly repayments once you are in well-paid work.' A spokesman for the NUS said although they did not have any quantitative evidence, they backed Ms Hart's comments. 'Anecdotally we are seeing a lot more of this and when you combine this with other reports there does seem to be an increase (in students working in the sex industry),' he said. 'We don't have any quantitative basis to back it up but we are confident to say this is an increasing problem. 'This hasn't originated from us but we are very confident standing by what Estelle said to 5 Live.'","One in five lapdancers is a student, body warns .

A driver may regret his decision to park on a building site after workmen dug around his Mercedes, leaving it marooned on a tarmac island. Baffled workmen at Edinburgh Waverley station - one of the busiest in Scotland - had to excavate around the luxury saloon after the driver apparently moved barriers in a bid to park the car. Rather than tow the vehicle or delay the car park resurfacing, workmen simply dug around it on Friday. Marooned: Work continues around a luxury Mercedes that was parked on a building site . Car park owners Network Rail said the driver ignored warning barriers to leave the saloon on the building site . Network Rail, which owns the car park has now asked police to try and trace the owner, who could face a fine. A spokesman said they had the right to charge the driver for any costs . incurred as a result of delays to the £100m refurbishment of the station. The spokesman said red barriers had been placed across the road but said 'the guy has moved them and parked inside'. However, Network Rail workers did leave a ramp so the driver could leave the car park. One workman, who did not want to be named, said: 'We can't move it. The people who own the car park have tried to contact its owner.' Passers-by were bemused by the scene. One woman said: 'It seems a bit daft. Why not tow it?' Pictures of the marooned car quickly spread online with people posting about the 'hilarious' blunder. One commuter said: 'I came back to my car and saw this Merc totally on its own. Workmen did not tow the car as a show of 'good faith' to the driver, who failed to return and now police have been asked to trace the owner . Network Rail said the driver could be fined for any costs incurred as a result of delays . 'It is pretty hilarious really - the owner has obviously totally ignored the cordon that had gone up and has been left there. 'Fair play to the workers - they've just got on with their jobs.' Asked why engineers continued the work despite the car being there, the Network Rail spokesman added: 'We could have held off but we were running a tight schedule. 'Any delays cost money and further inconvenience to customers. 'We decided to leave the car out of good faith in case the owner returned - when he didn't by the close of business on Friday workers there left a tarmac ramp so he could drive off. 'Just as in cases where people crash into bridges and so on, we are well within our right to claim any losses back from the individual.' The work is part of a £100million refurbishment of the station that has included a new roof, new entrances and the refurbishment to the station's concourses.","Driver apparently moved barriers to park the car at Edinburgh Waverley .

One cook has turned his kitchen into his studio, creating artworks with a breakfast serving of pancakes. What started as simple shapes made from pancake batter to amuse his children has turned into three-dimensional sculptures and replicas of famous artworks. Michael Goudeau spends hours creating edible art, sharing photographs of his pancake masterpieces on his blog before it is gobbled up for breakfast in what he calls his ‘madness’. That's pancake batter: Cook Michael Goudeau started making letters out of pancake batter to amuse his children but now spends hours creating amazing replicas like this plate of tacos, steak, chips and salad . On his blog The Pancake Project, the 53-year-old calls himself a 'pancake artist' and that 'the time has come to reveal my madness'. Breakfast never looked so artistic, with pancake batter whipped into replicas of other foods such as tacos, steak and chips, Christmas trees or a mouse caught in a trap complete with red syrup to show his sticky end. Artist Edvard Munch would surely be licking his lips had he seen Mr Goudeau’s attempt to recreate his famous painting The Scream.

From paint to pancake: The cook adjusts the cooking heat to control the colour and texture of the batter to recreate famous artworks such as The Scream by Edvard Munch (left) Mr Goudeau, a professional juggler from Las Vegas, Nevada said: ‘I make pancakes for breakfast for my children Emily, 10, and Joey, 12. ‘This started when they were very young. I wanted to make something that would get them excited about eating so I made the first letter of each of their names. ‘They loved them and their excitement led me to up my game.’ Breakfast blog: Mr Goudeau takes photos of his edible art, posting them on his Pancake Project blog before they are gobbled up .

He used a breakfast sausage to thread several pancakes together to create a pig (right) The pancake artist uses a bottle with a nozzle to pipe intricate sections and adjusts the cooking heat to control the colour and texture of the batter. He said: ‘I put the batter into a squeeze bottle, and I found I could do letters and easy shapes and designs. ‘For the first couple of years I only worked with getting different tones of brown by timing the placement of different parts of the batter. Syrup for slime: This pancake snail left a trail of slime (syrup) on the breakfast plate . Amusing breakfast: Mr Goudeau started with letters to get his children Joey, 12, and Emily (pictured), 10, excited about eating . ‘The next step into crazy was the idea that I could make a three dimensional pancake. ‘I made a pig's face, several regular pancakes and a pig's butt and threaded them all onto a breakfast sausage and put the whole thing into a pool of syrup. ‘That lead to the 3D snail with a syrup trail all the way across the table and then into a new technique of stacking different pancake pieces to build something complex. Favourite food: Once he discovered that pancake batter takes on food colouring really well to make vibrant colours, Mr Goudeau extended his creations to trees. His favourite is the Christmas tree (right) Mr Goudeau then experimented with food colouring, using it to recreate almost real looking replicas. He said: ‘My next discovery was how well pancake batter accepts food colouring, if you put in a lot of it you get very vibrant colours. ‘I made a colour wheel to demonstrate this but my favourite version of these is the Christmas tree. ‘It combines the simple stacking with the bright colours and makes what I think is a beautiful and very simple pancake.’","Michael Goudeau creates 3D animals, replicas of other foods and famous artworks using pancake batter .

She made her name as the glamorous organiser of secret high-stakes poker games for a string of Hollywood's biggest stars. But now some of Tinsletown's best-known celebrities are bracing themselves for potentially embarrassing revelations in her tell-all memoir. Notorious poker madam Molly Bloom - who hosted card parties for celebrities . including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Matt Damon - was . arrested in Los Angeles as part of an investigation into an illegal big-money poker ring. But before the glamourous 33-year-old takes the witness stand next year, she is threatening to lift the lid on what went on during those late-night card games, where participants might pay a minimum of $100,000 to join. And some of her famous clients' biggest betting secrets could also be revealed. Among the details Miss Bloom could disclose, include whether Maguire - widely known to be a top poker player - has any 'tells' which alert others that he has a good hand, according to the Express newspaper. Another rumour which could be confirmed is whether Damon once lost the equivalent to $25,000 in a single game. None of those celebrities are implicated in the investigation into Bloom and 32 others. But she did have a front row seat during many all-nigh and super exclusive poker games involving the world's richest and most famous individuals. It is understood Bloom would invite a very select group of high-rolling celebrities to a number of locations around Hollywood - including Maguire's LA mansion. The games then moved on to famous nightclub The Viper Rooms - formerly owned by actor Johnny Depp. But the discrete and carefully crafted arrangements put in place by Bloom to protect the secrets of her high-profile clients began to unravel in 2011 when one regular player was convicted of fraud.

He was indicted for rigging the figure skating competition at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. He is a a 'vory v zakone' or 'Vor' - translated as 'thief-in-law' - the highest rank in Russian organized crime networks. Authorities believe he provided protection and backing for the gambling rings. He is believed to be hiding out in Russia. Tokhtakhounov and Nahmad are accused of running separate gambling and money laundering rings that worked together. The FBI says Tokhtakhounov received a $10 million payment for his services.

His clients include high-profile businessmen, celebrities and sports stars. The FBI is not releasing the names of gamblers.

A 66-year-old priest and 71-year-old man have been charged in relation to alleged historic sexual abuse at a children's home in Hounslow, police said tonight. Father Anthony McSweeney was today charged with three counts of indecent assault, three of making indecent images of a child, one count of taking indecent images of a child and one of possessing indecent images of a child. The arrests follow an investigation into the abuse alleged to have taken place at Grafton Close Children's Home in west London. Arrests: 70-year-old John Stingemore, right, and 66-year-old Anthony McSweeney . right, have been charged by police over an alleged paedophile ring . dating back to the 1980s . John Stingemore, 71, was charged with eight counts of indecent assault, two of taking indecent images of a child and one count of conspiracy to commit buggery. The men are due to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court in September. A third man arrested in connection with Operation Fernbridge remains of police bail. The charges relate to seven victims, all of whom were . aged between nine and 15 years when the offences took place during the 70s and . 80s. It is claimed that boys living at Grafton Close were taken to Elm Guest House (pictured) in nearby Barnes where they were subjected to appalling sexual abuse . Operation Fernbridge was launched . with the help of Labour MP Tom Watson to investigate claims that a group . of senior 'Establishment' figures sexually abused . boys in council care throughout the 1980s. Stingemore is believed to be a former . deputy of head of Grafton Close children's home in Richmond, which is at . the centre of the abuse allegations. Former . ministers, senior MPs, top police officers and those with links to the . royal household are alleged to have indecently assaulted vulnerable, . under-age males at a care home and nearby guest house. Grafton Close shut more than 20 years ago and police have stressed . that the abuse claims are historic and are not linked with the current . occupants of Elm Guest House, which has been converted into flats.

The owner of a London bookshop has become the hero of hundreds of JK Rowling fans after he snapped up signed copies of her first detective novel. The Cuckoo’s Calling by Robert Galbraith is topping best-seller lists across the globe since it was revealed that Galbraith is a pseudonym for the Harry Potter author, and first editions sell for more than £1,000 each. Shopkeeper David Headley bought 250 signed copies of the book before the reveal – but instead of making a fortune, he has sold them all at face value: £16.99. Mystery unveiled: JK Rowling signed 250 first edition copies of The Cuckoo's Calling as 'Robert Galbraith' The owner of Goldsboro Books, which specialises in signed first editions, ordered the copies signed by the author, before knowing anything about ‘his’ true identity. Mr Headley had been tipped off about The Cuckoo’s Calling by a publishing friend and, upon being sent a manuscript copy, asked for signed copies of the book. Although he was told the author’s name was a pseudonym, he had no clue that it was Rowling. ‘I did ask if the author really was a first timer as it seemed, well, too good,’ he told The Sunday Times. ‘He assured me the writer was a first time detective writer. This of course is factually correct.’ Out of stock: Since the revelation that JK Rowling is the author of Teh Cuckoo's Calling, Goldsboro Books has sold all the remaining copies - at the £16.99 cover price . Upsell: One of the signed copies from Goldsboro was sold on eBay for over £1,750 and unsigned copies go for around £1,000 . JK Rowling was exposed as the author of The Cuckoo’s Calling by the wife of one of her lawyers. The publisher of The Cuckoo’s Calling had claimed it was written by a former plain clothes Royal Military Police investigator using the pen-name of Galbraith. However, several online literary sleuth’s began questioning similarities between Rowling and Galbraith as well as noting how well the ‘male’ author had described women’s clothes. Rowling was exposed after Jude Callegari, a mother-of-two posted a message on Twitter saying it JK Rowling, 47, was the real author. She had been told by Chris Gossage, a partner in Rowling’s legal firm Russells Solicitors, who told Callegari, his wife’s best friend, in a private conversation. JK Rowling released a statement saying . it had ‘not been pleasant’ to spend days wondering how a woman unknown . to her could expose a secret ‘that many of my oldest friends did not . know.’ Finished copies of The Cuckoo's Calling come off the print line today at Clays Ltd in Bungay, Suffolk . The novel, The Cuckoo's Calling, which was released in April, tells the story of Cormoran Strike, a war veteran turned private eye, who is investigating the death of a model . She added: ‘To say . that I am disappointed is an understatement. I had assumed that I could . expect total confidentiality from Russells, a reputable professional . firm, and I feel very angry that my trust turned out to be misplaced.’ Russells Solicitors have since apologised. One . of the signed copies sold in the central London bookshop has been put . up on eBay, with bids of £1,750 already placed, and even unsigned first . editions go for around £1,000 on the auction site. Since the news broke, Mr Headley has sold his remaining 120 copies – but refused to put the price up over £17. He has kept four copies for himself and his staff: ‘And I am not selling mine, despite the price. It will be with me forever.’","Goldsboro Books bought 250 signed copies of The Cuckoo's Calling .

At least 17 people have been killed after a bomb blast inside a Sunni mosque in Iraq during Friday prayers. The explosion rocked the Abu Bakr al-Sadiq mosque in Wajihiya, about 50 miles north east of Baghdad, injuring around 50 others. It is the latest in a string of attacks on worshippers during the holy month of Ramadan with almost 200 people killed in suicide attacks, car bombings and other violence since it began last week. Deadly: The blast went off at a Sunni mosque about 50 miles north east of Baghdad (file picture) The blast went off on the left side of the mosque, which was filled with men and children, as worshippers were kneeling during prayers, said 30-year-old Mohammed Faleh, who was praying inside. Faleh said security forces found a second bomb left near the mosque that they rendered safe with a controlled detonation. He said: 'I stood up to find blood-stained bodies lying on the ground. The Friday prayer turned into a disaster. Whoever left these bombs has no religion.' The violence is an extension of a surge of attacks that has plagued Iraq for months, reviving fears of a return to the widespread sectarian bloodshed that pushed the country to the brink of civil war after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. Bloody: The Diyala province was considered one of the most violent during the post invasion years. The aftermath of a car bomb in the region at the height of the violence is pictured . Diyala province, where the attack . occurred, was once the site of some of the fiercest fighting between . U.S. forces and insurgents in Iraq. It remains a hotbed for terrorist . attacks. The area is . religiously mixed and witnessed some of the worst atrocities as Shiite . militias battled Sunni insurgents for control in the years after the . invasion. Close by: Today's blast happened while Iran's outgoing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited shiite Muslim holy cities near Baghdad . Diyala provincial councilman Sadiq al-Husseini appealed for calm following today's explosion. He . said: 'Terrorism is targeting all sects in Diyala mainly by attacking . Sunni and Shiite mosques, funerals and football fields to draw the . province into a sectarian conflict. 'All the victims were civilians. 'I call on all Diyala residents to show self-restraint.' Police and hospital officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to release the information to media, confirmed the death toll. They warned that the number of dead could rise. The attack struck while Iran's outgoing president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wrapped up a two-day trip to Iraq with visits to Shiite Muslim holy cities of Najaf and Karbala south of Baghdad. There was no indication the mosque blast was related to his trips. Violence across Iraq has risen sharply since a heavy-handed crackdown by security forces on a Sunni protest camp in the northern town of Hawija on April 23. That raid followed months of rallies by Iraq's minority Sunnis against the Shiite-led government over what they contend is second-class treatment and the unfair use of tough anti-terrorism measures against their sect. The surge in bloodshed has left more than 2,800 people dead and many more wounded since the start of April. Attacks on Sunni mosques, for years a relatively rare target in Iraq, have picked up significantly in recent months. There has been no claim of responsibility for Friday's bombing or many of the other recent attacks.","The blast rocked a mosque in Wajihiya, 50 miles from Baghdad .

A council investment chief who spent over £8,000 on a single trip to Boston has been defended by the board, calling it ‘good value for money’. Leeds council has supported the chief executive of its investment arm, despite recently slashing millions form its budget. Lurene Joseph, head of Leeds and Partners, spent a total £8,340 on cab fares, flights and nights  at a five star hotel during a trip to secure investments  for Leeds in September last year. She spent £285 on a cab from the Yorkshire city to her home in Buckinghamshire before flying to Boston where she stayed in the luxury Charles Hotel and ran up a bill of £6,203 for nine nights with a further £1,852 spent on flights. A further £16,500 was spent on two separate trips in February and April sending delegates to the same city. Leeds and Partners also spent more than £12,000 sending nine delegates to a four-day commercial property conference in Cannes, where Ms Joseph also stayed in luxury accommodation. Leeds Council, who are the main funders of Leeds and Partners, has declined to provide the cost of Ms Joseph's hotel bill for the trip to Cannes. It claimed the five-star stay it was necessary for Ms Joseph as she was ‘leading events and working long days’ and needed to stay close to the main conference area.

Jailed: Nicole Minetti has been sentenced to five years for grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi's bunga bunga parties . An Anglo-Italian showgirl has been sentenced to five years in prison for procuring and grooming prostitutes for Silvio Berlusconi’s bunga bunga parties. Nicole Minetti, whose mother is British, acted as a Madame running a stable of more than 30 young women for the ex-premier’s sex parties, a court in Milan ruled. Minetti, 28, a regional councillor for Berlusconi’s People of Freedom party in Milan, helped to recruit 33 female guests, who were given envelopes stuffed with 500 Euro notes and expensive gifts after the dinners at the prime minister’s luxury villa near Milan. Convicted alongside Miss Minetti were former TV anchor Emilio Fede and talent scout Lele Mora who each received seven year jail sentences. Prosecutor Pietro Forno had told the court that Minetti acted as ‘the brothel manager, paying salaries and choosing locations’. Files included a telephone tap transcript in which a former police officer told a friend sordid details about the bawdy parties. He said: ‘Minetti was there with her chest out kissing Berlusconi continuously. It was a real whorehouse. All the girls were given rings and necklaces.’ In a separate but related trial that ended last month, Berlusconi was convicted of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, then just 17. Ruby, real name Karima El Mahroug, who testified at Minetti’s trial, reportedly performed a lesbian kiss with Minetti at one of the bunga bunga parties. El Mahroug told the court that Minetti was a central figure at the parties and had dressed up as a nun for Berlusconi before stripping down to her underwear. Minetti had been lining up call girls just hours before the investigation into Berlusconi began, the court heard. Sentenced: Emilio Fede, right, and Lele Mora, right, were also jailed for seven years . Guilty: In a separate but related trial that ended last month, Berlusconi was convicted of underage sex with Moroccan nightclub dancer Ruby the Heart Stealer, then just 17 . In text messages intercepted by investigators, Marystell Polanco, a television star, wrote: ‘Papi is here Saturday,’ to which Minetti replied: ‘How do you know he is here Saturday?’ At the same time Minetti messaged the glamour model Floriana Marincea writing: ‘He’s here Saturday. We absolutely must be there. Do you have a pretty friend we can take?’ Miss Marincea texted back: ‘Yes, I’ll find someone, pretty.’ Miss Minetti replied: ‘Who is it?’ getting the reply: ‘She’s very trustworthy, good-looking. I’ve known her since she was 14 and she’s now 25.’ But the defence claimed Minetti was ‘not the organiser of the parties but instead one of many women who had an affectionate relationship with the prime minister - some were given Land Rovers others were given positions in local government. Evidence: Ruby, real name Karima El-Mahroug, is a model and nightclub dancer who testified at Nicole Minetti's trial . Former lawyer Corso added the relationship was a bit like 'you scratch my back and I will scratch yours'. A trained dental hygienist, Minetti, whose mother Georgina Reed is from Newcastle upon Tyne, treated Mr Berlusconi’s broken teeth after he was hit in the face with a statue at a rally in December 2009. There were raised eyebrows when despite zero experience she was entered as a candidate for local elections, winning a seat on the council for the Lombardy region. In a ‘spontaneous declaration’ to the court, Minetti claimed she had been in a relationship with Berlusconi. ‘He began court me discreetly and I don’t deny being fascinated by him,' she said. She added: ‘My feelings for the prime minister were true love.’ Last night Minetti’s lawyer Pasquale Pantano said she was ‘stupefied by the excessive sentence’.","Nicole Minetti ran a stable of more than 30 young women for ex-premier's parties .

A study that says membership of the European Union is beneficial for Britain was last night branded a ‘Whitehall whitewash’. Despite uncovering a catalogue of problems, the Foreign Office review found that the balance of power between Brussels and Westminster was ‘broadly appropriate’. The report sparked anger among Tory . backbenchers, who questioned why it was commissioned in the first place . since the conclusions appear to contradict David Cameron’s policy of . renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels. Foreign Secretary William Hague: mandarins at the Foreign Office has concluded little needs to change in Britain's relationship with Europe . The review warned that: . But despite these issues, mandarins at the traditionally europhile Foreign Office concluded that little needed to change in Britain’s relationship with Brussels. Six reports published by Foreign Secretary William Hague yesterday are the first tranche of 36 studies on different aspects of Britain’s interactions with the EU. A report on the European single market showcased the views of big business and concluded: ‘Integration has brought to the EU, and hence to the UK, in most if not all observers’ opinions, appreciable economic benefits. Peter Bone: 'This sounds like a Whitehall whitewash. This is a government review, not a Conservative Party review.' ‘But it has brought with it a  regulatory framework which some find difficult to operate within or find burdensome. ‘Is . that trade-off, between cost and benefit, between economics and . politics, of overall benefit to the UK? Most observers, and indeed most . of the evidence received for this report, answer positively.’ The . report on health detailed concerns about the way the 48-hour working . week restricts training for junior doctors and encourages foreigners to . come to the UK for treatment on the NHS. But . it concludes: ‘The current balance of competence between the EU and the . UK was considered by stakeholders to be broadly appropriate.’ A report on animal health and food safety detailed concerns that harmonisation of rules on pets travelling has ‘significantly heightened the risk of rabies returning to the UK’. A report on international aid found that the ‘EU development programme management and delivery are overly complex and inefficient, and the EU does not systematically measure the results that EU aid achieves’. Yet it concluded that ‘the advantages of working through the EU outweigh the disadvantages’. Tory MP Peter Bone said the report should prompt the Tories to abandon the Coalition and seek to repatriate powers alone. He said: ‘This sounds like a Whitehall whitewash. This is a government review, not a Conservative Party review. This exercise was an irrelevance.’ Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell said: ‘It is the same tired old actors regurgitating the same tired old script. ‘It is Sir Humphrey assisted by big corporate interests looking out to the world from their desks in Whitehall. ‘We need a referendum so 60 million people, not just Sir Humphrey, can have the final say.’ A total of 44,000 out of Britain¿s 144,000 doctors were trained in other European countries . One in three doctors working in Britain qualified abroad, prompting top medical groups to express concerns about how this could harm patient safety, the review found. The report, which focused on the balance of power between Britain and the EU on health issues, revealed 44,000 out of Britain’s 144,000 doctors were trained in other European countries. It also said out of 104,000 UK medical staff who are not doctors, around 34,000 hailed from other EU nations. More than 9,000 GPs trained in Europe compared with 30,000 who qualified in Britain – meaning one in four learnt to practice medicine abroad. And evidence given to the report by Health Education England showed that more than half of Britain’s nurses came from other countries within the EU. Despite the alarming figures, the report concluded that continuing to ‘import’ doctors and other medical staff from countries around the EU would only improve the quality of the health service. The report claims: ‘None of the responses suggested that the current balance of competence was wrong. Respondents recognised the benefit to the UK as a net importer of health professionals.’ But they admitted some of Britain’s leading medical groups have come forward to deliver warnings about possible safety issues. In evidence submitted to the review, several groups stressed that more needs to be done to ensure foreign doctors have the qualifications and language skills to work in the UK. The report said that ‘concerns were raised’ by the British Medical Association, the General Medical Council, the Royal College of Nursing, the Alliance of UK Health Regulators on Europe and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, among others, on ‘matters that impact on patient safety – namely medical training and language testing’.","Government study finds membership of the EU is a good thing .

A government scheme to help 160,000 young people get into work has so far reached just 4,600, it emerged today. Nick Clegg’s Youth Contract promises to pay employers up to £2,275 for taking on an 18 to 24-year-old who has been out of work for at least six months. But latest figures show that the wage incentives, claimed after someone has been in work for six months, have been paid for more than 4,690 young people. Painting over the cracks: The Youth Contract scheme was launched with great fanfare by Nick Clegg as a solution to rising numbers of under-25s out of work . Mr Clegg has admitted that government policy for young people has failed, complaining that millions of pounds have been wasted on a ‘hotchpotch’ of schemes which have failed to stem the tide of youth unemployment. The Deputy Prime Minister has ordered a major review into Whitehall schemes which are supposed to get teenagers and people in their twenties into a job. Wage incentives under the Youth Contract have been paid to employers for more than 4,690 recruits between June 2012 and May 2013. Ministers hoped it would help 160,000 young people find work over three years – equivalent to around 53,000 people each year. The Department for Work and Pensions insisted the scheme ‘has encouraged UK businesses to offer over 21,000 jobs to young people at risk of long-term unemployment’. Employment minister Mark Hoban insisted the government was 'not complacent' Most of the incentive payments are only made once the employee has been in work for six months. The DWP claimed more than 21,000 jobs have been offered to young people at risk of long-term unemployment under the Government wage incentive scheme. Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: ‘Youth unemployment has fallen by 59,000 since the Youth Contract was launched and tens of thousands of people have benefited from work experience, apprenticeships or the wage incentive. ‘Through the different elements of the Youth Contract, this Government is delivering on our commitment to offer young people the best chance to get on in life, but we're not complacent about the scale of the challenge still facing us.’ The Department for Work and Pensions said take-up of the incentive got off to a slow start, but is now on a ‘clear upwards trajectory’. But TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ‘It is far too early for the Government to be hailing the Youth Contract a success. ‘Closer reading of today's figures show that of the 7,810 people who started on this scheme 26 weeks or more ago, only 2,870 found long-term jobs. In other words, 63 per cent of those who started left employment before six months. ‘There is also still a huge issue with employer take-up. Research published last month shows that nearly one in three of firms are still not aware of this initiative, and of those that are, fewer than one in five intend to make use of it.’ Dole queues: The number of people aged 18-14 who are unemployed has risen by 50 per cent in five years . Latest figures show that from March to May this year there were 3.63 million 16 to 24 year olds in employment, down 31,000 from December 2012 to February 2013. Liam Byrne, Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: ‘The Youth Contract has utterly failed to get our young people back to work. ‘This flagship scheme is on course to miss its target by more than 92% - no wonder there are still almost a million young people out of work. ‘The welfare revolution we were promised has fallen apart. The Work Programme doesn't work, Universal Credit is disappearing into the sunset, and now we know that the Youth Contract has been a disaster.’","Youth Contract pays employers £2,275 for taking on 18-24-year-olds .

Alli, 32, was due to stand trial for common assault but changed his . plea last week at Truro Magistrates Court in Cornwall and was jailed for . 14 weeks. Ms Nash, a former beautician, launched a media campaign urging other victims of domestic violence to flee abusive relationships as she tried to rebuild her life. Jenkins was jailed for life in a secure mental health unit and ordered to serve at least six years before being considered for release . The court heard Alli subjected 'extremely vulnerable' Tina to a 'sustained' attack in her home on June 16. Alli, from Plymouth, Devon, was also handed a restraining order banning him from going anywhere near Ms Nash's home in Penzance, Cornwall or contacting her again. The attack came just three days after Alli appeared before magistrates for scuffling with a policeman on the housing estate where Ms Nash lives. On that occasion, magistrates heard he was in a drunken rage after being kicked out of her house when he was approached by PC Ian Ridge. Alli pleaded guilty to drunk and disorderly behaviour after struggling with the officer and was fined £35 with £80 costs and surcharge. He was also told to pay £100 compensation to PC Ridge and given a drink banning order for a year. Ms Nash latest turbulent relationship comes despite her becoming a high-profile campaigner against domestic violence in the wake of her blinding. After her ordeal at the hands of Jenkin she wrote a book highlighting the scourge of abuse in the home and begged other victims to seek help and not stay silent. ‘Out Of The Darkness’ describes how Jenkin beat her unconscious and poked out her eyes at her home, telling her: 'You’re never going to see your kids again.' The 12-hour attack also left her with a broken jaw and nose. Ms Nash wrote: 'I sat up and reached my hand to my face... and felt my eyeball hanging halfway down my cheek. 'I touched my slippery eyeball, like I couldn’t believe it was real. My other eye was swollen to the size of a tennis ball.' Tina told other victims: 'It’s not going to get better, it’s going to get worse.'","Tina Nash, 33, was permanently blinded in April 2011 by Shane Jenkin, 34 .

James decided at a young age that he wanted to help by donating his own hair. 'I just thought if I had cancer how would I feel if I didn't get the help I needed,' he said. According to the Locks of Love website, most wigs sold by retailers are built to fit adult heads. Locks of Love provides custom-made wigs, adapted to fit each child specifically, through donated ponytails. The wigs return freedom to kids who may feel insecure about losing their hair. The custom-made pieces allow them to swim and do any kind of sport or activity while wearing it.James' family is no stranger to family members losing hair due to a medical illness. James' mother, Suzanne Johnson, recounted how her mother battled lymphoma and her grandmother fought lung cancer before both eventually succumbed to their illnesses.

England is the only part of the UK holding out against the policy. Charges are already in effect in Wales and Northern Ireland, and Scotland is planning to introduce one next year. England is the only part of the UK holding out against the policy. Charges are already in effect in Wales and Northern Ireland, and Scotland is planning to introduce one next year . A senior Lib Dem said: ‘It is the Tories in the Treasury who are blocking this. ‘They believe households would hate it, and that that is more important than the environmental consequences.’ While the issue has divided Coalition ministers, some Conservative MPs, including Zac Goldsmith, David Cameron¿s former green adviser, support a levy . The Mail’s Banish the Bags campaign has . highlighted their devastating impact on the environment and wildlife. Plastic carrier bags from supermarkets are used for an average of just . 20 minutes, but survive for hundreds of years, littering the landscape . and killing marine animals that eat or get tangled in them. In Wales, where a 5p levy has been in place for over a year, there has been an 81 per cent drop in usage as shoppers take their own bags to stores. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is officially still examining the evidence from Wales.Figures this month revealed the number of bags handed out by supermarkets in England has soared by more than 12 per cent in two years, to seven billion. While the issue has divided Coalition ministers, some Conservative MPs, including Zac Goldsmith, David Cameron’s former green adviser, support a levy. Yesterday a Lib Dem source said: ‘It is still something the party supports, as do many Tories, but there is no movement from the Treasury on it.’ A Treasury source said: ‘There are arguments for and against it. All options are being discussed.’ Earlier this year, the Lib Dems’ environment spokesman in the Lords, Baroness Parminter of Godalming, said charges would deliver financial as well as environmental benefits, as householders pay the ‘hidden costs’ of disposing of millions of plastic bags in their council tax bills.

"[CHRISTY AND CLARE CAMPBELL] . PUBLISHED: . 16:56 EST, 21 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 03:08 EST, 22 July 2013 . How long does it take to fall in love? Research has revealed that a quarter of men admit to falling in love at first sight, but only 20 per cent of women. Here, writers Christy and Clare Campbell, who have been married for 35 years and have three children,  recall how long it took for Cupid’s arrow to hit the spot. Happily married: Christy and Clare have been together for more than 35 years and have three children . HIM: LOVE STRUCK  IN TEN MINUTES . There was this girl at a party, the younger sister of my college pal Bill. She was wearing a crimson-and-blue, floor-length dress in some sort of gossamer material, and you could see quite a bit of her through it. Her body was all angles, as if the erotic painter Modigliani had assembled her out of Lego. It was her shoulder blades that got me, though. My knees went wobbly. That’s how it’s meant to happen, isn’t it? No words exchanged, no ritual dance to check out someone’s social 'suitability'. You see someone you really fancy and just get stuck in. It used to be called love at first sight. Well, it happened to me — in less than ten minutes. I’d always been a sucker for this kind of thing, going all gooey about a girl I’d seen on the Tube or even in a magazine. The trouble was, in that hormonal-emotional Sargasso Sea between late adolescence and college graduation, I’d been 'in love' plenty of times, but all to no effect. While other young adult chums were cosily pairing off, I was mooning round impossible objects of desire. I rather enjoyed it. Subconsciously perhaps, I enjoyed it so much I set the bar of impossibility higher and higher. At one stage, I found myself 'in love' with the bob-haired silent-film actress Louise Brooks, born half-a-century before me. Then I became convinced the only female who really understood my anguish was my tortoiseshell cat, Flossie. This was clearly going nowhere. Then it happened. It was a family party at the South London home of my college friend’s parents. And there she was, Bill’s kid sister. Her name was Clare. She looked fabulous. In love: Christy and Clare soon after they began dating. He was already in love. She, by contrast, was not . All the other girls, half-glimpsed disappearing down escalators on the Tube, fell off the edge of the world. This time it was different. It was a physical reaction that consumed my whole being. And I know I’m not alone. Many of my male friends have admitted the same thing occurred when they met 'the one'. In fact, two of my close friends have gone on to marry Clare’s friends, and they also said they knew immediately. She spoke. It was posh-Purdey from the New Avengers with a street-cred dash of South London. ‘This is my fiance,’ she announced, gesturing to some bloke at her side. I’d done it again: fallen for the girl I could never get; tilted my hat at the impossible object of desire. Except this time I put up a fight. This girl was real, not a fantasy. She had a home phone number, and her brother Bill, with whom I’d shared many drunken conversations on the trials of love, also proved an early ally in the great quest. Battle was joined. I had my first proper job and Clare was conveniently in her final year at university, away from London, so there were plenty of potential chinks in my love rival’s armour. What a rat I was being. But I was in love — and that justified everything. Time passed. I’d fallen in love in an instant, while she was still shilly-shallying round after three months, and was still engaged! And so we traversed the landscape of young love behaving like we were something out of Brief Encounter. There were visits to art-house cinemas, nights drinking in out-of-the-way pubs (where none of our friends would see us) and autumnal, leaf-kicking walks in suitably obscure locations. When at parties with mutual friends around, we’d pretend we hardly knew each other. Just getting away with it was terrifically exciting.There were rows and sulks. Serial monogamy was clearly more honourable for Clare than sleeping with two men and not telling one of them. I just wanted to get on with it. Love at first sight: William Shakespeare's Romeo is immediately smitten by the beautiful Juliet . Lightening bolt: Nicholas Cage's character in City of Angels gives up immortality for love . But, little by little, I won this guerilla war. Not just to make Clare love me, but to make her confident enough to break off her engagement — which, after six months, she did. No wonder women take longer to fall in love — there’s so much to be sure of. Why trust a guy who says it’s you, and you only? How many others has he said that to? Perhaps I was lucky. I fell in love at first sight with someone who seemed like yet another impossible object of desire. Except she wasn’t. Eventually, she loved me back — and still does. HER: IT TAKES AT  LEAST SIX MONTHS . A tall, handsome boy I’d only met for the first time earlier that day was looking down at me and smiling. 'Can I get you a glass of champagne?' he said. Christy, my older brother Bill’s best friend from university, had been paying way too much attention to me all evening, and this had not gone unnoticed by my boyfriend of two years, who had recently become my fiance. I was flattered, but also extremely flustered. In the whole time we’d been dating I hadn’t looked at another man. Now I felt confused. I’d never met Christy before but he was intelligent, charming, attractive and very funny. We chatted for an hour, I drank far too much, and I realised the next morning I’d agreed to meet him the following weekend. My brother was thrilled. He loved the thought I might start dating his friend. My parents liked Christy, too, but my close friends were appalled. For them, my boyfriend and I had almost become part of the furniture. So I didn’t tell them (or my boyfriend, obviously) when I went to a party with Christy the following weekend. Looking back, I feel ashamed of my behaviour. My parents had always told me never to do anything I wouldn’t like someone else to do to me. I never intended to hurt my fiance, but was worried how I could find someone else so attractive while I was supposed to be in love with him. I thought it was better to find out now rather than after we were married. I enjoyed that party a lot. I liked Christy a lot. He was chaotic (he still is) but great fun. Although I didn’t do anything more than kiss him goodbye at the end of the night, I felt terribly guilty. So I decided not to see him again. I convinced myself it was just a passing crush. Over the next two months, however, I began to think about him more and more. I tried to listen to my  friends who reminded me that Christy had never been out with anyone for more than a few months, so why should I be any different? I knew there was an element of truth to their words: even at 21, I realised men fall in love so much more easily than women. I was in my final year at university, while Christy was working for a magazine publishing company in London. I still saw him occasionally at weekends, when he came to see Bill. Often I’d find myself chatting over breakfast with him and catch myself feeling jealous if I thought he’d been out with another girl  the night before. And still he made  me laugh. So when he suggested going for a walk together, I agreed. Then I found myself agreeing to see a film. Before long, I was seeing him regularly. I knew it  was wrong, but I convinced myself  that as long as we weren’t sleeping together it didn’t technically count as being unfaithful. As the weeks went on, and after much agonising, I decided to break off my engagement. How could I marry when I had feelings for another man? Finishing with my fiance was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, and even though I was now free to start seeing Christy, I was too upset to do so. I spent evenings weeping during my university finals, feeling wretched and unsure. In the meantime, both Christy and my ex were bombarding me with phone calls. My father’s observation that: 'Well, you don’t have to marry either of them,' was no great help. Eventually, I agreed to meet Christy again, and this time I had no doubts. I remember the day I knew I was in love. He took me to lunch to meet his sister and brother-in-law, where he sat down and played blues piano to his six-year-old niece. That was it for me. He was already wonderful company: now I could see he was warm and compassionate, too. So, yes, it probably took me six months to fall in love with Christy, not just one meeting. People may assume it’s us women who fall in love instantly, but for me it was a slow burn, and I needed time to deliberate. Yet once I was certain, I never doubted it. Six months later, Christy asked me  to meet him at the Ritz Hotel bar, and  he proposed. ‘Nothing would make me happier,’ I answered. And it was true. Clare and Christy Campbell’s latest book, Bonzo’s War, will be published by Constable and Robinson this autumn.","Writers Christy and Clare Campbell have been married for 35 years .

The sun is shining, I’m about to go on holiday, the 5:2 diet has worked and I’ve lost a stone. Why, I’m positively Pollyanna-like as I breeze down the road to meet a friend for lunch, humming a happy tune as I go. And then it happens. 'Turn that frown upside down!' trills a complete stranger as he passes. 'It might never happen, love!' Sunny: According to those in the know, Victoria Beckham is utterly lovely but her BRF disguises it . What he simply doesn’t realise is that I have a tragic and little-understood affliction: what internet wags have dubbed 'Bitchy Resting Face' (BRF). This makes people like me look moody, bored or, yes, even mean, when they’re in repose or being thoughtful. It can affect anyone — even celebrities. In fact, it’s the only  thing Victoria Beckham and I  have in common. Her often pouty expression belies the fact that underneath she has a cracking sense of humour and the sunniest of dispositions. Well, me too. I like to think I’m a glass half-full kind of gal, and I do frequently smile. It’s just that when my face is merely 'resting', I tend to look like I’m about to commit murder. I’m always being asked if I’ve got out of bed on the wrong side while even unposed photographs of me — having what I thought was a nice time — suggest I could make hell freeze over with my icy glare. Sufferer: A new spoof PSA addresses the problems experienced by women afflicted by 'Bitchy Resting Face' 'Incurable': This woman may be happy to smell the flowers on a spring day, but her face doesn't show it . Luckily for me and fellow sufferers, a parody video, which has become a hit on YouTube, sets out to explain Bitchy Resting Face is an incurable syndrome requiring compassion and understanding. Hopefully, it will  change ill-formed perceptions. 'These women might be suffering without you even knowing it,' the video explains patiently. 'They might not be mean at all ... ' And, anyway, as it also points out, there’s something even worse: the male equivalent. This makes many men look deeply grumpy and bad-tempered, when they’re really as chirpy as Jiminy Cricket. In fact, as I sit opposite my husband, I remind myself that his frowning, about-to-explode expression has nothing to do with the news that I’ve pranged his car. It’s just his face — and he can’t help it.","Bitchy Resting Face makes people look moody when their face is in repose .

Protestors are planning to turn their backs on the funeral procession of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday. Pictured, British forces' officers carry a coffin outside St Paul's Cathedral during yesterday's rehearsal . Police were under pressure last night to crack down on plans to insult the memory of Margaret Thatcher at her funeral. Hundreds of protesters have pledged to turn their backs on the former prime minister as her coffin travels through Central London. Campaigners said Scotland Yard has effectively encouraged the move by decreeing it is not against the law and will not provoke arrests. The move is calculated to cause maximum embarrassment to her grieving family without provoking action by police. It will be seen by millions of people worldwide as the huge ceremonial occasion is beamed live around the world on TV. Police chiefs said they are ‘not there to uphold respect’ and said demonstrators who are merely ‘insulting’ are unlikely to face arrest. But they faced a backlash from many who questioned why anyone would want to be so disrespectful to the dead stateswoman. Hundreds of people have signed up to online sites vowing to wear red and turn their back on the military funeral cortege. They want to occupy high-profile points of Lady Thatcher’s three mile funeral procession so their views will not be missed. Organiser Rebecca Lush Blum, 41, of Warsash, Hampshire, said that by giving the green light police have encouraged others to join in. The environmental campaigner said: ‘It is symbolic gesture that I turn my back on Thatcherism and all it stood for and I hope other people will join me.’ John Cooper, QC, the architect behind the back-turning protest, said the public nature of the funeral means it is impossible to ban insulting gestures. He said: ‘Simply saying it is beastly, horrible or distasteful - a point of view that I can understand - does not take away the fact there will be a proportion of society that rightly wants to legally demonstrate. ‘Therefore what I am doing is trying to provide an outlet for people who so chose who want to demonstrate. I’m not saying they should or they shouldn’t, but for those that choose to there should be a legal way. Anger: Anarchists, students and militant far left groups have held parties to celebrate the death of Baroness Thatcher . ‘It might well be cathartic or therapeutic for some to do so and one legal way, and the police have agreed it is legal, is to turn your backs on the cortege.’ Scotland Yard refused to say how many groups have asked for permission to demonstrate during the funeral. But several Facebook protest groups that sprung up since Lady Thatcher died have attracted a vocal and enthusiastic following. One group, Maggie’s Good Riddance Party, threatens to hold a ‘right jolly knees-up’ outside St Paul’s Cathedral. Regal: The funeral of former Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher will be attended by luminaries from around the world and is expected to cost £10m . Retired chief constable Dr Tim Brain said police are forced to tread the fine line between the right to protest and upholding the law. The retired Gloucestershire chief said shouting insults may even be tolerated as behaviour that is ‘insulting but not alarming or distressing’ may be allowed. He said police will have the ‘human rights’ of protesters to ‘freedom of expression’ at the front of their minds. Asked if shouting would be an offence, he replied: ‘It depends what is being shouted. That is the very fine judgment you have to make about policing in a democracy.’ Speaking on BBC Radio 4, he said police will be ‘very firm’ if protest becomes disruption, for example if objects are thrown at the procession. Dr Brain said: ‘My expectation will be that when you move from peaceful protest into acts of disruption that is where the line will be crossed.’ Lord Tebbit, the former Conservative chairman, described protesters as ‘mindless bigots’ but said police have no option if they obey the law. He said their actions will not provoke her supporters, adding: ‘Hopefully, those of us who admire Margaret Thatcher are too well-mannered to fall for the bait.’ Lady Thatcher’s former press secretary Sir Bernard Ingham accused police of ‘conniving at a display of bad taste.’ He said: ‘The plain fact is that we know exactly what these Left and anarchist groups do - they break convention and they enjoy doing it. ‘I’m absolutely certain there will be people who take great offence and are deeply upset by these protests because they don’t think it is the way to behave.’","Campaigners want police to clamp down on protest on Wednesday's funeral .

A council tenant who carried out numerous 'home improvements' on his rented property has been sent a £5,000 bill to cover the cost of putting his botched DIY projects right. George Brassington, 71, fitted new doors, a sink and even built a shed at the three-bedroom council house he shared with wife Ivy for 20 years. He also demolished an old pantry at the side of the kitchen to create a space for a tumble dryer, got his colleagues to help with plumbing and electrical work and fitted two external security lights. But after moving out, housing association officials ruled his DIY work would be 'dangerous' for future tenants and has sent Mr Brassington a £5,000 bill to cover the cost of fixing them. Home DIY: George Brassington, 71, is pictured with a bill for £5,000 from First Choice Homes Oldham to fix botched DIY work he carried out at his Manchester council house . Home sweet home: Mr Brassington fitted new, and sometimes ill-fitting, doors, pictured above, at the . property in Oldham, Manchester.  He also knocked down a . pantry to make room for a tumble dryer and asked colleagues to help him with plumbing and electrical work during the 20 years he lived at . the house with wife Ivy . They sent the retired pensioner a letter and enclosed a bill including £2,500 for a complete re-wire of the property plus £2,300 for replacing the doors, kitchen units and even skirting boards and curtain rails. He is also being charged for new floor tiles, the cost of patching up the bathroom ceiling and even a new toilet seat for the property in Oldham, Manchester. They warned Mr Brassington he faced legal action if he failed to pay - but First Choice Homes Oldham eventually agreed to let him pay off the outstanding bill at £3.55 a week. It means he will be 97-years-old when the balance is cleared. The grandfather-of-ten said: 'The letter came as a massive shock. As far as I was concerned the work I did over the years was of a good quality and added value to the house. 'We lived there for 20 years so were bound to change some things and I wanted to make the place looking nice. I’m not a DIY disaster - far from it, I used to work in the building trade. 'We decorated the house and I put a shed . in the back garden. I changed a couple of the doors inside to ones that . were more expensive and I fitted a new sink in the kitchen. Handy man: Mr Brassington had also built his own shed, apparently with a collection of wooden planks, pictured above, at the property in . Oldham, Manchester, before the couple moved out earlier this year . Costly: But when Mr Brassington and his wife moved out of the property in Oldham, Greater Manchester, to a smaller bungalow, they were sent a £5,000 bill to cover the cost of fixing his DIY work . 'I also fitted a security light to make sure we could deter burglars - and moved a light in one of the rooms, but I got an electrician to do that for me. It was good job - not some fly-by-night cowboy operation. 'We’re pensioners and can’t afford to pay this amount of money. It’s unfair they’re taking this out on us. All of the work was carried out by professionals I know through my career in the building trade and was completed with quality materials. I can’t believe these people are saying its botched job.' The elderly couple were sent the bill after downsizing to a smaller bungalow a mile away in nearby Holts. As an incentive, First Choice Homes Oldham even promised £300 to aid his move. But just months after settling into their new home the letter dropped through the letter box saying he was liable for £4,977 of 'rechargeable repairs'. It said £178 pounds was being billed for a 'cleanse’ to the property which it then said referred to items being removed which had been left behind. Debt: Mr Brassington has been told by First Choice Homes Oldham that he can pay back the bill at £3.55 a week - meaning he will be 97-years-old when the balance is cleared . The letter added: '£2,500 is a for . full electrical re-wire which was necessary due to major and dangerous . DIY electrics both internally and externally to the property.' The firm is currently completing a major . £149 million project including a new builds programme, asset . management, and repairs and maintenance for its stock of 12,000 . properties in Oldham. Mr . Brassington said: 'At the moment all of the neighbouring properties are . being done up with new wiring and bathrooms being put in. I can’t . believe they are chasing me for this money. It’s not much for them but . it’s a phenomenal amount for me. Charges: This copy of the bill sent to Mr Brassington shows the breakdown of the costs of repairing his DIY work - reaching a total of £4,977.74 . 'I . said to them: ""What am I actually paying for?"" The reality is it will . take so long to settle the balance, I’ll be dead before I’ve paid it all . off.' Mr Brassington's . local Citizens Advice Bureau, which has written to the housing . association on his behalf, said: 'We believe that our client, however . misguided, carried out certain work in good faith and in the belief that . he was in fact improving the property. 'Considering . the simultaneous regeneration of the area and, as we understand it, . this property we would like to request that the debt be written off.' But Dave Woods from First Choice Homes Oldham said: 'Tenants have a right to make improvements and alterations but there are requirements to ensure works are carried out to a certain standard. Written consent must be sought from us before any work is carried out. 'Specifically the must comply with planning or building regulations and any work related to electricity or gas apparatus systems or equipment has to be carried out by a suitably qualified person. 'The tenancy handbook also clearly states that if a customer carries out improvement work either without first seeking our permission or after we have refused permission they could end up reinstating the property to its original condition. 'We may also take legal action for breaching tenancy conditions.' Mr Woods added: 'The tenancy agreement states that if or when a customer moves out of a home they must either leave the improvement in good working order or remove it and make good the original fitting at their expense so we can re-let the property. 'Failure to do this will mean a recharge for putting right any work that is not of the required standard, is unsafe unfinished or is in any breach of any other regulation.'

Despite the national obsession with cookery programmes, British cooks now spend just 38 minutes preparing the evening meal - down from an hour in 1980 and 100 minutes in 1960.

More than half of those questioned said that their family was their biggest source of gastronomic inspiration, possibly because for six in 10, their parents also taught them how to cook. Time was less of a luxury in the 1960s, when one could spend more than an hour and a half cooking dinner . The survey of 2,000 people found almost 60 per cent of women . say they were inspired to start cooking by their parents, a third take ideas from . their friends, one fifth from their grandparents and one in 20 are . influenced by the recipes their children learn at school.

But despite Britain's increasingly adventurous chefs, the Sunday . roast remains the nation's favourite meal, with two . thirds regularly reaching for the roasting tray. Curry also remains a popular choice although it was beaten into third place by Spaghetti Bolognese  and was closely followed by another British . classic - bangers and mash. Tulisa shared a picture of her evening meal on Instagram in March . But contemporary cooking isn't all about aping the older generation and tucking into classic dishes. 20 per cent said they not only share their dinner with friends but also with online acquaintances by posting . pictures of food on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Social networking at suppertime increases to 50 per cent in the 18-24 age bracket, perhaps inspired by A-list food fans such as Tulisa Contostavlos, 25, who shared a picture of a mammoth Chinese supper in March on Instagram. Although almost 40 per cent of us eat supper with other people, more than a quarter of British people read while they eat, whether the paper or on their Kindle or iPad, while a quarter like to check their phones. The award for the most sociable . diners goes to the East Anglians who sit down together seven times a . week (45 per cent), while Londoners, at the opposite end of the spectrum, are the . loneliest diners, with one in 10 always eating solo. We cut cooking time so we can spend more time with family, do chores, go to the gym or watch TV . The report also found that increasing numbers . are looking for help and inspiration to cut down on the amount of time . they spend preparing meals. On average, the main cook in the household . spends 38 minutes in the kitchen preparing the evening meal, . considerably less than 50 years ago. One in four claim they couldn't live without bottled cooking sauces. Women . look for convenient cooking . solutions in order to spend more time with family or to do chores (almost 15 per . cent), while 15 per cent of men want more time to go to the gym or watch . TV. Nevertheless, the survey also found a positive attitude to . cooking, with 65 per cent of us admitting to enjoying food preparation, with many considering it a . hobby rather than a chore. Britain's top three dinners are spaghetti bolognese, roast dinner and bangers and mash . The oldest and youngest in society are the . most enthusiastic when it comes to home cooking, with almost three . quarters describing it as an enjoyable pastime. Food historian Caroline Yeldham comments: 'As a nation, we've embraced cooking as a hobby - having fun, . sharing food and turning a meal into a social occasion. 'A younger Come . Dine With Me generation has developed, and supper clubs where people . pay to go out to dine in at someone's home have emerged.' Emma . Evison, General Manager at Mars Food UK which conducted the survey, said: 'The report sheds a . light on the eating habits of the nation and has provided some . interesting insight into the evolution of the dinner table and how our . eating habits have changed over the past five decades. 'As our lives . become increasingly busy and time is considered a precious commodity, . it's clear from the research that we're reaching for products we can . trust to create great tasting enjoyable nutritious meals quickly and . easily.'","The average time was an hour in 1980 and 100 minutes in 1960 .

One in ten police officers are being sent out on duty with a potentially lethal Taser stun gun, it was revealed last night. Almost 14,000 frontline officers are allowed to wield the 50,000-volt devices, which they are given after just three days of training. The figure lays bare how forces are increasingly relying on the weapons, which they claim make officers and the public safer. And it raises fresh questions about whether British police are being 'armed by stealth', endangering almost two centuries of policing by consent. Scroll down for video . Potentially lethal: Figures show one in ten police officers are allowed to carry Tasers after just three days training . Critics claim the American-made weapons are increasingly being used to force people to obey police, simply by threatening them. But one police chief said the training officers received was 'world-class' and Tasers were less dangerous than conventional firearms, batons and dogs. Fatal burns: Controversy rages over the death of Andrew Pimlott after he was Tasered while soaked in fuel . The news came as controversy rages over the death of Andrew Pimlott after he was Tasered while soaked in fuel. The 32-year-old succumbed to horrendous burns after a confrontation with police outside his home in Plymouth, Devon. The independent police watchdog is investigating the incident. A total of 13,794 officers are trained to use Taser stun guns, which were introduced in 2004. There are 132,235 police officers in England and Wales. To be able to carry a Taser, officers undergo a three-day training course and renew their accreditation each year via the internet. The training course includes classroom-based lessons and practical testing, including a scenario with a man holding a can of petrol and a cigarette lighter. One Taser critic claimed the weapons have been put into the hands of non-firearms officers without any clear debate or political decision. Richard Taylor, who is based in Cambridge, said: 'I don’t think any element of a UK police officer’s power and authority should come from the weapons that they are holding.’ Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said there was 'pressure’ for even more of the weapons to be made available. The West Mercia officer, who is responsible for Taser use nationally, added: 'Mistakes will be made because there is a human element to all this. We feel it is often by far the safest and least injurious weapon to use.'

If you've ever wondered what goes on inside the Bank of England, with its gold vaults and piles of cash, you can finally find out. The famous building has thrown its doors to the world today, with the launch of its Virtual Tour app that gives users a tour of the mysterious institution. Available to download free of charge via the Apple Store and Google Play marketplace, the App takes visitors on a virtual tour of the central bank’s historic building, with 360° panoramic views. Scroll down for video . The new app offers access to the gold vault of the UK's central bank with previously unseen panoramic photos . Not many people would usually get to see the Court Room, where the Bank of England's governing body, the Court of Directors meets, but the app gives us a sneak peek. The original design was by Sir Robert Taylor and dates from 1774 but the room was moved in the 1930s . The Bank of England (pictured) is throwing open its doors to its gold and cash vaults with the launch of its first app . The app allows users to find information about the workings of the bank. Here, a picture of a stash of banknotes is annotated with facts such as that there are around two billion banknotes in circulation . The highlight of the tour is arguably . the bank's staggering gold vaults - one of the largest in the world - . that houses over 400,000 bars of the precious metal. While gold plays no role in the Bank’s policy decisions today, it . remains a mark of stability and value. The bank keeps the valuable bars safe . for the UK government, other central banks around the world and members of . the London Bullion Market Association but actually only owns two standard size bars and two Roman bars itself. It is hard to imagine how much the room is worth in total as the value of a gold bar in June was around £350,000. Amazingly no gold has ever been stolen from the bank apart from in films and an episode of Thunderbirds. The tour also visits the cash vault . where the Bank holds a portion of its vast stock of banknotes, of which . there are approximately two billion in circulation. This is an image of the Bank of England's staggering supply of bank notes. There are £50 billion worth of banknotes in circulation. The bank issues approximatly one billion new notes a year . The Cantilever staircase was completed during the Herbert Baker re-building of the Threadneedle Street premises between 1935 and 1939. It is located in the front hall of the bank and was among the longest in Europe. It overlooks an original Roman mosaic . The app shows virtual visitors treasures such as this mosaic. It was created by Boris Anrep, a Russian whose work can also be seen in Westminster Cathedral and the National Gallery . The bank has been issuing notes for . over 300 years, although early banknotes were simply receipts for gold . deposited at the bank. There are over £50 billion worth of . banknotes in circulation and the bank issues around one billion new . ones every year as well as destroying the old ones. App users can also learn about the security features on each of the Bank’s notes in the app's ‘know your banknotes’ feature. Virtual visitors can explore the . Garden Court, a surprising garden feature at the heart of the building that is . planted with mulberry trees, which were used to make the first paper . money issued in 10th century China. The bank also shares the gruesome tale of the 'bank giant' with the public in its first app. A former clerk at the bank who was two metres tall was buried in the garden in 1798 to protect it from grave snatchers. Less surprisingly, the Bank of . England’s monetary policy and financial stability roles are also . illustrated in the tour, with a visit to the room where the Monetary . Policy Committee meets to set interest rates every month. Doors to the committee room, where interest rates are decided, were originally designed to prevent eavesdropping. This is the elegant Committee Room where the bank's Monetary Policy Committee meets to decide the official interest rate . The secret Garden Court at the Bank of England. It has its origins in the churchyard of St Christopher-le-Stocks, which was demolished in 1782 to make way for the expansion of the Bank. One of the conditions of the Act of Parliament permitting the demolition of the church was that the graveyard remain undisturbed - and so it was until the re-building of the Bank in the 1920s and 1930s when it was centralised behind the new Threadneedle Street entrance to the Bank . The Front Hall of the Bank of England houses a mini model of its inner buildings, some of which the general public will be able to explore for the first time using the bank's first app . Symbols reflecting money and finance are everywhere inside the bank and you can spot plenty of lions and eagles, which represent the relationship between the pound and the dollar. The mosaics featured in the app tour are based upon coin designs from Roman times until the 1920s. The mosaic seen at the base the bank's impressive staircase is actually one of three uncovered by excavations during the building of the bank and is believed to be from a 2nd century Roman villa that once stood on this site. Most of the Threadneedle Street building is, of course, a working space devoted to monetary and financial stability. But it is also a recognisable . landmark to many people, and the app provides a unique glimpse of some . of the bank’s more significant locations behind its familiar facade.

Cracking size: James Hyslop, scientific specialist at Christie's auction house, displays a sub-fossilised elephant bird egg measuring over 100 times the average size of a chicken egg . Elephant bird: The flightless species, found only in Madagascar, died out in the 17th century but its egg, held above by Christie's science specialist James Hyslop, has been rediscovered . Examples of whole eggs are extremely rare and it is likely to fetch up to £30,000. More than 260 lots will go under the hammer in the Travel, Science and History sale at Christies, including curiosities of natural history, globes, scientific instruments, rare books and maps, alongside paintings and works of art from the ages of exploration. Occasionally subfossilised elephant bird eggs are found intact and the National Geographic Society in Washington holds a specimen of an Aepyornis egg which was given to Luis Marden in 1967. The specimen is intact and contains the skeleton of the unborn bird. In Denver, the Museum of Nature and Science holds two intact eggs, one of which is currently on display.

Elephant birds are an extinct family of flightless birds found only on the island of Madagascar and comprising the genera Aepyornis and Mullerornis. They are among the heaviest known birds (Dromornis stirtoni of Australia reached a similar weight). The reasons for and timings of their extinctions remain unclear, although there are written accounts of elephant bird sightings on the island in the 17th century. The famous explorer and traveller Marco Polo mentions very large birds in his accounts of his journeys to the East during the 12th–13th centuries. These earlier accounts are today believed to describe elephant birds. Aepyornis was at the time the world's largest bird, believed to have been more than 3 m (10 ft) tall and weighing close to 400 kg (880 lb). The egg volume can be up to 160 times greater than a chicken egg.","It is believed that the extinction of the elephant bird was a result of human activity .

Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s British-born wife is pregnant, according to reports. The dictator is said to have told mysteriously anonymous Arab 'visitors' to Syria, who passed it on to Beirut newspaper al-Akhbar, generally regarded as sympathetic to his regime. The London-born mother of three, Asma Assad, 37, once described by Vogue magazine as a . ‘rose in the desert’, has not been seen in public in recent months, making the claim hard to substantiate. Efforts by MailOnline to confirm the report with her father Dr Fawaz Akhras, a Cromwell Hospital and Harley Street cardiologist failed. The al-Akhbar article focused on Assad's take on the ongoing civil war that has gripped Syria for the last two years and his confidence in his army's ultimate success. It said: 'On the personal level, the man seems . calm and in control. 'His confidence level stands out. Also there’s the . news of the pregnancy of his wife Asma, which could not be dealt with as . a simple personal matter between a couple.'

Revelations: Emails show that the First Lady, left, who married Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, right, in 2000, was kept up to date on how the furniture was being laid out in the palace . Earlier this month Assad and his family were reported to be living on a warship guarded by the Russian navy. The embattled dictator was said to . have moved with his family and a select band of aides to the warship off .

The British-based Syrian Observatory . for Human Rights, which says it provides objective information about . casualties on both sides of Syria's war from a network of monitors, said . the death toll could rise as high as 80. It was not clear who had carried out the killings. The Queiq River rises in Turkey and travels through government-held districts of Aleppo before it reaches Bustan al-Qasr.'They were killed only because they are Muslims,' said a bearded man in another video said to have been filmed in central Bustan al-Qasr after the bodies were removed from the river. A pickup truck with a pile of corpses was parked behind him. It is not clear who carried out the killings - human rights groups have accused both government forces and the rebels of carrying out summary executions. Government forces and rebels in Syria have both been accused by human rights groups of carrying out summary executions in the 22-month-old conflict, which has claimed more than 60,000 lives. Horrific: The bodies were found in a small river of in Aleppo, The police say the bodies were killed by Assad-devotees . Rebels pushed into Aleppo, Syria's most populous city, over the summer, but are stuck in a stalemate with government forces. The city is divided roughly in half between the two sides. The revolt started as a peaceful protest movement against more than four decades of rule by President Bashar al-Assad and his family, but turned into an armed rebellion after a government crackdown. More than 700,000 people have fled, the United Nations says. Syrian rebels stormed a government intelligence complex in the oil-rich east of the country on Tuesday, freeing at least 11 people held in a prison at the facility, activists said. After five days of heavy clashes around the intelligence compound in the city of Deir el-Zour, rebels finally overran the complex early Tuesday following intense fighting overnight, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Grim task: Residents attempt to identify bodies found along a river at a school used as a field hospital in Aleppo's Bustan al-Qasr . Opposition figures were reportedly being held at the jail on the complex's grounds, but it was not immediately clear whether those freed Tuesday are fighters or activists. Government forces responded to the rebel advance by unleashing a series of airstrikes on the compound, trying to push the opposition fighters from the facility. The aid group Doctors Without Borders said last month that government forces are shelling and bombing Deir el-Zour almost daily. It said tens of thousands of Syrians, many of them wounded, remain trapped in the city. Also Tuesday, regime warplanes also carried several airstrikes on rebel positions in restive towns and villages around Damascus, including eastern Ghouta and Yalda, and hit other suburbs with artillery, the Observatory said. The group relies on the reports from activists on the ground. After capturing several major army bases and government outposts, the rebels control large swathes of land in northeastern Syria. Assad's troops, however, continue to hold a tight grip on the capital after nearly two years of conflict. The areas on the capital's doorstep have been rebel strongholds since early on in the revolt. In recent months, the rebels have used them as a base from which they have been trying to push into central Damascus, the seat of Assad's power.

A life-like, autonomous robotic jellyfish the size and weight of a grown man is the latest weapon in the US Navy’s arsenal to guard the world’s oceans. Virginia Tech College of Engineering researchers have unveiled the prototype robot, nicknamed Cyro. It is a larger model of a robotic jellyfish the same team made in 2012 – headed by Shashank Priya of Blacksburg, Virginia, and professor of mechanical engineering at Virginia Tech. The earlier robot, dubbed RoboJelly, is roughly the size of a man's hand, and typical of jellyfish found along beaches. Scroll down for video . In the swim: The Robocop jellyfish is the size and weight of a man and moves using eight mechanically controlled arms . ‘A larger vehicle will allow for more payload, longer duration and longer range of operation,’ said Alex Villanueva, a doctoral student in mechanical engineering working under Priya. ‘Biological and engineering results show that larger vehicles have a lower cost of transport, which is a metric used to determine how much energy is spent for traveling.’ Both robots are part of a multi-university, nationwide $5 million (£3.3m) project funded by U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Centre and the Office of Naval Research. Jellyfish are attractive candidates to mimic because of their ability to consume little energy owing to a lower metabolic rate than other marine species. Additionally, they appear in wide variety of sizes, shapes and colours, allowing for several designs. They also inhabit every major oceanic area of the world and are capable of withstanding a wide range of temperatures in both fresh and salt waters. Preparing the prototyope: Researchers have been testing the device in a swimming pool, preparing it for a life in the ocean . Most species are found in shallow coastal waters, but some have been found in depths 7,000 metres below sea level. Partner universities in the project are Providence College in Rhode Island, the University of California Los Angeles, the University of Texas at Dallas, and Stanford University. Priya's team is building the jellyfish body models, integrating fluid mechanics and developing control systems. Cyro is modelled and named after the jellyfish Cyanea capillata, Latin for Llion's Manemain jellyfish. Jellyfish, with ‘Cyro’ derived from ‘cyanea’ and ‘robot.’ As with its predecessor, this robot is in the prototype stage, years away from use in waters. A new prototype model already is under construction at Virginia Tech's Durham Hall, where Priya's Centre for Energy Harvesting Materials and Systems is based. ‘Our hopes for Cyro's future is that it will help understand how the propulsion mechanism of such animal scales with size.’ A big difference exists between the larger and smaller robots. Cyro is powered by a rechargeable nickel metal hydride battery, whereas the smaller models were tethered, Priya said. Experiments have also been conducted on powering jellyfish with hydrogen but there is still much research to be done in that area. Fully charged: The Robo-Jelly is covered in a sleek silicone skin and is powered up with a battery that could last up to several months . In both cases, the jellyfish must operate on their own for months or longer at a time as engineers likely won't be able to capture and repair the robots, or replace power sources. ‘Cyro showed its ability to swim autonomously while maintaining a similar physical appearance and kinematics as the natural species,’ Priya said, adding that the robot is simultaneously able to collect, store, analyse, and communicate sensory data. This autonomous operation in shallow water conditions is already a big step towards demonstrating the use of these creatures. The jellyfish body consists of a rigid support structure with direct current electric motors which control the mechanical arms that are used in conjunction with an artificial mesoglea, or jelly-based pulp of the fish's body, creating hydrodynamic movement. With no central nervous system, jellyfish instead use a diffused nerve net to control movement and can complete complex functions. A parallel study on a bio-inspired control system is in progress which will eventually replace the current simplified controller. As with the smaller models, Cyro's skin is comprised of a thick layer of silicone, squishy in one's hand. It mimics the sleek jellyfish skin and is placed over a bowl-shaped device containing the electronic guts of the robot. When moving, the skin floats and moves with the robot, looking weirdly alive.‘It has been a great experience to finally realize the biomimetic and bio-inspired robotic vehicles,’ Priya said. ‘Nature has too many secrets and we were able to find some of them but many still remain. We hope to find a mechanism to continue on this journey and resolve the remaining puzzles.’ The goal of the robot jellyfish is to place self-powering, autonomous machines in waters for the purposes of surveillance and monitoring the environment. In addition, its other uses will be studying aquatic life, mapping ocean floors, and monitoring ocean currents. The jellyfish must operate on their own for months or longer at a time as engineers likely won't be able to capture and repair the robots, or replace power sources. Future uses of the robot jellyfish could include conducting military surveillance, cleaning oil spills, and monitoring the environment. The idea for a robotic jellyfish was pioneered by the U.S. Naval Undersea Warfare Centre and the Office of Naval Research. Jellyfish appear in wide variety of sizes, shapes and colours, allowing for several designs. They also inhabit every major oceanic area of the world and are capable of withstanding a wide range of temperatures in both fresh and salt waters. Most species are found in shallow coastal waters, but some have been found in depths 7,000 meters below sea level. Jellyfish have drifted along on ocean currents for millions of years, even before dinosaurs lived on the Earth. They have tiny stinging cells in their tentacles to stun or paralyze their prey before they eat them.","Jellyfish are attractive candidates to .

She was last week unveiled as the face of Miu Miu, and is also one of the face's of Just . Cavalli, as well as Madonna’s Material Girl. But as the 21-year-old smoulders for her latest campaign, she has revealed that there may be a drastic career change on the horizon. Bringing sexy back: Georgia May Jagger has been unveiled as the face of Hudson's a/w 2013-14 campaign . 'I wanted to be a vet when I was growing up, so I can definitely imagine doing that. 'I love animals. I also really enjoy photography, so I would like to do more of that in the future,' she told Vogue.co.uk. The young British muse was speaking as she posed as the face of Hudson's autumn/winter 2013-14 denim campaign. Shot by Sebastian Kim with art direction by Patrizio Micelli and the Al Dente agency, Georgia stars alongside Spanish model Jon Kortajarena, who has modelled for the likes of Just Cavalli, Versace, Giorgio Armani and Tom Ford. Speaking about the campaign, Mick Jagger's daughter said: 'I really love the Hudson brand because they have the classic jeans but they have a lot of fun with the denim, too. Rock child: Mick Jagger's daughter shows off some serious attitude in the new campaign, which isn't her first for the brand . Dare to bare: Georgia smoulders in the campaign as she struts around on set in just a bra . 'I'm really big on colour and I love that they have a lot of great colour options, as well as the black and indigo skinny jeans that I like to wear every day. 'I have also been working with them for a long time now and they have an incredible team who I really enjoy working with!' The campaign, which will be officially unveiled with a public event at Selfridges Denim Studio on July 18, is Jagger's second for the label. 'We wanted to create a campaign that revolved around our brand mantra of “Let yourself go,” and that visually set the tone which we could build on, season after season, said Hudson creative director Ben Taverniti.

A team from the University of Toronto has won the long standing AHS Sikorsky Prize with a flight lasting 64 seconds and reaching an altitude of 3.3 metres. Todd Reichert (pictured) provided the pedal power for the crazy aircraft to make the first ever sustained flight of a human-powered helicopter . The AHS Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Competition began in 1980 to find the first successful human-powered helicopter that can fly over three metres in height while hovering for at least one minute in an area of ten square metres. The $250,000 prize has not been awarded since the competition began and creative engineers have been competing for the title for over three decades - with very few coming close to winning. AeroVelo, a team made up of past and present students from the University of Toronto, competed with a team from Maryland University in a bid to take the coveted prize. The team's helicopter, nicknamed Atlas, measures 47 metres across but weighs just 54 kilograms. The super light-weight frame is made of carbon fibre tubes that connect the four rotors to the central bike, used to power the hand-made aircraft. It relies on the pilot's physical strength to keep it airborne. Mr Reichert said: 'As you spin your legs, you're spinning the rotors. 'It's very much an exercise in mental and physical control, at the same time as an all-out physical effort,' according to The Ottawa Citizen. Despite the huge amount of physical exertion, he described hovering in the air as an 'incredible feeling'. Mr Reichert said: 'This isn't something that you're going . to commute to work in any time soon, but it's an exercise in really . pushing the limits on what's physically possible, and what you can do . with lightweight materials and really creative design.' 'Winning this competition really is a catalyst to keep doing the things we love. 'Our goal is to take on projects that really inspire people to follow big dreams' The small Canadian team worked on the helicopter for more than a year and endured plenty of slow changes to perfect the prize-winning design as well as two crashes that wiped out their work each time. The team's chief structural engineer, Cameron Robertson, said: 'I hope that this inspires not only our fellow Canadians, but also global citizens to do more with less.' The team said: 'We came into this very confident that . we were capable of winning this prize. 'We realized that . the prize was a lot more difficult than we originally anticipated, but . at every step we were able to overcome the difficulty and get even . closer and closer to the prize.'

'It . is a great technological achievement, requiring ingenuity, knowledge, . and experience in a number of challenging technical areas. 'Through . accomplishing such a challenging feat, Todd and Cameron have provided . tremendous inspiration for young engineers both in Canada and around the . world.' Mr Reichert and Mr Robertson have set up a company called AeroVelo and plan on developing different human-powered vehicles. They hope that human-powered vehicles will be seen as a viable alternative or supplement to those burning fossil fuels. It is not the duo's first record-breaking win. In 2010 they created a human-powered ornithopter called Snowbird - an aircraft that flies by flapping its wings - and made aviation history by achieving human-powered bird-like flight.

Move over rats and squirrels, an increasing numbers of big cats and wildlife are giving up their natural habitat to come and live in the sprawling cities. A new study led by WCS-India scientist Vidya Athreaya finds that certain landscapes of western India completely devoid of wilderness and with high human populations are crawling with a different kind of backyard wildlife: leopards. The study found as many as five adult large carnivores, including leopards and striped hyenas, per 100 square kilometres, a density never before reported in a human-dominated landscape. Spot on: Leopards are loving the urban environment, forsaking the tough life in the jungle . The study, called Big Cats in Our Backyards, appeared in the March 6 edition of the journal PLoS One. Using camera traps, the authors founds that leopards often ranged close to houses at night though remained largely undetected by the public. Despite this close proximity between leopards and people, there are few instances of attacks in this region. Neighbourhood threat: There is increasing awareness about the ability of some large predators like wolves and pumas to live in cities . The authors also photographed rusty spotted cat, small Indian civet, Indian fox, jungle cat, jackal, mongoose – and a variety of people from the local communities. The research took place in western Maharashtra, India. ‘Human attacks by leopards were rare despite a potentially volatile situation considering that the leopard has been involved in serious conflict, including human deaths in adjoining areas,’ said big cat expert Ullas Karanth of WCS. Snake attack: The Indian variety of mongoose is well known for its ability to fight and kill venomous snakes, particularly cobras . ‘The results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both humans and wildlife to each other's presence.’ The authors say that the findings show that conservationists must look outside of protected areas for a more holistic approach to safeguarding wildlife in a variety of landscapes. The study was located in the Ahmednagar district of western Maharashtra, India. According to Wildlife Conservation Society big cat expert Ullas Karanth: ‘The results of our work push the frontiers of our understanding of the adaptability of both humans and wildlife to each other’s presence.’ Having its day: The Jackal is an opportunistic omnivore, a predator of small- to medium-sized animals and they are proficient scavengers . The findings also suggest that conservationists must look outside of protected areas for a more holistic approach to studying wildlife and their expanding habitats. During the last twenty years, there has been an increasing awareness of the ability of some large predators like wolves and pumas to live in very human-dominated environments in the developed world. Most examples of large carnivores in urban landscapes are from countries with a low human population density although in the case of mountain lions in Southern California, . It has been seen that part of their home ranges overlap with densely populated urban landscapes. Recent results from Africa show comparable densities for lions, cheetahs and jackals inside and outside the protected areas, although the human population density there was low. Very little is known about the ecology of ‘urban’ carnivores in densely populated countries where the potential for conflict can be very high. For instance, India has a high diversity of large carnivores, many of which share spaces with one of the highest human and livestock populations in the world. The most common is the leopard, which is frequently reported from many human dominated landscapes across India where it is involved in a wide range of conflict situations, often with fatal outcomes for humans.","As many as five adult large carnivores, including leopards and striped .

Scotland is to dramatically cut the drink drive limit making it illegal to get behind the wheel of a car after drinking a half pint of beer. Ministers are expected to announce later today plans to lower the limit from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg bringing Scotland into line with mainland Europe. Scots have an appalling record with alcohol, drinking on average 20 per cent more than people in the rest of the UK. Scotland is to cut the drink drive limit making it illegal to drive after drinking a half pint of beer . Holyrood has already announced plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol in a bid to tackle the problem of binge drinking. However the move to cut the drink drive limit is also being seen as part of Scotland's separatist agenda as it seeks to distance itself from England. The power to change the drink drive laws was transferred to Holyrood earlier this year as part of the Scotland Act. Proposals to lower the limit were announced by Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill earlier this year. A public consultation will be launched today. The move was cautiously welcomed by road safety campaigners, as a zero-tolerance approach is their ultimate aim. Sarah Fatica, general manager at road safety charity Brake, said: 'Whilst 50mg is a step in the right direction, what we really need to see is a strong message from our governments in Scotland and Westminster to say that not a drop is acceptable if you are behind the wheel. The power to change the drink drive laws was transferred to Holyrood earlier this year as part of the Scotland Act . 'Far too many lives are lost on UK roads annually because of drink drivers.'If we could have a zero-tolerance approach to drink driving, lives would obviously be saved.' Mr MacAskill will be joined outside Holyrood by Deputy Chief Constable Tom Ewing, secretary of road policing for the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, for the consultation launch. Commenting at the time that he announced the proposals, Mr MacAskill said: 'The Scottish Government has long called for a reduction in the drink-driving limit to 50mg. We strongly believe that reducing the drink-driving limit will save lives, and evidence from across Europe shows that alcohol-related road deaths drop dramatically where the limit has been reduced. 'Having secured the powers to take this forward through the Scotland Bill, the Scottish Government, as a priority, will bring forward proposals later this year, with a view to the change taking effect as soon as possible.'","Limit will be lowered from 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg .

Sparkling stars: One of the latest Hubble Space Telescope image showing a mass of young star clusters in the Milky Way . Now, however, it is firmly categorised as a barred spiral galaxy, with loosely wound arms and a relatively small central bulge. It is the closest and brightest example of a particular class of galaxies known as Seyfert galaxies - galaxies that are full of hot, highly ionised gas that glow brightly, emitting intense radiation.Strong radiation like this is known to come from the heart of Messier 77 - caused by a very active black hole that is around 15 million times the mass of our Sun. Material is dragged towards this black hole and circles around it, heating up and glowing strongly.

Dotted along each arm are knotty red clumps -- a signal that new stars are forming. These baby stars shine strongly, ionising nearby gas which then glows at a deeper red shade.The dust lanes stretching across this image appear as a rusty, brown-red colour due to a phenomenon known as reddening; the dust absorbs more blue light than red light, enhancing its apparent redness. The Hubble Space Telescope has made some of the most dramatic discoveries in the history of astronomy. From its vantage point 600 km above the Earth, Hubble can detect light with 'eyes' five times sharper than the best ground-based telescopes.The telescope was carried into orbit by a Space Shuttle in 1990 and remains in operation. Hubble's orbit outside the distortion of Earth's atmosphere allows it to take extremely sharp images with almost no background light. It has revealed some of the most detailed visible-light images ever, allowing a deep view into space and time. Many Hubble observations have led to breakthroughs in astrophysics, such as accurately determining the rate of expansion of the universe.Although not the first space telescope, Hubble is one of the largest and most versatile, and is well known as both a vital research tool and a public relations boon for astronomy. When finally launched in 1990, scientists found that Hubble’s main mirror had been ground incorrectly, compromising the telescope's capabilities.

"By . Rebecca Evans, Claire Ellicott and Tom Kelly . UPDATED: . 03:59 EST, 8 February 2012 . Prosecutor David Jones breached strict legal guidelines on witness contact when he discussed the case of 16-year-old karate star Dana Baker with her at his house. As a result, the trial of her coach Jaspal Riat, 48, was scrapped. Mr Jones resigned from the Bar soon afterwards. Tragic case: Dana Baker was 16 when she hanged herself while waiting for her abuser to be retried . Later Dana, who represented Great Britain in karate, hanged herself after making a cry for help on Facebook, pleading: ‘Lying here, trying to figure out what the hell I’m gonna do.’ Full details of Dana’s death are expected to be revealed when an inquest is resumed later this month. But six months after she died, video testimony she had recorded meant the trial could be resumed at Gloucester Crown Court in September, and Riat was jailed for eight years. Jailed: Jaspal Riat, 48, was sentenced to eight years at the subsequent retrial . He was cleared of rape but found guilty of sexual assault and seven counts of sexual activity with a child. A jury heard he had identified the academically bright teenager, who was in voluntary foster care, as a lonely child from a ‘vulnerable’ family background, whom he had exploited for his own sexual purposes since she was 13. But what the jurors did not know was that Riat had appeared at Birmingham Crown Court in 2010 when Mr Jones, a leading barrister on the Midlands circuit with 40 years’ experience, opened the rape trial on behalf of the Crown Prosecution Service. A day later, Judge Philip Parker QC discharged the jury after hearing of Dana’s two-and-a-half hour lunch meeting at the prosecutor’s home. Mr Jones, 68, a barrister with No5 Chambers in Birmingham, insisted that the meeting, a month before the trial started, was ‘well intentioned’ and was aimed at seeking to ‘avoid any problem with late video editing which might hold up the trial’. Dana, of Kidderminster, Worcestershire, attended the meeting with her foster mother and a social worker. It is understood that Mr Jones’s wife was also present. By hosting the gathering, Mr Jones breached his profession’s code of conduct because the Crown Prosecution Service was not notified, no police officer was in attendance and no notes were taken. The rules stipulate that such a meeting could have been allowed under ‘special measures’, providing that no evidential matters were discussed. Sports star: Schoolgirl Dana represented her country at karate and was academically bright . But the barrister admitted to the judge that Dana had seen transcripts of her video evidence and a ‘prosecution case summary’ which included details of other witness evidence. After the jurors were asked to leave court, Judge Parker said: ‘It is a very serious case, at its highest an allegation of rape of a young girl of 13 or 14 by a man in a position of trust.’ He said it was a misjudgment to ‘see a witness in such circumstances’, adding: ‘The long and short of it is that I do not believe that this jury can continue to consider this case. Resigned: Prosecutor David Jones quit his Birmingham law firm after his legal blunder halted the trial . ‘I am afraid the result of my ruling is that the current jury will have to be discharged and we will have to seek a new potential date for the trial.’ A hearing took place two months later at which Riat’s defence team argued for the case against him to be thrown out on the grounds that there had been ‘an abuse of process’. The application failed but Mr Jones resigned from the Bar the next day. During the retrial in September, the court heard that Dana became depressed when Riat ended their relationship, and that she had previously taken an overdose. She had also warned him that she intended to kill herself, to which he replied: ‘Thank you for sacrificing yourself for me.’ Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Riat: ‘You used her in a thoroughly selfish and, indeed, despicable manner.’ Mr Jones was called to the bar in 1967. He was also a recorder at Warwick Crown Court. Tony McDaid, practice director of No5 Chambers, said: ‘Mr Jones was a leading barrister on the Midlands circuit for 40 years. ‘What happened was very unfortunate but Mr Jones had an exemplary record.","David Jones breached strict legal guidelines on witness contact when he met Dana Baker at his house for lunch .

Police chiefs were criticised last night for spending £2,500 of taxpayers’ money to bus hundreds of far-Right supporters to a city centre protest that ended in multiple arrests. Around 700 members of the English Defence League from around the country were ushered on to double-decker buses when they arrived by train in Manchester. At no cost, they were driven into the city centre for a planned march. The event prompted 350 Unite Against Fascism supporters to hold their own protest nearby. Police paid £2,500 to bus hundreds of English Defence League supporters to a protest march in Manchester. File picture shows EDL supporters in Bradford demonstration in 2010 . GMP bosses said paying for EDL transport reduced disruptions and cut the number of officers needed to funnel the supporters through the streets. But leading city figures have slammed the right-wing group for draining the public purse. The EDL members visited Manchester for a planned march through the city to Albert Square on Saturday, March 2. The event prompted 350 Unite Against Fascism (UAF) supporters to hold their own opposing protest in nearby Piccadilly Gardens. The day-long rallies climaxed when the two factions faced-off in Albert Square. After previous outbreaks of violence at similar events, the town hall's courtyard was fortified with a two metre high steel fence surrounding the square. Leading city figures have slammed the right-wing group for draining the public purse. File picture shows EDL members in Birmingham in September, 2009 . The EDL and UAF supporters were filtered into opposite ends of the square, and were separated by metal railings and a 30 metre no-man's land. Hundreds of frontline police officers were joined by Tactical Aid Units, dog teams, the force helicopter and surveillance teams at GMP operational command. Figures obtained under freedom of information laws revealed the cost to the police for controlling the event. The bill, excluding VAT, was: . It is believed more than 300 officers took to the street for the operation, which saw 15 people arrested, although police would not confirm the exact number of officers used for tactical reasons. Councillor Afzal Khan, drafted a letter which was signed by many leading city figures ahead of the EDL march, which acknowledged their right to protest but added 'we can't welcome people who spew hatred and racism'. The demonstration cost Greater Manchester Police more than £50,000 overall. File picture shows a demonstrator from the EDL standing in front of police during a protest in east London in September 2011 . Coun Khan said: 'I am deeply concerned that at a time when public services are facing unprecedented deep cuts, we are seeing the police having to spend their scarce resources on the EDL yet again - especially when the individuals concerned come from outside our region simply to create not only disharmony but damage to the city's economy.' Police confirmed the EDL supporters were collected from pre-arranged points at train stations in Greater Manchester. Chief Supt John O'Hare, said: 'The use of coaches to transport large numbers of protesters reduces the number of police officers required to safely facilitate their movement and reduces any opportunities for confrontation. We worked hard in the planning stages to reduce all costs whilst ensuring such a sensitive event was managed effectively with minimum disruption to our city. The cost of not getting events like this right is often far greater.'","Police paid for the transport to make event in Manchester easier to control .

'Undervalued': Horticulture is not prioritised by government or recommended as a career in schools, Mr Titchmarsh said . The future of British gardening is under threat because of a lack of interest from celebrity-obsessed young people, Alan Titchmarsh warned last night. The TV gardener said that unless more youngsters were encouraged into horticulture, the Chelsea Flower Show could end up as ‘little more than a wistful memory’. Young people grew up idolising celebrities, such as boyband One Direction and James Bond actor Daniel Craig, as well as hi-tech gadgets. ‘It’s time we reconnected them with apples rather than Apple Macs, plant cells rather than cell phones and raspberries as well as BlackBerrys,’ he said. He warned that the young do not consider a future in horticulture because ‘careers advisers never even think of it’ and little is done to champion the industry. Mr Titchmarsh said: ‘There is much to learn and, as anyone who has been involved with horticulture will tell you, it can be tremendously challenging. 'And yet our role is undervalued by government, by the population and by young people in particular – in every instance because they just do not understand the breadth of what we do and its importance in terms of the wellbeing of the planet and its population.’ Citing a recent survey that showed that 70 per cent of horticulture businesses could not fill skilled vacancies, and another 90 per cent saying the industry ‘lacks career appeal’, Mr Titchmarsh predicted a bleak future for British gardening unless attitudes are changed. He said: ‘If this situation continues, British horticulture will dwindle and become a pale shadow of its former self, and Chelsea Flower Show little more than a wistful memory.’ Mr Titchmarsh was speaking at the launch . last night of the RHS Chelsea Centenary Appeal, a fundraising drive to . find £1million to support the next generation of horticulturists. Next generation: Alan Titchmarsh is concerned that not enough young people are interested in horticulture . He said: ‘The centenary of Chelsea Flower Show gives us an opportunity that is not to be wasted – a chance to demonstrate that those of us involved in horticulture are not thick, or dull, or unadventurous or simply incapable of doing anything else. ‘Without [horticulture] we would be hungry, uninspired, artistically stunted, unhealthily house-bound, pale of skin and unsound in body. ‘Our wildlife would be deprived of habitats, birds would go hungry, bees would be short of nectar and frogs would fail to find sufficient places to spawn.’","Young people obsess about 'celebs and gadgets' not the outdoors .

Congressman Steve Cohen of Tennessee says he's 'stunned and dismayed' to learn that DNA tests revealed he is not the father of a woman he thought was his daughter. Cohen made the remarks after CNN had a paternity test done on 25-year-old Texas model Victoria Brink with Cohen’s participation, which revealed that John Brink - the man who raised her and the ex-husband to her mother - is in fact her father. To John Brink's surprise, Cohen had stated in February that he was Victoria Brink's father, after Twitter messages he sent to her raised questions about their relationship. Cohen said he discovered she was his daughter three years earlier when he Googled a former lover, Cynthia Sinatra, and learned she had a daughter. 'I knew her mother a long time ago,' Cohen told CNN. 'I Googled her one night, and saw that she had given birth to a beautiful young lady, and I kind of went back to nine months before, and that was a time when we were involved.' Who are you Tweeting? Congressman Steve Cohen was seen sending a Tweet during the State of the Union in February (left) and the recipient was Ashley Brink (right) who he later revealed is his daughter. Now new DNA tests show she isn't, in fact, his daughter . Unintended audience: Though he meant to send it as a direct message, he sent it to his 6,000 followers and deleted it shortly after . Victoria Brink (left) stands with her real father, Houston oil businessman John Brink . John Brink, the president of Houston-based Environment and Energy Group, told Politico that Cohen's claims of paternity 'rocked' his world. In a tweet that Cohen had sent to Victoria Brink in February during the president's State of the Union speech, he  wrote, 'Happy Valentine's beautiful girl.' He ended the message by writing 'ilu,' which is short for 'I love you'. Cohen said Thursday said he still loves Brink and hopes to remain in her life, though he was 'stunned and dismayed when DNA tests disproved what Victoria and I believed about our relationship.' Back in February, Cohen had initially claimed that the model that he was tweeting during the televised speech was a family friend. Cynthia Sinatra, the mother of Victoria Brink, is pictured. She had a relationship with Steve Cohen around the time of Victoria's birth . But that didn't silence critics who thought it odd that the ended the message by writing 'ilu.' The congressman later admitted Brink was his daughter from a previous relationship. She . had not publicly admitted that he was her father, but the two have . grown close since Cohen contacted her mother - his former flame - for . unspecified reasons. 'When she let me know she was watching the State of the Union address I was thrilled that she wanted Steve Cohen to be part of her. I had such joy, that I couldn’t hold back from tweeting her,' he told NBC's Luke Russert. Bonding: Since learning of her existence only three years ago, Cohen has gotten to know Ms Brink and took her on a tour of the Capitol and to the White House Christmas party (pictured) The 63-year-old, three-term Congressman . said that he only discovered that he had fathered the young woman only . when he did a Google search of her mother and found out that she had a daughter. He contacted her after realizing that the 'math looked pretty accurate'. 'The mom told me we had a lot of catching up to do,' he told NBC. Cohen said that the mother confirmed that he was the father, saying that she sees physical similarities between the two. The mother said: 'Every time I look at her I see the German Jew in her face.' Cohen told NBC: 'I’m Lithuanian- close enough.' Cohen's heritage is a proud point for the politician, as he is the first Jewish congressman from Tennessee. From there, he began to build a relationship with Ms Brink, taking her on a tour of the Capitol and White House. Daughter: Little is known about Victoria Brink except that she is a 24-year-old model . He went on to share a picture from the White House Christmas party with NBC reporter Luke Russert, who said via Twitter that during their interview 'Cohen was emotional while telling the story about his daughter, fought back tears, could feel genuine fatherly emotion.' While the emotional reunion likely silences political watchers, it doesn't necessarily quiet his constituents who take issue with the fact he was tweeting at all. 'That goes to show you he had his mind on other things except the State of the Union,' Jerome Holloway from Memphis told local news station WMCTV.

Freeloader: Jeremy Heath, who feigned serious illness in restaurants so he could avoid paying for his meals, has been jailed for six weeks . The least favourite part of any restaurant meal comes when the waiter brings the bill. But Jeremy Heath found a novel way to avoid paying – he would feign a heart attack and get rushed to hospital. For almost five years he was the diner who restaurant managers wished wouldn’t come back as he racked up hundreds of pounds in unpaid bills. He would order drinks and meals before pretending to fall ill when his plate had been cleared and his glass emptied. In one restaurant he told staff he was desperately ill and they called 999, but he was caught on CCTV finishing his pint of lager as he waited for an ambulance. Last night Heath was getting all his meals for free again – but this time as a guest of Her Majesty’s prisons. Heath, from Preston, who uses a wheelchair and suffers from cerebral palsy, was beginning a six-week jail sentence after admitting fraud by false representation. Magistrates in Blackpool were told he was a serial ‘dine and dasher’ who had become the bane of restaurant owners across three counties. He was said to have begun his fraudulent spree in 2008 after a serious decline in his health and had travelled across the North of England enjoying feast after feast. He called in at restaurants and pubs in Cumbria, Lancashire and Greater Manchester where he would order a nice meal and then wash it down with several pints  of lager. On some occasions he would feign heart problems and be rushed to hospital only for him to be discharged when doctors discovered he was perfectly well. At other times, he would say he simply didn’t have the money to pay his bill or tell restaurant  owners his ‘carer’ would pay later. Lies: Heath pretended to be ill to avoid paying his £41.60 bill at the Shovels Inn in Hambleton in Lancashire .

The UK bank was last year fined £1.2billion for facilitating money laundering in the US and Mexico, channelling money for drug cartels. Accusations: Ricardo Echegaray, head of Argentina¿s Federal Administration of Public Revenue, accused HSBC of facilitating tax evasion and money laundering . Ricardo Echegaray, head of Argentina’s Federal Administration of Public Revenue, accused the bank of 'rolling out a fraud-enabling platform' since February. Mr Echegaray said that the scheme involved a 'manoeuvre to hide bank account information from tax collectors' and was linked to criminal activity. The tax chief linked three companies - Mas Distribuidora SA, Recaudaciones y Servicios del Sur SRL and Red de Multiservicios S - with the alleged laundering. He said: 'They evaded taxes and laundered money . through the purchase of fake receipts that were later used to justify . the issuance of checks whose amounts were deposited under a generic tax . identification number.'

The 28-year-old, who recently returned from a second tour in Afghanistan, will join a British team in the Walking With The Wounded South Pole Allied Challenge 2013. The challenge involves three teams from the UK, US and Commonwealth (Australia and Canada) racing across the Antarctic to the geographic South Pole. It aims to highlight the courage and determination of those who have been injured while serving their country. Over four weeks in November and December, the teams will cover a total of 210 miles in temperatures as low as -45C and 50mph winds.

It is generally accepted that the human brain is 'accommodating of illusory changes' so if a person moves at the same time as their virtual character, they feel as if they are really traveling through that virtual world. Mel Slater led the team at the university, which found that participants reacted differently in situations depending on whether they were inhabiting the virtual body of a four-year-old compared to an adult's body merely scaled down to the same size as a child's.

While 'embodiment illusions' are known to make surrounding objects seem larger if a person is placed in a smaller virtual body, the scientists were surprised that those in a child's body overestimated the sizes of objects to a much larger extent. When faced with a choice of two rooms to enter, adults in child-like bodies chose a matching room. They were also asked to categorise themselves as having child-like or adult-like attributes. Those in the child's virtual body reacted faster to child-like attributes to those in the smaller adult body. Professor Slater told the BBC that the illusion of body ownership was responsible for the findings of the study. When faced with a choice of two rooms to enter, adults in child-like bodies chose a matching room. They were also asked to categorise themselves as having child-like or adult-like attributes . 'Somehow the brain thinks 'this is my body' which makes the whole experience consistent. You see the world bigger, have more childlike attributes and prefer a child's environment rather than an adult one.' The scientists believe that their findings could be used for therapy or recalling distant childhood memories. He said: 'To some extent you could revert people to a child-like experience, so they may be able to remember things from their childhood better or to empathise more with their own children.' More research is needed to determine if the experience will have long-term effects.

It's a difficult conundrum faced by many countries around the world - how to produce enough food for an ever-increasing population when land and space is rapidly running out. But it appears China may have come up with an answer with its plans for space-saving vertical farms. They may look more like tower accommodation blocks usually found in big cities, but these 187-metre-high skyscrapers would only be used to grow vegetables and fruit. Because of China's limited room for farming, there are plans to create these imposing vertical structures which provide food while saving land space . The plans to build in the vertical farms in Tai Po, Hong Kong, come after the country's rapid urban expansion in recent years which has seen much of its usable farmland disappear. Despite still having one of the . largest agricultural outputs - feeding 20 per cent of the world's entire . population, only 15 per cent of all its land is suitable for farming . and only around 1.2 per cent permanently supports crops. And with its cities expanding in size by ten per cent annually since 2000, its farmland is becoming increasingly under threat. This coupled with the world's . ever-expanding population has led to fears of future face . food shortages action isn't taken soon. Despite being state of the art, the towers are inspired by traditional Chinese rice farming's amazing shifting terraces . But Spain-based architectural firm . JAPA believes its model could solve this problem with its Dyn-net or . Dynamic Vertical Networks model. This would be a series of high-rise . towers located on the outskirts of cities that could supply the food . needs of the metropolis. The structures would be made out of lightweight yet high tensile materials using as many recyclable resources as possible. The shifting floors of the structure, inspired by China's traditional rice farms, . means each ring of the building can change its position to best suit the . plants, such as making them receive the maximum amount of sunlight or . moisture. The farming towers will create more agricultural land space by building upwards and using cutting-edge technology to grow as much produce as efficiently as possible . The system would also use hydroponics . to grow produce, using little to no soil at all, and would even have . labs to better monitor growth and nutritional value of the crops. Visitors would be allowed into the . building so they can learn more about local agriculture and get to . witness the 360 degree panoramic views each platform offers. The buildings could put an end to . China’s difficulty in finding enough arable land to farm, which has been . a problem throughout its history, leading to chronic food shortage. Although China's agricultural output is the largest in the world, only about 15 per cent of its total land area can be cultivated enough to keep up with the population . While the production efficiency of its . farmland has grown over time, efforts to expand to the west and the . north have held limited success because of the colder and drier climate . than its traditional farmlands to the east. Since the 1950s, China's farm space has also been under pressure by the increasing land needs of industry and cities. The company has suggested Tai Po . District in Hong Kong  which is the second largest administrative district and has a surrounding unused area of some 14,800 hectares in the northeast New . Territories, as the idea site to test the farming skyscrapers. The firm believes the structures would be able to feed the entire population of the surrounding Kowloon-Hong Kong area. Not only will the towers provide food but also spectacular 360 degree viewing platforms and spaces to research on farming techniques .","A network of huge 187-metre-high vertical farms would be used to grow vegetables and fruit .

There is one Royal birth tradition, dating back several centuries, which the Duchess of Cambridge was probably happy has been abandoned: the Home Secretary was not be present at the birth. It was once customary for the Home Secretary, as a senior member of the Cabinet, to attend royal births to ensure the new arrival was a genuine descendant of the monarch and had not an imposter smuggled in. But last week the current Home Secretary, Theresa May, confirmed the convention had firmly been left in the past. History: Theresa May, pictured left, confirmed the tradition requiring the Home Secretary to attend royal births has been firmly left in the past . Waiting game: But while the Home Secretary was content not to be involved in the birth of the new royal baby, the rest of the world couldn't stay away with thousands of well-wishers gathering outside Buckingham Palace awaiting news of the arrival or the prince or princess . Hoping for a glimpse: Members of the public get ready with their cameras outside Buckingham Palace ahead of the arrival of the royal baby . The tradition dated back to the so-called 'Warming Pan Scandal' of the late 17th Century. As King James II and Queen Mary Beatrice celebrated the arrival of their new born son, James Stuart, rival families put about that he was an imposter. The Hanoverians claimed the real child had been born dead and replaced with a new-born infant carried in to the birth chamber in a warming pan. The last time a Home Secretary attended the birth of a future monarch was for the arrival of the Queen herself in 1926. Tory Home Secretary Sir William Joynson-Hicks was reported to have conveyed the news by special messenger to the Lord Mayor of London. The tradition began after 'Warming Pan Scandal' of the late 17th Century when rival families put about that the new born son of King James II, pictured, and Queen Mary Beatrice was an imposter . The last time a Home Secretary attended the birth of a future monarch was when Queen Elizabeth, pictured in the arms of her mother at her christening in 1926, was born . Mrs May was quizzed on the tradition while giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee last week. Tory MP Michael Ellis, who was chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, said: 'Until relatively recently there was a convention that home secretaries attended royal births, I understand this happened with Her Majesty, the Queen. He asked: 'Do you have any plans to visit the Lindo wing any time soon, following this convention?' Mrs May said: 'In fact, it is no longer the case that the Home Secretary is required to attend a royal birth, but I suspect Mr Ellis with your royal connections you might have more information about these things than I do.' She added: 'The home secretary had to be there to evidence that it was genuinely a royal birth and that a baby hadn't been smuggled in.'

Botanists have attempted to cross-pollinate two giant plant species, in a bid to create the largest lily pad in the world. Trainee botanist Hannah Rogers, 17, worked with experts at Ventnor Botanical Gardens on the Isle of Wight to delicately hand-pollinate an enormous Amazonian water lily that only blooms for two nights a year. The process mimics that performed in the . wild by nocturnal scarab beetles attracted to the plant's pungent . pineapple-like scent over its two nights of flowering. A botanical marvel bloomed at the Ventnor Botanical Garden on the Isle of Wight this weekend and 17-year-old trainee botanist Hannah Rogers (pictured) 17, had to bravely don her swimsuit to hand-pollenate lilies . The giant Amazonian lily flowers for just two nights a year and Ms Rogers had to plunge into the pool to remove pollen from Victoria cruziana on its first flowering to replicate the process performed by a nocturnal scarab beetle attracted to its heavy pineapple like scent in the wild . The unusual plant blooms in white on the first night, then changes sex and flowers the following night a deep red before sinking back under the water. The botanists are attempting to create a hybrid of water lily species Victoria Cruziana and Victoria Amazonica and it is hoped the resulting plant will be the largest lily in the world. The massive plants, as wide as 6ft, grow at an extraordinary speed, transforming from a seed the size of a pea in just three months. Their tiny seeds are placed in huge 8ft square pots holding two tonnes of manure, which are then submerged in 22,000 gallons of water. The unusual plant blooms in white on the . first night, then changes sex and flowers the following night a deep . red before sinking back under the water . The massive plants grow at an extraordinary speed and were a pea-sized seed just three months ago. The flowers must be hand-pollinated by botanists such as Ms Rogers (pictured) using a paintbrush while they bloom for just two nights of the year . But their lives are short - by October they will be dead.They are grown at the gardens in a specially designed hot house powered by solar panels which recreates their natural growing conditions - the only place in the world to do so. Inside the house the specially filtered water is kept at 26 degrees Celsius, while the air temperature stays at a balmy 45C and 90 per cent humidity. Chris Kidd, curator of Ventnor Botanical Gardens, said: 'The reproduction cycle of the giant water lily is a facinating thing. 'The first night's flower is bright white and very highly scented like pineapple to attract a pollinator, in this instance a scarab beetle. Botanist Chris Kidd is pictured with the photo voltaic cells brought in to boost the temperatures in the specially-designed hot house. The gardens in the Isle of Wight are the only place in the world to use this technology to recreate the lilies' natural growing conditions . 'When the scarab beetle enters the flower it is inclined to stay inside it because it feeds on the flower's nectar-sweet glands plus it is about five degrees warmer inside the flower. 'The flower then closes its petals, trapping the beetle inside. The following night, the flower opens again but this time it's red and it has changed sex to male. 'By this point the scarab beetle has eaten all the plant's food so it goes off in search of a white flower, and pollination takes place.' Mr Kidd pointed out that as scarab beetles do not like in the UK, botanists have to do the job for them. Ms Rogers does the job that a scarab beetle would do in the wild. The pineapple-scented flower attracts the beetle, and then traps it inside where it feeds on sweet nectar. When it re-opens it has changed colour and sex. The beetle moves on in search of another tasty white flower, and pollination takes place . 'It means stripping off in the middle of the night and getting in the pool with the lilies. 'We open up the flowers and transfer the pollen between plants using a paint brush.' The giant water lilies were named in honour of Queen Victoria after their discovery by British botanists in the mid 19th century. The team at Ventnor Botanical Gardens are hoping their new species could smash the current world record for the largest water lily ever grown. The massive plants, as wide as 6ft, grow at an extraordinary speed, transforming from a seed the size of a pea in just three months. The tiny seeds (pictured) are placed in huge 8ft square pots holding two tonnes of manure, which are then submerged in 22,000 gallons of water . Mr Kidd set the record of eight foot and nine inches in 1996 while working at Kew Gardens. 'By crossing the two species we will be able to grow a lily that is much bigger,' he said. 'It will have a very wide leaf but also a high ridge to its edge.' 'Instead of leaves of about 6ft across, we are hoping it will have leaves of 9ft.' Mr Kidd said that this time next year, the botanists should know if they will be in the Guinness Book of World Records or not.","Trainee botanist Hannah Rogers took on the role of a scarab beetle that would usually fertilise the giant Amazonian lilies in the wild .

Space is a mysterious place and could contain unknown massive structures that act like 'giant vacuum cleaners that suck galaxies towards them and tilt our universe', according to one expert. He points out that cocooned on our relatively comfortable planet, humans tend to think that we have quite a good notion of the laws of the universe. He claims that we believe we live on a small planet orbiting the sun on the fringes of the Milky Way galaxy, which space enthusiast David Glenn dubs a 'thoroughly unremarkable galaxy' in an infinite universe. Space is a mysterious place and could contain unknown massive structures that act like 'giant vacuum cleaners, titling our universe', according to space expert David Glenn. Pictured is a black hole, which is a region of spacetime from which gravity prevents anything, including light, from escaping . According to Glenn, most us us think 'the laws of physics do not change across the universe, even if what we are examining is billions of light-years away.' This theory is called the Copernican Principle, upon which experts base most of their scientific knowledge about the universe. But, Glenn said it could be very wrong. Scientists have started to look more carefully at the structure of the universe by analysing light from distant galaxies to look at the speed and direction of moving objects like planets and stars. They have observed that rather than moving apart as expected, some distant clusters of galaxies actually appear to be caught in a space current, much like a river. Scientists have started to look more carefully at the structure of the universe by analysing light from galaxies such as Barnard's (pictured). They have observed that rather than moving apart as expected, some distant clusters of galaxies actually appear to be caught in a space current, much like a river . And they are moving at incredibly fast velocities or around two million miles an hour, along a certain path. Scientists are unsure why but have labeled the phenomenon 'dark flow'. To work out why this must be happening, Glenn said scientists believe there must be 'something huge out there.' 'It would have to be so large that it is bigger than anything scientists have seen in the known universe before.' Glenn added that it could be so massive it could dwarf galactic clusters, which could be drawn towards it as if the huge object were a giant space vacuum cleaner. Scientists thinks that this mysterious massive body is so large that is possibly titling our universe. Scientists are unsure why galaxies are traveling in unusual directions but have labeled the phenomenon 'dark flow'. It is a good job there is not a giant unknown object close to the Milky Way or our neighbouring Andromeda galaxy (pictured) or life as we know it would be changed . But it is currently impossible to explore the theory, according to Glenn, because scientists have no technology capable of seeing massive structures outside our observable universe, which has a radius of around 45.7 billion light years. He highlights the incredible idea that while the universe has existed for 14 billion years, light from beyond the known universe has not had enough time to reach our telescopes. Some scientists have reportedly tried to explain this phenomenon by suggesting that a neighbouring universe could be causing the incredible pull and tilt. While it might take several lifetimes for scientists to develop the technology necessary to identify what these massive objects are, they currently have the power to make experts question the principle of universal uniformity, Glenn said.","Expert claims that space could contain unknown massive structures that act 'like giant vacuum cleaners, titling our universe'

Murderers and rapists in Ian Brady’s psychiatric hospital are able to watch gory violent horror films and hardcore porn, it emerged last night. Ashworth Hospital in Maghull, near Liverpool, offers patients a range of DVDs including The Silence of the Lambs, Reservoir Dogs, Hostel 1 and 2, Deliverance, Saw V and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Reservoir Dogs features a scene where a man’s ear is cut off, and characters in Saw V are decapitated, crushed and cut in half. The two Hostel films feature gruesome depictions of horrendous violence and have been called 'torture porn'. The hospital where Moors murderer Ian Brady is detained allows patients to watch violent and gory films, it has emerged. Pictured close to the time of his arrest (left) and at a recent court appearance (right) The disturbing films are available to the patients, many of whom have committed sickening crimes, from the library which holds 750 films. The Government pledged to ban prison inmates from watching X-rated films earlier this year, but the new rules do not apply to dangerous patients and criminals held in secure psychiatric units, who are not termed as prisoners.. The patients in Ashworth Hospital are deemed to be a danger to themselves or others, and there are fears that viewing violent or sexual films could make them more likely to commit depraved acts. Silence of the Lambs, featuring Sir Anthony Hopkins as psychopath Dr Hannibal Lecter, is one of the films available to patients . Hostel: Part II features sadistic torture scenes and violent sexual themes . A spokesman for Merseycare, the body which runs Ashworth Hospital, told the Daily Mirror: ‘The hospital library, situated on site, has more than 750 DVDs and the certificate rating is not recorded centrally, or in a way that is easily accessible. ‘All the DVDs in the hospital library are checked and vetted by security staff before allowing a patient access to them. Each patient’s request is considered individually by the security care team, in line with the NHS Safety and Security Directions 2011, which govern national arrangements in high-secure psychiatric hospitals. ‘If any request from a patient causes concern for the security team it would be referred to the patient’s clinical care team.’ Ian Brady, who killed five children with his accomplice Myra Hindley, was sentenced to life in 1966 and has been held in Ashworth Hospital since 1985. Some of the country's most dangerous patients are at Ashworth Hospital . Other Ashworth inmates have included Mark Corner, who murdered two women after being released from a psychiatric unit in 2003 and Paul Corrigan, who kidnapped, raped and murdered 13-year-old John Haddon in the West Midlands. Bill Esterson, the local labour MP, called on the Government to make rules surrounding DVDs the same for inmates and patients in hospitals like Ashworth.He said: 'The Government recently decided that X-rated DVDs are not available for prisoners and it makes sense that patients at Ashworth who have committed very serious offences should face the same restrictions.

But the problem of it passing too slowly or quickly has now been examined by a psychologist who looked at how our emotions, health and age can dictate the speed of the day in our minds. BBC Radio 4 broadcaster Claudia Hammond found that time - the most common noun in the English language - speeds up as you get older and passes faster if you are relaxed rather than scared. Checking your watch: The problem of time passing too slowly or quickly has now been examined by a psychologist who looked at how our emotions, health and age can dictate the speed of the day in our minds . Her book, Time Warped, available from Canongate Books in paperback at £8.99, also explains how time passes twice as fast if you are in amusing company, rather than with someone who is boring. She looked at how time dramatically expands in a near-death situation - using the example of BBC journalist Alan Johnston, who was taken hostage in Gaza in 2007 and released four months later. The psychologist also studied French explorer Michel Siffre, who in 1962 spent two months living in an underground cave to discover how isolation from daylight, clocks and routines would affect him. He completely lost track of time while in the cave and his waking days lasted from six to 40 hours, but the average length was around the same time as the length of a day on Earth - 24 hours.

People always believe they will have more free time in the future, she said, adding that there are plenty of practical methods for ensuring we can try our best to accurately estimate our schedules. But while we may spend much of our lives worrying about time, there is surprisingly no single part of the brain for specifically measuring the passing of minutes and hours, Ms Hammond revealed. Human beings instead tend to process events in three-second intervals - representing how long it takes to complete a handshake or the rhythm of speech - and sync this with clock times, she said.","Emotions, health and age can dictate the day's speed in our minds .

The dinosaur is thought to have been a cousin of the Triceratops and has similar features including the curved nose . It is thought these were used as a threat to establish dominance over other males – and possibly as weapons in combat. Believed to be the cousin of the . Triceratops, the reptile had an oversized snout and a bony frill at the . base of its head. Scientists estimate it was 15ft long and weighed . roughly 2.5 tons. Researchers from Denver and Utah . universities discovered the dinosaur’s skull and other fossil bones . while excavating in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument area . of southern Utah. The huge beast is believed to have lived in  Laramidia, a landmass . formed when a shallow sea flooded the central region of North America, . splitting west and east for millions of years. Laramidia stretched from Mexico to Alaska during the Late . Cretaceous period. The long-horned dinosaur is thought to be a cousin of the Triceratops. The name Nasutoceratops is Latin for big nosed horned face. Palaeontologists believe the creature was about 15ft long and weighed 2.5 tonnes. It lived around 76 million years ago. A clay model was then made from the skull and artists’ impressions highlight the plant-eating creature’s unusual features. The huge beast is believed to have inhabited Laramidia, a landmass . formed when a shallow sea flooded the central region of North America, . splitting west and east for millions of years. The bony frill, rather than possessing elaborate ornamentations such as hooks or spikes, was relatively simple and unadorned. Nasutoceratops, Latin for big nosed horned face, was about 15ft long and weighed 2.5 tonnes. It lived around 76 million years ago in a region that stretched from Mexico to Alaska during the Late Cretaceous period. The badlands, so called because of the dry, unusable terrain, would have been swampy and subtropical. Horned . dinosaurs, or 'ceratopsids', were a group of large, four footed plant . eaters that were around with T Rex up until an asteroid strike wiped . them all out 65 million years ago. Researchers from Utah used the fossils to create a skull reconstruction out of clay. They believe the creature was about 15ft long and weighed 2.5 tonnes. It was a horned dinosaur, or 'ceratopsid', which were a group of large, four-footed plant eaters . Dr Scott Sampson, from the Denver Museum of Nature and Science who described the dinosaur in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B, said: 'The jumbo sized schnoz of Nasutoceratops likely had nothing to do with a heightened sense of smell since olfactory receptors occur further back in the head, adjacent to the brain, and the function of this bizarre feature remains uncertain.' Instead, the horns and frills on these . creatures are believed to have been for intimdating other males and . attracting members of the opposite sex - much like peacocks do with . their tails, and deers do with their antlers today. Dr . Mark Loewen, of the Natural History Museum of Utah, added: 'The amazing . horns of Nasutoceratops were most likely used as visual signals of . dominance and, when that was not enough, as weapons for combatting . rivals.' The fossils were discovered in the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah by researchers from the University of Utah, pictured. The 15ft beast is believed to have inhabited Laramidia, a landmass formed when a shallow sea flooded the central region of North America, splitting west and east for millions of years . Based on the fossil findings, artist Lukas Panzarin created this drawing of the Nasutoceratops' skeleton. The dinosaur's horns are believed to have been used for intimidating other males as well as attracting members of the opposite sex . In Laramidia, which was about the area . of Australia, there may have been more than two dozen giant dinosaurs . on a landmass a quarter the size. These Nasutoceratops drawings are by artist Samantha Zimmerman. It shows the underside of the dinosaur's skull as well its head in profile . Dr . Loewen said: 'We are still working to figure out how so many different . kinds of giant animals managed to coexist on such a small landmass.' During the past twelve years more than a dozen new dinosaurs have been found in the desert known as Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument (GSENM). As well as Nasutoceratops, the collection includes plant eaters such as duck billed hadrosaurs, armoured ankylosaurs, dome headed pachycephalosaurs and two other horned beasts Utahceratops and Kosmoceratops. There have also been carnivorous dinosaurs from small 'raptor-like' predators to a megasized tyrannosaur called Teratophoneus. This has added strong support for a relatively fresh hypothesis of 'dinosaur provincialism' - isolated communities of giant dinosaurs. Dr Andrew Farke, of the Raymond Alf Museum in Claremont, California, said: 'Nasutoceratops is one of a recent landslide of ceratopsid discoveries, which together have established these giant plant eaters as the most diverse dinosaur group on Laramidia.' Dr Eric Lund from the Natural History Museum of Utah continued: 'Nasutoceratops is a wondrous example of just how much more we have to learn about the world of dinosaurs. Many more exciting fossils await discovery in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.'","The Nasutoceratops titusi is thought to be a cousin of the Triceratops .

The Liberal Democrats have been dismissed as 'naive or reckless' by the Conservatives for demanding a huge downgrade in Britain's nuclear deterrent. The Trident missile system could take weeks to launch under Lib Dem proposals for the country to take a ‘step down the nuclear ladder’. Tory Defence Secretary Philip Hammond warned the plan failed to take account of possible future threats from Iran, North Korea and Russia. Ageing: The Trident fleet will come to the end of its life in the mid-2020s but the Government is committed to replacing it . Treasury Chief Secretary Danny . Alexander has drawn up Lib Dem plans to cut the number of Trident submarines . from four to two – and send them to sea without nuclear warheads. A leaked document reveals that the party plans to have just ‘one submarine in a state of readiness measured in weeks’ while the other is being used for training or undergoing maintenance. But Mr Hammond said there was no way of knowing who Britain's future enemies will be, and warned Russia, Iran and North Korea could all pose threats up to 2060. He told BBC Radio 4: 'I think it’s frankly either naïve or reckless just because we don’t perceive an immediate threat today doesn’t mean there won’t be a threat over the 60-odd year time horizon we’re looking at here. 'We've got countries like Iran and North Korea attempting to build nuclear weapons and already possessing long-range missiles. 'We can’t say who the potential adversary might be in the future – Russia is investing $150billion in renewing its forces, we can’t say where the threats will come from. 'We have had for 45 years now a continuous at-sea defence posture that has served this country very well and we do not believe that with nuclear threats if anything proliferating, with more countries seeking to get nuclear weapons, this is a time to downgrade, certainly not to go to a part-time deterrent.' Warning: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond (left) said Lib Dem Treasury . minister Danny Alexander could not predict what future threats lie ahead . The Trident fleet is designed so at least one submarine is continuously at sea so that Britain’s enemies know it could retaliate if attacked. Both the Tories and Labour back Trident’s renewal in the 2020s. But Mr Alexander used a speech today at the Royal United Services Institute to reveal the results of a Lib Dem study on the next generation of Trident subs. He argued that the UK should save money because it no longer needs a Cold War-type defence posture. He acknowledged it would mean accepting a 'different calculation of risk' but said he believed such a change was now justified. 'If continuous-at-sea deterrence is an insurance policy, we're paying too high a premium for our needs,' he said. 'The argument that a current adversary would take the opportunity to target the UK during a period when no boat is covertly deployed and launch an overwhelming nuclear strike against Britain is, frankly, not supported by any analysis I have seen. He added: 'This is the ultimate guarantee we often talk about. But the reality is that in the current circumstances - and for the foreseeable future - that guarantee does not need to sit on a hair trigger.' The Liberal Democrat Trident Policy document reveals the party is ‘wholly unconvinced’ the UK needs its existing fleet and envisages a future government issuing ‘a declaratory policy of going to sea with unarmed missiles’ – meaning subs would have to return to base in the event of an international crisis to get the necessary armaments. Deterrent: A Trident missile launches from a nuclear-powered submarine . And, in a clear sign that the Lib Dems want to abolish Britain’s nuclear arsenal altogether, the leaked paper argues that the UK should start ‘identifying a long-term exit route’ from their ownership. ‘Surely we now have an opportunity at least to “step down the nuclear ladder”,’ the document states. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he hoped the report would . open a 'fact-based debate' on Trident, ahead of the key decisions on the . submarine replacement programme due to be taken in 2016, after the . general election. 'It clearly shows that there are options for our country that do not . simply involve us sticking to the same strategic positions that were . taken in the Cold War,' he said. But he was slapped down by Downing Street who insisted David Cameron was committed to retaining the full deterrent. 'The Prime Minister believes in continuous at-sea deterrence. It is as simple as that,' Mr Cameron's official spokesman said. 'He has seen no evidence that there are credible alternatives.' Mr Alexander mapped out the plan for two Trident submarines after the Lib Dems’ preferred option – cruise missiles mounted on ships, subs and aircraft – was comprehensively junked by Ministry of Defence officials as ruinously expensive. The Lib Dem document admits: ‘Alternative systems, such as cruise missiles in tactical submarines or surface vessels, or air-launched systems, were found to be technically viable but very expensive.’ Defence experts last night rubbished the plan as liable to leave Britain open to attack. Labour peer Lord West, the former First Sea Lord, told the Mail: ‘I find this extraordinary. The reason we picked  this system [Trident] was because it is undetectable and almost invulnerable. ‘These plans are a mechanism for making something invulnerable very vulnerable. Once you have to come back to fit warheads, or spend long periods lying alongside, it gives your enemies the chance to kill your deterrent.’ A Conservative source said: ‘Deploying a so-called nuclear deterrent without nuclear warheads wouldn’t deter anyone. ‘We’d have submarines rusting away in port doing nothing, protecting nothing and vulnerable to a first-strike attack. ‘It would be a massive gamble with our national security.’","Philip Hammond says Lib Dem plan is 'either naive or reckless'

When it comes to choosing a holiday, some of us opt for sun, others go in search of culture… and some, it seems, look no further than the TV guide. A fifth of British holidaymakers admit to being ‘TV tourists’, who go abroad to see the settings of their favourite television programmes and films, a survey found. According to the research, by the Post Office, 19 per cent of us have travelled somewhere simply because it was a film or TV location, and a further 20 per cent hope to in the next five years. Most popular: Brits fancy a trip to New York the most, thanks to programmes like Sex And The City . Of course, it helps that most of those destinations are also fairly desirable in their own right. The most popular was New York, with 39 per cent of TV tourists saying they would like to see the city where the likes of Seinfeld and Sex And The City were filmed. The second most desirable destination was Hawaii, which has hosted TV shows such as Charlie’s Angels, Baywatch and Hawaii Five-0. Los Angeles, the location for a string of movies including Pretty Woman, was third on 22 per cent, followed by Rome on 21 per cent. The Italian capital was the setting for classic movies including La Dolce Vita and Roman Holiday. Roman holiday: Films such as La Dolce Vita from 1960 inspire British people to visit Rome in large numbers . Fifth was New Zealand, where The Lord Of The Rings trilogy was set. Other popular destinations included Las Vegas, setting for 2009 comedy The Hangover, and the Greek islands, where 2008 film Mamma Mia was shot. The TV tourist is one of seven new types of holidaymaker identified by Post Office researchers, based on a survey of 2,000 adults. The others include long haul lovers, who think nothing of travelling long distance for a weekend, ‘in-tents characters’, who prefer a back-to-basics camping trip, and health trippers, whose perfect holiday is a trip to a yoga retreat. Another category is that of the ‘Facebook boaster’. Attractive location: Baywatch has made many British people book holidays to Hawaii . They spend much of their time away making friends jealous with updates about their trip. In fact, the pressure to look good on social networking sites is so great that 34 per cent of holidaymakers admit to faking fun photos purely to impress their friends. The survey also identified ‘senior city-zens’, older tourists in search of an exciting city break, and lastly beached males, who are happy with a beach – any beach.","19 per cent of us have travelled to a film or TV location .

He still faces charges in Stafford County, which didn't take part in the agreement. Serial thief: Eric Brown, 49, of Richmond, Virginia has been sentenced to seven years in a federal prison after making off with a truck owned by the White House . In 2011 Brown was caught on video surveillance driving off with the unmarked truck outside a suburban Richmond hotel parking lot, ahead of an appearance by Obama several days later. 'Video surveillance from the hotel depicted a dark colored SUV driving into the hotel lot.  Shortly thereafter, the truck containing the President’s equipment was driven off of the lot.  Immediately thereafter, a dark colored SUV followed the truck containing the President’s equipment off of the hotel lot,' according to the U.S. department of justice. Along with audio equipment, the truck contained a laptop computer, presidential seals and a podium. Some of the items were later recovered at Maryland pawn shops with the audio equipment found in Brown’s home. The truck was found the next day empty on the side of the road across town. Surprise: President Obama had his teleprompter, podium and various audio equipment and computers stolen days before he spoke at Fire Station 9 in North Chesterfield, Virginia in 2011, seen here . 'Man, I got that truck. I don't do no playing,' told authorities when confronted about the theft, NBC reports. He said he didn't realize at the time that the truck belonged to the White House. He explained that he targeted Ford F-350s and Ford F-450s because they were easier to steal. 'If I had to sum up Mr Brown's character, it would be that he's a thief,' Judge John A Gibney said while arguing his attorney's claim of seven years being a long time for his sentence. Brown has had three-dozen convictions in the last three decades, according to records. Those include burglary, drug possession, identity fraud and grand theft auto. Brown pleaded guilty in January to theft of government property.","Eric Brown told authorities: 'Man, I got that truck. I don't do no playing'"

A planned rise in the price of petrol will go ahead as George Osborne refused to freeze or reduce the amount of tax motorists pay for fuel. Despite pressure from hard-pressed . motorists and businesses that rely on fuel, such as hauliers, there will . be a 3.02p per litre hike in fuel duty from August. The move sparks fears that the country could see a repeat of fuel protests similar to those seen in September 2000 when petrol pumps ran dry during a series of rolling blockades on the country's motorway networks. Scroll down for video . Breakdown of the cost of fuel from August when a 3.02p increase will be applied . Soaring fuel costs: Petrol and diesel prices have rocketed in the last decade . Mr Osborne said: 'High oil prices have put real pressure on household budgets and on businesses. 'That is why we took action in last year's Budget to cut fuel duty so it is 6p lower than our predecessors planned. 'We . have also scrapped the last Government's fuel duty escalator of annual . above inflation rises, regardless of the oil price - and are today . confirming the fair fuel stabiliser. 'Above . inflation rises will only return if the oil price falls below £45 on a . sustained basis - currently equivalent to around 75 US dollars.' AA president Edmund King said: 'At a . time of record prices at the pumps the August increase in duty is a . budget blow-out which will force drivers off the road and could bring a . summer of discontent for many. 'We have heard much about tax . allowances but the increase in fuel duty makes no allowance for . car-dependent, rural and disabled drivers. 'Only last week the Prime Minister . told American students that UK fuel prices would make them ‘faint’, yet . the Government seems intent on inflicting more pain for no gain on . drivers. 'Ironically such a hike in duty . doesn’t necessarily help Government finances as people will cut spending . at the pumps and in shops, and it could fuel inflation.' Quentin Willson, national spokesman for campaign group FairFuelUK, said: 'The Government has turned its back on families and businesses all across the country - three-quarters of the electorate who want lower fuel prices. 'It ignores the threat of rising global oil prices - even the Saudis are trying to pull down the price of crude. And it ignores robust research we gave to the Prime Minister showing that cutting duty will create jobs, improve GDP and cost the Treasury absolutely nothing.' The rise in the price of Brent oil is doing little to help motorists at the pumps . A rise in petrol prices could spark fuel protests similar to those seen in September 2000 . Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: 'The Chancellor’s decision to go ahead with the summer rise in fuel duty is as unsurprising as it will be disappointing to 34 million drivers, especially when the Chancellor acknowledges there is likely to be a further spike in oil prices. 'George Osborne said that taxes should be fair, simple, predictable and support work. Motoring tax fails on at least three of these measures and it is time for a review of exactly what fuel duty is for and who it impacts most.' In a move aimed at appeasing hard-pressed drivers, the Chancellor also said he would increase vehicle excise duty only by inflation and it would be frozen for hauliers. Air passengers were hit by an increase in air passenger duty along with a rise that was deferred from 2011. It will mean a 10 per cent hike in duty adding £250 to a family of four's flights to Florida and £360 onto a flight to Australia. Travel organisation Abta said the APD news was 'incredibly disappointing' but added that the South East airport announcement was 'encouraging'. Some motorists had said they . would have to change or quit their jobs as a result of the rise in duty . because of unaffordable travel costs. Of 16,647 AA members polled, 4per cent . said they would change jobs to reduce mileage while 3per cent would . have to abandon their job because of unaffordable travel costs. Skilled service and manual workers are most at risk, with 9per cent fearing for their employment as a result of the rise. Southern England, the Midlands and north west England are the regions where there is most concern about jobs, the survey showed. The cost of refilling a car has reached record levels with many people saying the cost of fuel has affected their lives . The planned increase is likely push petrol prices up to around 145p a litre, with diesel rising to 150p. Those polled were asked what would be . the effect of such prices, with 63per cent saying they would cut back on . car use, 18per cent would cut back on grocery shopping and 23per cent . would abandon or delay the purchase of furniture, home improvements or . luxury items. AA president Edmund King said: 'Pump . prices that many people can't afford means lost high street spending, . higher transport costs, rising inflation, lost tax from lower fuel . sales, lost tax from businesses going bust, lost tax from workers losing . their jobs and a bigger unemployment benefit bill. 'A hike in fuel costs at the start of the holiday season will backfire as many people are already cutting back.' There were hopes that George Osborne would repeat his U-turn during the Autumn budget in which he abandoned a planned rise in fuel duty in January . Driving groups had hoped for a repeat of the . Autumn Statement in November when Mr Osborne pulled a U-turn and axed a . planned hike this January. He also lowered the original duty rise to the 3.02p figure from 5p. Over 90 per cent of businesses and . motorists think the Government should cut fuel duty in the Budget, . according to a poll by MoneySupermarket. In the same poll, over 40 per cent . believed prices are far too high and another 38 per cent believe cutting . the fuel price would help the economy grow. It comes as diesel and unleaded . prices hover around all-time highs. On Friday, average diesel prices . have hit 145.45p a litre, with unleaded at 138.5p. At present, 57.95p is taken in fuel . duty for every litre bought on diesel and unleaded. VAT adds another 20 . per cent - around 24p at current prices. As the price of fuel in the UK continues to grow there are fears that hauliers may look at repeating fuel protests seen in September 2000. Much of the country's motorway network was brought to a grinding halt as lorry drivers reduced their speeds to 5mph rolling blockades. That year the price of petrol was 76.9p a litre. Top agenda: Many households will be hoping for some respite at the forecourts . According to the Centre for Economic Business Research (CEBR), even a cut of 2.5p per litre of petrol would boost the economy, creating 180,000 jobs in just five years. The CEBR said that it is clear fuel duty has a very significant impact on business and consumer finances and even a modest reduction could support economic growth and give an important psychological boost to financially squeezed households. Its calculations show that these benefits could be reaped without hurting the public purse. These thoughts are echoed by campaign groups who are heaping pressure on the Chancellor to stop the planned hike. Members of FairFuelUK, which is backed by the RAC and freight organisations, said that an even bolder cut, by 5p to a litre of fuel, would cost the Exchequer around £1billion but would be offset by intangible benefits of increased confidence and would add a further 30,000 jobs. It also said that a 2.5p cut would boost GDP by 0.33 per cent. Quentin Willson, spokesman for FairFuelUK, said: 'It is very frustrating that so many politicians are talking about every tax – the mansion tax, personal thresholds, VAT, the 50p rate – and so few are talking about the one tax that is right at the top of the agenda for families and businesses.' He added that the planned hike in fuel taxes would be 'cruel and brutal' and claimed the Government was trying to ‘duck the central point’ by blaming price increases at the forecourt to volatile oil prices given the Treasury takes almost 82p in tax on every pound spent on fuel. The campaign group has urged supporters to contact their MP by e-mail to put pressure on the Treasury for a 'cut in fuel duty' not just another freeze. Jakes de Kock, Fuelcard Company’s marketing director, claimed not a rise in fuel duty could mean the end for many hauliers. He said: 'This level of taxation simply cannot be maintained by the UK’s hauliers who have already implemented as many fuel-efficient practices as possible yet are still being financially squeezed to the point of no return. 'Ministers want economic growth, yet they’re shackling the fleet industry through unsustainable taxation. This is forcing businesses to turn down work because the high cost of fuel means there is no profit to be made.' The influential Ernst & Young Item Club says that the Chancellor has 'plenty of wiggle room’ to ease the pain on motorist tomorrow . Its senior advisor, Andrew Goodwin, said it would be 'an open goal' for Osborne in tomorrow's Budget. The report predicts that the Chancellor will have around £7billion to play with on Wednesday thanks to lower than expected borrowing. Many motorists will have their fingers crossed that Osborne will deliver at least some respite for cash-strapped households and businesses.","Petrol to rise to 145p a litre from August .

Her mother immediately rang the 30-year-old on her mobile phone - and it was answered by a police officer at the scene. Heartbreak: Cheryl Jones, 49, was left to discover that her daughter Karla was dead on Facebook . Shocked Cheryl, of Tredegar, South Wales, almost collapsed when the police officer told her: “Sorry but an officer will be around to see you shortly.' Police called an hour later to confirm the tragic news that Karla had died three hours earlier less than a mile from her mother's home. Senior police chiefs were today investigating a formal complaint from Cheryl and her MP over the delay. Mother-of-three Cheryl said: 'My daughter was found dead and I only found out through Facebook. 'I was Karla’s mother, her next of kin, the police should have come to see me straight away.' Message: The words: 'She's died. RIP Karla.' were written on the social networking website .

A man who put his cat in a tumble drier and posted the footage on YouTube has been jailed. Allan Staughton, 23, of Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a cat at an earlier hearing. Today he was jailed for 56 days by Huntingdon magistrates, the RSPCA said. He was also banned from keeping animals for life. Staughton told RSPCA inspectors that he thought the incident was funny when first questioned about it. Vet Helen Dennis told magistrates that the cat, named Princess, would have been severely traumatised by the ordeal and it would have been akin to a form of torture for her. Princess suffered a broken tooth and a tongue injury in the incident at Staughton’s home, the charity said. Magistrates saw film of the cat being put into the machine as Staughton said it was going for 'a tumble'. The machine was turned on with the cat spinning inside for 12 seconds before Staughton opened the door. The cat was on its back in the bottom of the machine. Staughton then spun it twice more. The court heard that Staughton suffers from attention deficit disorder. The cat had belonged to Staughton's partner of four-and-a-half years. The relationship broke down over the incident. A spokesman for the RSPCA said: 'We have now found a loving new home for Princess.' Staughton laughed as the cat, called Princess, was shoved in the tumble dryer and injured in the terrifying ordeal . Staughton trapped his girlfriend's terrified cat in the tumble dryer and put it through three spin cycles, because he thought it was funny . The RSPCA were alerted to the online . video entitled 'You must see this - it will crack you up' and launched a . man hunt for Staughton, who posted the sickening film under the alias . Nitroazza - even asking viewers to rate it. The lout broke down in tears during a previous magistrates' court hearing, last month, after his internet anonymity was unmasked. During that hearing, Robert Starr, prosecuting for the RSPCA, told the court: 'The cat would have been very . terrified and would have suffered mental and physical effects caused by . the cat having no method of escape. Princess suffered a broken tooth and a tongue injury in the ordeal and has now been rehomed . Sick Staughton admitted animal cruelty at Huntingdon Magistrates' Court . 'The . reason why Princess didn't move when the door was opened is because the . incident would have left the cat in sheer terror, unbalanced and . disorientated. 'It left the cat without any of its senses that you would attribute to a cat. 'This would have been compounded by the fact that it had no means of escape.' Mr Starr said a vet examined the cat on July 6 and said it would have been disoriented and traumatised by its experience. The prosecutor added that when Staughton was interviewed he had thought the incident was 'funny'. He added: 'He accepted it was a disgusting thing to do.' The RSPCA tracked down Staughton outside a pub in Godmanchester, Cambridgeshire, following the incident on June 14. The RSPCA were alerted to the online video entitled 'You must see this - it will crack you up' and launched a man hunt for Staughton . After the incident Staughton's relationship broke down with the mother of his child and the owner of Princess .

Kevin Warboys, mitigating, told the previous court hearing: 'Mr Staughton suffers from conduct disorder which he says means ""I just do things without thinking"".

A Korean War pilot who crash landed his plane to help a dying comrade is due to return to the battleground that claimed his friend. Thomas Hudner crash landed his own plane during the dark days of 1950 when the US was locked in a bitter war with North Korea and China. His friend Jesse Brown's plane had been damaged while flying a mission near the Jangjin Reservoir - known as the Chosin Reservoir by Americans - in the northeast of North Korea. Fallen comrade: When Jesse Brown (left) crashed his plane in North Korea, his friend Thomas Hudner (right) put down behind enemy lines to help his friend . Combat: The F4 Corsair pilots flew missions throughout the Korean War, pictured here over aircraft carrier USS Boxer . When Brown crashed, Hudner risked his own life and crash landed nearby with the intention of pulling Brown from the wreckage. But Brown, who was the first African-American pilot, was trapped and Hudner was unable to free him. When a Marine helicopter . landed to rescue the pair, Hudner had to make the agonising decision to . leave Brown. Hudner promised Brown, who was mortally wounded, he would return for him. Both men were in their early 20s but . lived a world apart. Hudner was the white son of a successful grocery . store owner in Massachusetts, while Brown's father was a Mississippi . sharecropper. Hero: Retired US Navy Capt Thomas Hudner has returned to the scene of his terrifying ordeal behind enemy lines . Momentous occasion: Capt Hudner packs his bag in preparation for his return to North Korea . Honour: Upon returning from the front line, Capt Hudner (right) was awarded a Medal of Honor by President Truman . In an interview with CNN, Hudner said: 'The Marine pilot pulled me aside and said dusk was approaching and he couldn't fly the helicopter in the dark and the mountainous terrain, so he had to leave.' The pair were well behind enemy lines and even if Hudner had managed to escape the clutches of the Chinese, it is unlikely he would have been able to survive the harsh winter. 'I told Jesse that we had to get some more equipment because we couldn't get him out with what we had. I don't know if he even heard me, I'm afraid by this time he had passed.' Brutal: A frostbitten casualties of the First Marine Division and Seventh Infantry Divsion wait for evacuation by plane . The Korean War broke out in June 1950 when communist North Korea attacked its southern neighbour. United Nations forces, made up primarily of US troops, fought on the side of South Korea. China fought with North Korea. Choisin . Reservoir was the scene of a harrowing battle waged during the brutal . Korean winter, with frostbite a common injury. Arms and medical supplies . also froze in subzero temperatures. Of the 15,000 US troops involved, more than 3,000 died during the 17-day struggle. But . the Chinese forces paid a much greater price trying to force the allied . troops from their positions -- some 60,000 replacements were required . to replace men lost to firepower and cold. Front: Tanks of the First Marine Division destined for action are loaded on to flatcars at Munsan in Korea . An estimated 35,000 Chinese troops lost their lives during the conflict. Some 8,000 US soldiers are still missing in action. Now, in a rare show of cooperation . with a country it often calls the imperialistic enemy, North Korea has . given permission for Hudner to return to Chosin Reservoir. Hudner told CNN he did not think the trip would ever happen. 'We're . very grateful to him (leader Kim Jong Un) and to the North Korean . government that after all these years we've been given permission to . look for Jesse's airplane,' he said. He puts the chances of finding Brown's remains or his aircraft at 50-50, but said it was important. And he believed severely strained US-North Korean relations could even get a boost. Big guns: USS USS Saint Paul fires from her eight inch guns as she steams out of Changjin harbor after an inshore firing run . 'Of course, that olive branch has to be extended and accepted by both sides,' said Hudner. 'There's an important factor that not many people talk about, but in World War II the Japanese and the Germans were our bitter enemies and now they're some of our closest friends.' An armistice agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty has never been signed, meaning the two Koreas are still technically at war. The 60th anniversary of the end of the war is just one week away and Pyongyang has planned a military parade and mass celebrations on what it calls 'Victory Day'. The group is not planning on attending the commemoration. Brown's widow and daughter, who was just a toddler when he died, are hopeful he will be found and eventually brought back home.","Retired US Navy captain is hoping to find fallen comrade's plane during visit .

During the past two years the Brit Award-winning pop star has, along with a group of like-minded female musicians, been working with schools around the country, teaching teenage girls to play instruments and write songs in an effort to bolster their self-esteem and emotional health in the process. The first stage of the project culminated in a show featuring the girls and Kate at the Queen Elizabeth Halls in London last December. During workshops, teenagers are encouraged to write about anything that is important to them and then sing their own words to music they play along with Kate and her colleagues. The girl I have just watched on video was singing about being bullied for being a redhead. Though Kate sports raven-black hair with white streaks, she is a natural redhead, so feels a particular empathy for the youngster’s situation. And she is acutely aware, from personal experience, of how tough life can be for young girls. She was bullied at school and on one occasion a group of girls locked her in a cupboard for an hour. It was the lowest point of a year of ‘bitchy little events’. Kate says: ‘That’s really sad, isn’t it? I was 16 at that point. Girls – kids – can be mean. It was a power thing. It was done jokily, like it wasn’t a big deal, while I was locked in there just crying.’ By 19 she was thrust into stardom, with a No 1 platinum-selling album and a Brit award. But the subsequent pressures of a relentless tour schedule – and comments she endured about her weight  and general appearance – brought on  a breakdown. She also battled obsessive compulsive disorder and retreated from the spotlight to deal with it. She says: ‘I think that being creative, writing music for example, is the healthiest way to deal with your problems.  If you get out how you feel, you’ve achieved something and you can feel proud of yourself.’ Kate, now 25, uses the classes – the . lyric sessions especially – as a way of addressing the girls’ struggles . with their anxieties without sitting down and asking them to talk about . their problems. Rock role model: Kate at a school helping a young girl during one of her workshops at her Rock 'n' Roll for Girls club . She says: ‘They do open up, they do want to tell you what’s bothering them. You get through the tears and then you have a really fun lesson.’ The girls really do lay their emotions out on the table, says Kate, often without realising. ‘One of them got really upset during a songwriting exercise about what makes you happy, what makes  you sad and so on. 'She said, “I get really sad when someone ignores you and you don’t know what you’ve done but they just keep ignoring you.” Then she added, “I hate it when my mum ignores me.” I felt that was so awful.’ The project is proving especially powerful at a time when the emotional health and wellbeing of teenage girls is of increasing concern. The think-tank Demos recently published a report into the self-esteem of  UK girls which found that anxiety and unhappiness among teens had risen considerably in recent years. Girls are more anxious than boys about their appearances and careers, and a celebrity culture that places a premium on good looks. The report said that teenage years  see a . concentration of behavioural problems. At the heart of the growing . sense of unease about teenage wellbeing is plummeting levels of . self-esteem. Bullied: Kate Nash as a young girl at school . The Government too has indicated  that it is concerned about adolescent girls in particular and the way that wider culture has an impact on their sense of self and emotional health. UK teenage pregnancy rates are the highest in Europe, teenage girls are  the group at most risk of domestic violence and the Department of Health reported last summer that British girls are also the biggest binge-drinkers in Europe. Meanwhile, Ofsted has criticised schools for failing to help girls escape career stereotypes. One of the Demos report’s recommendations is that girls should be encouraged to build positive relationships  with peers and that the negative effects of peer pressure should be eased by promoting and protecting extracurricular activities. Kate has seen how supportive teenagers can be. ‘Girls have a reputation  for bitchiness, but in a safe environment that isn’t the case.’ Music broke down social barriers, she says. ‘Some were geeks, others were musical theatre  kids. They’d always applaud each other and when someone got upset, they’d  all help out.’ Lucie Russell, director of policy and campaigns at Young Minds, a charity supporting young people’s mental health, says that low self-esteem during adolescence doesn’t automatically lead to  long-term mental health problems but it is undeniably a risk factor. ‘We’re all  on a continuum from feeling pretty good,  to not so good, right through to not  being able to cope. ‘It is especially pronounced in young people who are on an emotional  rollercoaster with hormones and all  the transition that happens with growing up. ‘If you’ve got low self-esteem, you  are going to find it harder to cope. What’s really important is building young people’s emotional resilience, and that’s what Kate is doing.’ While there has always been a lot of competition between girls, it’s been  made worse by online technology and how it’s abused. Russell says: ‘Take cyber-bullying  and things like Facebook hate groups. Research is showing it is happening more with girls than boys. ‘Doing something wholesome like music, away from all the online devices, is great.’ The Rock ’n’ Roll For Girls Club is the kind of thing that schools should be doing more of, she says. ‘There’s an unrelenting focus on academia and getting results, but schools should also be about developing character and resilience.’ It’s certainly something that Kate  feels would have been invaluable when she was dealing with her emotional problems. She is planning to extend the workshops to other schools and release an After School Club album through her own record label. ‘It’s all about building self-confidence,’ says Kate. ‘The class is a safe environment where girls aren’t judged. ‘Music is about opinion and nobody’s right or wrong. Writing a song is like being in a movie – it makes you feel as if something is happening. ‘If more girls feel entitled to do  that, they’ll be having fun in healthy, positive ways.’","Singer Kate Nash was bullied in school over her red hair as a teenager .

Horrific: A care worker and her husband hid years of abuse by 'brainwashing' their children into thinking their punishments were 'horseplay' (file picture) A care-home worker and her husband who subjected their children to years of horrific abuse were facing jail yesterday after being convicted of cruelty. The couple hid their crimes for years by lying to social services and ‘brainwashing’ their daughter and two sons into believing their sadistic punishments were ‘horseplay’, a court heard. Details of their shocking attacks included: . ■ Pressing red-hot spoons against their children’s skin and holding knives to their necks; . ■ Beating them with belt buckles and metal coat-hangers; . ■ Making their daughter sleep in a tent for three weeks in freezing conditions after wetting her bed; and . ■ Stabbing her with a dirty needle and telling her she would die of Aids. Following a week-long trial the parents, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of four counts of child cruelty, having previously admitted five similar offences. They will be sentenced next year, and could face a maximum prison sentence of ten years. Judge Pamela Badley said: ‘This is a very distressing case, and one where your heart went out to the children whose bitterness while giving evidence was quite palpable. The children have clearly been brainwashed and each  parent seemed to have their own agenda, blaming each other and saying they were manipulated by the other into carrying out the abuse. ‘The defendants are clearly going to be facing custodial sentences.’ Preston Crown Court heard how the father would punch his children in the groin and hold their heads underwater. Their mother, a care-home worker, boasted to a friend that she headbutted the children and once hit them so hard that she burst a blood vessel in her hand. However, despite complaints to social services and the children’s school by a family friend ‘every week’, the youngsters remained in their parents’ care in Chorley, Lancashire, until the eldest approached the police. The friend told the jury that her  concerns were dismissed as ‘malicious’.  ‘The children begged me to ring  social services but my complaints  were dismissed,’ she said. ‘I’ve lost count of the amount of times I rang.’  However, Ann Pennell of Lancashire County Council said it investigated every complaint of abuse. Hearing: The pair were convicted of four counts of child cruelty at Preston Crown Court (pictured) ‘All referrals that we receive, including those in this case, are investigated  and acted upon accordingly,’ she stressed. The couple’s younger son said he had been driven to the brink of suicide by his treatment. ‘I was in constant fear,’ he said. ‘It got to the point where I would sit in  the kitchen and think, “If I grab hold of a knife and ram it in my heart it will all be over”.’ The children were originally placed into foster care in 1997. Their parents separated shortly afterwards, and their father started a new relationship. However, in 2001, after the death of their foster parent, they were returned to the care of their father and his  new wife. In 2003 their father divorced  and resumed his relationship with  the children’s mother, and went on to marry her. In 2004, care orders were made for all three children, but they remained with their parents. The abuse eventually came to light  in March 2010, after the eldest child complained to the police. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","The Chorley, Lancashire, couple, who cannot be named for legal reasons, subjected their children to years of abuse but convinced them that their sadistic punishments were 'horseplay'

In need: Firefighters were called to the Middleton family home after Lupo, pictured here with Kate, got his head stuck in a gate . As the Duchess of Cambridge waited patiently for the first signs of the arrival of her baby tonight there was drama at her family home, Bucklebury Manor. Firefighters using blue lights rushed through the lanes of the west Berkshire village to the isolated manor house after a 999 call to say that a pet dog on the estate was trapped with its head in a gate. Fire crews from nearby Newbury and an animal rescue unit from Reading were requested urgently in a frantic call from the Middleton family's £2 million home. The call was made to the headquarters of the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service in Reading at 5.47pm and five firefighters were immediately despatched from Newbury, eight miles away. There were unconfirmed reports that the distraught dog was Kate Middleton's pet cocker spaniel Lupo, although firefighters were unable to confirm whether he was the animal involved. A photographer, waiting for a glimpse of the Duchess leaving home on her way to hospital for the Royal birth, revealed that he heard someone shouting a name which sounded like 'Lupo' and asking the animal to come to heel. 'Soon after a heard a high-pitched scream which sounded like a dog is distress. I presume that was when they were pulling the poor animal out from between the bars of the gate,' said photographer Greg Blatchford. It was not clear whether the Duke and Duchess had taken Lupo to Bucklebury Manor so that he could be looked after by family members while they were away from home during the birth. A spokesman for the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that the brigade had been called to Bucklebury Manor shortly before 6pm tonight. 'We were called to an animal rescue. The special unit from Reading was despatched along with an appliance from the nearest station, Newbury,' said the spokesman. Much loved: Prince William with Lupo at the Audi .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 20 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:43 EST, 21 July 2013 . When a loved one needs help, perhaps during illness or long-term incapacity, stepping in to help is an instinct. Six million Britons are carers to an adult, and every day a further 6,000 take on that huge responsibility. But where do carers find the help and advice they need when the often complex network of health and welfare services can be daunting? To support them, the British Medical Association has released a Carer’s Manual. Here, in the first of three extracts from it, we explore the initial steps to becoming a carer... Providing a helping hand: Six million Britons are carers to an adult, often a family member who suffers from a long-term health problem . MAKE CARING A CHOICE . If your partner or parent  needs care, your role as carer may develop gradually and unconsciously – but taking on the commitment ought to be an  active decision. Talk it over with family members and the person’s doctor. Consider how it will affect you and others in your household. It  is important to discuss the situation with your family and make a decision together. You must consult the person needing care, too; their approval will make your role in looking after them easier. KNOW YOUR RIGHTS . It can be difficult to care for someone while also holding down a job, but most employees have statutory rights, including the right to request flexible working hours and unpaid leave in emergencies. Your employer may offer you a sabbatical or part-time hours. Anyone being cared for is entitled to a needs assessment (also called a community care assessment) to analyse their abilities and make sure they are safe. To arrange this, contact social services or the person’s GP. Helping hand: As thousands daily take on the job as a carer for an ill family member or relative, a manual has been released to help them get of the ground . MAKE HOME SAFE . Most people needing care prefer to stay in their own home and familiar surroundings. An occupational therapist can advise how to make the environment safe and adapt the home. Caring for someone from a distance is difficult but can be done – try to create an organised pattern of care that can be shared with other people. A telecare alarm system, which uses sensors around the home that will alert a call centre if the person has a fall, can reduce worry if someone lives alone. Only move somebody in with you when you have fully thought through how well you get on, how your privacy will change and how much it will alter your lives. CHANGED RELATIONSHIPS . The role reversal of caring for a frail parent can be distressing for both parties. Similarly, becoming your partner’s carer will change your relationship. It is normal to feel not just sad but angry and resentful because your future may not be the one you planned.Caring for a friend or neighbour to whom you are less close can also feel awkward, especially if personal care is necessary. The most important thing in all scenarios is to find others to help, such as family members or social services. Being uncomfortable can lead to resentment and harm the relationship. There are support groups you can join.  Try Carer’s UK (carersuk.org, 0808 808 7777), Crossroads Care (crossroadscaring.com, 0151 343 1960), and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers (carers.org,  0844 800 4361). Local councils also run support groups. You are not alone: Finding a care assistant can relieve some of the burden from a family member and can give day-to-day practical help and advice . LOOK AFTER NO 1, TOO . With the focus on someone else’s health, it is easy to forget your own. But carers are much more likely to suffer ill health than other people, statistics show. However short of time you feel,  it is important you attend all your own medical appointments and keep track of your health. Make sure you eat properly and that you get enough sleep. Exercise can be combined with caring – find out about mobility scooters or wheelchairs if the person you’re caring for can’t walk far. Yoga and chair or floor exercises could suit you both and be done together at home. Make sure you don’t become socially isolated. Set up a rota of people to visit you regularly and talk about your day and situation so friends understand better. If you’re tired, tearful, easily irritated and find it hard to concentrate, it may be time to speak to your GP about referral to a counsellor. PLAN EACH DAY . Planning your day can make you feel more in control. Prioritise tasks and delegate those you can. Being overtired is a major contributor to stress, so build in rest time for yourself. Give yourself a treat each week and do small enjoyable things daily, such as taking a long bath, listening to a favourite radio programme or seeing a friend. None of this is selfish; by tending to your own needs you will feel more positive and energetic and be able to offer better care. FIND A HELPING HAND . A care assistant can give day-to-day practical help, such as washing and dressing, making meals and helping the person to the toilet. They can visit twice a day, all day or overnight, or even move in full-time. Find a care assistant through your local social services department, which will recommend agencies. You may be able to get funding for a care assistant from your local authority, based on the community care assessment. You may also be entitled to financial help with your own costs, such as travel or housing, if you spend more than 35 hours a week caring for another adult who receives disability benefits. Even if you have help, you will occasionally need a complete break from caring. That means either getting someone to take over full-time care or arranging a residential home. There is also day centre care, enabling you to have days away, and respite holidays with specialist organisations. Contact Age UK (ageuk.org.uk, 0800 169 6565) or advice line Carers Direct (0808 808 0202) to find a local service. The British Medical Association Carer’s Manual is published by DK, priced £14.99.

A pensioner had a shock when he opened up his wheelie bin and spotted the face of a baby badger staring back at him. Alan Davis, 67, had been tidying up his garden and was about to put bags of rubbish in the dustbin when he spotted the animal. He believes the badger fell into the bin and became trapped after climbing along a nearby wall and nosing the lid open. Surprise: Alan Davis was shocked to find a badger in his wheelie bin when he went to put out some rubbish . After taking some pictures of their unusual visitor, Mr Davis and his wife Joyce carefully tipped up the bin and released the badger into their garden, which borders a field in Sutton Poyntz, Dorset. He said: 'I was tidying up the garden and went to throw some bags out and saw this head popping up, looking at me. 'It's definitely not what I expected to see. It was a baby one, and I think it must have gone in there to scavenge for food. 'They go down the side of the house, which is a badger run, a sort of road for them. 'They always go the same way, I think it's something they pass on through the generations. 'But there is some building work on the opposite side of the road and a fence was put up the day before we found the badger. 'It's blocking their usual path so I wonder if it got confused and ended up back in our garden. It's very strange but it was quite sweet really. Freedom: The young badger was gently tipped out of the bin into the couple's garden, which backs onto Dorset fields . 'We get a lot of wildlife here, and we always have foxes, badgers and deer running around the garden, which is lovely, it's like a nature reserve.' The couple have lived at the house for five years and said it is the first time wildlife has ended up in their bin. Joyce added: 'Alan called me when he found the badger and said he had found something interesting. 'I couldn't believe it when he told me.' Badger setts are most commonly found in areas near woodland and shelter, and badgers are known to walk the same routes for years. They mainly feed off earthworms but will eat whatever is available including fruit, insects and cereal.","Alan Davis, 67, had gone to put rubbish in a bin when he found the badger .

A learner driver has received a ticking off from a 999 operator after he called to say he had received a ticking off from his driving instructor. The unnamed man contacted West Midlands Police when his lesson was terminated after he 'gave her attitude' for turning up 10 minutes late. He told them that he needed to complain to someone but his call has been branded as 'ridiculous' and a waste of time and resources. They have released audio of the phone call made last Thursday at 8am to highlight how time-wasting calls to 999 can cost lives. Scroll down to listen to the audio . Complaint: A learner driver dialled 999 to complain after his driving instructor terminated their lesson because he was 'giving her attitude' for being late (stock image) The learner driver, who has not been named by West Midlands Police, can be heard telling the operator: 'Sorry, it's silly, but I've got an emergency'. He then continues speaking in a rush, saying: 'The person who’s supposed to be teaching . me came late and now she’s asking me to get out of her car. She’s . saying I’m giving her attitude. Can you please come over?' The operator then asks the man to slow down and explain what has happened. He tells the operator: 'I know it's not an emergency but she's telling me I'm giving her attitude and to get out of her car. I need someone to complain to.' The operator calmly explains that the problem isn't one for the police and the man needs to contact the driving instructor's company or the DVLA. When the learner driver persists, the operator tells him he must get out of the instructors car if he has been told to do so and warned trivial matters don’t qualify as 999 emergencies. The call is the latest in a series of nuisance calls to West Midlands police. Warning: Police described the 999 call as 'ridiculous' and warned that time wasting phone calls can lead to delays in answering real emergencies . Officers say other ‘emergencies’ they have been called to in recent weeks include one person who had a blocked sink plug in a hotel room and someone who had forgot their computer password. West Midlands Police Contact Centre Chief Inspector Sally Holmes said: 'We regularly receive calls on the 9s about lost property, people asking for directions and revellers who’ve been denied entry to nightclubs. 'It’s astonishing listening to them but they hide a serious truth. Each call often takes minutes to deal with as staff have to clarify the situation - it might not sound like much but, if someone is trying to get through to report a genuine life or death emergency, then a minute is a very long time to wait. 'I cannot stress enough the 999 number is for emergencies only. This is defined as a crime in progress, if someone suspected of a crime is nearby, when there is danger to life or when violence is being used or threatened. To contact police for any other reason, call 101.' West Midlands Police said they get more than 1,500 calls to their 999 number each day and staff have to deal with each one professionally. Other police forces blighted by nonsense emergency calls include South Yorkshire Police, who told of a man calling who had lost his trainers, a child refusing to go to bed and people having problems watching films on Sky TV. In parts of the country forces are taking up to 30 per cent longer than two years ago to react to 999 calls a recent investigation has revealed.","West Midlands Police have branded the call as 'ridiculous' and 'time wasting'

Calvin Klein's on-off toyboy boyfriend and former porn star was involved in a bloody fist fight at an exclusive Hamptons nightclub at the weekend, it was alleged today. Nick Gruber is accused of punching a man in the face in the early hours of Sunday morning in SL East in Southhampton before fleeing the scene. Eye witnesses said his victim's face was covered in blood from a cut above his eyebrow and he had to be taken away in an ambulance. Employees of the club were said to have been mopping up blood from the floor. Back on? More than two years after their high-profile split, it seems Calvin Klein, 70, and Nick Gruber, a 23-year-old former porn star and model, have reconciled (pictured in 2011) Around 20 police officers were called to the club and began a frenzied search for Gruber around the areas, sources told the New York Post's Page Six. The model began his night at restaurant Sienna . and Pink elephant, where guests included Bobby Flay. He then moved on to . SL East which is where he got into the alleged brawl. Things moved outside after . security removed them from the club and Gruber is alleged to have thrown . a security guard to the ground before fleeing.

Around 20 police officers started a full-scale . manhunt using [flashlights] to search through the bushes.' But the former porn star's spokesperson said he was acting in self defense and hasn't been arrested. 'The guy pushed him first, then there . was a bit more pushing. Nick punched him out of self-defense, and the . guy suffered a cut above his eye. Nick is fine,' Matt Rich said. 'Nick . did not flee the scene, the club security told him to leave.

Unfortunately, when you are a well-known face, people . target you for the wrong reasons.' This is not the first time the 23-year-old has been in trouble with the law. Gruber was arrested last April for . attacking his friend Calvin Swint after they returned to Gruber’s West . Village penthouse apartment in New York following a night of partying. When officers arrived at the . penthouse shortly before 5am, they saw Gruber hide something down his . pants before he tried to avoid getting handcuffed by waving his hands in . the air.

Allegations: Cheick Tiote appeared at Newcastle Crown Court today charged with using a false Belgian licence . Newcastle United midfielder Cheick Tiote will contest charges that he used a fake Belgian driving licence, a court heard today. Tiote, 27, is accused of five offences, including using a false document as a form of ID 'to establish personal information' about himself in December. The Ivory Coast international is also charged with committing fraud by using the allegedly false document to get a UK licence, also in December. In addition, he is accused of making a false statement to obtain insurance in September 2011 by allegedly claiming that he held a full driving licence without endorsements. He is further charged with driving his Chevrolet, which bears the personalised licence plate T10 TEV, in Newcastle in February without a licence or insurance. The French-speaking player wore jeans, a dark high-collared jacket and heavily embellished shoes for his brief appearance at Newcastle Crown Court today. His barrister Robert Adams told the Recorder of Newcastle James Goss QC that he will need a French interpreter when the trial takes place on October 28. Mark Giuliani, prosecuting, said: 'I understand that the matter will be contested and that a trial date in October would be convenient to the parties.' The trial is expected to last three days. Tiote, who has not entered pleas, will do so at a hearing on September 6. He was granted bail in the meantime. Born in Ivory Coast, he moved to Belgian club Anderlecht in 2005.

Details of the tragedy which happened on the B5441 near Connah’s Key on last month emerged as chicken factory worker Masiulis was jailed for five and a half years after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving. He was also banned from the roads for six years. In a statement Miss Kairyte's fiance Audrius Ubartas said he 'lost the love of his life.' and told how they were planning to wed next year and start a family. The couple met her over the internet when he was living in Lithuania and she was already settled in the UK.

He said: 'We were saving for a car and starting to save for a wedding next year because we wanted to start a family together. She would constantly talk about how she wanted to be a mum and how she dreamed of having a family. 'She was such a warm person and her death has turned my life upside down and caused me great grief.

Fatal accidents among young drivers could be more than halved by putting restrictions on their licences, a report by the RAC Foundation says today. Young people aged 15 to 24 are four times more likely to die in a road crash than from drug, alcohol, gun and knife-crime combined, says the RAC. One in five young drivers (17 to 24-year-olds) will have an accident within six months of passing their test and 1,552 young drivers were killed or seriously injured on Britain’s roads in 2011 – more than four deaths per day. Metropolitan Police officers at the scene of an accident in the Elephant and Castle, London. Young drivers are more likely to die in an accident than from drugs, alcohol and crime combined . Novice young drivers are at particular risk because of their lack of experience and also the ‘biological and behavioural characteristics of youth’. Bringing in a graduated licensing system - including restrictions on night-time driving and the number of passengers - would allow young drivers to gain invaluable experience in safer circumstances. Research by the RAC Foundation of graduated licensing schemes in other countries shows fatal collisions for this age group falling by up to 60 per cent and overall casualties being cut by up to 32 per cent, depending on the range of measures implemented. Traffic chaos in Kensington: Young drivers are at particular risk because of their lack of experience and also the 'biological and behavioural characteristics of youth' Young drivers make up  a quarter (25 per cent) of all those drivers killed or seriously injured on the roads annually. Yet  they account for 1 in 12 (8 per cent) of licence holders. They also drive less than older licence holders. Yet the evidence shows that risk reduces quickly as experience is gained. Studies have found that the first 1,000 miles of driving may be the most important in terms of reducing collision risk. The RAC Foundation study – Young Driver Safety: Solutions to an Age-Old Problem, authored by Foundation staff members Elizabeth Box and Ivo Wengraf - looked at evidence from several countries with graduated licensing including America, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. According . to RAC analysis of 2009 mortality data from England, Scotland, Ireland and . Wales for 15 to 24 year olds there were: . ●  94.1 road traffic accident deaths for every one assault by . firearm death . ●  21.3 road traffic deaths for every one assault by sharp or blunt object . death . ●  4.2 road traffic deaths per one poisoning from alcohol or drugs death. And there were 2.1 road traffic deaths for this age group per violent . assault and hanging deaths combined. The RAC Foundation is calling for : . ●  A  one-year minimum learning period during which they would need to have experience of driving in a variety of circumstances: e.g. during the winter, in darkness . ●  A one-year post-test period during which there are passenger restrictions and conditions for late-night driving . ●  A  final full licence with a two year probationary period (which currently exists and during which if a driver receives six penalty points they have to take a retest). The Foundation also backs a reduction in the drink-drive limit for all drivers to a maximum blood alcohol content of 50mg/100ml, down from the existing 80mg/100ml. It says: ’This would be of greatest safety benefit to younger drivers, with knock-on benefits for the rest of the driving population.’ The RAC Foundation research is published as the Government prepares in the Autumn to publish a consultation on young driver safety. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘Young people are four times more likely to die in a road accident than as a result of drink or drugs. 'Yet, as a society we seem to turn a blind eye to the carnage. If this was any other area of public health there would be an outcry.’ He said: ‘Circumstances conspire against young drivers. Their youth and lack of experience create a deadly mix which means one in five will have an accident within the first six months of passing their test. The professor added: ‘Our research shows that putting certain restrictions on young drivers allows them to rapidly build up live-saving experience in the safest possible way. Putting a firm number on casualty reduction is hard because of the pick and mix approach to graduate licensing. 'But the evidence suggests that a full package of measures could reduce fatalities by anything up to 60 per cent. ‘Some will complain that these proposals are paternalistic and limit people’s freedom. This is nonsense. We should all have an interest in preserving young drivers’ lives rather than exposing them to undue risk at the stage of their driving careers where they are most vulnerable. This is about ensuring their long term safety and mobility. Not curtailing it.' The Northern Ireland Assembly is due to bring in legislation in the autumn to improve a graduated licensing scheme which is already in place.","Young drivers more likely to die in road crash than from drugs or crime .

Highland Buses could even become an unlikely best-seller - today there were only two copies left for sale on Amazon. John, from Milngavie, East Dunbartonshire, said: 'It’s all about nostalgia. It’s not just about buses, it’s about the rural scenery and the signs of the times. 'None of the pictures were taken at bus stations or stances but all over the Highlands in rural sightings. 'I just did it for fun. I love travelling around and talking to people. It’s an unusual topic for a book. The photographs are unique, nobody else was doing it at the time.' Mr Sinclair practised medicine in Stornoway and other towns across the north of Scotland before becoming a surgeon based in Glasgow. His obsession with buses began with his 17-mile journey to and from school every day and in 1961 he bought his first 35mm camera with colour slides.

Changes: John says he has seen the way in which the bus service operates change dramatically in his time photographing them . His family had relatives in Inverness and as he grew older, John made numerous trips to the Highlands where his unusual hobby took hold. He said: 'I hitchhiked everywhere to get there as I didn’t have a car. 'You just stood and smiled and people stopped in those days. I occasionally travelled by bus but only short distances because I couldn’t afford it. 'I loved the scenery and the idea of narrow rural roads in the Highlands. They weren’t just straightforward A to B bus routes. Buses were part of social life back then. It was a vital form of transport.' After moving to Edinburgh as a medical student in the 1960s, John continued to visit the Highlands at least twice every year. His favourite spot was the nuclear reactor in Dounray, Caithness, where 40 old buses dropped off and picked up staff. John said: 'There were no youth hostels in Thurso so I often stayed in police cells and signed out at six o’clock in the morning. 'You could do that back then because there was nowhere else to stay. There were very elderly buses in Dounray. Line up: Double decker are parked up at a depot in Edinburgh in 1976 . Passion: John moved to Edinburgh to study medicine in the 1960s but kept returning to the Highlands to take more photos . Important: For isolated communities, Highland buses were an important part of social life for many years . Unusual: John said he often stayed in police cells in Thurso because there were no youth hostels . 'Staff actually complained because there were no platform doors and some buses had no heaters which was not good in the winter. '40 buses used to sit outside the plant all day and for a young enthusiast like me it was a fantastic line up. I could wander in freely which you wouldn’t be able to do now.' The buses which John photographed were operated by Highland Omnibuses part of the state-owned Scottish Bus Group that operated services throughout Scotland. The company ran services throughout the Highlands, from Thurso and Wick in the far north through Fort William to Oban in the south, and west to Kyle of Lochalsh and the ferry to Skye. Over the decades he has spent photographing buses, John has noticed a number of changes in the way they are operated. He said: 'Back then there were bus conductors who worked with the driver as a team and it was a much more leisurely way of life. Colourful: The rugged terrian of Birichen in January, 1977 . Special service: Conductors were known to deliver prescriptions for people years ago . Audience: The book was created with book enthusiasts in mind, but John thinks readers have also been struck by the scenery . Success: After receiving positive feed back on Highland Buses, John is working on a follow-up about buses in Skye and the Western Isles . Modern methods: John says conductors now stick to a strict timetable and there is less communication with passengers . Enthusiast: Retired doctor and amateur photographer John Sinclair with his book Highland Buses . 'The conductors and drivers would spend a lot of time chatting with passengers. Some buses were even known to take prescriptions to houses. 'It was part of community life. Now, the schedules are so tight and there are no conductors. Personal contact is lost.' John is still travelling far and wide to take pictures of buses but he admits he rarely uses a bus to get there. Following the success of his book, he is currently working on another which will feature buses in Skye and the Western Isles where he worked for a number of years. John added: 'Highland Buses has been selling really well and people seem to be taking to that nostalgia. 'The book was put together with bus enthusiasts in mind but because of the period and the scenery it has captured a wider audience. 'I still drive all over the country, going around the Highlands and other remote locations to take pictures of buses but sadly there isn’t much variety these days.'","John Sinclair, 72, fell in love with Highland Omnibuses as a schoolboy .

These absolutely astonishing pictures of utterly incompetent parking are made all the more amazing because they come from a single town in the UK. Doncaster may be in the running for being Britain's worst town for selfish, thoughtless and downright inept parking after a Facebook page exposed the South Yorkshire town's driver's nightmarish abuse of spaces, kerbs, roads and even steep slopes. Parking like a t*** in Doncaster invites people in the town to submit pictures of the kind of parking that makes considerate road users slap their forehead in frustration. What were they thinking? This driver has plonked his car across two spaces in a Doncaster car park. It is just one example from a Facebook page shaming poor parking in the town . Off-road: Perhaps this 4x4 owner wanted to test their vehicle's ability to climb slopes? It has been liked more than 7,900 times and has been deluged with pictures of cars taking up two, three and even four parking spaces in car parks, vehicles blocking roads and pavements, motors squeezed into tight spots and cars parked in disabled and parent-only bays outside supermarkets. The group, which has been set up anonymously, simply states: 'Fed up of people and their parking? Send us a pic in a message and it’ll be posted anonymously.' One poster on the group said: 'I commend you on shaming these people who put the love of their car above their respect for other people. 'It is amusing and annoying in equal measure to see what some of these berks deem to be acceptable parking.' Didn't brake in time? This white BMW has two wheels on the kerb, inexplicably . The founder of the group, who doesn't want to be identified, said: 'I started it as a but of a joke really. 'I saw a couple of bad examples and put them up and then people just started sharing their own. 'We went from having 60 people liking our group to 2,000 in one day and it has just kept growing and growing.

Premium Bond holders stand less of a chance of winning a payout after National Savings & Investments announced that it was cutting prize payouts. NS&I will reduce the annual Premium Bond prize fund rate from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent from the start of next month, it revealed this morning. The cut means the odds of each £1 Bond number winning a prize will lengthen to 26,000 to 1 from 24,000 to 1 for the 22million investors who hold them. Big cut: The number of Premium Bond prizes will fall drastically in August after becoming 'too attractive' to savers . The total prize pot this month is £57.1million. In August, this will fall to £49.3million – an almost 14 per cent cut. The total number of prizes will fall by more than 150,000, from 1.9million to 1.75million. There will still be a £1million jackpot, but the number of winners of other prizes will dwindle. The number of £100,000 winners will fall from five this month to three in August, while the £50,000 winners will drop from nine to six and £25,000 from 20 to 11. Jane Platt, Chief Executive of . NS&I, told This is Money: ‘We agonised over the decision to reduce returns on Premium Binds. It's not something we undertook lightly. Less chance: Those with Premium Bonds now have less chance of winning a payout in the annual prize draw . 'Rates across the savings market have fallen over recent . months, resulting in NS&I savings being increasingly attractive, but it's important to note that we have not altered the terms since 2009. 'The cut to the prize fund is 20 basis points but this is far below the cuts that have been made among our private sector competitors. ‘To . ensure we stay within our Net Financing target – and in light of our . framework to  balance  the needs of our savers, taxpayers and the . stability of the broader financial services sector - we now need to . reduce the Premium Bond prize fund rate.’ Instead of paying interest, Premium Bonds are entered into monthly prize draws to win prizes from £25 to £1million. The monthly prize fund is set by calculating one month’s interest on the total value of all eligible Bonds, at the annual prize fund rate. NS&I sets its interest rates and the Bond prize fund rate, it says, to balance the interest of its savers, taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector. It must not make its rates or chances of winning too attractive as this would distort the market for private sector savings providers. It sets a target each year for the total it wants to take in through deposits and Premium Bonds purchases. It has taken the decision to reduce the Premium Bond prize fund rate to stay within its Net Financing range for 2013-14. £1million . 1 . £100,000 . 5 . 3 . £50,000 . 9 . 6 . £25,000 . 20 . 11 . £10,000 . 49 . 30 . £5,000 . 97 . 58 . £1,000 . 1,142 . 789 . £500 . 3,426 . 2.367 . £100 . 33,552 . 11,891 . £50 . 33,552 . 11,891 . £25 . 1,831,461 . 1,724,014 . NS&I said today that Premium Bonds had become ‘too attractive’ in the light of falling savings rates from banks and building societies. In the first quarter of 2013-14 (April-June) NS&I attracted net £1.7billion of Premium Bond sales against a target of net £0, with a range of £2billion either side of this. The inflows show how popular the product has become as savers struggle to find a decent return. Interest rates have fallen over recent months in the savings sector, resulting in NS&I savings being increasingly competitive. Lower value: The prize payouts for the Premium Bonds draw has been cut by NS&I . The reduction in the Premium Bond prize fund rate reflects current lower interest rates across the savings market, NS&I says. Last month, NS&I announced it was reducing the interest rates on its Income Bonds, Direct Saver and Direct ISA with effect from 12 September 2013. Cash Isa, easy-access and fixed-rate savings rates from private sector providers have all fallen in the last 12 months as a direct consequence of the Funding for Lending scheme. This has enabled banks and building societies to tap into cheap money from the Government, rather than rely on savers. NS&I and Premium Bonds are government-backed - and many experts will argue this is yet another attack on savers. Despite the average return dropping from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent, Premium Bonds still represent a good bet versus savings accounts. Premium Bond returns are tax-free so, for 20 per cent taxpayers a 1.3 per cent return on Premium Bonds is equivalent to 1.62 per cent on savings, and for 40 per cent taxpayers the equivalent return rises to 2.16 per cent. Currently, the best buy easy-access account is 1.6 per cent from Coventry Building Society, while the best two-year fix is 2.3 per cent from Kent Reliance. Cash Isas are tax-free - and there are a number of accounts that pay over 1.3 per cent.","NS&I to reduce prize fund rate from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent .

A businessman who raked in more than a £1m a year through a brothel disguised as a five-star licensed massage parlour was jailed for two years today. Ross Lawson, 32, raked in £75,000 every Friday night offering X-rated services at the brothel where his sister Jade was a receptionist. Dozens of prostitutes earned up to £100,000 a year at the sex den in Camden, north London, which was posing as a legitimate health club. Lawson got alcohol and massage . licences from Camden Council for the Steam and Sun Health Club, and kept . up to date with his taxes and National Insurance contributions. Ross Lawson (left) was jailed for two years for running a brothel where his sister was a receptionist . But in fact, he operated an 18-hour-a-day brothel for seven years, offering as many as 27 prostitutes each night in private rooms with pole dancing and X-rated videos. Lawson used the proceeds to pay off £8,000-a-month credit card bills, and to fund his and his family’s lavish lifestyle. When detectives raided the four-storey building, in Chalton Street, Somers Town, in February last year, they found men and women having sex, 27 scantily-clad women, and £3,000 in cash in a jar on the bar. Lawson, the owner and manager of the brothel, was convicted by a jury at Blackfriars Crown Court of running a brothel and money laundering. Judge Peter Murphy jailed him for two years, but warned him he would have faced a longer sentence if the prostitutes had not been working in such good conditions. 'The Sun and Steam has been described as being as legitimate as it could be as a criminal enterprise’, he said. 'It was in any view a remarkably successful one, and I think it's right to say, Mr Lawson, that in light of all the evidence that success of that business is almost exclusively due to you. 'I am in no position to try to calculate the profits, but they must have been very considerable, and supported an affluent lifestyle for yourself and members of your family. 'This is a case of a long-standing, well organised, and profitable business which turned over a great deal of money.' The . judge said many of the prostitutes interviewed by police had . complemented Lawson's style of running the brothel, running an expensive . bar and legitimate sauna and steam rooms, and charging a 30 per cent . credit card fee, but not taking any of the women's earnings. The brothel was run at a five-star massage parlour called Steam and Sun Health Club in Camden, North London . 'You were not taking advantage of them in any way’, he said. 'It has been urged upon me that I could possibly suspend the sentence, but the scale of the enterprise however renders that impossible. 'But I will say the sentence I pass will be a good deal less than it would have been having regard to the financial success of the operation because of the conditions I’ve referred to.' Mark Paltenghi, prosecuting, told the court the brothel had an 'absolutely staggering turnover', with Lawson admitting himself the last ten months of business yielded £1.1m. The club's website boasted 'international ladies', VIP rooms and two penthouse suites, and billed itself as London's 'only five-star massage parlour'. Internal emails from Lawson warned prostitutes to offer 'a complete service' to customers, even if they were fat and ugly. 'I suspect anyone looking at the website and the brochures, or read the emails could have had absolutely no doubt what the nature of the business truly was behind the scenes', said the judge. 'The scale of the operation was truly remarkable, and on the occasion of the raid that were 25 or so women working. I have no doubt that was true on many evenings.' 'This is a case of a long-standing, well organised, and profitable business which turned over a great deal of money' Lawson, who took over the failing business from his uncle in 2005, got valid licences from Camden Council and paid annual taxes, even registering several staff for income tax payments. He was joined in the dock today by his sister, Jade, 27, a law graduate from the University of Hertfordshire, who worked as the brothel receptionist. The jury cleared her of managing the brothel after a four-week trial, but she was convicted of accepting £30,000 from her brother to pay off her student debts knowing it was the proceeds of crime. The judge told her: ‘You are a very capable young woman when you put your energies to legitimate enterprises, this was an aberration which is unlikely to be repeated.’ Ross Lawson, from St Albans, Hertfordshire, was convicted after trial of keeping a brothel and three counts of money laundering. He was jailed for two years for running the brothel, and sentenced to 18 months each for the other charges, to run concurrently. Jade Lawson, from Fleet, Hampshire, was convicted of one count of money laundering and cleared of keeping a brothel. She was given a six month jail sentence suspended for a year, and put on a three month 9pm to 7am curfew. A third defendant, club barman Waldemar Walczak, 29, from, Somers Town was convicted earning money from a brothel and transferring £53,000 to his wife and brother-in-law Karolina Ginter, 33, and Rafal Ginter, 29. He will be sentenced on August 19. Mr and Mrs Ginter were cleared of acquiring criminal property after trial.","27 prostitutes worked in the brothel which was open for 18 hours a day .

Creator Mike Brooks liked the sound of  'The Real Housewives of Benning Road' and he thought a lot of people would find it interesting enough to click on. 'First of all I thought the title would be hilarious: The Housewives of Benning Road. A lot of the urban neighborhoods in the city, the stereotype can be hoodrats and ghetto fabulous and all of that, so I thought the title would be real creative,' Brooks told the Washington Post. So he made a one-off spoof trailer.The low budget video was created after a quick call for actors on Facebook.

Looking good: Ree Ree actually asked for the shorter option of false lashes . Cast of characters: Creator Mike Brooks sent out a message on Facebook asking for actors and actresses to play his funny Benning Road housewives . Brooks is aware that the show plays into stereotypes of low-income communities, but he says it's all in good fun. 'A lot of times, we like to laugh at our pain,' he said. 'I guess everything I look at, I try to find the funny in it. Whether it's good or whether it's bad. So It's not really to bring anybody down. It's to make light of where we live. While some of the humor is DC-centric, the appeal of the show has spread and Brooks says he's gotten positive feedback from viewers all over the country. Now Brooks hopes to find an even bigger audience for his show. 'Hopefully it will be on a network,' Brooks told My Fox DC.

Amid the widespread fury and indignation sparked by George Zimmerman's murder acquittal, a 1973 photo of black and white kids embracing on a rain-soaked Detroit street has struck a chord with Americans, instantly becoming a viral sensation. The now-iconic image was captured by Joseph Crachiola, a photographer working in the 70s for The Macomb Daily. The black-and-white photo taken on a summer day in 1973 depicts five kids - three of them African-American and two of them white - happily posing for the camera in the middle of the street in the suburb of Mount Clemens. Moment of unity: In July 1973, Joseph . Crachiola was wandering the streets of Mount Clemens, Mich., when he . came across (left to right) Rhonda Shelly, 3, Kathy Macool, 7, Lisa . Shelly, 5, Chris Macool, 9, and Robert Shelly, 6 . Four of the older kids are seen embracing, while the smallest of the group, a 3-year-old girl, is standing next to them, nearly obscured by a too-big shopping cart. Last Sunday, just days after the controversial verdict clearing Zimmerman in the 2011 killing of black unarmed teenager Trayvon Martin, the 63-year-old photographer dug up the old picture of the grinning children and posted it on his Facebook account, hoping to bring something positive to the heated debate over race relations. Serendipity: Crachiola (pictured) shot a few frames of the grinning and embracing kids at their request, and he came to cherish the image as one of the most meaningful in his life . 'For me, it still stands as one of my most meaningful pictures,’ he wrote in his post. ‘It makes me wonder... At what point do we begin to mistrust one another? When do we begin to judge one another based on gender or race? I have always wondered what happened to these children. I wonder if they are still friends.’ The photo showing a brief moment of racial harmony amid a firestorm of anger and hatred instantly went viral. On Friday, Crachiola wrote on his Facebook page that the vintage picture has drawn 769,000 views. By Saturday evening, the image has attracted nearly 19,000 ‘likes’ and just under 10,500 comments. The Macomb Daily reprinted the photo on its homepage and sent someone to the archives to track down the microfilm in order to identify the kids, whose names were written in the caption. The subjects, who are now middle-aged, have been identified as two sets of siblings: Rhonda Shelly, 3, Lisa Shelly, 5, and Robert Shelly, 6, and their friends, 7-year-old Kathy Macool and her 9-year-old brother, Chris. Like most truly great things in life, the encounter between Crachiola and the siblings was a case of pure serendipity. On the afternoon of July 31, 1973, the photographer was on assignment in Mount Celemns trying to find a subject for a 'slice of life' essay for the paper. In his Sunday post that accompanied . the vintage photos, the 63-year-old Crachiola, who now lives in New . Orleans, explained that he was walking down Cherry Street when he . spotted some neighborhood kids at play. March of time: Forty years later, Rhonda Shelly, pictured left with her daughter, Bianca, still lives in Mount Clemens, along with her sister, Lisa . 'They saw me and said, ""Hey mister, take our picture!"" he wrote. ‘The pose was completely spontaneous.’ Crachiola . shot several frames, one of which was later published inside the paper . and forgotten by most. But for the photographer, seeing the kids . embracing one another without giving the color of their skin a second . thought made him wonder: when is innocence lost? ‘At . what point do we begin to mistrust one another? When do we begin to . judge one another based on gender or race?’ he later wondered on . Facebook. Following the heated debate over the . Zimmerman verdict and seeing images of angry protesters demonstrating . from coast to coast made the 63-year-old retiree think about the old . photo of the kids and share it with the world, he told NPR. And now it appears that a reunion between Crachiola and his young friends may be in order. In his original post, Crachiola wondered if the children he had depicted were still friends, and what had become of them. Less than a week later, he started getting answers to his questions. On Wednesday, the retiree emailed Deadline Detroit, . saying that he got a call from Bianca Shelly, the college student . daughter of Rhonda Shelly – the little girl barely visible behind the . shopping cart in the vintage print. Watershed moment: Crachiola was inspired to share the vintage photo with the world after George Zimmerman (left) was acquitted of shooting dead Trayvon Martin, a black unarmed teen (right) Public fury: Protesters rally in Chicago on July 20, 2013 to express anger over a not-guilty verdict in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin and call for an end to the Stand Your Ground self-defense laws . Positive message: Amid widespread indignation and outrage, Crachiola's snapshot of racial harmony has struck a chord . Ms Shelly, who attends school in Mississippi, told the photographer that her mom was shocked to see her 3-year-old self staring back at her from a page in the morning paper. ‘She seemed genuinely moved by the spirit of the picture,’ Crachiola said of Bianca. Rhonda still lives in Mount Clemens along with her 46-year-old brother Robert. Their 45-year-old sister, Lisa Dianne Roby, lives in Clinton Township. Crachiola also heard from Robert Shelly’s wife, Darnesha, who joked in a post on his Facebook page: ‘It was great seeing a picture of my husband with hair!’ By Thursday night, the photographer had tracked down 47-year-old Kathy Macool and her 49-year-old brother, Chris, who had learned of the viral photo from another sibling and reached out to the 63-year-old to let him know that the family now live in Texas.","Newspaper photographer Joseph Crachiola took photo on July 31, 1973, in Detroit suburb of Mount Clemens .

A young single mother died after mixing cider, beer and Lambrinis with amphetamines and heroin during an impromptu party with friends, an inquest heard. Former A grade college student Karayn Mcinerney, 20, was found dead in bed at a friend's flat in the village of Heaton, north of Bolton, by a former flatmate after a night out. Miss Mcinerney, whose eight-month-old daughter was being looked after by a relative at the time, was at least three times over the drink-drive limit and had traces of amphetamine and morphine in her system, Bolton Coroner's Court heard. An inquest into her death heard that the once-promising student's life changed dramatically when her grandmother, who had brought her up, died, and Miss Mcinerney began associating with 'the wrong people'. Miss Mcinerney was brought up by her grandparents after her mother abandoned her and enjoyed a happy and successful childhood until the age of 12 when her grandmother died, quickly followed by her grandfather. Her aunt, Emma McInerney, told the hearing: 'Everything started to go wrong when she lost her gran - . it was like losing a mother. 'She started . associating with the wrong people and started to drink. 'We all struggled very hard. Her . friends were the wrong friends. She found it difficult living where her . grandparents lived, so exchanged it for a flat. She stopped going to . college.' In November 2012, Miss Mcinerney gave birth to her baby girl and her family hoped she would get back on track. But on April 19 this year her . brother Aaron, 29, agreed to take his niece for the night so his sister . could go out with friends. The inquest heard from Miss Mcinerney's former flatmate Tiffany . Stevens, who said she had joined her for a drinking . session at a friend's flat after a night out in Bolton town centre. She said the group drank cider, beer . and Lambrini, and said Miss Mcinerney was very drunk. 'She was acting like . crazy,' said Miss Stevens. 'She said her stomach was hurting and she went . to the bedroom on her own.  I went to the room later. 'When I did she looked asleep.  I thought she had fallen down the side of the bed and was asleep.' The next day Mr Mcinerney tried calling his sister to arrange for her to pick up her daughter, but was told by a female who answered the phone that she was still asleep. His evidence read in court said: 'At . 3.30pm the same girl was crying and said an ambulance had been called . because she wasn't breathing.' He rushed to the flat and was . told by a paramedic that his sister had died. Police found snap bags used to carry drugs, and drug-taking accessories including burnt tin foil and a crack pipe in the flat where she died. Recording a narrative verdict Bolton coroner Alan Walsh said Miss Mcinerney died from a misuse of amphetamines and alcohol. He said: 'She was a young woman who had a rollercoaster life where, as a child, she had been brought up by her grandparents. Her grandparents did a very good job by looking after her and making sure she got an education. 'She became involved with associates who weren't good for her. She was known to drink from a young age because of these associations.' He added: 'Her daughter was the catalyst for her to change and in the early stages she did change. She was very committed to being a mother - but you can't control who she gets in touch with. The combination of drugs and alcohol was a disaster. 'It was a sudden, unexpected and tragic death - tragic for her at the age of 20, tragic for her lovely daughter at eight months. That is the saddest part of her death. 'I don't believe the family could have done any more... It is the loss of a very young life and the life of a young mother.'","Karayn Mcinerney, of Bolton, was found dead in friend's flat after night out .

A Louisiana teen is dead after falling 16 stories to his death while on vacation with friends after recently graduating high school. Challenge Talbot, 18, of Thibodeaux, LA., fell 16 stories from a balcony to his death in a pool at the Turquoise Place Condominiums in Orange Beach, AL. A couple walking near the pool early Friday morning saw his body face down and called 911, but responders were unable to revive the teen. Police are still investigating if Talbot fell from the balcony or jumped. Tragic death: Challenge Talbot, 18, fell 16 stories from a balcony to his death in a pool below . ‘There are no witnesses. We haven't been able to find the video yet and there's no indication of foul play,’ Orange Beach Police Chief Billy Wilkins told WPMI. ‘We're not through with the investigation. We're still trying to find out as much as we can.’ Friends staying at the condo with Talbot told investigators they ‘don't have any idea of what happened,’ Wilkins told the Houma Courier, adding that no one saw him fall or jump. With the investigation still in preliminary stages, officials still aren’t sure if drugs or alcohol played a role in Talbot’s fall. Talbot recently graduated from a local Catholic high school, where he was a member of the swim team that placed second in the Louisiana state championship, according to the Courier. On vacation: Talbot was staying with friends at the Tourquoise Place Condominiums in Orange Beach, AL . A champion swimmer: Talbot was a champion swimmer who had expressed hope of helping to coach his team to glory in the future . In a November interview, Talbot told the Courier that it meant a lot to him for his team to be on the gym wall with other athletic achievements, adding ‘When I look up at that board, I can say that I was on that team, and it means a lot.’ The recent grad also expressed a desire to return to help coach the team in the coming years. ‘They might win it next year, and I am thinking about coming back as an assistant coach,’ he said. ‘I think I can get a ring with these guys in the next few years.’ The school held a candlelight vigil Friday night in Talbot’s honor, according to WPMI.","Officials have said there is no indication foul play is involved .

This is the moment a disqualified driver brazenly smashed his pick-up truck into a brand new police car - seconds after officers joked: 'I hope he doesn't ram us'. Thug Chad Harrison, 27, reversed straight into the officer's high-spec BMW X5 on April 18 this year causing £5,000 worth of damage. Shocking footage taken from inside the 13-plate BMW, which only had 400 miles on the clock, shows Harrison ploughing his flat-bed truck into the 4x4 twice. Scroll down for video... First, officers were joking as they spotted the truck and hoping the driver wouldn't reverse into their new BMW X5, but they were in for a surprise... The lorry filmed as it reverses back to hit the police car, a brand new BMW with just 400 miles on the clock, near Stourbridge, West Mids. The driver feared officers would discover he was banned from the roads . He then speeds off on the single-track lane near the A449 in Stourbridge, West Midlands, hoping to leave the brand new £40,000 police car in his wake. But Harrison's attempts to disable the BMW, which was on its first emergency callout, failed and PCs Dal Nijjar and Gareth Phillips pursued him for almost 20 miles. After crashing into the gates of Hunts . Mill Nature Reserve in Dudley, West Midlands, Harrison tried to escape on . foot through woodland. The brand new police patrol car with just 400 miles on the clock, suffered more than £5,000 worth of damage. Officers pursued the driver for almost 20 miles until he crashed through the gates of Hunts Mill Nature Reserve off Coopers Bank Road in Dudley . But with help from the West Midlands Police helicopter, officers were easily able to track him down to where he was lying low in bushes and make the arrest. Harrison, from Kingswinford, West Midlands, admitted dangerous driving, driving whilst disqualified, failing to stop for police and damaging eight other vehicles during the pursuit. And last Tuesday, he was jailed for 19 months and handed a seven-year driving ban at Wolverhampton Crown Court. A video released West Midlands Police after the case shows the shocking moment Harrison reversed his pick-up truck into the front of the stunned motorway officers car. Harrison and his collegues try to make an escape before he is spotted by a police helicopter and apprehended by police on the lane near the A449 in Stourbridge . The lorry, pictured during its doomed attempt to escape, was used to ram a police vehicle . With help from the West Midlands Police helicopter, officers were easily able to track Harrison down to where he was lying low in bushes . Seconds before the impact, audio from in-car cameras captured a discussion between the two PCs saying they hoped the disqualified driver wouldn't shunt their new car. One of the officers can be heard saying: 'I hope he doesn't ram us' before the pair start chuckling. The one minute and 41 seconds long video then shows Harrison fleeing down the track before he eventually dumps his truck and is monitored by the force's helicopter. Speaking after the case, Acting Sergeant Robert Leaver, from the Central Motorways Police Group (CMPG) said: 'Harrison has an appalling record of driving going back many years; on this occasion his reckless driving in a large commercial vehicle caused near carnage and caused thousands of pounds worth of damage. The normally peaceful country lane: Damage was caused to other motorists during the police chase as they pursued the driver for almost 20 miles . 'He deliberately drove at a patrol car, injuring the officers, and then led police on a long pursuit during which he strayed onto the wrong side of carriageways and struck at least eight other vehicles. 'The truck was in a poor condition and several of the cars were damaged after being struck by one of the truck's stabiliser booms which protruded out from its side. 'The public need protecting from people who drive in this manner and put other road users in danger. 'He's rightly been jailed and should he be tempted to take to the roads at any stage over the next seven years he's likely to find himself back behind bars.' Police revealed Harrison caused £5,000 in damage to the brand new BMW X5 as well as thousands more to other vehicles he struck as he tried to escape.","Thug Chad Harrison reversed straight into the officer's high-spec BMW X5 .

"By . Christopher Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 20:15 EST, 21 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:16 EST, 21 July 2013 . Television presenters have to be passionate these days. ‘I am passionate about treacle sponge,’ they burble, on shows called Britain’s Best Puddings, or some such. ‘I am so passionate about blancmange!’ They’re certainly bright-eyed and breathless over the dessert dishes, but do we really believe they race home to make more steaming treacly sponges? Do they dream every night of pink wobbly blancmanges? Arthur Williams showed us, in The Plane That Saved Britain (C4), what passionate TV really looks like. The former Royal Marines Commando was giggling, weeping, gasping, squealing, roaring and punching the air as he inspected a De Havilland Mosquito, the forgotten weapon in the RAF’s wartime strikeforce — and then he got to fly it. Forgotten hero: The de Havilland Mosquito ('The Wooden Wonder', also known as 'The Timber Terror') is believed by some to have been more important to the RAF than the Spitfire . It was all the more poignant that Williams, best known for his coverage of last year’s Paralympics, has been unable to walk since a car crash six years ago. He plainly wasn’t going to let a detail like that keep him on the ground. When he hauled himself up into the cockpit by his arms, you could see the veins standing out on his neck. Williams didn’t just love this plane, he worshipped it, and the men who flew it. And though they were in their 90s, the airmen who piloted the Mosquito in strikes against the Nazis had lost none of their affection for this 400mph wooden marvel. ‘The plane would take an awful lot of punishment,’ reminisced Bud Badley, 93, over a pint of bitter. ‘One time, I came back from a mission flying a lot of holes held together by bits of aeroplane.’ During World War II, Bud flew the fighter version, which had four cannon mounted under the pilot’s seat and bristling from the Mosquito’s nose. When he opened fire, with the guns thumping under his thighs, it was, Bud said, ‘a very erotic feeling’. John Trotman, another wartime pilot and, at 93, still flying, remembered piloting the Mosquito along German railway tracks, releasing his delayed-action bombs at the mouth of tunnels to block the lines. ‘You don’t train for that,’ he shrugged. ‘You just do it.’ Tired: After 15 years on the air, the jokes in Family Guy are wearing a bit thin . Hero worship shone in Arthur Williams’s eyes, and no wonder. But his deepest passion was for the plane itself. The prototype was first offered to the RAF in the late Thirties, but top brass could not see the advantages of a plane made from wood. Designer Geoffrey de Havilland, then aged 57, would not be deterred. He built it in secret, then showed it again to the RAF — at a time when Britain was desperate for a bomber that could outrun the German Messerschmidt and attack fast enough not to be stopped by anti-aircraft guns. Some historians believe the ‘Mossie’ was . even more important in winning the war than the Spitfire. But its . wooden frames soon rotted in peacetime, and the plane was forgotten. Ikea’s psychotic garden gnomes were bad enough. But the scowling, grimacing dolls in the furniture company’s latest advert are downright nightmarish. Every time that plastic hand whisks back a shower curtain, I expect to see a carving knife come stabbing down. Williams, who first heard of the Mosquito as an eight-year-old making Airfix models of warplanes, tracked down the only one still flying, a recently rebuilt plane owned by a U.S. billionaire. His sheer cheek, demanding to fly in it despite health-and-safety protests, made winning TV. And his euphoria as he took the controls was contagious: ‘The power . . . this is just insane. The most thrilling adrenaline junkie ride you will ever experience in your life. Man!’ Most TV shows, even the ones shown at odd times on little-watched channels, have a cadre of passionate fans. The crudely drawn and crudely comic American sitcom Family Guy began its latest series on BBC3 at 11pm last night with a double bill, and that was cause for euphoria for some. Creator Seth MacFarlane has always denied the show is just a Simpsons clone, and he’s right. Bart, Lisa and Marge Simpson are great characters, but the wife and kids in Family Guy are anodyne and devoid of personality. The dog, Brian, and Baby Stewie get all the best lines, which have become fewer and thinner as this 15-year-old show has slogged on. Some can still raise a laugh, others are so racist or misogynist that they wouldn’t be out of place in a Bernard Manning sitcom. Still, there’s a time and a place for this kind of stuff, and 11pm on BBC3 is probably it.","The Plane That Saved Britain (C4) ***** .

The estranged wife of the driver who was at the wheel of a limo that burst into flames killing five female passengers claims he was arguing with her over the phone just before the disaster. Rachel 'Raquel' Hernandez-Brown has said Orville 'Ricky' Brown, 46, was distracted, and even turned up the music in the limo so the bachelorette party in the back couldn't hear him fighting with his ex. Bride-to-be Neriza Fojas, 31, and four of her friends died after becoming trapped in the blazing limousine on the San Mateo Bridge in San Francisco in May - a further four bachelorettes and driver Mr Brown managed to escape. Distracted: A bride-to-be and four of her friends were killed when the limousine they were travelling in burst into flames on the San Mateo Bridge in San Francisco . Ms Hernandez-Brown said the music in the limo was 'really loud', adding that she told her estranged husband 'You're not paying attention', and 'stop calling me'. In an interview at her San Jose home she also recalled telling him: 'I'd hate to have a limo driver like you.' Mr Brown was calling to try and make up after a violent outburst that was investigated by police earlier in the day she said, according to a report on Mercurynews.com. Her remarks have raised questions over whether the driver was too distracted to react quickly when one of the women banged on the partition to get his attention after realising the vehicle was filling with smoke. Devastation: Driver Orville Brown's estranged wife has claimed he was arguing with her over the phone in the moments before the vehicle began to fill with smoke . 'We need to follow up on this,' Karen Guidotti, chief deputy San Mateo County district attorney, said on Friday when confronted with the content of the interview. Police had never contacted Ms Hernandez-Brown. Mr Brown said he was not 'authorised' to talk to journalists or give interviews on Thursday, and declined to comment on his wife's account of the moments leading up to the fire on Saturday. In the days after the fatal fire on May 4, Mr Brown recounted the ordeal in numerous television interviews. He has insisted he did everything he could to get the women out of the car but that the flames were too intense. Probe: The five women were trapped in the limo when it caught fire on Saturday May 4, while four others, and driver Orvile Brown, managed to escape . He said someone from another car finally wrenched open one of the Lincoln Town Car's back doors. Moments later he called his ex once again to tell her what was happening. 'My mom, I, everyone in my family were like, gosh, what made him not call the cops right away?' Ms Hernandez-Brown said in her interview. One survivor said in the wake of the blaze that the driver did nothing to help the trapped women escape. She declined to comment on his wife's claims. She and three other women escaped after climbing through the partition separating the driver's section from the passengers, but five others died in the limo. The investigation into what caused the blaze is yet to conclude. Mr Brown, 46, was born into a well-known Bay Area family. Lewis Brown Sr., his father, was the first African-American elected to the Vallejo City Council. He is also related to Charles Bledsoe, one of the attorneys who worked on the landmark 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education school-segregation case. Orville Brown had worked for the limo company for about two months after a long period without a steady job, Ms Hernandez-Brown said. She said he told her that the fire could be a windfall for them, saying, 'We're going to get super-paid'. But Hernandez-Brown insisted she didn't want anything to do with 'blood money'. The report said Mr Brown used his phone to film the smouldering remains of the limo and text the footage to his wife with the words: '...Remember this could off [SIC] put me in the ground...'.","Limo carrying bachelorette party caught fire on San Francisco bridge in May .

Alex Leaver, 39, was initially convicted of assaulting Jilly Sandamas, 49, but had his conviction overturned on appeal . It is a universal truth that, where there is a neighbours’ dispute, there’s quite often a leylandii not far away. And the row between Jill Sandamas and . Alex Leaver was no exception – although it also involved a stepladder, a . drenching with a hosepipe and two trips to court. The saga began when Mrs Sandamas, 49, . climbed up her stepladder to trim the leylandii branches which overhang . her garden from Mr Leaver’s side of the fence. With her electric hedge cutters in . hand, she was suddenly hit by a huge jet of water when 39-year-old . plumber Mr Leaver turned on his hosepipe. The jet hit Mrs Sandamas full in the . face, knocking her off the ladder. She fell five feet into a flower bed, . hurting her knee, and was so upset she ran to another neighbour’s house . and asked her to call the police. Mr Leaver was charged with the offence of common assault, which has a maximum sentence of up to six months in jail. In January he was convicted of . battery, fined £300 and ordered to pay Mrs Sandamas £100 compensation . plus £790 in costs. But the story was not over yet. He then appealed the . conviction, saying it was an accident and he had not intended to hit . Mrs Sandamas. Now his conviction has been overturned . by an appeal judge at Burnley Crown Court, who believed his version of . events. Mrs Sandamas lives in a £250,000 four-bedroom house in the . village of Barnoldswick, Lancashire, with her husband Mark, the managing . director of an events and exhibition firm. Jilly Sandamas, 39, left, says she was knocked off her ladder by Mr Leaver's hose as she trimmed the hedge . Mrs Sandamas was clipping the leylandi hedge seen here between her house (on the left) and Mr Leaver's . Sarah Statham, prosecuting, told the . court that the couple’s house backed on to Mr Leaver’s £190,000 dormer . bungalow, and they share a border made up of his leylandii hedge and . their wooden fence. Miss Statham said the couple’s garden . fence was ‘somewhat lower’ than the hedge and the leylandii ‘protruded . significantly’ over it. 'For the offence of battery to be made out, the Crown had to demonstrate... that there was an intentional or reckless application of force' - Recorder William Smith . On the day of the incident, neighbours . Keith and Vivienne Hardwick heard Mrs Sandamas using the trimmers from . inside their house next door, the court was told. Mrs Hardwick, 68, saw Mr Leaver using a . hosepipe and said he appeared to be trying to get water over the hedge . deliberately. Her husband, 70, claimed he saw Mr Leaver squeezing the . end of the pipe, as if trying to get more pressure, before aiming for . the ladder. But Mr Leaver denied any deliberate assault on his neighbour, and told officers he could not hear her using the hedge trimmers. Mrs Sandamas lives in a four-bedroomed house in the village of Barnoldswick in the Pennines . Mr Leaver, whose house is pictured, said he did not realise it was better to water a hedge's roots than its top . Yesterday Mrs Sandamas said she did . not want to talk about the case, and instead wanted to consult with . police and Victim Support. But Mr Leaver claimed the incident had . occurred against a background of ill feeling between the two neighbours . which began when he built a conservatory. Mr Leaver said: ‘It was all rather silly and it’s very unfortunate the matter got as far as it did at a crown court. ‘I’ve always wanted to be a good . neighbour. I’ve never had any complaints before and get on well with my . other neighbours – but things simply haven’t worked out between myself . and Mrs Sandamas. ‘It has just been a nonsense and a . complete farce. Now I’m going to have to be very careful if I want to . water my hedge and will have to get my girlfriend to video me doing it . in future.’","Jilly Sandamas, 49, was knocked off ladder by water as she trimmed hedge .

DuckDuckGo, the little known U.S. company, sets itself aside from its giant competitors such as Google and Yahoo, by not sharing any of its clients' data with searched websites. This means no targeted advertising and no skewed search results. Aside from the reduced ads, this unbiased and private approach to using the internet is appealing to users angered at the news that U.S. and UK governments (the National Security Agency (NSA) in the U.S. and GCHQ in the UK), have direct access to the servers of big search engine companies, allowing them to 'watch' users. At just 33, DuckDuckGo founder and CEO, Gabriel Weinberg has tapped into a niche market - offering Internet users real privacy when searching the world wide web . Within just two weeks of the NSA's operations being leaked by former employee Edward Snowden, DuckDuckGo's traffic had doubled - from serving 1.7million searches a day, to 3million. 'We started seeing an increase right when the story broke, before we were covered in the press,' said Gabriel Weinberg, founder and CEO, speaking to The Guardian. Entrepreneur Mr Weinberg had the idea for the company in 2006,  while taking time out to do a stained-glass making course. He had just sold successful start-up Opobox, similar to Friends Reunited, for $10million (£6.76million) to Classmates.com. While on the course he realised that the teacher's 'useful web links' did not tally up with Google's search results, and realised the extent of the personalised skewing of results per user. From there he had the idea to develop a 'better' search engine, that does not share any user information with any websites whatsoever. Search data, he told the paper, 'is arguably the most personal data people are entering into anything. You're typing in your problems, your desires. It's not the same as things you post publicly on a social network.' DuckDuckGo, named after an American children's tag game Duck Duck Goose (though not a metaphor), was solo-founded by Mr Weinberg in 2008, in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. He self-funded it until 2011 when Union Square Ventures, which also backs Twitter, Tumblr, Foursquare and Kickstarter, and a handful of angel investors, came on board. Leak impact: It appears to some, privacy really does matter, as DuckDuckGo's user-figures show. Just two weeks after the June 6 revelations, searchers were up 90 per cent . The team  has expanded to a few full-time people, many part-time contributors and a bunch of open-source contributors. 'If you're wondering how you would turn that into a verb...Duck it!' he says on the company website. The 33-year-old CEO, who lives in Paoli, a suburb of Philadelphia, PA, with his wife and two children, explains that when other search engines are used, your search terms are sent to that site you clicked on; this sharing of information is known as 'search leakage'. 'For example, when you search for something private, you are sharing that private search not only with your search engine, but also with all the sites that you clicked on (for that search),' he points out on his website. 'In addition, when you visit any site, your computer automatically sends information about it to that site (including your User agent and IP address). This information can often be used to identify you directly. 'So when you do that private search, not only can those other sites know your search terms, but they can also know that you searched it. It is this combination of available information about you that raises privacy concerns,' he says. Within two weeks of NSA's . operations being leaked by former employee Edward Snowden (pictured), DuckDuckGo's . traffic had doubled - from 1.7million searches a day to . 3million . The company offers a search engine, like Google, but which does not traffic users, which has less spam and clutter, that showcases 'better instant answers', and that does not put users in a 'filter bubble' meaning results are biased towards particular users. Currently, 50 per cent of DuckDuckGo's users are from the U.S., 45 per cent from Europe and the remaining 5 per cent from Asia-Pacific (APAC). On June 3, the company reported it . had more than 19million direct queries per month and the zero-click Info . API gets over 9million queries per day. It . has partnerships with apps, browsers and distributions that include . DuckDuckGo as a search option: Browsers, distributions, iOS, and . Android. Companies can use DuckDuckGo for their site search, and the . firm offers an open API for Instant Answers based on its open source . DuckDuckHack platform. Speaking . on U.S. radio channel, American Public Media, Mr Weinberg said: . 'Companies like DuckDuckGo have sprung in the last couple years to cater . to the growing number of data dodgers. 'There’s pent up demand for companies that do not track you,' he says. User feedback on the company website say the search engine reminds them of the early days of using Google; it's like an 'honorable search site to complement Wikipedia'; and other are 'amazed' that a search engine company is 'doing exactly the right thing'. Critics of the company remain cautious of the sudden surge in success, however, pointing out that 3million searches per day is just a 'drop in the ocean' compared with the 13billion searches Google does every day. Writing on his website, Danny Sullivan, who runs the Search Engine Land site and analyses the industry, said big companies like Ask.com and Yahoo had tried pro-privacy pushes before and failed to generate huge interest.

'amazed' that a search engine company is 'doing exactly the right . thing' Other companies have had more success, however, and Duck Duck Go is not the first search engine firm to tap into the pro-privacy market. Competitors include Ixquick, a Dutch meta-search engine firm, based in the Netherlands and New York. It returns private meta-search results from other . providers. From mid 2006, the company opted not to include the private details of its users, and in 2009 it launched Startpage.com, a similar service taking top Google search results without saving users' IP addresses or giving personal user data to Google. Together, the company's search engines serve 4.4 million daily searches. YaCy is another free search engine that is fully decentralized. It prides itself on making all users of its search engine network as equal, not storing user search requests and doesn't censor content. Perhaps in the wake of the NSA and GCHQ revelations, internet users may think twice about their search engine provider.","DuckDuckGo, based in Pennsylvania, does not share user data with sites .

The naming and shaming of bankers in the wake of the financial crisis is ‘lynch mobbish’, the Archbishop of Canterbury warned last night. The Right Reverend Justin Welby said it is wrong that individual bankers have been singled out by the media since the financial began nearly six years ago. Interviewed by Radio 4’s The Bishop and The Bankers, broadcast last night, he said: ‘This business of somehow saying that one individual bears the whole blame as opposed to simply the accountability - it feels lynch mobbish.’ The Right Reverend Justin Welby said it is wrong that individual bankers have been singled out by the media since the financial began nearly six years ago . But the former senior oil executive admitted he too might have been sucked into behaving badly in the run-up to the financial crisis, just like the disgraced bankers. Dr Welby, who sat on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said he had listened to the evidence from bankers - and worried he could have been caught up. He told the BBC he was ‘sitting there, most of the time, thinking: ‘Well, I’m not sure I would have been any different’, rather than thinking how bad they were.’ Dr Welby discussed how the culture of a company influences its workers, either for good or for bad. He compared a worker to ‘a bit of plasticine’ which is easily moulded by his or her colleagues. Johnny Cameron, a former executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, is one of the few bankers to have been disciplined about his role. He said: ‘What I do remember [from his time in the oil industry] is the sense that the culture and values of the financial world sort of enveloped you and began to shape one, like a bit of plasticine really, into a new ethical shape. ‘You were aware that you were struggling with this and weren’t quite confident - in fact, often rather frightened - by the re-shaping that was going on.’ Dr Welby described the church as ‘the mould that was shaping me correctly.’ He worked in the oil industry for 11 years, both in Britain and overseas, but retired his executive position in 1989 after sensing a calling from God. Dr Welby said he had ‘loved’ his oil industry career, describing it as ‘hugely addictive’ and ‘such a buzz.’ Johnny Cameron, a former executive of Royal Bank of Scotland, is one of the few bankers to have been disciplined about his role. Quizzed by the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend James Jones, who presented the three-part series, Mr Cameron said the idea that all bankers are bad is wrong. He singled out scandals such as the mis-selling of payment protection insurance and the manipulation of Libor as utterly reprehensible. But he added: ‘The whole thing [banking industry] is branded as lacking morality and unethical but it is more complicated, I would say.’ In a plea for peace in May, David Cameron called time on the national sport of criticising the financial community and the City of London.

A British comedy show chain called The Glee Club is taking on Twentieth Century Fox claiming the American company violated its copyright when naming the hit TV show, Glee. Comic Enterprises Ltd, which has four clubs under its 1999 trademark, 'The Glee Club', is locked in a legal battle with Fox, the hugely popular musical show unlawfully 'swamped' its own trademark. The club chain's boss, Mark Tughan, has also accused the massive Los Angeles-based outfit of 'threatening to take away his home' if he loses the enormously costly legal action. Success: Glee is the top-rated television series on satellite TV, attracting millions of viewers, who were branded 'Gleeks' Days after one of TV show's stars, Cory Monteith, died from a drug overdose, Fox has denied any trade mark infringement and called for Comic Enterprises' mark to be revoked at London's High Court. Comic Enterprises registered 'The Glee Club' trademark, including an image with the words in a spotlight, on June 19, 1999, the company's barrister, Douglas Campbell said. It opened venues under that name in Birmingham, Cardiff, Oxford and Nottingham between 1994 and 2010, hosting top comedians such as Jack Dee, Michael McIntyre and Rob Brydon, selling 1.5 million tickets. But Comic Enterprises is, by any measure, a relative minnow compared to Fox - one of entertainment's biggest fish. Comic Enterprises registered 'The Glee Club' trademark, including an image with the words in a spotlight, on June 19, 1999, the company's barrister, Douglas Campbell said . Mr Tughan, Comic Enterprises' owner, . says he was stunned when, flicking through TV channels in 2010, he . discovered Glee, a show about an American High School Choir group, on . E4. 'I thought 'Jesus Christ - there's a . TV show with our name on it'. I warranted it to be serious enough to . look into it and get to the bottom of what the hell was going on,' he . told Judge Roger Wyand QC. Mr Tughan, who thought the show had a . 'saccharine, bland narrative', started to become especially worried . when he realised the second season was a runaway success when it aired . on Sky, later that year. That season, by Fox's own account, . Glee was the top-rated television series on satellite TV, attracting . millions of viewers, who were branded 'Gleeks'. Mr Tughan said his confused customers . have often assumed there is some connection between his comedy clubs . and the TV show, causing major problems for his business. Denial: Fox has denied any copyright infringement and called for Comic Enterprises' mark to be revoked at London's High Court . His barrister said that the company's . mark and that of Fox, used on much of its merchandising, share a . 'strong visual, aural and conceptual similarity' for services which are . 'in part identical' and otherwise 'extremely similar'. He said: 'The acts of Twentieth . Century Fox have swamped the reputation of Comic Enterprises' mark and . thereby diluted its ability to denote its services.' Comic Enterprises had hoped to keep . the costs of the case down by having it heard in the patents county . court but a judge moved it to the High Court at the studio's request in . March. Since then, Mr Tughan has accused . Fox, which has set aside £750,000 to fight the case, of 'intimidating' him in what he brands a 'David and Goliath' tussle. 'Legal costs matter to this David,' Mr Douglas said, 'given the recent threats made against Mr Tughan . personally - the suggestion being that, if Comic Enterprises lose, Fox . will try to take away his home.' But the studio denies any such threats, as well as the alleged trade mark infringement and passing off. Simon Malynicz, for Fox, said the . contentious marks are 'plainly different' and leave almost no scope for . people to muddle the two. He said: 'There is no evidence of genuine or properly substantiated confusion and no likelihood of confusion. 'A fleeting, momentary or speculative . thought about whether there might be a connection cannot be consistent . with the requirement that there be damage to the essential function of . the trademark.' He put forward evidence from the . show's co-creator, Ian Brennan, who said he picked the name for its . 'double-meaning' of slang for choir groups and 'sinister joy or . shadenfreude'. Mr Malynicz argued that Comic . Enterprises' mark is descriptive and should be invalidated in relation . to singing groups and revoked for all goods except for comedy clubs and . live music venues. The legal battle continues just as . shocked fans of the TV show are coming to terms with the death by drink . and heroin overdose of Canadian Monteith, who played Finn Hudson.","Comic Enterprises Ltd, has four clubs under its trademark The Glee Club .

The roof of a church has been left with huge holes after heavy masonry fell through when it was hit by powerful lightning bolts. The spire of St Andrew's Church in Ramsbottom, near Bury, Greater Manchester, was struck during thunderstorms today which have hit several buildings across the country. Pieces of the spire, weighing more than a tonne, came crashing through the roof of the building, which was built in the 1830s, at around 7am today. A large hole has appeared in the roof of St Andrew's Church, Ramsbottom, after a bolt of lightning hit one of four stone turrets on the tower .

The building has now been declared structurally unsafe amid fears more masonry could fall from the spire . The damage was so extensive that the building has been declared structurally unsafe amid fears that more masonry could fall from the spire. Lightning storms hit the North West throughout the morning, with major delays reported after lightning hit a train at Manchester's Piccadilly Station. The lightning strike at St Andrew's Church was so loud that neighbours described the sound as 'like a bomb going off'. Watch Manager Ady Tonge, from Ramsbottom fire station's blue watch, said: 'The damage is extensive and everyone at the church is devastated. 'There is structural damage to the tower and we have had to cordon off the whole church. The lightning hit one of the turrets at the top of the church's spire.

The bolt hit one of four stone turrets on a tower roof at the church, showering the surrounding area with huge fragments . One fragment of the spire crashed through the church's main roof . 'Debris has then fallen through the church roof, causing one major hole and five or six smaller ones. There was also debris in the primary school playground next door. 'It is frightening to think what could have happened if it had happened a little later in the day and there were people around.' The Grade II listed building, finished in 1832, cost £5,000 to build, which would be the equivalent of £320,000 today. The Rev Andy Lindop, 56, who has been at the church for two and a half years said: 'I live about half a mile down the road and I heard the clap of thunder but I never imagined that the church would have been hit and all this damage would have been caused. It was like an explosion in the church. 'There are even dents in the school playground. The services will probably be moved into the school. It's just the church building that has been affected.

Unfortunately it left five substantial holes in the roof. The stone is sandstone and it's fallen from about 80ft. 'Inside it looks like a bomb has gone off, it has even blown all the electrics and blasted off the lights. Services are going to have to be postponed for many months and months. 'Thankfully the school finished last week but they had held three performances in here and they had their end of term service on Friday. Each night of the performances there were 200 people in there.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 11:07 EST, 23 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:07 EST, 23 July 2013 . Sent anonymously to the Boston Globe, this cardboard box of human remains has helped to shed fresh light on a mystery that has endured for almost 40 years. A note inside - from a sender identified only as 'Veritas' - asked the newspaper to find out who the bones belonged to, and pointed it towards the disappearance of two young couples who vanished at sea back in 1976. Danny Kwiatkowski, 24, and his sister Elaine, 20, together with their respective dates Jana Coonan, 16, and 26-year-old Daniel Poirier, set out on a fishing trip off Plymouth, Cape Cod, over the Memorial Day weekend, and never returned. Lasting mystery: Mailed by somebody using the name 'Veritas', the cardboard box that arrived at The Boston Globe offices was found to contain two human skulls . The Coast Guard discovered 24-year-old Danny Kwiatkowski's motorboat floating partially submerged off the coast of Marshfield, with two pairs of shoes, Elaine's purse and some soft drinks the only trace of those that had been on board. The boat was later found to be still seaworthy, and three life jackets and a distress flare were recovered unused. The foursome's baited fishing rods were still attached to the side of the vessel. It was concluded that both young couples had succumbed to the icy temperatures of the Atlantic after their boat got into trouble, but the families of the missing four never gave up hope that the missing boaters would be found. 'We feel their has been foul play,' Joseph Kwiatkowski, Danny and Elaine's brother, told a newspaper in June 1976. Their relatives - conscious that all four were strong swimmers - scoured the shoreline of Cape Cod Bay, before expanding their search further, giving television interviews and eventually seeking the advice of psychics as years went past with no clues. Clues: The package included official paperwork related to the foursome's disappearance, and a message insisting 'this is not a Halloween prank' A leg recovered by a fishing trawler . towards the end of 1976 was still inside a high leather boot that . contained Danny Kwiatkowski's wallet, and his family buried it in Notre . Dame Cemetery in Worcester. But it was not until the mysterious . package arrived at the Boston Globe offices last autumn - containing . remains from two humans, paperwork connected to the vanished boaters, . and a note which insisting 'this is now a Halloween prank' - that more . emerged about the foursome's fate. Paperwork inside the box indicated . that the medical examiner suspected one of the skulls could belong to . either Jana Coonan or Elaine Kwiaktowski - but in the days before DNA . testing he had no way to be sure. The other set of remains were thought to belong to a Native American woman. The remains would have been disposed . of were it not for an employee at the state crime lab who decided to . send them to Veritas for safekeeping, according to the Boston Globe's . report. 'Please see that justice is now done for the sake of these two victims,' Veritas wrote. In the wake of the arrival of the box . Massachusetts Police and Globe reporters embarked on separate . investigations into the disappearance of the boaters. Hope through the years: Police used DNA testing to identify one set of remains as those of Jana Coonan, the 16-year-old sister of Michael Coonan (pictured), who never gave up hope that his sibling might have survived . Disappearance: Siblings Danny and Elaine Kwiatkowski and their dates Jana Coonan and Daniel Poirier vanished during a boating trip off Cape Cod on Memorial Day weekend in 1976 . Using a DNA sample collected from a . single tooth remaining in the unidentified skull suspected to be that of . one of the missing boaters. In December, genetic material was . collected from Danny and Elaine's sister Marge Habib, Jana Coonan's . brother Michael, and Pamela DePaoli, sister of Daniel Poirier. After an agonising six month wait, investigators contacted Mr Coonan to inform him the school was that of his sister, Jana. 'Until I got the . phone call . . . I always kind of expected to see her walking down the . street,' he says . After notifying the families . involved, the case was closed again, but not before samples collected . from the relatives of the unaccounted for boaters, Elaine Kwiatkowski . and Daniel Poirier, were logged in a missing person's database in case . their remains should ever be unearthed. The other remains inside the box were . found to be between 400 and 500 years old and from two different . people. A state archaeologist is now trying to establish which Native . American tribes the remains can be traced back to. Efforts to trace Veritas by both police and the Boston Globe have proved fruitless. The family of Daniel Poirier accepts . he probably died in the boating accident, but long for the sense of . 'closure' that physical evidence has brought to the Jana Coonan's . relatives. 'I wish there was a way we could have put it to rest and we never did,' Daniel's older sister Pamela said.","Box contained two skulls and paperwork connecting to missing foursome .

Claire Cisotti and son Zac in the same Lindo wing as the Duchess of Cambridge, after Zac comes out of the Paediatric ICU in St Marys . Looking at TV footage of the Lindo Wing at London’s St Mary’s Hospital, chosen by the Duchess of Cambridge for the birth of her first child, I couldn’t help but smile. Seeing it brings memories flooding back of the six days I spent there when I became a first-time mother 13 years ago. Terrified and totally unprepared for childbirth on my arrival, I experienced warmth, kindness and love there. When I left with my new baby, I was set up for life. Quite simply, the Lindo taught me everything I needed to be a mother. It’s the best baby boot camp in the world. The secrets of the Lindo are not high-tech. Indeed, they’re unorthodox: from red wine for dinner and a surprising use for grated carrots to grandmotherly care and a constant supply of cabbage leaves. I never expected to give birth at the private hospital favoured by royals. I was fortunate my father-in-law insisted on paying the cost. The Lindo is the specialist private maternity and obstetrician unit at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, West London. Princess Diana gave birth to William and Harry there. A normal delivery sets you back at least £6,000, but costs can spiral to an eye-watering £10,000 if you need a Caesarean section, as I did. What do you get for that? Well, there’s a TV, jewellery safe and fridge in every room, and the food and wine list is restaurant standard. But what makes the Lindo unique is the exclusive attention of the most skilled obstetricians in the country. Kate has been attended by Alan Farthing, the Queen’s gynaecologist. From the moment she arrived at the Lindo, she will have been lavished with care by a team of dedicated nurses and midwives. The practical, old-fashioned tenets I was taught there — such as introducing a strict routine with my baby from day one — haven’t just helped me raise confident, happy children, they’ve also helped make us a happy, united family. A Union Flag flies outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge gave birth . A designated midwife tended me throughout my stay. She helped turn me and my husband from a frightened couple into confident parents. Max, a photographer, and I met at the newspaper where I was an executive: our son Zac was conceived on our wedding night. Three months into my pregnancy, I put myself under the care of obstetrician Guy Thorpe-Beeston, who shares consulting rooms in Harley Street with Alan Farthing. He recommended I book the Lindo. High profile: members of the media outside the Lindo Wing this week as the new baby prince was born . I saw Mr Thorpe-Beeston every two weeks and my pregnancy went smoothly. I didn’t read a single baby book or attend an antenatal class, having decided to leave all that until my maternity leave. Zac was due on May 17, 2000, and in early April I stopped working, preparing to put my feet up and start reading baby books. I’d not even finished the first chapter when, six days later, on April 27, my waters broke. Trying to control my rising panic, I rang Mr Thorpe-Beeston, who urged me to go straight to the Lindo. It took 12 minutes to get there — the longest 12 minutes of my life. The huge wooden doors opened and a nurse in a navy uniform and sensible shoes greeted me with a warm smile. She took my arm and guided me gently inside. ‘It’s Claire, isn’t it?’ she said. ‘I’m looking after you and I promise you’ll be absolutely fine. You need some rest before the baby comes.’ In that second, my fear floated away and this lovely middle-aged woman became my guardian angel. By the time Mr Thorpe-Beeston arrived at 11pm, I was tucked up in soft white sheets, with fresh flowers on my bedside table. Less hectic: police officers stand outside the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, a favourite with VIPs . My room was just how I imagine NHS maternity units used to be, with everything spotless. Hooked up to monitors and checked constantly, the hours passed in a blur as I drifted in and out of sleep, desperately hoping the contractions would start. But they didn’t. I’d been there for more than 24 hours when I was told I’d need a Caesarean. The baby was vulnerable to infection without his sac of amniotic fluid to protect him. Squeezing my hand, the midwife reassured me: ‘It will all work out well. You’ll soon have the loveliest baby in your arms.’ Our son was born at 4.16am on April 29. Though he was three weeks premature, he weighed a healthy 6lb 1oz. But he was so fragile I was allowed to hold him for only a few minutes before he was taken to the intensive care unit. The nurses comforted me until, 12 hours later, he was back in my arms. And then it hit me that I was responsible for the tiny creature I was cradling. I felt a mixture of unbelievable joy and terror. But that’s when the Lindo comes into its own. I was put in the care of Mary — a Mary Poppins in her mid-60s who had more experience than an army of grannies. I was guided through everything, from what I should eat to produce the best breast milk to bedtime rituals. Soon after the Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in London, police control the crowds . In order to speed up the production of milk and reduce swelling of the breasts, Mary had shown me how to place cabbage leaves inside my bra. It worked a treat and I was able to feed him within hours. As Zac was premature, Mary advised me to feed him for 15 minutes from each breast every three hours. As he gained weight, I was to increase this to every four hours. This old-fashioned routine worked like a charm. He fed easily and slept beautifully. She also showed me a great trick to prevent my breasts getting sore — sleeping with grated carrot inside my bra. The carrot toughened up the nipples, meaning that when Zac was placed on my breast in the morning it didn’t hurt. Mary instructed me and Max how to wind our baby by putting him across our knees, then gently rubbing his back. Her lessons were invaluable: Zac never had colic. She also advised me to sleep when Zac took his nap. ‘Your body needs to rest in order to produce good milk,’ she said. I carried on this ritual until I went back to work when he was ten months old. Perhaps the best thing about the Lindo is the way it forges a bond between father and baby. Every day, Max and I had lessons together in the creche. Mary insisted we took turns changing nappies and cleaning Zac’s bottom, using dampened cotton wool pads rather than baby wipes, which can be too harsh. Best of all, Mary suggested Max make a habit of bathing Zac while I rested. ‘It will be your special time with him,’ she said. I can’t thank her enough. Max never felt pushed out and would rush home to be with Zac. Hearing our son gurgle with glee as his father bathed him was magical. I expect Lindo staff will be sending out Prince William to buy a case of expensive red wine — not for him, but for Kate. ‘Mummy needs to drink half a glass of good red wine every evening with her supper,’ Mary told Max. ‘It will relax her, so she produces lots of lovely milk for Zac’s last feed of the day. That will help him sleep through the night.’ When I walked down the steps of the Lindo with five-day-old Zac in my arms, it was a wrench to leave, but I knew I’d been given something precious — instruction in how to be a good mother.","I was put in the care of Mary, in her mid-60s who had more experience than an army of grannies .

The senior Crown lawyer who played a pivotal role in the conviction of two of Stephen Lawrence’s killers was today named the country’s top prosecutor. Alison Saunders, 52, is to succeed human rights barrister Keir Starmer QC as Director of Public Prosecutions later this year. The married mother-of-two - currently chief prosecutor in London - has overseen some of the country’s highest profile murder cases during her 27 year career in the Crown Prosecution Service. New appointment: Alison Saunders, pictured left, will take over the position of Director of Public Prosecutions from Keir Starmer QC at the end of the year . But she is best known for making the landmark decision to prosecute Gary Dobson and David Norris over the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. The pair, two of the original five murder suspects, were jailed for life last year after a forensic breakthrough in the case. Prior to their trial, Mrs Saunders had to navigate complex legal issues as Dobson had been previously acquitted of Stephen’s murder, and had to be prosecuted under the new double jeopardy laws. She becomes the first DPP directly appointed from within the CPS, and only the second woman in history to take up the role. High profile: Mrs Saunders made the landmark decision to prosecute two men over the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, pictured . Police chiefs and senior detectives regard her as a straight-talker who is not afraid to make finely balanced charging decisions. Married to a leading defence barrister, she is expected to adopt a lower profile than the man she is succeeding as the country’s top prosecutor. Her appointment follows Mr Starmer’s decision to step down as DPP at the end of October. She will take up her new post on November 1. It is understood Mrs Saunders beat off competition from senior CPS lawyer Alison Levitt QC to land the job. Ms Levitt is overseeing the prosecutions of dozens of journalists and police officers arrested under Operation Weeting and Operation Elveden. Attorney General Dominic Grieve said: ‘Alison will make an excellent Director of Public Prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years. ‘I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service.’ Mrs Saunders said: ‘I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next Director of Public Prosecutions. ‘To lead an organisation of committed and professional staff is an honour, especially having worked for the CPS since its inception. ‘I look forward to carrying on with the fantastic work that Keir Starmer QC has undertaken, ensuring the CPS further improves and continuing with reforms, both within the CPS and more widely in the criminal justice system.’ Mr Starmer, who has faced criticism over some of his public pronouncements while DPP, said: ‘I have had the privilege of working with Alison Saunders for five years. She has been an outstanding leader within the CPS and she will make a first rate DPP.’ Court case: Gary Dobson, pictured left, and David Norris, right, went on trial for the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Both men denied the charge but they were found guilty by a jury .","Mother-of-two Alison Saunders is currently the chief prosecutor in London .

Dozens of people have been hospitalised in Italy after eating pesto sauce contaminated with Botulinum. More than 50 people, who had eaten jarred pesto from a local producer, sought help at local hospitals after suffering symptoms including vomiting, diarrhoea and high fevers. Tests on the pesto showed the presence of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which produces the toxin Botulinum, used cosmetically by television personalities such as Simon Cowell. When ingested the toxin causes a life-threatening kind of food poisoning. A local brand of Italian green pesto, made with basil (see stock picture), has been linked with Botox contamination after more than 50 people were hospitalised . Health and food safety workers were inundated with calls through the weekend requesting information on the scare. The victims are almost all from the area around Genoa, the birthplace of the famous pasta sauce, the Italian newspaper La Repubblica reported. Six of those admitted, including two children, were kept in overnight for observation as further tests are carried out. The local producer responsible for the outbreak has been growing the area’s renowned basil for almost two centuries, but only recently started selling pre-prepared jars of the sauce. Bruzzone and Ferrari alerted health authorities on Friday pulling the jars from supermarket shelves. The company said: ‘We made the discovery during our own tests and analysis of our fresh product, non pasteurised product, which contains no preservatives’. Local newspaper Il Secolo XIX reported on Saturday that Stefano Bruzzone, one of the company's owners, as saying: 'In one sample we found level of substances which forced us to recall a whole batch of the product.' Tests on the pesto showed the presence of the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which produces the toxin Botulinum, used cosmetically to hide wrinkles and known as Botox . He told the paper they have done everything they should do to  take care of their customers, spending 25,000 euros a year on laboratory analyses to avoid such episodes. He added that the tests were still in progression. But today's national newspaper La Stampa reports: ‘In one of the batches of Pesto di Pra produced by the old established company Ferrari e Bruzone, in an internal test, the germs responsible for the toxin Cloostridium botulium have been found.’ The botulinum toxin can occur in conserves and jarred foods and attacks the nervous system. While it usually causes similar symptoms to food poisoning including vomiting, stomach pains and fever it can in extreme cases cause psychosis and even death. The name pesto comes from 'pestello', the Italian word for the pestle which was once used to grind basil, garlic and cheese into the well-loved sauce. The earliest known record of the sauce is an 1865 cookbook ‘Genovese Recipes’ in which it is defined as ‘beaten basil and garlic which is used to season pasta’.","More than 50 people hospitalised from pesto contaminated with Botulinum .

It also poses two of the greatest cosmic challenges any astrologer could find in the chart of a newborn. This is a royal who will grow up in a time of turmoil and will eventually preside over an era of marvels. He will be a leader whose name will be remembered for the rest of time as the rule-breaker who became a peacemaker. The announcement: The Queen's Press Secretary Ailsa Anderson, with Badar Azim, a footman, placing the official document proclaiming the birth of the baby boy . Children born in the few hours just before the Moon becomes precisely full — as it did at 7.16pm last night — tend to grow up troubled, but talented. They tend to feel tension and estrangement more closely than most and though they often grow into exceptional people, it is usually because they have had to deal with so many issues at an early age. This is the chart of a childhood that cannot be entirely easy. Unlikely though it may seem to us, given what we know (or think we know) of the Royal Family, there’s a suggestion of pressures close to home that will make great demands on this young man. Yet for all this drama and trauma, William and Kate’s son will find an inner reserve of strength that shapes his character and moulds him into a truly charismatic monarch. His story will be full of hard-won victories and narrow escapes — and these themes will run through the story of his subjects. I base this prediction on far more than just the fact the new arrival is a sensitive Cancerian, just like his father and his grandmother Diana. New parents: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's newborn has been born at an auspicious time . Though the sign of Leo began just a couple of minutes after he drew his first breath, he is a Cancerian through and through, even though he was born so close to the end of this sign and his father was born at the beginning of it. The newborn Prince has the Moon in Capricorn and Scorpio rising. These are tricky influences — Moon in Capricorn people can be harshly self-critical and those with Scorpio rising can guard their privacy jealously — and there are other fascinating factors in his chart. Just a few hours before his birth, Venus moved from Leo to Virgo, suggesting that babies born this week will be blessed with clever, inquiring minds. Star sign: The boy is a sensitive Cancerian, just like his father and his grandmother Diana . And all this happened just as Mercury ended a particularly difficult retrograde phase. Children born when Mercury is retrograde tend to be thinkers rather than doers. So it is almost as if the royal baby waited until he was a week overdue in order to pick up every possible astrological advantage to counteract the two most powerful potential downsides of his birth chart. Children born so close to the monthly lunar culmination invariably lead charmed yet challenging lives. Furthermore, a sharp opposition between Mars and Pluto is close enough to be exerting an influence and that’s an omen of lifelong strife and struggle. Yet as readers of my column will know, this is a special week for another reason. A phenomenon known as a Watery Grand Trine is being formed in the sky between Neptune in Pisces, Saturn in Scorpio plus the conjunction of Jupiter and Mars in Cancer. Many experts are calling this a harmonic convergence and seeing it as a once-in-a- lifetime opportunity to heal the world, promote a culture of greater spirituality and increase an awareness of the need for world peace. This child inherits the spirit of this convergence, carries it for his lifetime and, despite trials and tribulations, will become a deeply influential force for good.","New arrival is a sensitive Cancerian, just like his father and Princess Diana ."

A man kicked and crushed to death a 6-pound Yorkshire Terrier that ran from her owner and now claims it was self defense and police agree with him. Precious, a 6-year-old toy Yorkie, got loose from owner Donna Limbaugh, 72, while she was reading the newspaper in front of her home and ran down their Olathe, Kansas street. He began barking at Limbaugh’s neighbor Carl Henrichson and his much larger Labrador when Henrichson launched him four feet into the air with a swift kick and then crushed him under his boots. Scroll down for video... Self-defense? A man stepped on and killed this 6-pound Yorkie named Precious and claims it was in self-defense and in defense of his Labrador . A tearful Limbaugh recounted her side of events to KSHB: . ‘He put his foot on her and then he raised the other foot so that he actually stood on her. It actually reminded me of if you were going to step on a bug.’ While they both agree that Henrichson stepped on the dog, Henrichson claims he did so on accident. But Precious’s injures might tell a different tale. Aggrieved: Donna Limbaugh says neighbor Carl Henrichson kicked her Yorkie and stomped her with both feet but police gave her a citation, not Henrichson . ‘I picked her up. She was crying, screaming, making these terrible noises,’ Limbaugh said. ‘[She was] having trouble breathing and he said to me: Donna, you need to have better control of your dog.’ Precious was taken to veterinarians with lung and brain injuries and later died. Henrichson also blamed Limbaugh when he, too, was interviewed by KSHB. ‘It was an extremely unfortunate incident’ he said. ‘But if Ms. Limbaugh had had her dog on a leash, her dog wouldn't have attacked my dog, wouldn't have attempted to bite my dog and frankly you and I wouldn't even be talking today.’ Didn't mean to: Carl Henrichson says Precious was a nuisance dog and does not deny stomping her, but says it was an accident . Police investigated the incident, reports KCTV, and they too are blaming the aggrieved Limbaugh. Olathe police issued her citations for not having a license, not having her dog on a leash, and nuisance violation. Now neighbors are taking sides and filing police reports, some in support of Henrichson and others supporting Limbaugh. Limbaugh, meanwhile, will file a restraining order against Henrichson and says she no longer feels safe in the neighborhood. Though Limbaugh does not deny her dog ran toward Henrichson, she does deny there was any way he truly believed 6-pound Precious was a threat. ‘Precious was little, sweet…loving,’ Limbaugh said. ‘She was my baby.’ Unsafe: Limbaugh has set up a this memorial on the sidewalk where Precious was fatally injured. She says she no longer feels safe in the neighborhood and intends to get a restraining order against Henrichson .","Donna Limbaugh's 6-year-old Yorkie died after her neighbor stomped on it .

A senior Italian politician is facing calls to resign after likening the country’s first black Cabinet minister to an orangutan. Roberto Calderoli, vice-president of the Senate – Italy’s upper house – and a leader of the anti-immigrant Northern League party, made the remarks about immigration minister Cecile Kyenge at a party rally. ‘When I see images of Kyenge I cannot help think, even if I don’t say that she is one, of a resemblance to an orangutan,’ he said. For most of the day, Calderoli said he had no intention of resigning and offered only a qualified apology. ‘I did not mean to offend and if . minister Kyenge was offended I am sorry, but my comment was made within a . much broader political speech that criticised the minister and her . policies,’ he said. But after hours of nearly universal . condemnation and extensive coverage by the international media, . Calderoli called Kyenge in the evening to apologise directly. She had done well to become a minister, he said, but ‘perhaps she should do it in her own country’. Miss . Kyenge, 48, is a Congolese-born doctor who has lived in Italy since . 1983 and became a minister in April. She declined to comment on Mr . Calderoli’s remarks. Prime . Minister Enrico  Letta has denounced the comments as ‘unacceptable’ and . ‘beyond every limit’. And several ministers said Mr Calderoli should . step down from his Senate position. Politicians, including some from his own party, lambasted Calderoli, with some calling for him to resign as Senate vice president. In an official statement and on Twitter, Prime Minister Enrico Letta said the comments were unacceptable. ‘They go beyond all limits. Full solidarity and support to Cecile. Forward with your and our work,’ Letta said. ‘I just spoke with minister Kyenge and I apologised,’ Calderoli told state news agency Ansa. Racist slur: Calderoli also said immigration minister Cecile Kyenge, pictured, should 'be a minister in her own country, and was later forced to apologise . Kyenge . is campaigning to make it easier for immigrants to gain citizenship, . and she backs a law that would automatically make anyone born on Italian . soil a citizen. Last month, . a Northern League member in the European parliament was expelled from . the eurosceptic Europe of Freedom and Democracy group for making racist . remarks about her. Mario Borghezio had attacked Kyenge for wanting to impose ‘tribal traditions’ in Italy as a member of a ‘bonga bonga’ government, an apparent play on the so-called ‘bunga bunga’ parties of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Opposition politician Calderoli, twice a cabinet minister under Berlusconi, has often caused offence. In 2006, he was forced to resign as reform minister after displaying a T-shirt mocking the Prophet Mohammad during a state news broadcast. The same year, after Italy won the soccer World Cup, he disparaged the opposing French team, which he said had lost because its players were ‘niggers, Muslims and communists’. Before Calderoli's apology, Kyenge told AGI news agency he should think of his responsibility as a senior Senate member. ‘I don't want to address Calderoli the person, but as a representative of an institution: reflect on what you want to represent through your language,’ she said.","Roberto Calderoli made remark about immigration minister Cecile Kyenge .

He also demanded the release of all Al Qaeda and Taliban suspects around the world. Concern is mounting over the fate of kidnapped American contractor Warren Weinstein . 'Just as the Americans detain all whom . they suspect of links to Al Qaeda and the Taliban, even remotely, we . detained this man who is neck-deep in American aid to Pakistan since the . 1970s,' al-Zawahri said, according to a translation provided by the . SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors militant messages. The 31-minute video appeared on Jihadi websites, according to SITE. 'I tell the captive soldiers of Al . Qaeda and the Taliban and our female prisoners held in the prisons of . the crusaders and their collaborators: ""We have not forgotten you, and . in order to free you we have taken hostage the Jewish American Warren .

'He could also leave him in . captivity for years and, if he does something stupid, kill him.' 'Your problem is not with us but with . (U.S. President Barack) Obama. We have raised fair demands ... So . continue to pressure Obama, if you want your relative to be handed . back,' Zawahri said, addressing Weinstein’s family.

World Trade Center, and Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman, serving a life . sentence for plotting to attack the United Nations headquarters and . other New York City landmarks. Mr Weinstein was abducted by at least eight armed men from his house in the eastern city of Lahore on August 13. The house was protected by security . but the captors were able to overpower and tied up Mr Weinstein's three . guards, and pistol-whipped his driver. Weinstein, . about 70 years old, had been working on a project in Pakistan’s . northwestern tribal areas where Pakistani troops have been battling . Islamist insurgents for years. Police and U.S. officials have not . publicly said who they believed was holding him, but Islamist militant . groups were the main suspects. Mr Weinstein, who has a home in Rockville, Maryland, worked in Pakistan for several years and spoke Urdu. He was the country director in . Pakistan for J.E.

He had told his staff that would be . wrapping up his latest project and moving out of Pakistan, police . official Tajammal Hussain told AP. Mr Weinstein is based in Lahore and . has been in Pakistan for seven years. The company headquarters' website . describes Weinstein as a development expert with 25 years experience and . a Ph.D. in international law and economics. He was in charge of a program that has been trying to help strengthen the competitiveness of various Pakistani industries. The company has said Mr Weinstein is . in poor health and provided a detailed list of medications, many of them . for heart problems, that it implored the kidnappers to give him. Official documents: A copy of Weinstein's passport was released after his kidnapping . 'He's a short, funny man with a quick wit,' said Raza Rumi, a Pakistani journalist who last saw Mr Weinstein about a year ago. 'He's a very laid-back guy, not too worried about security issues, not really paranoid at all.' Al-Zawahri took over Al Qaeda this . year after Osama Bin Laden was killed in May by U.S. SEALs at his . hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad. Twelve days after Mr Weinstein's . abduction on August 13, Lahore police said he had been freed, but they . then retracted the claim. Militant organisations frequently . target foreigners in Pakistan, although it is rare for assailants to . stage such a raid on a victim's home.

Surveillance: Israeli military officials said Jabari was identified by 'precise intelligence' gathered over several months . Fears of war: Immediate calls for revenge were broadcast over Hamas radio and smaller groups also warned of retaliation against Israel . The upgrade would give the Palestinians a place in the world body similar to that of the Vatican - short of full membership as a sovereign state but as close as they can get without the full recognition that Israel says can only come from a peace treaty. Ransomed soldier: Jabari has been blamed in particular for the kidnapping of Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit in 2006 . A draft document from the office of Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, said Israel must confront this challenge by means that could include 'toppling (Abbas) and dismantling the Palestinian Authority'. Newspaper reports say Israel instructed its ambassadors to warn it may revoke all or part of the 1993 Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation, which set up the Palestinian Authority under an interim peace agreement. The Palestinians are currently an observer 'entity' at the United Nations. An upgrade could grant them access to bodies such as the International Criminal Court in The Hague, where they might file legal suits against Israel. Targeted killings are controversial . but advocates say they are an effective deterrent without the . complications associated with a ground operation, chiefly civilian and . Israeli troop casualties. Proponents argue they also prevent future . attacks by removing their masterminds. Critics . say they invite retaliation by militants and encourage them to try to . assassinate Israeli leaders. They complain that the strikes amount to . extrajudicial killings.

The radical cleric, who had been deported from Britain to his homeland earlier this month to face a retrial on terrorism charges, is being held in a high-security prison near the capital Amman. He had been convicted in his absence of conspiring to carry out terrorist attacks against Israelis, Americans and other Westerners in Jordan in two foiled plots in 1999 and 2000. Facing justice: Abu Qatada will go on trial in Jordan . However now the 53-year-old Muslim preacher is receiving a new trial. The prosecutor, who cannot be identified under court regulations, did not elaborate on the reason for his decision, although terrorism suspects are rarely granted bail. Qatada is currently being held in Muwaqqar Jail outside Amman, where he shares a cell with 15 other inmates. Many of the prisoners have been sentenced or charged with offences against state security.

The two women are currently staying in the hospital wing of the facility in Rancho Mirage, California, and have already run into each other, reports TMZ. The 35-year-old mother of Charlie Sheen's twin sons is said to have chosen the clinic because she wanted to carry out her substance abuse treatment alongside Lohan, according to RadarOnline. Same rehab: Brooke Mueller, pictured with her twin sons Bob and Max in 2011, entered the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California alongside Lindsay Lohan . Mueller was not legally bound to enter rehab after her four-year-old sons Bob and Max were removed from her care last week by officials who allegedly found them living in 'shocking conditions.' She is also not guaranteed to regain custody of the two boys after her rehab stint, reports RadarOnline, after they were placed in the care of Sheen's other ex wife Denise Richards. The Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services reportedly didn’t want the socialite to enter the Betty Ford Center because of Lohan's presence. It's unsure how well the two women . know each other, but they do both share a strong connection in Charlie . Sheen, Mueller's ex husband and Lindsay's self appointed mentor. Self-appointed mentor: Sheen offered his support to Lohan in March, claiming he felt a 'kinship' with her . Charlie recently expressed a desire . to mentor the star, and even offered to give her money during one of her . particularly troubled periods. Lindsay also recently guest starred in . Charlie's hit television show Anger Management. 'I have a kinship with somebody who . clearly needs a mentor, whether she wants one or not,' he said in March. 'She can continue to hang out with her dress-shredding club buddies, or . turn to me for some advice from a guy who's been down the road as well . as every other side trail on the journey.' 'If she listens, she'll win. If she doesn't, that's on her,' he added. This is not the first time Richards has taken in the boys, who are the younger half-siblings of her two oldest daughters. Hands-on mother: Denise Richards, 42, took her older daughters Lola and Sam along with her as she visited her younger daughter Eloise at preschool on Thursday in Los Angeles . Richards also stepped in last year to look after the twins while Brooke underwent a different stint in rehab. Mueller was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold at the UCLA Medical Center for two days last week before checking out of the hospital on Friday. The twins were removed from her home during her involuntary stay at the hospital. She checked in again on Sunday for short-term rehab and later will move into a longer rehab program. Renowned facility: The Betty Ford Center is a non-profit that offers inpatient, outpatient and day treatment for those suffering from drug and substance abuse . Also on Friday, a judge officially accepted the Betty Ford Center as a suitable alternative for Lohan's 90-day court-order treatment after she failed to check into the court-appointed Seafield facility lat Thursday. Judge Jim Dabney gave Lohan the okay to enter Betty Ford, but gave prosecutors until Friday to file any objections. According to TMZ, both the Los Angeles and Santa Monica City Attorneys have given the okay for her to remain where she is. Meanwhile, Lohan's The Canyons' costar James Deen has said that he misses the actress and wishes her well in rehab after accusing her of acting like a diva on set, reports RadarOnline. The 27-year-old porn star, who recently starred in Teen Mom Farrah Abraham's first skin flick, said that after his experience dealing with a reality star, Lohan seemed fine in comparison. 'Honestly, after this whole experience I really do miss Lindsay,' he said. 'I’ve been taught that movie star and reality star is very different and I just miss Lindsay.' Clearing the air: Lohan's The Canyons' costar James Deen, pictured with the star in LA last August, has admitted he 'misses' the actress . And Lindsay's parents Michael and Dina also seem to have found peace after Michael finally paid back the $30,400 in child support he owed his ex-wife. 'I admit that I withheld part of my child support because of my anger . toward Dina, but I now want to admit that I was wrong for doing it and . have made things right,' he told told Radar. As for Lindsay, he is hoping to move her to another rehab facility after she checked into Betty Ford last Thursday for her court-mandated stay. 'I would like Dina and Lindsay to consider having Lindsay go to the Lukens Institute because it is more private (only 8 people), it’s not 12-Step, it gives 6 hours of psychotherapy and its success rate is higher than any place I have experienced,' Michael said.

"The most common causes of injury death were vehicle crashes . PUBLISHED: . 07:32 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:55 EST, 24 July 2013 . Large cities in the United States are safer than their rural counterparts, a new study has claimed. Researchers have found that the risk of injury and death is 20 per cent greater in the countryside than in inner city urban areas across the States. The most common causes of 'injury death' were vehicle crashes, according to the American study, due to be published tomorrow. Large cities in the United States are safer than their rural counterparts, a new study has claimed. New York's Times Square, once a hotbed of crime, is now a global tourist attraction thronged with families . A study, which is due to be published tomorrow, analysed the deaths of 1.3million people from injury between 1999 and 2006. It analysed the deaths of 1.3million people from injury between 1999 and 2006. Study author Sage Myers of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, said: 'Cars, guns and drugs are the unholy trinity causing the majority of injury deaths in the U.S. 'Although the risk of homicide is higher in big cities, the risk of unintentional injury death is 40 percent higher in the most rural areas than in the most urban. 'And overall, the rate of unintentional injury dwarfs the risk of homicide, with the rate of unintentional injury more than 15 times that of homicide among the entire population. 'This has important implications about staffing of emergency departments and trauma care systems in rural areas, which tend to be undeserved as it is.' The most common causes of injury death were road accidents with researchers noting 27.61 deaths per 100,000 people in most rural areas and 10.58 per 100,000 in most urban areas. Researchers have found that the risk of injury and death 20 per cent greater in the countryside than in urban areas across the States . Though the risk of gun-related deaths showed no difference in the rural and urban areas, experts did find that they were significantly higher in rural areas for children and people 45 years and older. The teams found that race was also a factor with rural counties with large black populations having significantly lower risk of injury death than those with small black populations. But the opposite was true for Latino populations, with countryside counties with large Latino populations noting significantly higher risk of injury death than those with smaller populations. It also found that  rural middle class areas with lots of college-educated residents and average income had significantly increased risk of injury death compared to rural counties with the lowest levels of each. 'By digging deep into the data, we may be able to tailor injury prevention efforts to the populations that need them, such as seniors in cities who are more likely to fall and rural children who are more likely to drown,' said Dr Myers.","Researchers studied deaths of 1.3m people from city and country in America .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:18 EST, 24 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:46 EST, 24 July 2013 . The rabies-infected man whose organs went to four people, including a kidney recipient who died, is now revealed to have been bitten by raccoons at least twice in the months before he died. Tests have now also confirmed his rabies-infected kidney caused the recipient's disease and subsequent death and that the rabies originated from raccoons. Doctors initially attributed the death of U.S. Air Force recruit William Edward Small to other causes, but an investigation prompted by the kidney recipient's death in February found evidence of rabies in the Small’s brain tissue and also brain inflammation, which can be caused by rabies. No idea: William Edward Small, 20, had been in the military just a short time when he died and his organs were donated to four recipients in four states. Doctors at the time thought he'd eaten tainted fish . The virus was consistent with raccoon rabies and was nearly identical to a virus found in the transplanted kidney and other tissue from the recipient, an Army veteran from Maryland, said the report, compiled by researchers from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others and published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Investigators don't know if organs given to three other patients — the Small’s heart, liver and second kidney-were infected with the rabies virus, but all three were considered at risk. Their recipients received anti-rabies treatment ‘and to date remain well,’ said CDC researcher Dr. Neil Vora, the lead author. Unfortunate: Small's son Shane is seen here with his mother Alecia Mercer. When Mercer learned that Small had died of rabies, she wasn't surprised. 'He did a lot of trapping and hunting and stuff.' she said, though Small was never tested . Warning signs: A wall of Small's bedroom in Trenton, North Carolina. It has been revealed that Small was bitten by two raccoons prior to his death from rabies and the farming of his organs that killed one kidney recipient . While the case is rare, it underscores the need to improve screening for would-be organ donors with suspected encephalitis, the report's authors say. They say a uniform donor questionnaire could help better identify risk factors for the virus and that rabies should be considered in donors with unexplained encephalitis. Doctors in Florida didn't test 20-year-old Small for rabies before he died and his heart, liver and kidneys were donated to recipients in Florida, Georgie, Illinois and Maryland. The recipient in Maryland received an infected kidney and died 18 months after Small. The patients who received the man's other organs started getting the rabies vaccine this month, but none of them has shown symptoms of the rare disease. Tragic: Small showed signs of rabies before his death, but his body wasn't tested for the disease before his organs were farmed out to four recipients in four states, one of whom died 18 months later . Deadly: It took 18 months for the kidney recipient to die of a rabies infection, which is almost unheard of. The further from the brain, the longer the infection takes to spread. Small was bitten months before his death . Rabies is a deadly viral infection that usually occurs when a person is bitten by an infected animal. The most common animal to infect humans is the raccoon, and some believe incidences will rise as the creatures become more common in urbanized areas. The time between the infection and when symptoms occur, the incubation period, ranges from as short as 10 days to as long as seven years. The average period is three to 12 weeks. Symptoms generally include: drooling, convulsions, excitability, loss of muscle function, muscle spasms, numbness and tingling, difficulty swallowing. Untreated, rabies can lead to coma and death. Once rabies symptoms appear, the person infected rarely survives the disease, even with treatment. An estimated 55,000 deaths from rabies occur around the world each year. An estimated two deaths from rabies occur in the U.S. each year. The majority of those infected die from respiratory failure, which typically occurs within seven days from when symptoms begin. Alecia Mercer, the mother of his young son, originally revealed that Small was the infected donor. Mercer said she wasn't surprised to learn that Small had died of rabies, and not a stomach virus as she’d been told, because he liked to hunt and trap animals. 'He did a lot of trapping and hunting and stuff,' she said. 'He did the trapping, and he didn't care what the animal looked like. He just picked it up.' Small had been in the Air Force for 17 weeks before he died. He was in Florida to train as aviation mechanic. He visited a clinic at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in August 2011 for abdominal pain and vomiting and was transferred to a civilian hospital four days later . Small's initial symptoms included nausea, vomiting and fever — which could indicate rabies but also other less serious conditions that are much more common. Doctors thought Small had eaten tainted fish. The United Network for Organ Sharing issued guidance last year to help organ procurement organizations screen for encephalitis and other central nervous system infections in potential donors. It urged caution in accepting organs from donors with an untreated central nervous system infection. The researchers want to improve awareness that rabies can be the cause of encephalitis, said co-author Dr. Sridhar Basavaraju, another CDC researcher. But he added, ‘We wouldn't want to mandate any screening that would potentially exclude transplantable organs.’ The study is based on a review of laboratory tests and medical records, and interviews with relatives of the organ donor and recipient. It provides the most detailed account of the chain of events that led to the two deaths and the investigation that followed, which prompted health authorities to recommend vaccines for dozens of people who were in contact with the donor or recipients. The case attracted public attention . because of the rare circumstances, including the long time between . infection and death of the transplant recipient — about a year and a . half. It was just the third documented transmission of rabies through a solid organ transplant, the report says. East Coast problem: As this 2010 map shows, rabies-infected raccoons are most common along the Eastern Seaboard. Small was likely infected during a hunting trip in Florida prior to his death in 2011 . More widespread: Bats are another animal more likely than others to transmit rabies to humans and infected animals occur throughout the U.S. Also, there are only roughly two human rabies deaths in the United States each year, and all but two domestic cases between 2000 and 2010 were linked to bats, according to the report. The authors say raccoons pose an under-recognized risk for infection and their spread into urban areas raises concern. The patient who received the North Carolina donor's kidney at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. in September 2011 has not been publicly identified. Investigators say they learned during subsequent interviews that Small trapped raccoons for use as bait during hunting-dog training exercises, and had been bitten at least twice by the animals, 18 months and seven months before developing symptoms. He was not treated for those bites. ‘If you don't ask specific questions, you don't get specific answers,’ said Dr. Michael Green, chairman of an advisory committee on disease transmission for the United Network for Organ Sharing. ‘At the time these questions are being asked initially, families are often traumatized, in shock,’ Green said. ‘They're losing a loved one. They may not be thinking normally or straight or remember all those details.’","William Edward Small was an avid wild animal trapper and showed evidence of rabies infection .
