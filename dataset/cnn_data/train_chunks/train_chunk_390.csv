"Some important lessons and grudge matches of the just-concluded government spending battle, and some faces to watch as we move into 2015 and 2016 -- those topics filled our trip around the ""Inside Politics"" table Sunday. John King and other top political reporters empty out their notebooks each Sunday to reveal five things that will be in the headlines in the days, weeks and months ahead. 1. In losing, did Democrats lay down an important 2015 marker? Liberals didn't like the $1.1 trillion spending bill that passed Saturday night for a host of reasons, most notably provisions that eased some restrictions on big banks and allowed big political contributors to give even more money. So they protested -- loudly -- about the details and the process, including venting anger that President Obama was supporting the compromise. House Democratic leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi at one point said members were being ""blackmailed."" In the end, liberals lost. But Julie Hirschfeld Davis of The New York Times reports Democrats are hoping the president takes notice, and perhaps grows more willing to use his veto pen in battles with the new Republican Congress in 2015. ""They were able to keep together enough Democrats to show that they could sustain a presidential veto, if indeed one is needed,"" explained Hirschfeld Davis. ""That was a big subtext of what they were doing this past week: to show that next year, 'You're gonna need us, so just remember that as you look at what's coming down the pipeline from Republicans, you can't take House Democrats for granted,'"" continued Hirschfeld Davis, adding that Obama will need the Democrats to roll back some of the things the GOP wants to do to with his agenda. 2. Sorry senator, no perks for you . The Senate is a place of time-honored tradition. Well, it used to be. Recent days have been full of accounts about how freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas surprised his Republican leadership with his actions during the spending debate. In the old days, senators would at least give their leaders a heads up when they planned to make a point. Not anymore. And Ed O'Keefe of The Washington Post took us inside another example of the changing times. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, by virtue of his tenure, holds the largely ceremonial post of president pro tempore of the Senate. In the old days, when control shifted to the other party, it was usually the case that some of that position's perks (like a car and driver) would be left in place. But GOP leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has some issues with Leahy, and O'Keefe detailed a bit of inside maneuvering to make a point. ""The reason? Because Pat Leahy has stood in the way as a member of the Appropriations Committee of allowing even more changes to campaign finance laws that McConnell wanted to be added to the bill,"" said O'Keefe. ""So a little bit of petty fighting only over about $200,000 at the most, but it didn't happen -- so Leahy loses all the trappings of the office,"" O'Keefe added. 3. The junior senator from Virginia is worth watching . Tim Kaine is in the middle of some interesting debates these days, and is someone worth watching as both parties deal with the new dynamics of Congress and the run-up to the 2016 presidential campaign. Kaine is the junior senator from Virginia, a former Democratic governor and one-time close ally of Obama. But he is at odds with the administration over its approach to ISIS, and Nia-Malika Henderson of The Washington Post told us that isn't the only big political debate where we should keep an eye on Kaine. ""It'll be interesting to see how he elevates his profile and builds his portfolio over these next months. He was a 'no' vote in terms of Harry Reid returning to leadership ... and in some ways, he's with the party on Keystone, things like that, but he's also been sort of critical of this move to anti-Wall Street,"" explained Henderson, adding that we should look for Kaine in 2016. ""Certainly, if Hillary runs, he might be on that short list for VP as he was for Obama in 2008."" 4. Off to Iowa, for Costa and a Clinton rival looking to make his mark . Robert Costa of The Washington Post is off to Iowa in the days ahead, and not for some farm state holiday shopping. Or not just for that reason, anyway. He's reporting on the latest visit of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an Independent who caucuses with the Democrats and is gearing up for the 2016 presidential nominating contest. Most Democrats think Hillary Clinton is the runaway favorite, and many liberals who like Sanders are openly wishing Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will join the race. But Costa smartly notes there is good reason to keep an eye on Sanders. ""I think Sanders looks at what's happening in the party with Sen. Warren, with his own efforts against banks, and he thinks yes, he's a long-shot contender, but because he's out there giving speeches, really engaging with a lot of the core Democratic base voters, it means he thinks he does have a shot,"" said Costa. 5. More signs Jeb Bush is running -- including tensions with Camp Romney . Jeb Bush is sending more signs he is likely to run for president, and they are causing a reaction that has many top Republicans buzzing. The former Florida governor plans to release some 250,000 emails from his two terms in office and to write a book describing how the emails detail his political philosophy. ""He's doing what no other potential candidate is doing --  being completely transparent and accessible,"" a top Bush political adviser tells ""Inside Politics."" Make no mistake, it's as much a message to Camp Clinton as it is fellow Republicans: The State Department has been slow to release documents from Clinton's days as secretary of state, and Bush is only too happy to draw a contrast. But what has Republicans buzzing more than that is the repeated pot shots between Camps Bush and Romney in the past week or so, in reports about Bush's political maneuvering or about his venture capital work. The question is whether this is genuine tension between the principals -- both GOP establishment favorites -- or whether this is more of a staff feud, as we still see from time to time between the 2008 Obama and Clinton teams. ""I don't think both run, and I think Mitt is the less likely,"" says a leading GOP activist with ties to both the Bush and Romney camps. ""But this back and forth will go on a while."" Why? ""Remember Stuart and Murphy do not get along."" As in top Romney adviser Stuart Stevens and top Bush (and onetime Romney) confidant Mike Murphy.","Dem Sen.

"The families of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and other unarmed black men felled by bullets or police force filled a podium in the nation's capital. ""This is a history-making moment,"" said Garner's mother, Gwen Carr. ""It's just so overwhelming to see all who have come to stand with us. Look at the masses -- black, white, all races, all religions. ... We need to stand like this at all times."" Invoking the familiar names of black men who died at the hands of police, tens of thousands marched throughout the nation on Saturday to protest what they see as rampant racial injustice. The throngs -- young and old, black and white -- took to the streets in major cities, including New York, Washington, Boston, San Francisco and Oakland, California. In Washington, a crowd of thousands snaked up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol in a protest that evoked memories of past civil rights marches. The crowds appear to represent a burgeoning movement sparked by the decisions of grand juries in Missouri and New York not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men. Garner died in July when New York police officers on Staten Island wrestled him to the ground, with one of the officers wrapping his arm around Garner's neck. Four mothers share pain of losing sons . 'Sea of people"" ""What a sea of people,"" said Lesley McSpadden, the mother of Michael Brown, who was fatally shot by a Ferguson, Missouri, officer in August. ""If they don't see this and make a change, then I don't know what we got to do."" Thousands marched in Boston, starting at the Massachusetts State Capitol. Police arrested 23 people on disorderly conduct charges, according to the Massachusetts State Police. One man was charged with assault and battery on a police officer. From New York's Washington Square Park, thousands marched to police headquarters chanting ""I can't breathe"" -- Garner's last words -- and ""How do you spell racist: NYPD."" The march was largely peaceful, although a protester from a splinter group hurled a garbage can through the window of an NYPD traffic car. ""I stand here as a black man who is afraid of the police,who is afraid of never knowing when my life might end, never knowing when I might be ... gunned down by a vigilante or a security guard or a police officer,"" said marcher Ahmad Greene-Hayes. Michaela Angela Davis, a writer and frequent CNN guest who participated in the march, said the demonstrations signal a lasting movement. ""The collective self-esteem that's happening with these young people is really powerful,"" she said. ""They know they are part of history."" Map: Protests around the country . Isolated ugly incidents . From coast to coast, the protests were peaceful, but there were at least two instances of violence reported by police in New York and Oakland, California. In New York City, two police officers were allegedly assaulted by a group of protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge as they attempted to arrest a man trying to throw something at police. The officers were treated for their injuries at a local hospital, police said. The group ""attempted to steal their portable radios and tear away their police identification jackets,"" said police spokesman John Miller. Afterward, police recovered a bag containing three hammers and a black mask. Authorities have arrested a 29-year-old man in the incident. Eric Linsker faces charges of robbery, assaulting a police officer, riot, obstruction of governmental administration, reckless endangerment and unlawful possession of marijuana, said NYPD spokesman Sgt. Lee Jones. In Oakland, California, police said there were several instances of vandalism. Arrests were made. Protesters demand . In Washington, many carried signs with now familiar messages: ""Black lives matter,"" ""Hold cops accountable"" and ""I can't breathe."" It's systematic racism that is instilled in our government,"" said Shanna Lawrie, her hands in the air as she marched to the Capitol. ""We come in peace but we come strong,"" said Ashley Sharpton, daughter of the Rev. Al Sharpton, an organizer of the Washington march. ""We come with demands. We want the government to get involved."" Protesters are demanding a more aggressive federal response to racially charged incidents involving police. Another marcher was Samaria Rice, whose 12-year-old son, Tamir, was carrying a toy gun when a Cleveland police officer fatally shot him in a park. The local medical examiner ruled his death a homicide. Marc Morial, head of the National Urban League, said protesters are demanding body and dashboard cameras for police, special prosecutors to investigate police misconduct and laws against racial profiling. New York City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who marched in Washington, said the protest needed to move beyond police brutality and focus on issues such as housing, unemployment and better schools. ""That's where we need to steer the conversation,"" he said. ""That's where the anger is."" What the officers say . Daniel Pantaleo, the New York police officer shown on video wrestling Garner to the pavement with his arm around his neck, spoke with internal affairs investigators last week. His attorney says Pantaleo did not use a chokehold but a ""takedown technique"" he learned in the police academy. ""He said he never exerted any pressure on the windpipe and never intended to injure Mr. Garner,"" attorney Stuart London said. Police had confronted Garner on the sidewalk for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson resigned from the department last month. He testified to a St. Louis County grand jury that he shot Brown after the 18-year-old tried to take his gun and then charged at him. The results of autopsies, including one by a Justice Department medical examiner, showed that among Brown's multiple gunshot wounds was one to his hand at close range. That supports Wilson's account of a struggle at his patrol car but doesn't explain why Wilson continued shooting at least five more times.","NYPD arrests a 29-year-old man for assaulting a police officer .

"They won't be able to count for a few years, but when the time comes, they'll be able to practice by using their unusual birthdays. At least four babies were born Saturday at 10:11 a.m. across the United States. If you follow the American style of writing dates, that means they arrived at 10:11 on 12/13/14. Parents David and Katherine Jones did not realize they'd hit that sequence of numbers until a nurse excitedly pointed it out, said Kimberly Romo, a spokeswoman for Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. The couple had other things on their mind -- Victoria Marie Jones was not due until December 31. Instead, she came early via C-section. ""The doctors just said it had to be like right now, and none of us realized what time it was,"" David Jones told CNN. ""One of the nurses in there is the one that actually caught it.  All of this happened so fast."" Victoria came in at 5 pounds and 10 ounces. She arrived just in time for her parents, who are Navy veterans, to catch the annual Army-Navy football game. ""It is a tradition for us to watch the game,"" her dad said. Two hours earlier, when it was 10:11 in the Eastern time zone, Hazel Grace Zimmerman was born to parents Leisha Campbell and Shawn Zimmerman in Ohio's Cleveland Clinic. Hazel is the couple's fourth child, hospital spokeswoman Sabrina Powers told CNN. She weighed in at 7 pounds and 14 ounces. ""We knew she was going to be born today, we just didn't know it would be at 10:11 a.m.,"" Leisha Campbell told CNN afiliate WEWS. ""Everyone is telling us we should play the lottery. We feel this is a lucky day and are excited to get family photos with Santa."" Clare Elizabeth Keane's birthday also will be an easy one to remember.

"Around the world, aid agencies are dispatching teams to the Philippines with one initial overriding objective: Gain access to the areas hit by Super Typhoon Haiyan and understand what has happened. The Philippines government estimates that as many as 11.3 million people have been affected, and we know that at least 28 million people were within the storm's path. A minimum of 670,000 people are displaced and 41,000 houses are damaged, with about half destroyed. And total casualty numbers continue to vary wildly, depending on different sources. Getting a handle on a crisis on this scale is hard, but it's made even harder when you're working in an archipelago in a country that is relatively poor with weak infrastructure. That's the challenge in the Philippines, where we are facing decimated services on a truly terrifying scale. The images you have seen are only from areas we have accessed. Worse may be around the corner. Opinion: For Filipinos, despair and prayers . Organizations such as the International Rescue Committee have learned a great deal from responding to past catastrophes, from the earthquake in Haiti and floods in Pakistan in 2010 to the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. Where state resilience and infrastructure are weak, the immediate concern, beyond first aid for those harmed in the first wave of destruction, is recovering, maintaining and reconstructing basic water and sanitation services. A cholera outbreak is always a threat, and other diseases such as typhoid are often the first killers to emerge. So the initial work is basic -- clearing debris and understanding what services are working and what aren't. The IRC will typically look to mobilize the local community by offering cash for work to clear roads and kick-start a microeconomy. This puts cash back in pockets so people can start to rebuild their lives, where they can, and rekindle economic activity. The second priority is to assess and reinforce health care systems. The government of the Philippines has defined the typhoon event as a national calamity, and there will be thousands of casualties desperately in need of first aid. Many survivors would be ill and reliant on a health service that the typhoon has destroyed. So, securing and providing medication for chronic conditions such as diabetes, which can quickly become life threatening if left without attention, is crucial. We are already hearing reports of closed hospitals without power and fears of electrocution if the power is switched back on. Reports indicate that aid agencies will be able to access a robust pharmaceuticals market based out of the capital of Manila, but the supply of medical supplies and infrastructure tools will quickly dry up. No country can be fully prepared for disasters of this scale, so aid agencies will call for and coordinate international flights and shipments of the medicines and resources that are in the shortest supply or that have already run out. This process is expensive and requires serious financial support and logistical assistance. It will require donations from people who can afford to help as well as the offer of military-scale logistical assistance from governments that can help. When they lose their home and their family, people also often lose hope. Where food has run out, electricity cut off and communications down, then looting, violence and theft become an immediate danger. The IRC will be assessing the nature and locations of these threats to alert the government and work with partners to offer protection services. We consider the vulnerability of women and girls to be front and center in our emergency response, as we know that in emergencies gender-based violence tragically increases. It may sound dull, but ensuring we are transparent and accountable to the communities we are serving is critical. If the people tell us we aren't serving their needs, we need to listen and adapt our approach. So we immediately set up systems to ensure that the people we are trying to help are part of shaping our response. Like many disasters, the event itself lasted only a few hours, but the response will take many years to achieve what it must. So this is a long-term project. Right now, we need to first save lives. At the IRC, we have launched an immediate appeal for $10 million. You can donate here. We will then begin the greater task of helping the Philippines rebuild their lives and to be better prepared for next time.","More than 11 million people in the Philippines are affected by Super Typhoon Haiyan .

"Manufacturers of antibacterial hand soap and body wash will be required to prove their products are more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illness and the spread of infection, under a proposed rule announced Monday by the Food and Drug Administration. Those manufacturers also will be required to prove their products are safe for long-term use, the agency said. ""Millions of Americans use antibacterial hand soap and body wash products,"" the agency said in a statement. ""Although consumers generally view these products as effective tools to help prevent the spread of germs, there is currently no evidence that they are any more effective at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. ""Further, some data suggest that long-term exposure to certain active ingredients used in antibacterial products -- for example, triclosan (liquid soaps) and triclocarban (bar soaps) -- could pose health risks, such as bacterial resistance or hormonal effects."" About 2,000 individual products contain these products, health officials said. ""Our goal is, if a company is making a claim that something is antibacterial and in this case promoting the concept that consumers who use these products can prevent the spread of germs, then there ought to be data behind that,"" said Dr. Sandra Kweder, deputy director of the Office of New Drugs in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""We think that companies ought to have data before they make these claims."" Studies in rats have shown a decrease in thyroid hormones with long-term exposure, she said. Collecting data from humans is ""very difficult"" because the studies look at a long time period. Get dangerous germs out of your home . Before the proposed rule is finalized, companies will need to provide data to support their claims, or -- if they do not -- the products will need to be reformulated or relabeled to remain on the market. ""This is a good first step toward getting unsafe triclosan off the market,"" said Mae Wu, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""FDA is finally taking concerns about triclosan seriously. Washing your hands with soap containing triclosan doesn't make them cleaner than using regular soap and water and can carry potential health risks. The FDA first proposed removing triclosan from certain products in 1978, the council said, ""but because the agency took no final action, triclosan has been found in more and more soaps."" In 2010, the council said it sued FDA to force it to issue a final rule. The new proposed rule stems from a settlement in that suit, according to the NRDC. The rule is available for public comment for 180 days, with a concurrent one-year period for companies to submit new data and information, followed by a 60-day period for rebuttal comments, according to the FDA. The target deadline is June 2014 for the public comment period, then companies will have until December 2014 to submit data and studies. The FDA wants to finalize the rule and determine whether these products are ""generally recognized as safe and effective"" by September 2016. ""Antibacterial soaps and body washes are used widely and frequently by consumers in everyday home, work, school and public settings, where the risk of infection is relatively low,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Due to consumers' extensive exposure to the ingredients in antibacterial soaps, we believe there should be a clearly demonstrated benefit from using antibacterial soap to balance any potential risk."" The action is part of FDA's ongoing review of antibacterial active ingredients, the agency said. Hand sanitizers, wipes and antibacterial products used in health care settings are not affected. Most hand sanitizers have 60% alcohol or ethanol and are generally recognized as safe when water isn't available, Kweder said. However, health officials still believe washing hands with soap and water is the best method.","The FDA says there's no evidence antibacterial washes are better than soap and water .
Some data shows there may be long-term health risks from exposure .
Hand sanitizers and wipes are not covered by the proposed rule ."
"(CNN) -- A California mother was arrested this week after she was captured on video encouraging her son to pummel another boy, police said. The woman can be heard yelling ""Beat him down.

At one point in the video, circulated on the internet, the woman offers pointers to her son on how to win the fight. She also assures the combatants they have permission to fight in her yard and that she will not call the police. Police say they have arrested the woman, identifying her as Jennifer Zuniga, 33, of the central California city of Ceres. She faces child endangerment and contributing to the delinquency of a minor charges, police said. ""Jennifer can be heard and seen in the video yelling and encouraging her son to batter the other juvenile. Jennifer is heard yelling a barrage of profanities and enticing the fight,"" Ceres Police said in a statement. The video was posted on YouTube and police say they learned about it from a tipster. Police also credited a man who witnessed the fight and can be seen on the video stopping it. ""This man (challenges) Jennifer Zuniga's actions and stopped the assault before someone was seriously injured,"" the police statement said. At the end of the video, the man is seen getting in between the brawling boys. ""Lady, you're letting them fight like this? What kind of example are you, lady?"" the man asks.

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Park Sang Hak and his family jammed 150,000 sheets of paper, dollar bills, DVDs and tiny AM/FM radios inside bags attached to giant inflatable helium balloons. They launched them into the sky where they floated 200 km (124 miles) across the border to North Korea. The message: Kim Jong Il is lying to you. Renewed worldwide pressure on Pyongyang has given urgency to North Korean defectors living in Seoul who hope to reach North Koreans. The balloons are the weapons in breaking Kim Jong Il's spell, say the Fighters for Free North Korea. The group, made up primarily of North Korean defectors, says if North Korea can't get any messages from the outside world, then outside world must deliver those messages in. How? The giant helium balloons carrying the garbage bags of propaganda, which can fly 200 kilometers over the border, straight into the heart of Pyongyang. It's the heart of Kim Jong Il's regime that these defectors hope to strike, by destroying the illusion it has built for its citizens. ""My brothers are still living there,"" said Kwon Young-Hee, who defected to Korea a decade ago. ""I will be happy if they can come after reading these messages. North Koreans know nothing about Kim Jong Il except for his power as general and chief of the country. We want them to know the truth."" In North Korea, all public discourse, from media to education, is controlled by the military regime. A little radio, says North Korean defector Park Sang-hak, is a big weapon. ""I'm sending this off with the hope of reaching my people, who I left behind,"" said Park, as he watched the balloons lift into the sky heading northward. ""If they get these, I hope they will be able to reflect on the true meaning of freedom. The two Koreas halted decades of propaganda warfare under a 2004 reconciliation deal. But ties have soured in the wake of the sinking of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan, last March. It's reinvigorated the propaganda war among North Korean defectors in the south. Kim Seong-Min runs Free North Korea Radio, broadcasting from the third floor of a small office building in the outskirts of Seoul. He may be in South Korea, but the audience, he hopes, is North Korea's citizens, listening from illegal radios. Kim, who fled North Korea a decade ago, says the Cheonan warship sinking should show the international community that negotiations with Pyongyang will never work, and it must try to reach the North Koreans directly. It worked for me, said Kim, who recalls how he heard a story on an illegal radio in North Korea. ""Listening to the stories, I thought maybe this is propaganda from the south,"" he said. The important part, he said, is that he began to question the unquestionable military regime. Just the question led to him fleeing the North. ""I want to see it for myself,"" he said, referring to the free world. While the propaganda war is heating up, people in Seoul say the prospect of an actual war feels remote. South Koreans, long used to the heated battle and rhetoric between the nations, are going about their normal lives. ""I don't think war will take place,"" said Park Kyung-hee, as she shopped with her son in a busy market in downtown Seoul. ""Although the Cheonan incident is serious, the country will be safe because we have strong ties with our allies. The north would never invade us."" American Mischa Moreau, who has lived in Seoul for three years, said she doesn't feel any sense of danger. ""It does not feel like war. The feeling I get from the Korean people here, it's very easygoing and they go on with their life and I do too. It's very comforting.""","Bags packed with paper, dollar bills, tiny radios by North Korean defectors .

"Stacey Addison marked her 41st birthday this week in very different circumstances from previous years. The American veterinarian from Oregon spent the day in a prison in the small Southeast Asian nation of East Timor. She's being held there in connection with a drug investigation in which she says she was unwittingly caught up. ""It's been a nightmare,"" her mother, Bernadette Kero, told CNN on Wednesday. ""We just want her to be able to come home."" Addison shares a cell with two other women and has received treatment for an abscess at the prison clinic, her mother said. ""Never in a million years would I have thought that she'd be spending her birthday today in a prison,"" Kero said with tears in her eyes. 'She had no involvement' The way that Addison, who has been traveling solo since January 2013, ended up in jail is a terrifying case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, according to her and her mother. After working for 10 years as a vet and saving money, Addison quit her job, sold her home and belongings and set out to travel the world, setting aside a small nest egg for when she would eventually come home, Kero said. On September 5, Addison was sharing a cab from near the Indonesian border to Dili, the capital of East Timor, when the journey turned into a traveler's nightmare. On the way, another passenger asked to stop and pick up a package at a DHL office. ""My daughter was in the vehicle in the backseat,"" Kero said. ""She was looking up in her Lonely Planet to find a hostel, he came back with a package. At that point, the police surrounded the car and arrested all three of them."" The package was found to contain methamphetamine, Addison said on her Facebook page. Police searched her and her belongings and gave her a urine test, which she said came back clean. ""At that initial point she wasn't that worried; she knew she had no involvement,"" Kero said. 'Very scared about the future' But Addison was held for four nights in a detention center before being conditionally released by a judge. ""The person who picked up the package, he told the police and he testified before the judge that he didn't know my daughter,"" Kero said. ""He had never met her before; he didn't know the driver. He had just paid to hire the driver."" But the terms of Addison's release prevented her from leaving East Timor while the investigation into the case continued. She found herself caught up in the young developing country's justice system and was advised to hire a lawyer. ""I am under a lot of stress and very scared about the future, but I am trying to stay strong,"" she said in a Facebook post on September 24. Her situation appeared to be looking up last week, when she had a court appearance to retrieve her passport. But rather than giving Addison her papers and letting her go, the court detained her again and sent her to Gleno prison outside Dili, a U.S. State Department official said. ""She had thought this was being resolved -- now this,"" said her mother, who has set up a Facebook page titled PleaseHelpStacey. 'A violation of human rights' Paul Remedios, a senior lawyer representing Addison, said the court had detained her again because there was a warrant for her arrest -- although the reason for the warrant remains unclear. He said her arrest, in which she was deprived of the rights to a defense and to be heard before a judge, hadn't followed due process. ""We consider this to be a violation of human rights,"" Remedios said, but he warned that under East Timor's criminal procedure law, an individual can be held in detention for up to a year while there is an ongoing investigation. The East Timor Justice Ministry didn't respond to calls from CNN seeking comment on Addison's case Thursday. The U.S. government is seeking ""a fair and expeditious resolution to this case in accordance with Timorese law,"" the State Department official said. Hair cut short . For her first five days in Gleno prison, Addison was held on her own, according to Kero. Her long blond hair was cut short to comply with prison protocol. But she's since been moved to a unit with about 16 other women, at least one of whom has a child, Kero said. She is being treated as well as can be expected and gets three meals a day, her mother said. The U.S. Embassy is in ""close contact"" with Addison and a consular official visited her in prison on Tuesday, the State Department official said. Kero said embassy staff have been ""extremely supportive"" in the case -- they brought Addison a birthday cake recently. She said she hopes a meeting Friday between U.S. State Department officials and the Timorese ambassador might help move the case forward. The staff of Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon have been ""working with the State Department and her family to get this resolved as quickly as possible,"" said Hank Stern, a spokesman for the senator. Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley's office is also working with the family, he said.","Stacey Addison was detained by police in September during a taxi journey .

"Amid growing foreign policy crises, President Barack Obama is encouraging Congress and the country to focus on issues here at home -- namely how to improve the livelihoods of working families. On Monday, the President and first lady Michelle Obama will hold a Working Families Summit in Washington, which highlights economic issues affecting American families at home and in the workplace. ""Every single day, there are conversations around the kitchen table where people are trying to figure out, this child care is costing so much, I'm not sure that we're going to be able to make our mortgage at the end of the month,"" the President said to Kate Bolduan of CNN's ""New Day."" ""There are folks who are saying, 'Little Johnny is sick, but if I don't show up at my job, because I don't have paid family leave, we're not going to be able to pay the electricity bill.' "" Bolduan sat down with the President on Friday to discuss how he plans to achieve his administration's goal of a ""21st-century workplace that works for all Americans."" Here are the five things we learned from our sitdown with the President: . 1. The goal of the summit is ... ""... to lift up the conversation that everybody is already having individually and let people know you're not alone out here,"" Obama said. The President said he believes ""good, strong, healthy families"" are the foundation of our society. But today, according to Obama, those working families are struggling to get by as parents are having difficulty juggling their obligations at home and work. ""And if that's the case, it's not just about giving lip service to it,"" he said. ""We've got to reduce the stresses on families. And I think if you ask most families around the country, 'What's the biggest stress?' It has to do with financial pressures and time pressures that are constantly encroaching on them."" 2. President Obama's three priorities at the Working Families Summit: . Priority one: Paid family leave . According to a survey from the United Nations' labor agency, of the 185 countries and territories with readily available information, only three do not provide paid maternity leave. And, you guessed it, the United States made that list. The other two countries are Oman and Papua New Guinea. ""Paid family leave, we're the only advanced country on Earth that doesn't have it,"" the President said. ""It doesn't make any sense. There are a lot of countries that are a lot poorer than we are that also have it."" But the President said paid family leave isn't just a women's issue, as he reflected on his days of becoming a new working dad. ""One of the most precious memories that I'll ever have is when my first daughter, Malia, was born,"" he said. ""I was lucky enough that my schedule allowed me to take that first month off. And staying up until 2 in the morning and feeding her and burping her creates a bond that is irreplaceable."" Right now in the United States, employees can take 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Employers can choose to provide paid leave, but less than half do. According to a 2012 survey from the Department of Labor, 48% of employees who went on leave received full pay, while 17% received only partial pay. ""We have unpaid family leave right now, but for a whole lot of families, it means they can't use it because they just can't afford it,"" Obama said. Lerner: Is paid family leave bad for business? Priority two: Workplace flexibility . The President said he's pushing for workplace flexibility to give parents the opportunity to become more involved in their children's lives and education. ""We always say that we want parents involved in our kids' education,"" he said. ""There are millions of families out there who can't even imagine taking time off to go to a parent-teacher conference."" This type of workplace flexibility is a practice that he and the first lady believe will improve employee morale and motivation. ""When we knew that employers had our backs and were willing to give us flexibility to look after family, that made us want to work harder for that employer,"" he said. ""Even if it meant taking work home with us, if it meant coming in on Saturday to replace the time we had taken off on Tuesday. And that, I think, has been the experience of a lot of employers."" Priority three: Child care . Obama administration officials say they are focusing on the issue of child care at Monday's summit. White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett cited a survey that found that over a three-month stretch, 29% of working parents had a child care emergency. ""What happens if you've got to leave in the middle of the day? If you are a low-wage worker and you leave, you could lose your job,"" Jarrett said in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""We don't do a very good job providing high-quality, affordable child care, and there are a lot of countries, a lot of our competitors do it,"" Obama told Bolduan. ""That means that it's a lot easier for women to be in the workforce and not have to make choices that ultimately mean they're, in some cases, getting paid less or having less opportunities. And it also means, by the way, that our kids are more likely to thrive."" 3. Add to that list: . Equal pay for equal work. Women now make up more than half of the country's primary or co-breadwinners. But the Obama administration says those women are still earning less than their male counterparts. A 2013 Pew Research Center study said women earned 84% of what men earned, according to an analysis of hourly wages of all workers. ""We've done some things administratively on that front. I always say that shouldn't be a women's issue because I always wanted Michelle to make sure that she was getting paid fairly because when she brought her paycheck home, that went into the overall pot to help us pay our bills,"" the President said. 4. What the President is going to do about it: . Obama says he has full faith that these best practices of offering paid family leave and workplace flexibility will garner a more productive and competitive economic landscape. ""For companies who are offering paid family leave, who are offering flexibility, their workers are more productive, more loyal,"" he said. ""There's lower turnover and ultimately, they're going to be more profitable."" Monday's summit is just one step toward his second-term agenda of improving these domestic issues. ""I'm going to be taking some action, a presidential memorandum directing every federal agency to be very clear to their employees that it is my view that offering flexibility where possible is the right thing to do. We don't want people having to choose between family and work when you've got an emergency situation,"" Obama said. But Republicans have been critical of what they perceive as initiatives that are derived solely from the President's midterm election strategy of mobilizing women to turn out to vote. With Democrats holding the upper hand on women's issues, the Working Families Summit plays into the party's strength, leading administration critics to wonder if this is just about playing politics. ""I've got a strong, successful wife, who I remember being reduced to tears sometimes because she couldn't figure out how to juggle everything that she was doing. And I've got two daughters that I care about more than anything in the world,"" the President said. ""And so this is personal for me. And I think it's personal for a lot of people."" ""This is not just a women's issue. This is a middle-class issue and an American issue,"" he continued. ""And to the extent that we want to have this conversation outside of politics, I'd welcome a bipartisan effort with ideas coming from the private sector and from Republicans, from Democrats and from nonprofits and the faith community about how we make sure that we're supporting families and reducing their stress."" 5. His tips on parenting: . With Bolduan's first baby on the way, she asked the President for some parenting advice. ""You know, you're going to do great,"" Obama said. ""Michelle and I talk about this. And kids are more resilient than you realize. You give them unconditional love and then you give them some structure and some rules. And they usually turn out really, really well. And they'll bring you a lot of joy."" Some of those structures and rules fall directly in line with the President's second-term agenda, by homing in on the issue of minimum wage. Both the President and the first lady told Parade magazine that they worked minimum-wage jobs -- an experience they want for their daughters, Malia, 15, and Sasha, 13. ""I think every kid needs to get a taste of what it's like to do that real hard work,"" Michelle Obama told Parade. ""We are looking for opportunities for them to feel as if going to work and getting a paycheck is not always fun, not always stimulating, not always fair. But that's what most folks go through every single day,"" President Obama added. Malia Obama is turning 16 on July 4, a milestone marked by her getting her first job on a Steven Spielberg set as a production assistant and soon prepping for her driver's license. Obama reflects on the years gone by, raising his girls in the White House. ""We were pretty big believers in, as soon as they could understand words, you start giving them some assignments: Eat your peas, pick up the toys off the floor. And by the time they're 16, they turn out pretty good, although they don't always give you as much time with them as you want,"" he said.

"A Texas woman claims she was forced to give birth alone in jail during a horrific night in solitary confinement nearly two years ago, and that her baby died because of it, according to a federal lawsuit filed this week. Nicole Guerrero alleges in legal documents that ""Wichita County denied (her) access to reasonable medical care ... ignored her obvious signs of labor and constant requests for medical assistance, failed to conduct a physical examination ... when she began to display obvious signs of labor, left (her) unattended in a solitary cell while she was obviously in labor, failed to transport (her) to the hospital for safe delivery, which ultimately caused (her) to deliver her baby alone in the solitary cell, and resulted in (her) suffering severe and likely permanent, physical and psychological injuries."" Wichita County isn't talking about the case. ""We are prohibited (from talking) about pending litigation in Texas because we are representing the county in this case,"" said Wichita County District Attorney Maureen Shelton. The lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Texas, names as defendants Wichita County, the Sheriff's Office, registered nurse LaDonna Anderson, and Correctional Healthcare Management, Inc., Anderson's employer. Here's what Guerrero says happened, according to court documents: . She was arrested on drug possession charges on June 2, 2012. After visiting her doctor for an infection on June 11, while still in custody, Guerrero says her doctor told her she was  8½ months pregnant. According to the legal complaint, once Guerrero was returned to jail she experienced severe pain and cramping. She said she was checked out by the nurse on duty, identified in court documents as Anderson, late on the night of June 11. Anderson determined at that time Guerrero was not in labor, according to the legal documents. The complaint then detailed a night spent in solitary confinement, during which Guerrero claims she tried to get medical attention throughout the night and into the early morning hours as her pain worsened, but that she was ignored by Anderson and the guards on duty. Finally, Guerrero said, around 5 a.m. on June 12, a detention officer walking by her cell helped her deliver the baby. The court filing said the baby was not breathing when it was born and that the umbilical cord was wrapped around its neck. Guerrero says in court papers that no CPR was performed on the baby and that it was later pronounced dead at a local hospital. Guerrero alleged she was still kept in solitary confinement, without medical help, after the baby was taken away. Guerrero's lawsuit accuses Anderson and Correctional Healthcare Management of medical malpractice. Her attorney Rick Bunch said Wichita County and Sheriff David Duke violated her due process rights under the 14th Amendment by depriving her of access to reasonable medical care, according to CNN affiliate KFDX. CNN contacted the Wichita County Sheriff's Office, Anderson and Correctional Healthcare Management several times requesting comment, but did not receive a response.","Texas woman says she was forced to give birth alone in jail .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- It only takes the touch of a finger to locate the nearest bank, purchase tickets for a movie or find directions to just about anywhere in the world. The digital revolution has changed the way the current generation carries out everyday tasks. But some say that convenience has come at the price of your privacy. Your personal interests and where you shop is valuable data for companies that want to effectively target their direct marketing. And it's not just a matter of companies recording your IP addresses and credit card swipes. ""Almost anything you do in today's society involves leaving a track,"" said Doug Klunder of the American Civil Liberties Union. He's the director of the ACLU of Washington's Privacy Project. As you go about your daily routine, you inadvertently share more data than you realize. ""It starts the moment you get up,"" Klunder said. ""Just moving around is tracked. If it's on a bus, and you are paying with bus cards, that can be tracked. If you are driving your car, there are increasingly video cameras that recognize license plates. Anytime you have a cell phone on, it's talking with cell towers and creating a record of where you are down to 100 feet."" And that can put your personal information at a higher risk. Last year, more than 11 million U.S. consumers were victims of identity theft, according to an annual survey released last month by Javelin Strategy and Research. It found that the No. 1 targets are people 18 to 24. Their salaries might be lower than the older, less digitally savvy generation, but they are more likely to share their personal information online. And that isn't always a bad thing. Private investigator Steve Rambam argues people are in a sense compensated for the personal information they divulge. ""The average American finds a very healthy acceptable balance between privacy and convenience, they give up some privacy and get a lot of convenience,"" said Rambam, who regularly gives a talk at conferences titled, ""Privacy is Dead: Get Over It!"" Rambam has become an expert using someone's digital tracks to locate the person, whether they are a fugitive, a missing person or a writer that Rambam challenged to try and hide from him for a year. Rambam found him nine times just from electronic bread crumbs he left, and the two are working on a book about the experience. It's very hard to function in society and not leave those kinds of clues, Rambam said. ""If you want to have access to the largest, most fantastic marketplace in the world, eBay has to know what you have searched for,"" Rambam said. ""If you want to be able pull a phone out of your pocket and talk on it anytime you want, well, that phone reports where you are 24/7. If it's a smart phone like an iPhone or an Android phone, it tell us where you eat, what books you buy, what restaurants you like."" But is it possible for someone who truly wanted to go off the grid to avoid leaving any tracks? Frank Ahearn helps people who are desperate enough do just that. ""I teach people how to disappear,"" Ahearn explained. For more than 20 years, Ahearn was a skip tracer; his job was to track down people who had skipped town. Then he realized there was opportunity in aiding people who didn't want to be found. Ahearn is something like a one-man witness protection program. For a fee, he helps people with personal or financial problems, but who are not wanted by law enforcement, vanish.   He has also written a book, ""How to Disappear."" One of the people Ahearn said he helped disappear was a female attorney being threatened by a client who blamed her when he lost his case in court. ""He turned his anger on her, basically started throwing dead animals on her lawn,"" Ahearn said. ""The problem with stalkers is there are no boundaries. You don't know where, how or if it's going to end."" In cases like those, Ahearn says he sets up new identities for people so they can't be tracked down by someone like him. ""If I am looking for you, you have got some problems. But if I am helping you to get out of town, you're going to be OK because I know what they are looking for,"" he said. ""The key is your old life and your new life never connect."" But odds are it won't be an easy life. Evan Ratliff, a writer and editor for Wired Magazine, decided last year to test out the idea of living without leaving a trace. He dared his readers to find him. Ratliff moved across the country living under false identities, trying not to leave any electronic clues. ""I think in the first few hours of it I thought, 'No one's really paying attention, no one cares about this topic,' "" Ratliff said. ""Then the flood started."" Dozens of strangers formed social media search parties and traded tips about so-called ""Evan sightings."" ""One post after another, they had already started digging up information about me,"" Ratliff said. ""After about the first night, I was fully freaked out."" He didn't make it easy, using prepaid cell phones, physical disguises and software that masked his Internet usage. Eventually he was tracked down in New Orleans, Louisiana, living under an assumed name, 2,000 miles from where he started. Ratliff said paranoia and suspicion quickly set in when he was on the run. There was little romance to living like a fugitive, he said. ""It's hard to let go of that idea that if you really did it right, you could end up on a beach in South America for the rest of your life drinking margaritas,"" he said. ""That's always still there, but I think the actual process of living on the run in the United States -- in the end, it's almost never going to be worth it.""","ACLU official: ""Almost anything you do in today's society involves leaving a track""

"Toronto Mayor Rob Ford asked for forgiveness Monday, his first day back to work following a two-month leave of absence for substance abuse treatment. ""To the people of this great city, I want to offer a public apology,"" said the embattled mayor at a news conference.  ""I used poor judgment and I take full responsibility for my actions."" In May, Ford announced that he'd be taking a break after reports of a video that allegedly showed him smoking crack cocaine surfaced -- apparently the final setback in a year full of them for a man who said Monday that he was in ""complete denial"" about his substance abuse. ""When I look back on some of the things I said and some of the things I did when I was using, I am ashamed, embarrassed, and humiliated,"" he said. The Canadian mayor's public unraveling began in May 2013 when cell phone video surfaced that appeared to show Ford smoking crack cocaine. He denied any wrongdoing and defiantly brushed aside calls for his resignation, even after the city council stripped him of most of his power. Ford pledged to quit drinking and adopt a healthy lifestyle, but after another embarrassing video appeared on social media in January -- one in which he incoherently mocked the city's police chief -- Ford admitted to suffering a setback. Though he offered apologies Monday to ""every single person who was hurt by (his) words and actions,"" one thing Ford did not offer was his resignation. In fact, the mayor -- who is seeking another term -- doubled down. ""I look forward to serving you for many, many more years"" he said.","Mayor Rob Ford pledges to keep serving people of Toronto .

"When Ian McLaren-Morris named his 12 meter yacht ""Silver Slipper,"" he never could have known it would bring him a real life fairytale romance. The divorced father-of-two had long dreamed of sailing around the globe with his very own Cinderella; a soul-mate who shared his love of the ocean and sense of adventure. But finding a special woman willing to quit her job and say goodbye to her family and friends for a romantic voyage into the sunset wasn't quite as straightforward as the 52-year-old had hoped. Like a growing number of single people across the world, McLaren-Morris searched for love on internet dating websites. Two years later and the sailor was still no closer to finding his seafaring sweetheart. It wasn't until McLaren-Morris signed up to a website catering specifically for boating enthusiasts, LoveSail.com, that he found the woman of his dreams -- 45-year-old former superyacht hostess Wendy Robson-Burrell. The pair met at the Chichester Yacht Club in south-east England, embarking on  a whirlwind romance that found them engaged just six months later. They now plan on marrying in April, sailing around the world for their honeymoon before joining the Atlantic Rally for Cruisers (ARC), the world's largest transatlantic yachting event later in the year. ""I loved sailing, I had my own boat, and I wanted to do it with someone who got the same excitement and pleasure out of it,"" McLaren-Morris, a former sales and marketing director at National Geographic, said. ""And to do that, you can't have a partner that's too high maintenance. You can't be with someone who needs to have a hairdryer, their nails done, a shower everyday. ""Wendy is so naturally beautiful she doesn't need all that. She just loves having the wind in her hair. And being near the water is one of the most important things in her life."" Launched in 2004, LoveSail now has around 5,500 users ranging from professional skippers to hobby sailors. As the name suggests, most are looking for love but there are also offers of friendship, sailing trips and work opportunities. For those mariners constantly on the move, trying to find a partner willing to wait on land or give up everything to jump on board is one of the pitfalls of a seemingly idyllic lifestyle. ""People who sail tend to be extremely passionate about it -- it's a big investment,"" LoveSail director Erica Joyce said. ""But it can be difficult for sailors because they're not based in one place, so when they do find someone they often have to leave them."" It's a scenario former delivery captain Tor Pinney knows well. As a handsome young sailor traveling the globe in the 1970s, Pinney had little problem meeting women willing to show him around their home town or even set sail for a brief adventure on the high seas. But rather than leading to a long-lasting relationship, it was more often a case of ships that pass in the night as Pinney's nomadic lifestyle made it difficult to rest his anchor in one port for very long. Now 64-years-old, Pinney's love of the water hasn't waned. And neither has his search for a partner willing to share an unconventional life on the waves. ""When I was 20 there was no shortage of girls who wanted to share this experience and cruise the islands,"" said Pinney, speaking from his 12 meter yacht in St John's River, Florida. ""But as people get older they seem to lose that adventurous spirit -- and that's changed my prospects."" Pinney also signed up to LoveSail.com in the hope of finding that special lady. He's still yet to find her, admitting: ""It's difficult to hook up with a LoveSail girl for a cup of coffee when I'm still sailing all over the world."" Online dating is big business in the UK, with more than 9 million people logging on in search of love last year, according to Metaflake, a company that reviews internet dating sites. It's the highest number in Europe, with Britain now claiming 1,500 of the continent's 5,000 dating websites. And it's continuing to grow, with the industry turning over £170 million ($270 million) in the UK -- a 6% rise on the previous year. ""It's not just people who sail, everyone has busy lives now and you don't have the opportunity to meet new people,"" McLaren-Morris said. ""Five years ago, if someone had told me they were doing online dating my reaction would have been 'you silly idiot.' But as more people do it, the stigma disappears."" For Pinney, the joy of yachting is still far too great to give up on the off-chance it will help him find love. ""It's a lifestyle I chose when I was 16-years-old and obviously it presents its challenges,"" he said. ""But it's beautiful out here. I can watch osprey and fish from my deck and manta rays dive under my boat."" Whether he'll one day share that beautiful view with a special lady remains to be seen. But then, there's always plenty more fish in the sea.","For sailors traveling the globe, finding a longterm partner can be difficult .

"I got an urgent call from the doctor. Come to my office immediately, he said. The test results have arrived. A few days earlier, I suddenly felt so ill that I asked the doctor to test for everything and find out why I had been feeling this way. Two months prior, my new husband and I returned from our honeymoon in the South Pacific. He became severely ill on the 11-hour flight home. His headache and high fever lasted for days but then went away before his doctor could determine the cause. And now I felt horrible. Nothing in life prepared me for the test results. Had the doctor said ""you have diabetes,"" that would have made sense. My mother and grandfather had diabetes. But when he said ""you have HIV,"" it blew my mind! And it made no sense, no sense at all. In the next breath the doctor said ""your husband needs a test"" and ""you need to contact everyone you've had sex with to tell them you have HIV, they all need to get tested."" ""Fortunately for you,"" he said, ""I have expertise in this area."" He sent me to his office's social worker who asked if my husband would become violent with news of the diagnosis. She filled the rest of our time together trying to connect with me, sharing stories of her excessive drinking habits, as if I could relate. I called my husband and asked him to meet me at home. I broke the news to him about the diagnosis and got him tested. My new husband also tested positive for HIV. The doctor told us that I had the disease for a long time and did not prescribe me any medication. He also said I gave my husband the virus so he prescribed antiretroviral drugs for him. How could this happen? Was this a death sentence? How long did we have to live? What did we need to do? And oh my God! The doctor says I'd given my new husband a disease of the ""wicked and amoral."" Without any question, he and his staff decided I was a whore and/or addict. This was stunning! I was a wreck. It was only later that I discovered e-mails that proved my husband had been living life on the ""down low"" -- secretly having unprotected sex with many men -- and had likely given me the disease. That was 2000, more than 10 years ago. I still live. In fact, I thrive. Looking back, I realized I was very fortunate. Several weeks after the diagnosis, I was referred to a therapist who really was an expert in HIV/AIDS. He was my sole support in navigating the strange and disturbing world of HIV. It was hard. My therapist's first task was supporting me in finding a medical doctor with HIV/AIDS infectious disease credentials. Fortunately, I had the financial resources to pay for therapy as my life slowly and painfully unraveled. For me, my therapist showed me why mental health care was as important in treating HIV as a knowledgeable, supportive medical doctor. But most others aren't so fortunate. Fear of judgment and discrimination force people diagnosed with HIV or AIDS to live in isolation. Lack of money and access to support services prevent them from getting the emotional help required to cope in a life-affirming way. With the stigma of getting HIV/AIDS, coupled with the myth that life is over, I felt like the entire system was telling me to go into the corner and die. But it doesn't have to be that way. For women like me -- heterosexual, vibrant, who may have contracted HIV through their male partner -- there needs to be more resources available to help us deal with the mental landmines that this situation creates. Too many people in our society are grossly uninformed and still cling to misguided beliefs about HIV/AIDS.  Consequently, the lack of accurate information about HIV/AIDS increases the risk of transmission and decreases the likelihood for women to escape the downward spiral. At first, as a working professional and career engineer, I was fortunate to have access and the ability to pay for extensive mental health care. But tending to this crisis eventually cost me my career, and then the money ran out. It wasn't until I was the subject of a segment on the ""Oprah Winfrey Show"" in September 2010 that my struggle started to gain more meaning. I found there were many more women out there like me. According to Kathleen J. Sikkema, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, ""Persons living with HIV/AIDS have disproportionately high rates of psychiatric disorders, with mood and anxiety disorders being the most common."" Yes. That was me. Depression. Post-traumatic stress disorder. Can't go to sleep. Can't get out of bed. These were all foreign concepts to me until I was diagnosed. I had little background in dealing with mental illness, HIV and even less experience in how to get help. So I launched the BridgetB Foundation. ""BridgetB"" was my Jane Doe alias used during a lengthy court battle with my former husband, a battle that went all the way to the California State Supreme Court and resulted in a $12.5 million negligence and fraud judgment against him. And no, I have yet to see a penny from him. The new foundation is dedicated to providing access to mental and other health services for American women with HIV while respecting their need for privacy. We have a lot of work to do. HIV is deadly serious, but it doesn't have to be a death sentence. However, without access to mental health services to help women cope with the inevitable struggles, too often it is. Today, I am doing well. The loves of my life -- my daughter, her father (both HIV negative) -- and I are living each day to its fullest. And we know tomorrow will be even better. We got help.","Bridget Gordon: In 2000, I found out I have HIV, and that my new husband has it, too .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Ousted Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak is depressed and refusing to eat as he awaits trial on charges of ordering police to kill anti-government protesters, a state news agency reported Tuesday. Mubarak is consuming only liquids and juices, is weak and has lost a lot of weight, Mohammed Fathallah, the head of the hospital where the ex-president is being held, told the state-run EgyptNews. Fathallah's deputy, Dr. Asim Azzam, told the agency that the former leader's vital signs were semi-stable. The 83-year-old Mubarak ruled Egypt for more than 29 years before a popular uprising drove him from office in February. He has been hospitalized since April, after suffering heart palpitations. Prosecutors have said Mubarak suffers from depression, fatigue, repeated irregular heartbeats, low blood pressure that could lead to fainting and an increased risk of heart attack. His lawyer disclosed in June that the ex-president been struggling with complications from 2010 surgery for stomach cancer. On July 18, hospital officials reported that Mubarak had fallen into a coma, but one ""that did not last long,"" Fathallah told CNN. But he is still scheduled to stand trial in August on charges that he ordered police to turn their guns on demonstrators before his ouster -- a charge that carries a possible death sentence.

"The September attack that killed four Americans at a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya was the subject of a few claims at Thursday night's vice presidential debate at Centre College in Kentucky. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan contended that requests for more security at the mission were denied before the attack that killed U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens on September 11. Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith, and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died that night as a result of an attack by dozens of armed men on the U.S. complex  in Benghazi and a nearby annex, according to State Department officials. Vice President Joe Biden said Ryan is in no position to argue about diplomatic security, arguing that Ryan, in Congress, didn't provide all the embassy security funding that the Obama administration asked for. Biden also contended that the administration knew of no requests for more security at the Benghazi mission. We'll look at these claims separately. Fact Check: Ryan cites unlikely outcome under Obamacare . Statements: . Biden: ""We weren't told they wanted more security. We did not know they wanted more security."" Ryan: ""There were requests for extra security. Those requests were not honored."" The facts: . On Wednesday, the State Department's former point man on security in Libya told the House Oversight Committee that he asked for additional security help for the Benghazi facility months before the attack, but was denied. Various communications dating back a year asked for three to five diplomatic security agents, according to testimony at Wednesday's hearing. But Eric Nordstrom, the one-time regional security officer, said he verbally asked for 12 agents. The request for 12 agents was rebuffed by the regional director of the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, Nordstrom testified. ""For me and my staff, it was abundantly clear that we were not going to get resources until the aftermath of an incident,"" Nordstrom said. Also, Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, a Utah National Guardsman who was a site security commander in Libya from February through August, testified that a regional security officer tried to obtain more personnel, but 'was never able to attain the numbers he felt comfortable with."" It was unclear whether he was talking about Nordstrom. Five diplomatic security special agents were in Benghazi at the time of the attack, two of whom only happened to be there because they had traveled with Stevens from Tripoli, according to testimony. Under Secretary of State for Management Patrick Kennedy responded, at the hearing, to suggestions the State Department was responsible for a lack of preparedness: ""We regularly assess risk and resource allocation, a process involving the considered judgments of experienced professionals on the ground and in Washington, using the best available information."" On Tuesday, two senior State Department officials told reporters that U.S. and Libyan security personnel in Benghazi were out-manned, and that no reasonable security presence could have fended off the assault. Conclusion: It's unclear how high Nordstrom's request got in the administration, but he says he did ask the State Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs for more security help at the Benghazi post. Fact Check: Iran and the bomb . Statement: . Biden: ""The congressman here cut embassy security in his budget by $300 million below what we asked for."" The facts: . According to Democratic House Oversight Committee staff, the amount that the GOP-led House passed for two accounts that pay for embassy security in fiscal 2012 ($2.311 billion) was $330 million less than the Obama administration had requested ($2.641 billion). A GOP House Appropriations Committee aide confirmed the House bill had less in these accounts than what the administration requested. However, the final bill, after being worked on by the Democratic-led Senate, put in more money than what had passed in the House. The final bill, which passed with bipartisan support, gave a total of $2.37 billion to these accounts for fiscal 2012 -- about $270 million less than what the administration had requested. Conclusion: The GOP-led House did initially approve about $330 million less than what the administration requested, but in the final bill, passed with bipartisan support after adjustments by the Senate, put the amount a little closer to the administration's target.

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Palestinian militants fired a long-range rocket from Gaza into southwestern Israel on Tuesday morning. It was the first such attack into the city of Ashkelon since the two sides declared a cease-fire, the Israeli military said. This aerial view shows the power station and industrial zone of Ashkelon, Israel, in March of 2008. The missile fired from a Grad rocket launcher did not cause any injuries or damage in the coastal city, said a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces. Rockets fired from a Grad have a longer range than the crude, home-made Qassams that Palestinian militants in Gaza fire more frequently. Militants have used Grads to strike farther into Israel. Ashkelon lies 12 miles (19 km) north of Gaza. Israel and Hamas, the Islamic militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, declared separate, tentative cease-fires two weeks ago after more than three weeks of fighting in Gaza. Israel launched the attack on Hamas in Gaza on December 27 with the stated aim of ending rocket attacks on southern Israel. More than 1,300 Palestinians died and about 5,400 others were wounded. Thirteen Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were also killed in the fighting. Since the two sides declared a cease-fire on January 21, militants have sporadically fired rockets into Israel. Israel has responded with air strikes. CNN's Igor Krotov contributed to this report.","It's the first attack into Ashkelon since cease-fire two weeks ago .

"Texas Gov. Rick Perry's decision to send up to 1,000 National Guard troops to the southern border is the latest move in a controversy over the influx of migrant youths from Central America, many unaccompanied, streaming into the United States. It represents concrete action over concerns raised by Perry and other Republicans that border security be given more resources generally and specifically in this case to deal with what most agree is a humanitarian crisis. The White House, which has declined to approve federal authorization of the National Guard in response to the immigration situation that has flared this year, panned Perry's idea as shortsighted and politically motivated. Here are the questions we wanted to know about Perry's plan. Why did Perry call on the guard? Perry said those troops are needed to ""combat"" crime because the border patrol is busy dealing with the flow of immigrant kids crossing the border from Mexico. The National Guard will be a ""force multiplier"" to aid state law enforcement to reduce crime from cartels, traffickers and criminals crossing the border, Perry said. But isn't this a crisis about kids? Perry said the border patrol is consumed with handling the influx of migrant children and partial family units, who cannot be deported but must be humanely treated and cared for according to U.S. law. If unaccompanied children approach the troops, however, Texas Adjutant General John Nichols, who is head of the Texas National Guard, said they will ""get on the phone"" to a border station so that the children will receive water and medical care. How does that stop the influx? Perry doesn't say that it will. He said he wants to stop border crime. So what will the border patrol do? The National Guard troops will ""refer"" suspected criminal activity to the Texas Department of Safety. They will also patrol the border by air, especially at night. And they will amass at the border to provide a strong visual that Perry hopes will ""deter"" criminals from bringing illicit activity across the border. What won't they do? The National Guard will not make arrests. ""If we were asked to, we could detain people, but we're not planning to,"" Nichols said. How much will it cost and who will pay for it? Texas taxpayers are on the hook, and it will cost about $12 million per month. Will it work? The former head of the National Guard and a former commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection bureau have said Perry's plan is limited in scope. ""The real solution to basically helping border patrol is going to be a holistic approach to this that goes way beyond more boots on the ground,"" said David Aguilar, the acting commissioner of CBP from 2011 until 2013. Aguilar said one thing that will help relieve the workload of border patrol agents is to relieve CBP from being the sole government agency to process and care for the unaccompanied youth in the immediate aftermath of their detention. The former chief of the National Guard echoed Aguilar's sentiment. ""That measure alone will not solve the current problem. It is far more complex and it requires a unity approach that incorporates state, local and federal resources,"" said retired Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum. When will this take place and for how long? The troops will be immediately deployed over the next 30 days, according to Nichols.  How long they will remain is unknown. Perry is asking the federal government to hire and train an additional 3,000 border patrol agents to replace the National Guard. That part of the plan is up to Congress and the comprehensive immigration plan which would have provided more resources for border security is stalled in the House, and neither body has yet unveiled how they would solve the current border crisis. Is politics playing a role? Perry is considering another presidential run in 2016. He previewed his National Guard plan in Iowa, a key presidential nominating state, over the weekend and announced it the next day. Perry has some reconciling to do within a Republican Party that has used the current border crisis to move to the right on the issue. CNN political analyst and National Journal editorial director Ron Brownstein said that Perry's focus on border security ""allows him to shore up his tough on security bona fides"" in what has become ""a big moment for the Republican Party"" on immigration. Has the National Guard been sent to the border before? Yes. The National Guard is already on the border but in smaller numbers. A recent and much larger instance was Operation Jump Start, a two-year deployment that began in 2006 to stem the more than 1 million people who were caught crossing the border each year. What is the situation on the border? The Rio Grande sector, where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol, currently has 3,000 border patrol agents covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water, which equates to 5.4 agents per mile. The Tucson sector, for instance, has approximately 15.7 agents per mile. While the number of unaccompanied youth crossing the border has doubled to nearly 60,000 in the past year, the total number of immigrant crossings has mostly declined. About 1 million people have been caught crossing the border nearly every year between 1983 until 2006, but that number has dropped to about 400,000 in 2013. At the same time, resources for border security have steadily increased: More than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago. And the amount spent on border security has more than doubled. The Customs and Border Patrol budget jumped from $5 billion in 2002 to $12.4 billion this year.

"Tests on the long-lost skeleton of Richard III reveal the medieval monarch had a taste for rich foods such as peacock, heron and swan, and that his liking for the finer things in life -- including wine -- increased significantly after he became the king of England. Scientists at the British Geological Survey measured the levels of isotopes including oxygen, strontium, nitrogen and carbon in the remains of Richard III, found buried beneath a parking lot in the English city of Leicester in 2012. In a paper published in the Journal of Archaeological Sciences, they say the tests can reveal clues as to where a person lived, and what they ate and drank, allowing experts ""to reconstruct the life history"" of the last Plantagenet king. READ MORE: King Richard III's grave opens to the public . Isotope geochemist Angela Lamb, who led the study, said two teeth -- a molar and premolar -- and two bones -- a rib and femur -- were analyzed because each held different information and could offer a variety of clues to Richard III's life. ""The teeth develop in childhood and don't change, so from them we can get information about a person's early years,"" she told CNN. ""Bones are different; they remodel and repair themselves through life -- if you break a bone, for example, it can heal. The femur is dense and slow-growing, so it can tell us about the last 10 to 15 years of a person's life, whereas the rib bone is much more spongy and regenerates much more quickly, so it can reveal information about the last two to three years."" High-protein diet . This is key in the case of Richard III, since he became king just 26 months before his death at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485 -- and analysis suggests his diet changed markedly in the few short years after he was crowned. Medieval aristocrats are known to have eaten high-protein diets full of freshwater fish and wildfowl, in part because of religious observances that called for ""meat-free"" fasting for up to a third of the year. Fish and wildfowl -- birds such as heron, swan and egret -- were not considered meat. ""Obviously, Richard was a nobleman beforehand, and so his diet would be reasonably rich already,"" explained Lamb. ""But once he became king we would expect him to be wining and dining more, banqueting more. Food was a real mark of status in the medieval period. ""We have the menu from his coronation banquet and it was very elaborate -- lots of wildfowl, including real 'delicacies' such as peacock and swan, and fish -- carp, pike and so on, which were cultivated in special fishponds."" Scientific analysis . Matching up historic records from the king's lifetime with brand new scientific data harvested from his remains has offered experts a unique opportunity to ""cross-check"" what is already known about his life and times. As Richard Buckley, the University of Leicester archaeologist in charge of the dig which uncovered the king's remains, explained: ""It is very rare indeed in archaeology to be able to identify a named individual with precise dates and a documented life. ""This has enabled stable-isotope analysis to show how his environment changed at different times and, perhaps most significantly, identified marked changes in his diet when he became king in 1483."" Isotope analysis backs up many of the records of Richard's life -- that he was born in eastern England but spent part of his childhood in western Britain. And knowing where he lived, from ancient documents, allowed the experts to learn something new about isotope analysis. ""By looking at the levels of oxygen isotopes, we can tell where a person lived, because the oxygen comes from the drinking water that they consumed,"" said Lamb. ""In this case, the isotopes suggested that [towards the end of his life] Richard was living in the extreme southwest of Britain, but we know from the records that this isn't the case, so we had to look for another explanation."" Wine habit . Given the discoveries they had already made about Richard's extravagant diet, they began to wonder if the discrepancy in oxygen isotopes pointed to the fact he was drinking something other than water. Brewing water into ale is known to alter isotope levels, but beer was not a high-status drink in the medieval era. ""We needed something that would tie in with the luxury food he would have been eating,"" said Lamb. ""Back then wine was very much the preserve of the upper classes -- it was imported, expensive and only the very wealthy could afford it."" By carrying out tests with modern equivalents, the scientists were able to conclude that Richard drank up to a bottle of wine a day -- and to work out, for the first time, that wine consumption affects oxygen isotope levels. ""It is fascinating,"" said Lamb. ""We use these techniques all the time, but we are never able to 'cross-check' them, and it is only his which enabled us to figure it out.""

"Sheriff Joe Arpaio's apparent use of racial and ethnic profiling  will cost Maricopa County, Arizona, at least  $22 million, according to the county. A court ruled in May that  Arpaio's routine handling of people of Latino descent was not tough enforcement of immigration laws, but instead amounted to racial and ethnic profiling. The sheriff's office had a history of targeting vehicles with occupants with darker skin or Latino heritage, scrutinizing them more strictly and detaining them more often, U.S. District Judge Murray Snow ruled. The sheriff's lawyers dispute the judge's conclusion and Arpaio is appealing the decision. Meanwhile,  the judge ordered a monitor to oversee retraining in the sheriff's office and the creation of a community advisory board. Over the next 1½ years, the county will have to pay $21,943,107 for the monitor and the retraining, according to county budget records. Each  year after that it will cost $10 million  to keep it going, according to Maricopa County spokeswoman Cari Gerchick. The money will come from the county's general fund, Gerchick said, and it's not clear if cuts are needed in other areas to find the money.

"(CNN) -- The people who killed three Israeli teenagers have hurt the Israeli people deeply, there's no doubt about that. But they have also harmed Palestinians, and they have hurt the cause of peace. Anyone who fails to condemn this horrific act -- the murder of students going home from school -- is contributing to the poison that makes peace so difficult in the Mideast. Anyone who hesitates, who equivocates, is helping to prolong the conflict. For Palestinians and their supporters around the world, if you remain silent about the killing of Israelis, you are adding to the duration and bitterness of this conflict. Excuse this atrocity, and you condemn the people of this area to remain enemies for the foreseeable future. That does not mean you cannot criticize Israeli actions, but the cold-blooded murder of Israeli children will have the effect of making Israelis less willing to believe they can accept Palestinians as their neighbors and live in peace. Israelis today are consumed with grief, but they are watching how the world reacts. They are watching how Palestinians react. I, for one, am convinced that the vast majority of Israelis would strongly support, even advocate and push for a withdrawal from the West Bank if they really believed that they would be safe living alongside a Palestinian state. These attacks undermine their confidence. They provide evidence to back the claim that Palestinians will never let that happen, that what they really want is to destroy Israel. In the hours after we learned that bodies of the three teens -- Eyal Yifrach, 19, Gilad Shaar, 16 and Naftali Frankel, 16 -- had been found under a pile of rocks in a field near Hebron, reaction has been predictable and often disheartening, just as it was when we found out someone had kidnapped them on June 12. Frankel, it's worth noting, was an American citizen, which brings up the question of how the United States will respond to his killing. Secretary of State John Kerry said earlier that ""many indications point to Hamas involvement,"" noting that Hamas, designated as a terrorist organization by many countries, has used kidnappings in the past. The FBI says it has launched an investigation. The atrocities were swiftly condemned by some countries. On social media, there has been a flurry of accusations against Israel ahead of what is expected to be a strong Israeli reaction against Hamas, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he is absolutely sure carried out the operation. But others were slow to comment. It took the European Union's foreign policy chief almost a week to condemn the kidnappings. She did it only after Israel complained about European silence. Days earlier, Israeli forces rushed into the West Bank in an urgent and ultimately unsuccessful effort to find the three before they were killed. The military deployment produced clashes with protesters in which five Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers. That received a great deal of attention. The mothers of the kidnapped students appealed for help at the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, describing ""every mother's nightmare...waiting and waiting endlessly for her child to come home."" They described their children, one was an amateur pastry chef. Another ""loves to play guitar and basketball. He's a good student and a good boy,"" said a heartbroken Racheli Frankel of her son Neftali. But the Human Rights Council reacted to her tearful words with chilling indifference. Many others, including human rights organizations, tempered their criticism of the kidnapping by calling the boys ""settlers."" The truth is that two of the three did not live on the West Bank. They lived west of the Green Line well inside Israel. The third lived in a settlement called Efrat, in the Gush Etzion area, which was in Jewish hands before the 1967 war, even before the 1948 war, and even Jimmy Carter, a harsh critic of Israeli settlement, agrees it will remain in Israel after a Palestinian state is created. Every peace plan has agreed. But that's hardly relevant. The teens were students, not warriors. Kidnappings are immoral. Murder is inhuman. For some Palestinians, the kidnapping was cause for celebration. A new three-finger salute became popular, marking the capture of three Israelis. The Facebook page for Fatah, the Palestinian Authority's main party, had a number of cartoons, including one showing the three teenagers as Jewish rats, wearing yarmulkes, caught on a fishing line. To his great credit, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the kidnapping. For that, he came under fierce criticism. Hamas, which is now part of the Palestinian Authority government in a unity deal with Fatah, made no effort to conceal its glee. Hamas denies it had anything to do with the kidnapping. But earlier, its exiled chief, Khaled Meshal, was ambiguous about responsibility, saying only ""I congratulate the abductors."" Opinion: Slain teens call for justice, not escalation . When Israeli authorities named two Hamas members as the perpetrators, the mother of one of the men told Israeli television ""If he did it, I'll be proud of him."" She joins other Palestinian mothers proud of children who commit murder, adding to Israelis' doubts about future coexistence. Israelis are watching closely to see what Abbas does about his unity deal with Hamas, an organization that is openly committed to Israel's destruction. If Israel can show definitive proof that Hamas was indeed behind the kidnapping and killing, it is inconceivable that Abbas would let the unity deal stand. It is even more inconceivable that the United States and Europe would continue providing millions to support the Palestinian Authority under those conditions. This killing hurts Israelis and Palestinians who want peace. The only way this tragedy could be turned into a positive step would be if the Palestinians who support reconciliation, who are outraged by what happened, would speak out loudly against it. That would spark a positive reaction and create energy toward reconciliation. Can that happen? In this atmosphere, we can only hope for a positive surprise.","Frida Ghitis: The killing of three Israeli students hurts Mideast peace process .

"Rockets flew between Israel and Hamas as tensions in the region continue their upward climb. Hamas security sources reported at least 60 Israeli airstrikes across Gaza on Monday night into Tuesday, including from F-16s, Apache helicopters and drones. The sources said at least 10 people were injured. ""Operation Protective Edge is underway. Targeting #Hamas capabilities that are terrorizing #Israel,"" Israel Defense Forces spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner tweeted. The position of the IDF has changed, the spokesman said at an earlier news briefing. Last week they were focused on de-escalation, but now Israel is preparing for a possible deterioration of the situation, he said. Lerner said the IDF has already called up several hundred reservists and is prepared to add 1,500 more. During the last offensive on Gaza in November 2012, 30,000 reservists were called up. Eight Palestinian militants were killed in more than 25 Israeli airstrikes and 39 rocket attacks across Gaza on Sunday night into Monday, said Ashraf Al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Health Ministry in Gaza.  At least 15 people were injured, he said. CNN originally reported nine killed but the death toll was lowered because one man believed to have been killed in a tunnel in Rafah was found to be alive and in critical condition. ""The enemy has crossed the red lines and will be made to pay the price for its crimes,"" Mushir Al-Masri, a Hamas leadership figure and member of the Palestinian parliament, wrote on his Facebook page. ""The blood of our martyrs is precious ... and is fuel for the intifada and the resistance."" After that statement, 70 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel, with Hamas claiming responsibility. Israeli air raid sirens were heard near Yavne in central Israel as militants in Gaza stepped up their attacks. At least one person was wounded by shrapnel in Ashdod, according to Israeli rescuer services. In another tweet, Lerner said that all summer camps, kindergartens and schools within a roughly 25 mile (40 kilometer) radius of Gaza have been forbidden because of the threat of rockets. Suspects questioned . The escalation of military action comes after the slaying of a Palestinian teenager, which was perhaps an act of retaliation for the killing of three Israeli teens earlier. Israeli police have questioned six suspects about what they did ""before and during the murder"" of the Palestinian teen who was abducted and burned to death, Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Naftali Schwartzburger, the lawyer of one of the six suspects, said on CNN affiliate Israeli Channel 2 on Monday that Israeli police conducted re-enactments of the killing of  Mohammed Abu Khedair. Flare-up in Israeli-Palestinian violence: Why now? The fallout from the slayings might damage Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political future. Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, head of Yisrael Beiteinu party, said in a press conference Monday that he told Netanyahu of his intention to dissolve his party's joint faction with Netanyahu's Likud party, saying it was ""not working."" Lieberman criticized Netanyahu's handling of Gaza. Netanyahu on Monday spoke with the father of the Palestinian teenager who was burned alive in Jerusalem last week, expressing shock at what he called an ""abhorrent"" murder. As anger continues to boil over the death of 16-year-old Abu Khedair, Netanyahu talked by phone with Hussein Abu Khedair, telling him that the killers will be brought to trial and ""will be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law."" Police have said there is a ""strong indication"" the attackers may have been motivated by a desire for revenge over the deaths of the three Israeli teenagers, whose bodies were found a week ago in a field in the West Bank. ""Israel stands thoroughly against this. We promised to investigate. We promised to bring the perpetrators of that crime to justice and guess what? We delivered. We've done exactly that,"" said Mark Regev, spokesman for Netanyahu. The teen's father said later Monday that he did not recall speaking with the Prime Minister. ""I was up until 5 a.m. this morning and tried to go to sleep around then,"" Hussein Abu Khedair said. ""Around 7 or 7:30, I started getting phone calls from many Hebrew speaking people. I was tired and could not make out what or who I spoke to. I can't recall speaking to Netanyahu.""​ . In a region that has experienced decades of fighting and mistrust, the past week's events have still managed to shock -- and to further embitter relations between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli police also announced Sunday a confession in the killing of a Jewish Israeli teen a month ago. Shelly Dadon, 19, was kidnapped and stabbed to death by an Arab Israeli taxi driver, who has now provided details of the killing, according to Rosenfeld. 'Stop this disgusting cycle of violence' Meanwhile, the Abu Khedair family is irate over the treatment by Israeli police of one of the burning victim's cousins, an American high school student. Relatives say Tariq Abu Khdeir, a 15-year-old high school sophomore from Florida, was beaten while being detained amid protests over his cousin's death. (The American branch of the family uses a different spelling of the family surname.) Khdeir, who was in Jerusalem to visit family during his summer vacation, was released on bail Sunday. The magistrate court ordered that he stay under house arrest for nine days at a relative's house in a different neighborhood from the family home. ""We're extremely concerned that he's under house arrest right now without really facing any legitimate charges that have been made public, and that those who beat him apparently are walking free,"" his family attorney said Monday, speaking from Florida. Senior State Department officials told CNN that the United States was instrumental in securing the release of the youth. Senior officials in the Obama administration said they were shocked at two videos in which Khdeir was seen being held down and pummeled by men in the uniform of Israeli security forces, the officials said. The officials said they expect Tariq will be able to return home to Florida with his family in the next few weeks. Israeli authorities say Khdeir was part of a group of youths who attacked police. ""From what I understand about the facts of the case, this is not just an innocent bystander who was pulled off of a schoolyard,"" Israel's ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, told ""Fox News Sunday.""  ""He was with six other people. They were masked. They threw petrol bombs and Molotov cocktails at our police. Three of them had knives. ... That does not excuse any excessive use of force, and our Justice Ministry is opening an investigation."" But State Department officials questioned Dermer's remarks. ""They are investigating whether he was throwing rocks,"" another senior State Department official said. ""Even if he was, the question is, was this the right response to that? Obviously we don't think so."" Regev, Netanyahu's spokesman, agreed. ""This is no excuse for this sort of behavior and we're currently investigating it. It's not the police investigating themselves. We've initiated an impartial, objective, independent inquiry into exactly what happened,"" he said. 'Demolish their houses' Abu Khedair's mother, Suha, said she wants equal justice for the people who abducted him in the early morning as he was heading from his home to a mosque for prayers. He died after being burned alive and hit on the head with a blunt object, authorities say. ""If they sentence them and demolish their houses and give them life sentences, it might satisfy me a little,"" Suha Abu Khedair said. The Israeli military destroyed the homes of the two main suspects in the killings of the three Israeli teenagers. Those suspects are still at large. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has called on the United Nations to set up an international investigation into recent crimes against Palestinian people, including the killing of Abu Khedair, the Palestinian state news agency WAFA reported. Officials from both sides have called for restraint amid fears that the cycle of horrific violence could continue.","""Operation Protective Edge is underway,"" says Israeli spokesman .

"It is, in the words of one frustrated official, ""one of the biggest open crime scenes in the world."" And yet, 11 days after Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was blown out of the sky by a suspected surface-to-air missile, the Dutch investigators in charge of finding out what happened have yet to lay eyes on the wreckage or the human remains believed to remain strewn across the enormous debris field. The latest setback came Monday, when a 45-person team of Dutch and Australian experts, accompanied by monitors from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, abandoned their effort to reach the site after hearing explosions and being warned of heavy fighting in the area. It's the same thing that happened Sunday. ""We're really sick and tired of being delayed,"" Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe spokesman Michael Bociurkiw told CNN's ""New Day."" ""We all know there are still human remains out there exposed to the elements, number one,"" he said. ""Secondly, it is one of the biggest open crime scenes in the world as we speak, and it is not secured. There's no security perimeter around the 30- or 35-square-kilometer site."" According to unconfirmed reports from pro-Russian rebels, Ukraine's military broke through to part of the crash site Monday and had stationed armored personnel carriers and dug trenches there. ""Safe work of experts and observers is impossible,"" Vladimir Antyufeev, the acting Prime Minister for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, said Monday. The United Nations and other countries have repeatedly called for a cease-fire to allow investigators a safe working environment at the crash site, which the U.N. human rights chief said Monday could be the scene of a war crime. The Malaysian government had struck a deal with rebels to allow unarmed international police officers to guard the site, but the fighting has made that impossible. ""This is a contested zone. There is active fighting going on,"" Andrew Colvin, deputy commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, said at a news conference Monday in Canberra. ""We are working on the basis that if it's a permissive environment, we will go in,"" he said. Bociurkiw said Monday that investigators will try to reach the site again Tuesday. ""We will keep trying every day,"" he said. A CNN crew joined the convoy that attempted to go to the crash site Monday, but the media were stopped by armed men near Shakhtorsk. The forensic teams turned around not long later. Other people were also fleeing the violence. One man said jets were flying over his home. ""My little one is terrified,"" the man said. Identifying the bodies . As of Monday, 227 coffins bearing remains from the crashed plane had been sent to the Netherlands, where forensic investigators were working to identify them. Of the 298 people killed in the crash, 193 were Dutch, 43 were Malaysian, and 27 were Australian. More than 200 forensics experts from all over the world are working at a Dutch military base to identify the remains, according to Howard Day, who is leading the effort. Investigators aren't sure how many sets of remains they have. Only one victim -- a Dutch man -- has been identified. ""This will take weeks; it will take months,"" Day said. Experts are using a variety of approaches in their work, including dental records, DNA analysis and fingerprints, he said. ""We don't just identify people from a photograph or from an item of property that may be on them, because there's been countless mistakes, examples of mistakes where that's happened in the past over the years, even small incidents, like car crashes,"" he said. Russian role in conflict debated . The fighting appeared to be moving southeast from Horlivka, a city about 30 miles (about 50 kilometers) northwest of the crash site. At least 13 people, including two children, were killed in fighting Sunday in and near Horlivka, the Donetsk Regional Authority said. At least 332 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and nearly 1,300 have been injured since April 7, according to Ukraine's National Defense and Security Council and law enforcement agencies. There is no known figure for the number of rebels killed. Meanwhile, debate continued over Russia's role in the conflict. On Sunday, the State Department released satellite images that it said showed Russians firing into Ukraine. ""We are putting out evidence to confirm the points that not only has Russia been providing the weapons across the border, including heavy weapons, but they have also now been firing artillery barrages across the border,"" senior White House adviser Ben Rhodes said. Russian officials have denied arming the rebels. At a news conference Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he hoped that deployment of an Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe observer mission at two checkpoints on the Russian-Ukrainian border would clarify what was happening on the ground. Russia wants 'impartial' MH17 investigation . U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said that a Russian-made missile system was used to shoot down Flight 17 from rebel territory. Russia and the rebels have disputed the allegations and blamed Ukraine for the crash. On Monday, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said that what happened ""may amount to a war crime."" ""It is imperative that a prompt, thorough, effective, independent and impartial investigation be conducted into this event,"" Pillay said. Russia announced over the weekend that it had formed a team to join the investigation, state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. It will be led by the deputy head of the Federal Air Transport Agency, Oleg Storchevoy. Lavrov called for an ""impartial"" investigation carried out with agreement from the U.N. Security Council. But State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Monday on CNN that the United States has little faith in what Russia says. ""The Russians have mastered the art of saying one thing and doing another,"" she said. Russian foreign minister shrugs off sanctions . The United States will place new sanctions on Russia this week, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken announced Monday without elaborating. Representatives from EU member states will meet Tuesday to consider the proposals, according to the EU website. The new proposals include sanctions on weapons, goods that can be used for both civilian and military purposes, access to European capital markets and on the export of energy technology from Europe to Russia. Psaki said Monday that what happens next is up to Russia. ""We're seeing a serious impact of just the sanctions we have put in place to date,"" she said. ""The Europeans want to do more. We expect they'll do more,"" Psaki said. ""So the question for the Russians is, do they care about the economy and how it's impacting their people, or are they just going to be in denial about what impact these sanctions are having?"" Lavrov said Monday that the Russian government wasn't happy about all the sanctions but that the country would overcome any economic difficulties and become more independent as a result. ""We are only seeing the desire of our Western partners to punish Russia,"" he said. Also Monday, the United States accused Russia of violating the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, citing cruise missile tests that date to 2008, senior State Department and White House officials said. ""This is a very serious matter which we have attempted to address with Russia for some time now,"" said a senior State Department official. Russia's suspected violation of the treaty was first reported Monday by The New York Times. ""The 2014 Compliance Report of the treaty includes a determination that the Russian Federation is in violation of its INF Treaty obligations not to possess, produce, or flight-test a ground-launched cruise missile with a range capability of 500 to 5,500 kilometers (310 to 3,417 miles), or to possess or produce launchers of such missiles,"" a White House official said, adding that they ""have kept the Congress and our allies informed of this matter."" The violation was for cruise missile tests that date back to 2008, prompting an administration review as to whether the tests are in violation of the 1987 treaty between the United States and Russia banning medium range missiles. Officials told CNN that Washington had called for senior-level talks, but insisted the situation was not related to the violence in Ukraine. What you need to know about Russia and sanctions .

"London, England (CNN) -- James Pallotta has already begun a Roman revolution -- now he wants Italian football to take over the world. The president of high-flying club Roma believes playing a Serie A league game abroad during the regular season could provide huge benefits in the long term, especially if it helps crack the lucrative American and Asian markets. The 56-year-old has been pondering the idea ever since news emerged that the English Premier League was considering playing matches outside the UK in a bid to connect with fans around the world. And with Serie A struggling to match the entertainment of the Premier League, the German Bundesliga or Spain's La Liga, Pallotta is keen for Italian football to strike back -- although he concedes he may struggle to convince other club owners. ""I'd love to take Italian football abroad,"" Pallotta told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday. ""I don't know how it would work with Serie A with the home games, and you'd have to figure that out, but I'd love to play a bunch of games abroad or in Boston. ""I'm not saying what form it should take, but we'd be willing to listen about playing a game in some place. ""I don't know it it would be a 39th game or part of the 38 games, but I don't think it's a bad idea to get your product out there."" In 2011, Roma became the first Serie A club to be bought by foreign owners -- a U.S. consortium led by Thomas DiBenedetto, a partner in the Fenway Sports Group that also owns English club Liverpool and baseball's Boston Red Sox. Pallotta was one of the new investors, and succeeded DiBenedetto as president the following year. The club has not won the Serie A scudetto since 2001, but was runner-up last season. That success has continued this season, with Roma second in Serie A after five victories from six games and in a good position to qualify from the group stage of the European Champions League. A preseason tour to the U.S. helped underline Roma's new commercial pulling power across America but it is in Asia where Pallotta has been pleasantly surprised. The club has organized a reality TV series with a Chinese company in which a group of children undergoes trials and plays matches before being picked to travel to Italy and train with Roma's youth team. Italy already has a presence in China, with the preseason Super Cup being played in Beijing in 2009, 2011-12. ""We're looking worldwide because that's where our fans are,"" Pallotta said of the club's marketing strategy. ""We sent our youth team to Vietnam this past year and 25,000 people turned up to see them. ""Can you imagine what would have happened if we'd sent (veteran club legend) Francesco Totti? ""The U.S. is clearly important to us, Asia is huge for us. We have an enormous amount of fans in Indonesia -- we don't know why yet but we're trying to learn. ""In terms of Facebook, Indonesia was our second biggest market.""","President of Roma hopes that Serie A will hold a league game outside Italy .

"(CNN) -- Grammy-winning blues pianist Willie ""Pinetop"" Perkins died at his home in Austin, Texas, Monday, his official website said. He was 97. ""It is with deep sadness that we announce Pinetop Perkins passed away,"" the web page said. The Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award winner scored solo success late in his seven-decade-long career, releasing 14 albums between 1988 and 2010. He was the oldest person ever awarded a Grammy. Before Perkins stepped into the spotlight, he played in Muddy Waters' band for 12 years, starting in the late 1960s. ""In 1980, Pinetop and other members of Muddy's crew struck out on their own and formed the Legendary Blues Band,"" according to his online biography. He was born Joe Willie Perkins in Belzoni, Mississippi, on July 7, 1913. ""Pinetop started out playing guitar and piano at house parties and honky-tonks,"" his biography says, ""but dropped the guitar in the 1940s after sustaining a serious injury in his left arm."" The Recording Academy, which presented Perkins with his lifetime Grammy praised the bluesman. ""Whether performing solo or jamming with other notable talent, his charisma and energy stood out in every song,"" said Neil Portnow, president and CEO of the academy.

"In a much-anticipated report, the United Nations has concluded that chemical weapons have been used in the Syrian conflict. Experts investigated seven instances of alleged use and found that chemical weapons were either used, or likely used, in five of those instances. The case that was most clear to inspectors was an August incident near the capital, Damascus. ""The United Nations Mission collected clear and convincing evidence that chemical weapons were used also against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus on 21 August 2013,"" read the 82-page report, which was released on Thursday. Blood and urine samples from patients there tested positive for sarin and sarin signatures, it found. Anti-government activist groups say more than 1,300 people were killed in the attack in Ghouta -- many of them women and children. Graphic video footage showed rows of bodies without apparent injury, as well as people suffering convulsions or apparently struggling to breathe. U.N. inspectors also said they collected credible information, or evidence consistent with the probable use of chemical weapons, in Khan al Asal, Jobar, Saraqueb and Ashrafiah Sahnaya. They were unable to corroborate the allegation that chemical weapons were used in either Bahhariyeh or Sheik Maqsood. The report did not specify whether the government or opposition groups were responsible for the alleged attacks, which happened between March and August this year. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people overall have died since the Syrian conflict began in March 2011. It began with a government crackdown on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement, then slowly spiraled into a bloody, full-blown civil war. Rebel leader denies he fled . Also Thursday, a top Syrian rebel commander denied that he had abandoned his post and said he is working to resolve fighting among opposition groups in the country's north. In the meantime, a decision by the United States and Britain to halt nonlethal aid makes sense, said Salim Idriss, chief of staff of the Free Syrian Army. Several U.S. administration officials had said that the fate of Idriss, a top rebel commander supported by the West, was uncertain as conflicts persisted between the Free Syrian Army and Islamist groups. Idriss denied reports that he fled to a Gulf state after the Islamic Front allegedly seized a warehouse held by the Free Syrian Army. He did leave Syria, but is working at his office on the Turkish border and has not left his job, Idriss told CNN. In this case, he was already in Turkey when the attack on the warehouse happened, he said. On Wednesday, Turkey sealed its border with Syria because of the fighting between opposition groups in Syria. In the past two days, Idriss has been talking with different groups and has tried to resolve their differences, he said. ""The situation in the north of Syria now is very complicated and very dangerous because there are some problems between some groups, and I think we will try and we should try everything now to find a solution for this problem,"" he said. The Islamic Front, which announced its formation last month, is an alliance that includes tens of thousands of fighters from some of Syria's most powerful Islamist groups, including Ahrar al-Sham, Suqour al-Sham, the Islamic Army and the Tawhid Brigade. The groups control territory in key areas across Syria and have been fighting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad along the critical lines of Damascus and Aleppo, among other places. The front's formation has diminished the stature of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and its leadership abroad, the Syrian National Coalition, as leaders inside the country have sought to distance themselves from a command structure criticized for failing to serve the opposition's needs on the ground. 'Infighting is growing' The seizure of the warehouse this week could prove key in shaping how the United States deals with the Syrian opposition. ""The Syrian opposition has never been a unified fighting force but infighting is growing and, naturally, this is hindering cooperation on the battlefield,"" said one U.S. official. ""At least temporarily, there will be more turbulence within the opposition as the new groups that have cropped up compete for power.  What isn't clear yet is whether the various factions will refocus attention on toppling Assad or become embroiled in internecine fighting that would play to the regime's advantage."" According to Idriss, the Islamic fighters did not take over the warehouse, but attacked a Free Syrian Army battalion that was protecting it and took its inventory. It was unclear which group gave the orders to attack the battalion, he said. The inventory that was inside the warehouse -- which was not American aid, Idriss said -- is in good shape and will hopefully be returned. Idriss admitted that he doesn't fully trust the Islamists, but that an agreement must be reached to control the fighting and form a single command. The fighting among these groups opposed to al-Assad led the United States and Britain to suspend nonlethal aid to the rebel groups. ""It is very difficult now to pass the support to the right hands. And that's why I can understand the, let me say, freezing the support for a period of time,"" Idriss said. The Supreme Military Council of the Free Syrian Army called the allegations that Idriss had abandoned his post rumors. ""Such rumors only serve to impact on the morale of our brothers fighting on the ground at a time when we need to concentrate on stopping the criminal regime, which continues to perpetrate horrific massacres all over the country against our people,"" the council said in a statement.","The United Nations releases a much-anticipated report .

"(CNN) -- While we officially celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of Charles Darwin's ""On the Origin of Species"" on November 24, celebrations of Darwin's legacy have actually been building in intensity for several years. Darwin is not just an important 19th century scientific thinker. Increasingly, he is a cultural icon. Darwin is the subject of adulation that teeters on the edge of hero worship, expressed in everything from scholarly seminars and lecture series to best-selling new atheist tracts like those by Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. The atheists claim that Darwin disproved once and for all the argument for intelligent design from nature. And that of course is why he remains hugely controversial. A Zogby poll commissioned by the Discovery Institute this year found that 52 percent of Americans agree ""the development of life was guided by intelligent design."" Those who are not scientists may wonder if they have a right to entertain skepticism about Darwinian theory. Read a leading Darwin proponent's view that evolution leaves no room for intelligent design theory . We are told that a consensus of scientists supporting the theory means that Darwinian evolution is no longer subject to debate. But does it ever happen that a seemingly broad consensus of scientific expertise turns out to be wrong, generated by an ideologically motivated stampeding of opinion? Of course, that does happen. Many ideologically driven crusades in science -- the earth-centered solar system and eugenics, for example -- survived long after supposed evidence for these ideas evaporated. And precisely the same thing is happening today in the ideologically charged field of evolutionary biology. Indeed, there are strong scientific reasons to doubt the consensus about Darwin's theory and what it allegedly proved. Contrary to Darwinian orthodoxy, the fossil record actually challenges the idea that all organisms have evolved from a single common ancestor. Why? Fossil studies reveal ""a biological big bang"" near the beginning of the Cambrian period (520 million years ago) when many major, separate groups of organisms or ""phyla"" (including most animal body plans) emerged suddenly without clear precursors. Fossil finds repeatedly have confirmed a pattern of explosive appearance and prolonged stability in living forms, not the gradual ""branching-tree"" pattern implied by Darwin's common ancestry thesis. There are also reasons to doubt the creative power of Darwin's mechanism of natural selection. While many scientists accept that natural selection can produce small-scale ""micro-evolutionary"" variations, many biologists now doubt that natural selection and random mutations can generate the large-scale changes necessary to produce fundamentally new structures and forms of life. For this reason more than 800 scientists, including professors from institutions such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Yale and Rice universities and members of various national (U.S., Russian, Czech, Polish) academies of science have signed a statement questioning the creative power of the selection/mutation mechanism. Increasingly, there are reasons to doubt the Darwinian idea that living things merely ""appear"" to be designed. Instead, living systems display telltale signs of actual or ""intelligent"" design such as the presence of complex circuits, miniature motors and digital information in living cells. Consider the implications, for example, of one of modern biology's most important discoveries. In 1953 when Watson and Crick elucidated the structure of the DNA molecule, they made a startling discovery. The structure of DNA allows it to store information in the form of a four-character digital code, similar to a computer code. This discovery highlights a scientific mystery that Darwin never addressed: how did the first life on earth arise? To date no theory of undirected chemical evolution has explained the origin of the information needed to build the first living cell. Instead, the digital code and information processing systems that run the show in living cells point decisively toward prior intelligent design. Indeed, we know from our repeated experience -- the basis of all scientific reasoning -- that systems possessing these features always arise from an intelligent source -- from minds, not material processes. Darwin's ""revolutionary"" legacy on display . DNA functions like a software program. We know that software comes from programmers. Information -- whether inscribed in hieroglyphics, written in a book, or encoded in a radio signal -- always arises from a designing intelligence. So the discovery of digital code in DNA provides a strong scientific reason for concluding that the information in DNA also had an intelligent source. Despite the consensus view that Darwin showed that ""design could arise without a designer"" there is now compelling scientific evidence of actual intelligent design in even the simplest living cells. The question of biological origins has long raised profound philosophical questions. Is life the result of purely material processes or did a purposive intelligence play a role? It's not surprising that such a worldview-shaping issue would illicit strong passions and disagreements. All the more reason to let the evidence, rather than a supposed consensus, determine the outcome of what is, in fact, a very legitimate and important debate about the Darwinian legacy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Stephen Meyer.","Stephen Meyer says there are scientific reasons to doubt consensus about Darwin's theory .

"Arron Lewis, the suspect in the abduction and slaying of Arkansas real estate agent Beverly Carter, told reporters Tuesday that he pleaded not guilty to the charges only because his lawyer told him to. He said he wanted to plead guilty because he just wanted ""this to be over with."" Carter's body was found in a shallow grave near Cabot, about 20 miles northeast of central Little Rock, the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office said early Tuesday. As Lewis was escorted out of court Tuesday, he told reporters, including CNN affiliate KARK, that he wanted to plead guilty to the charges of kidnapping and capital murder, adding, ""I just want this all over with."" Asked whether he would have pleaded guilty even facing the death penalty, which the sheriff's office said prosecutors will seek, he nodded in agreement. ""I'm just sorry it all happened,"" Lewis said. ""I just want it all over with."" The 33-year-old from Jacksonville, Arkansas, was arrested by authorities Monday. ""Lewis admitted ... to kidnapping Beverly Carter but would not divulge her whereabouts,"" the sheriff's office said. After he was booked into the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility, investigators said they obtained information that led them to the property where the grave was located. Authorities think Lewis was a stranger to Carter before her abduction. They believe they have the right man in custody and are not currently seeking any other suspects, said Pulaski County Sheriff Doc Holladay. An investigation is ongoing. ""This case did not end as we had hoped. But now we must move forward to prepare a case for submission for trial that will result in the pursuit of justice,"" the sheriff said. Family: We are devastated . Lewis gave peculiar statements to reporters as he was led on a perp walk Monday night. On video from CNN affiliates KTHV and KARK, police are shown leading Lewis, in shackles and dark prison scrubs, to a police car. Reporters ask him whether he killed Carter. Twice, he says that he didn't, . ""I had a co-defendant. I haven't seen her for two days. Now, they're showing pictures of this. I haven't seen her,"" he says. Asked to explain, Lewis repeats that he ""had"" a co-defendant and provides a man's name, saying he's in the military. Questioned about his and the co-defendant's relationship, he says, ""He's got texts back and forth to me and him, and then they wanted my phone."" ""Why Beverly?"" a reporter asks. ""She was a rich broker,"" Lewis responds. Asked whether he has anything to say to Carter's family, he twice says, ""Sorry."" As officers place Lewis in the back seat of a squad car, a reporter asks again, ""Why Beverly?"" ""Because she was just a woman who worked alone, a rich broker,"" Lewis says. As the car door is closed, Lewis is asked one more time whether he killed Carter, and again, he replies, ""No."" Carter vanished last week when she went to show a home in the small community of Scott. The family released a statement thanking those who had joined in the search for Carter. The statement also seemed to blame Lewis for her disappearance. ""We are devastated at the loss of our precious Beverly. There is now a hole in our hearts that will never be filled. Mr. Lewis robbed us of an amazing wife, loving mother and grandmother. Her grandkids will never get to know the magnitude of her greatness,"" the statement said. ""We draw some comfort in knowing that she is now in the arms of Jesus. God bless you all."" Police haven't said how they linked Lewis to Carter or how they tracked him down, but they say Lewis left a hospital Sunday without notifying police while he was a person of interest in her disappearance. Suspect was in wreck . Lewis, who was on parole, was in a traffic accident Sunday, and police arrived to find his automobile on top of a concrete culvert, according to an accident report from the sheriff's office. Lewis told police that a vehicle, which he couldn't describe, had run him off the road. But a witness told police that he was behind Lewis before the accident, and ""Lewis was traveling at a high rate of speed prior to the crash,"" the report says. Another witness told police that ""the Lewis vehicle was going 'so fast' prior to the curve and she further stated that she observed the Lewis vehicle 'fishtail' around the curve, going into the ditch,"" according to the report. Paramedics took Lewis to Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock. A deputy followed the ambulance to the hospital to issue Lewis a citation for careless driving as well as not wearing his seat belt, because there was evidence Lewis hit the windshield during the crash, the report says. At that time, Lewis was a person of interest in the Carter investigation, but he was not under arrest, Lt. Carl Minden said. ""While at the hospital and undergoing tests, Mr. Lewis left the hospital. He was not under the guard of law enforcement at that time due to not having any criminal charges at that point,"" the lieutenant said in a statement. The warrant charging him with kidnapping was issued later Sunday, he said. Official: Agent's cell phone used . The mysterious disappearance of the 49-year-old resonated among fellow real estate agents, who posted their fears on a Facebook page set up for sharing information about her case. Carter's last phone call to her husband came Thursday afternoon, telling him the address where she would be. When hours went by with no further word from her, Carl Carter says he ""knew something was wrong."" Before calling authorities, Carl Carter went to the address of the home Beverly Carter was showing and saw her brown Cadillac parked there, the sheriff's office said. Noticing the property was open, the husband entered and searched for his wife without success, according to the Sheriff's Office. There was activity on Carter's cell phone after she disappeared, Minden said. Later he explained to HLN's Nancy Grace that activity included text messages, but he declined to elaborate on the nature of the texts. According to her employer's website, Beverly Carter was married for 34 years and has four grandchildren. ""I feel like I'm in a fog, or a horrible nightmare from which I can't awaken,"" Beverly Carter's son, also named Carl, wrote on a Facebook post before his mother's body was found. A Facebook page set up about Carter's disappearance was followed by more than 28,000 people as of Monday afternoon. Police say Lewis' Monday arrest isn't his first run-in with police. In addition to any charges he may face in Carter's disappearance and death, he has a criminal history in northwest Arkansas that includes felony theft of property, obstruction of government operations, failure to appear and unlawful removal of a theft device, Minden said in a statement. He's also faced charges from the Kansas City police and the Utah Department of Corrections, he said.","No other suspects are being sought, sheriff says .

"The first time the South Korean factory owner watched his North Korean employees nibble on a Choco Pie, they appeared shocked -- even overwhelmed. He summed up their reaction to the South Korean snack in one word: ""Ecstasy."" Much like what Twinkies are to Americans, South Korea's Choco Pies -- two disc-shaped, chocolate-covered cakes, sandwiching a rubbery layer of marshmallow cream -- are ubiquitous, cost less than 50 cents and are full of empty calories. But on the other side of the Korean border, the snacks are viewed as exotic, highly prized treats, selling on North Korea's black markets for as much as $10, according to analysts. Their rising popularity in the north reveals an unexpected common ground between the two Koreas, despite their fractious relationship -- a shared sweet tooth. This month, an art exhibition called ""The Choco Pie-ization of North Korea"" opened in New York, exploring the symbolism of the treat. The high value in North Korea of the Choco Pie, something considered so widespread and mundane in South Korea, is  ""a sad tragic story,"" said the artist, Jin Jo Chae. Chae smeared melted chocolate across the North Korean newspaper Rodung Sinmun, staining the state-run propaganda with something sweet. She used the chocolate to make a symbol of Choco Pie, written in the lettering style of Coca Cola. Her exhibit, displayed at Julie Meneret Contemporary Art gallery, also contains piles of Choco Pies as well as a gold-plated one. ""Through this Choco Pie, I found the potential from chocolate as an object that changes a society,"" Chae said. The Choco Pie represents something more than just a treat. Subversive Choco and Coke? Despite perceptions of North Koreans as brainwashed, insulated masses, the hunger and desire for Choco Pie shows that ""complete quarantine is impossible,"" wrote Richard Lloyd Parry in London Review of Books. Lloyd wrote that it ""reveals a susceptibility to outside influence in a society commonly regarded as impenetrable."" The crumbly mass of chocolate and marshmallow had taken on a subversive aspect. Indeed, Chae, the artist behind the exhibit, says, the Choco Pie ""has a power in how it works as a mind changing tool between South and North."" The South Korean factory owner, who introduced his North Korean workers to Choco Pies, washed down with a Coca Cola, said the products seemed to leave an impression on his staff. ""It was clear that the workers had gotten at least some idea of capitalism and that it wasn't all bad,"" he told CNN. ""They had only associated the United States with evil, and the fact that they could love something that the U.S. had produced -- specifically Coca Cola -- was an eye-opener."" Choco trade . The factory owner, who did not wish to be named, operated his business for seven years at the Kaesong Industrial Complex, one of the key symbols of cooperation between North and South Korea, and the site through which Choco Pies trickled into North Korea. At the complex, more than 100 South Korean factory owners employ about 50,000 North Korean laborers to manufacture products like clothing and shoes. Kaesong, considered to be an important source of hard currency for North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's regime, sits just a few kilometers north of the Demilitarized Zone, which divides the two Koreas. It re-opened in September after a five-month hiatus. ""It's really the only one place where North Koreans and South Koreans come in regular contact together,"" said Stephen Noerper, senior vice president of the Korea Society, in New York. While workers at Kaesong brought their own rice, the South Korean factory owners provided them with soup and snacks, said the factory owner who spoke to CNN. ""The snacks were necessary because the workers were walking to work often for hours, because there were no buses and they became very hungry as they were working,"" he said. Choco Pie and Coca Cola were the standard snacks with other South Korean managers at Kaesong. They provided two Choco Pies a day, because ""otherwise, (the workers) would not have energy to sustain themselves at work,"" he said. But he and fellow South Korean managers also noticed a conspicuous lack of Choco Pie wrappers at the factory. ""It became clear that the workers were hiding them and taking them home to give them to their children,"" he said. Choco's value . The snacks spread to North Korea's informal markets, valued in the marketplace as about $10 in purchasing power, and holding something of a sweet spot for North Koreans, said Noerper. ""It's sentimental role,"" Noerper said. ""It's given by South Koreans. It's a South Korean product."" The Choco Pies have even been sent in balloon launches to North Korea by some advocacy groups. But Park Sang Hak, a prominent North Korean defector who regularly sends leaflets and supplies from South Korea, said the Choco Pies are not ideal for the balloons, because they weigh too much and crumble. Park says he prefers to send U.S. $1 bills, vitamins and information through USB drives. Choco replaced . At Kaesong, the South Korean factory owners eventually switched from Choco Pies to cup noodles -- ""in order to provide a more substantial snack,"" the former factory owner told CNN. The change, he said, was well-received. One of the most surprising things he remembered from his years at the factory was how North Korean workers were mystified by everyday items. The workers had no idea how to use a Western-style toilet, and had never seen toilet paper before, he said. He has since pulled out of Kaesong. Through all the stories about noise and misinformation about North Korea, perhaps the Choco Pie is a reminder of an aspect missing in the narratives about the country, said Noerper. ""We lose sight of the fact there's a common human experience. We need to realize North Koreans are regular human beings -- that 99% of North Koreans just desire a better life."" ""They want a Choco Pie at the end of the day.""","Businessman describes North Korean workers at Kaesong trying Choco Pie for first time .

"(CNN) -- Think half-eaten cookies and carrots are the only way to prove it was actually Santa who put that reindeer sweater under your Christmas tree? Think again. Thanks to Google and the North American Aerospace Defense Command, also known as NORAD, you can track old Saint Nick on his Christmas Eve journey around the globe. Log on to Noradsanta.org to view a special Google Map displaying Santa's whereabouts. The map, which launched at 2 a.m. EST on Friday, uses little red and yellow presents to note the places Santa has already visited. Click on the presents to learn a bit about each location, like Rabaul, Papua New Guinea, where, according to the map, Santa visited at 8:16 a.m. EST on Friday. A tiny Santa icon is used to show his current location while a countdown clock below the map lets users know where he'll take the sleigh next. But NORAD's interactive tracker isn't the only way to follow Mr. Claus around the world on Christmas Eve. Google Earth shows Santa and his reindeer in action as they make their way across the globe, from Seattle's Space Needle the to pyramids in Egypt and so on. Traveling on Christmas Eve? NORADs got you covered. Search ""Santa"" using Google Maps on your smartphone, or, better yet, just ask OnStar. ""Do you have an OnStar-equipped vehicle?"" NORAD asks on its official Noradsanta Twitter page. ""On Christmas Eve day, press the OnStar button and locate #Santa!"" The bi-national air defense command began tracking Santa in 1955 because of a typo in a Sears Roebuck & Co. advertisement, according to NORAD's website. The ad, reading, ""Hey, kiddies! Call me direct on my telephone,"" accidentally printed the wrong number, directing children to the phone of the former NORAD director of operations. Adding to the holiday excitement, first lady Michelle Obama teamed with NORAD to take calls Friday from children eager to know Santa's whereabouts, according to a NORAD press release. ""Hello, this is first lady Michelle Obama with NORAD Tracks Santa. How may I help you?"" she said, according to the release. Obama fielded the calls from Hawaii, where the first family will spend the holiday.","NEW: Michelle Obama helps kids track Santa's journey .

"Front Royal, Virginia (CNN) -- The young cheetahs chirped as a veterinarian gave them a quick but thorough checkup at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute. ""People always expect them to sound like scary carnivores, but they sound more like little birds,"" Luis Padilla said. The two cheetahs had been separated from their mother so they could be vaccinated, weighed and swabbed for DNA. While both cubs are attached to their mother, only one can truly call her mom. Zoologists at the Smithsonian National Zoo have cross-fostered a cheetah cub, persuading a female cheetah to become a foster mom to an at-risk cub. Cross-fostering cheetah cubs is rare, having been done six times within the North American captive cheetah population. Single-cub cheetahs are usually at risk because their mothers don't produce enough milk. After two cubs were born to different mothers at the zoo, officials decided to have one mom tend to both to ensure their chance of survival. The male cub was born first in December to first-time mother Amani. ""A cheetah female can't produce enough milk for just one cub because a single cub won't stimulate mom enough to keep producing milk,"" cheetah biologist Adrienne Crosier said. ""We hand-raised the first cub for about 13 days."" When another singleton female cub was born to 9-year-old Zazi, the zoo biologists decided to sneak the first cub in with the second and see if Zazi would raise both as her own. They took steps to transfer the smell of one cub to the other by doing things such as rubbing them together. Then they put the two cubs in a box together and let Zazi in. The big cat immediately went to the cub that wasn't naturally hers. ""She picked him up, she immediately started grooming him. And then laid down in the nest box with him, and it took about 20 to 30 minutes before she realized that there were two cubs in there with her,"" Crosier said. Zazi has since proven to be a model mother. Within an hour, she was feeding and grooming both. Cheetahs are considered to be vulnerable on the World Conservation Union's Red List of Threatened Animals. Researchers estimate that there are 7,000 to 12,000 cheetahs in the world, down from about 100,000 at the beginning of the 20th century. ""Hey buddy, nice teeth,"" Padilla told the young male as he took a look in his mouth and swabbed a sample for DNA testing. The female let out a loud chirp as the veterinarian tried to swab her mouth. ""She's getting a little worked up,"" Padilla said. Biologists are not sure who the real father of the little girl is, hence the DNA testing. ""Last year, we had our new young male coalition, and we wanted to literally teach them about female cheetahs and how to breed because they were very young and inexperienced,"" Crosier said. ""It's always a good management tool to put experienced cats with inexperienced cats. So we were training our younger males with that older experienced female, and she actually bred two of the boys in one day. So we are not sure which of the boys fathered the second cub."" Crosier pointed out that genetics will determine the future of the cubs. They'll stay with Zazi for another year, but they will likely get a breeding recommendation and go to other breeding centers.","Zoologists at the Smithsonian National Zoo cross-foster a cheetah cub .

"The discovery of a slain Palestinian teen in Jerusalem early Wednesday further inflamed tensions in a region already unsettled over the killings of three Israeli teens, not to mention decades of entrenched enmity between all sides. Mohammad Abu Khedair, 17, was heading from his home to a mosque in the middle-class neighborhood of Shuafat for prayers around 4 a.m. when three men forced him into a car and drove off, his father, Hussain Abu Khedair, told CNN. His body was found about an hour later at a forest in Jerusalem. The killing quickly triggered condemnations from Palestinian and Israeli leaders, as well as from the United States. Abducted Palestinian teen was kind, beloved . Those who spoke out passionately included an uncle of one of the three Israeli teens whose bodies were found earlier this week. He called the young Palestinian's killing ""a forbidden action, and it has no forgiveness."" ""Any act of revenge of any kind whatsoever is completely inappropriate and wrong. Murder is murder,"" said Yishai Frankel, uncle of Naftali Frankel, a 16-year-old dual Israeli-American citizen, to Israel's Channel 2. ""One should not differentiate between bloods, be it Arab or Jew. Israeli authorities are probing Wednesday's death, with police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld tweeting this effort will try to determine if it is a ""criminal or nationalistic"" act -- the latter term referring to a politically motivated act in retaliation for the Israeli  teens' killings. Mark Regev, a spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN late Wednesday that investigators ""at this stage cannot say who did this killing."" This came hours after Netanyahu's office promised a speedy investigation to find ""who is behind this despicable murder and the background to this act,"" according to a statement from his office. ""Netanyahu calls on all sides not to take the law into their own hands. Israel is a country of law and everyone is ordered to act according to the law."" The killing riled many Palestinians, particularly in Jerusalem. But it didn't happen in isolation. Israelis and Palestinians continue to trade blows -- over longstanding issues unrelated to Abu Khedair's death -- through rocket attacks and airstrikes. All this violence, from various angles, leads to one big question: When will it stop? Report: Body was 'charred and bore signs of violence' ""Settlers"" kidnapped the teenager and his body ""was charred and bore signs of violence,"" according to the Palestinian state news agency WAFA. DNA, through saliva samples, was used to positively identify the boy, his father said. Rosenfeld told the Jerusalem Post the teen had significant burn marks. The same Israeli publication also reported police are looking into previous kidnap attempts on members of the teenager's family related to a personal dispute. Yet Hussain Abu Khedair, the boy's father, blamed Israelis and vehemently denied reports that this may have been tied to any sort of family dispute. ""Netanyahu is responsible for the crime,"" the father told CNN, ""because he is the one who is giving the settlers the cover and supporting them."" The teen's cousin, Majdi Abu Khedair, said whoever carried out the abduction was driving a car that had been used in an attempted abduction two days ago. A similar claim was made to Haaretz by Knesset member Ahmed Tibi. The cousin passionately suggested: ""The Israeli police and Israeli government should do the same as they have done in Hebron: Demolish and blow the settler houses who have done this crime."" The Israeli military destroyed the homes of the two suspects in the killings of the three Israeli teens. When confronted with this suggestion, Regev insisted ""we are totally color blind when it comes to this sort of criminal act."" ""There's no difference between a Jewish resident of Jerusalem or an Arab resident of Jerusalem,"" the spokesman said. ""... Police will get to the bottom of this."" ""It is sickening to think of an innocent 17-year-old boy snatched off the streets and his life stolen from him and his family,"" said Secretary of State of John Kerry, who talked with Netanyahu by phone about the situation. ""There are no words to convey adequately our condolences to the Palestinian people."" He noted that both Israeli and Palestinian officials have condemned it, and he added to Netanyahu's call. ""Those who undertake acts of vengeance only destabilize an already explosive and emotional situation."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the Fatah party and is based in the West Bank, called Mohammad Abu Khedair's father and promised that those behind his abduction and death will be brought to justice, WAFA, the Palestinian state news agency, reported. And Hamas -- the militant Islamic organization that controls Gaza -- said in a statement that it holds the ""Israeli occupation (fully) responsible,"" adding that the incident ""exposes (Israel's) ugly ... racism"" and ""refutes the Israeli narration of being the victim all the time."" Anger, clashes in Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem . As news of the boy's death spread, public anger in Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem rose to levels rarely, if ever, seen since the Second Intifada, or uprising, last decade. That led to several clashes around the city, the biggest of which was centered in Shuafat. Residents there threw stones at security forces and the Israeli authorities responded with occasional volleys of stun grenades or tear gas. Some protesters attacked two Palestinians whom they mistook for undercover Israeli police, The Jerusalem Post reported. The clashes expanded and continued through midnight in the Palestinian neighborhood, with a large amount of Israeli forces on hand. In Suwwaneh, Palestinians threw rocks at a nearby settlement and several of them were injured by rubber bullets, witnesses said. And some tossed Molotov cocktails at an Israel settlement in Silwan, outside Jerusalem's Old City. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported that more than 100 were injured, most of them in Shuafat, in the clashes. There were concerns that the Palestinian teenager's funeral could spark further unrest. But his father said Thursday he was still waiting to hear from Israeli authorities when the body would be handed over to the family. ""The autopsy should be done around 1 p.m., and then I am supposed to wait for a call,"" Hussain Abu Khedair said on Palestinian television. ""We will not bury my son at night,"" he said. ""We will do it during the day. If they purposely delay, we will do it during the day even (if that means) tomorrow."" Israeli airstrikes into Gaza . Meanwhile, the dangerous back-and-forth between Gaza and Israel was erupting yet again. Rockets from the Palestinian territory into Israel was met by at least eight airstrikes within about an hour early Thursday. Three hit a Hamas intelligence building in Gaza city, while at least one struck the Qassam training camp in Beit Hanoun. Palestinian medical sources reported at least 10 injured, one of them seriously. Israel Defense Forces said the airstrikes -- going after 15 Hamas targets -- were in response to the firing of more than 20 rockets into Israel since Wednesday. This is in addition to other actions -- including the arrests of hundreds of Hamas activists, the demolition of homes and the closure of dozens of institutions in Gaza, according to Netanyahu -- targeting Hamas and focused in Gaza. This action follows the abduction of Israeli teens Eyal Yifrach, Gilad Shaar and Naftali Frankel as they were on their way home from school June 13; the three were found dead on Monday in a West Bank field. Hamas praised the kidnappings but denied that it was responsible for what happened. It warned that if Netanyahu ""brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him."" At the teens' funerals, Netanyahu said the country would avenge their deaths at ""the hands of evil men."" ""A broad moral gulf separates us from our enemies,"" he said. ""They sanctify death; we sanctify life. They sanctify cruelty and we mercy and compassion. That is the secret of our strength."" Opinion: Teens' killing hurts Israelis, bad for Palestinians .

"(CNN) -- Move over, baseball.  The coolest new trading cards feature a ""Geek a Week."" For the last 52 weeks,  artist Len Peralta has been interviewing one geek hero a week, posting podcasts of his discussions online and designing the front and back of a trading card. (Paul and Storm write the descriptions.) This week, nerdy retailer ThinkGeek debuts physical, collectible ""Geek a Week"" cards. The first installment features the first eight geeks in Peralta's project. The cards show a picture on the front of a celebrity in the geek world, stylized as an iconic character from sci-fi or fantasy. The backs offer a description of the characterized geek and an amalgamation of Dungeons & Dragons and Pokemon-stye attributes. The only thing missing is a dry, tasteless piece of gum. ""We're releasing them in waves of eight going in order, so there actually will be 56 cards total,"" Peralta said. ""So there will be four secret geeks included."" Already in the collection of 52 are such geek luminaries as Weird Al, Phil Plait, Felicia Day, Dana Snyder and Steve Wozniak. Peralta has gone from fanboy to respected interviewer and entrepreneur thanks to this geeky experiment. ""I'm selling the cards because I knew people wanted them. I wanted them. I wanted to hold on to them, I wanted them to be physical,"" he said. Thanks to society's recent acceptance of geeky enthusiasm, Peralta is convinced it's possible to turn nerd obsession indulgence into a viable career option. ""We're at a point where you're allowed to geek out and you're allowed to be kind of goofy,"" he said. Aaron Douglas, who played Chief Tyrol on ""Battlestar Galactica,"" sees things slightly differently. As ""Geek a Week"" card No. 47, Douglas was portrayed as ""The Comedian"" from Alan Moore's graphic novel, ""The Watchmen."" ""I love the sneer and the cigar. I love that I am a badass (geek). I love that you can be badass and a geek and I think that Len nailed it,"" he said. Neil Gaiman, author of ""The Sandman"" comic books and novels like ""Stardust"" and ""Coraline,"" was ""Geek a Week"" card No. 35, depicted as ""The Vault Keeper."" ""The depictions of people on the 'Geek a Week' cards are always fundamentally iconic,"" he said. ""For a storyteller, there's probably little that's more iconic than one of the old EC Comics horror hosts."" ""Obviously, I was consumed with bitter envy with my friends who were depicted as superheroes,"" he said, but admitted he would rather be cobwebby and in a crypt somewhere. Douglas said the trading cards are unique because, ""It is a window into the lives of people you wouldn't otherwise get to know in this way. It shows that it is cool to be a geek and that there are many very cool people who have a whole geek side that their professions don't allow out."" ""Part of the fun of geek a week is actually celebrating the people who don't normally get their cards,"" said Gaiman. ""Because if you ask your average person in the street who Jonathan Coulton was, they might look at you with puzzled eyes and hazard a guess as to possibly someone in baseball or maybe a politician. But if you're on the right college campus or on the right internet site and mention Jonathan Coulton, you will see eyes that light up and people salivate and start humming songs and it becomes this sort of bonding thing."" Kari Byron -- ""Head Rush"" host, part of the ""Mythbusters"" team and ""Geek a Week"" card No. 36 (as the Tomb Raider) -- said, ""He really captured what people actually look like. He definitely got the essence of people."" ""He's honoring people that are sort of outside the box. It's not Lady Gaga or the glamorous (celebrities), it's kind of Dragon*Con culture people,"" Byron said. ""(No. 52) was Nolan Bushnell, the 'godfather of gaming,' he called him. I really like the fact that he's honoring a different sort of person."" ""I think geek is definitely a career path you can take now. It's become something you don't have to be ashamed of. If you're good at math, you like comic books and you watch 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer,' it's not uncool anymore,"" she said. ""The commercialization of nerd-dom made my career."" To commemorate the debut of the ""Geek a Week"" cards, ThinkGeek is holding a weeklong charity auction of items related to the geeks of the weeks -- including an action figure of Chief Tyrol from ""Battlestar Galactica"" signed by Douglas, honey from Gaiman's private apiary, signed editions of the first set of Geek a Week cards and original props from ""Mythbusters."" Peralta is still amazed at how his project has turned out. ""It's weird, because I'm just a fan,"" he said. ""I'm no one. I'm an unknown artist and to have (celebrities donate to the charity) like that is really edifying."" On his journey to a nerdy career, Peralta has learned ""it never hurts to ask,"" and he's been able to connect to geek royalty through the relationships he fostered along the way. ""I guess what I've learned is that being friendly, being honest and open and just being a nice person still counts in this world,"" he said. Peralta found that his heroes were unpretentious and normal, but that didn't do much to stop the butterflies in his stomach. ""Honestly, I never stopped feeling like a total nerd. I always felt like I was still not able to approach the cool-people table, like in high school,"" he said. ""The phrase I've been using is, I felt like a nerd among nerds."" But the nerds love his work. ""I really like the Bonnie Burton (card),"" Byron said. ""She's just so gothy looking, it's great! He definitely captured her."" ""I want mine, obviously, because dammit, I want my card,"" Gaiman said. ""And I want Paul & Storm's, because I got to write the back of that one."" Douglas said he wants all the cards. But thanks to a frenemy relationship with ""Geek a Week"" card No. 14, ""If I had to pick one,"" he said, ""Wil Wheaton, so I can tape it to my dart board.""","Artist Len Peralta has been interviewing one geek hero a week .

"They were teenagers on their way home from school. One liked basketball and was a gifted musician who played a mean guitar as well as the flute. Another liked to bake cakes for his five younger sisters. The third would bring jars of cookies to study hall for his classmates. Naftali Frankel, Eyal Yifrach and Gilad Shaar, Israeli Jewish teens, were buried Tuesday after a memorial ceremony watched nationwide. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the three were ""gifted, pure, honest and decent"" and were ""cut down by the hands of evil men."" Their deaths galvanized the country and sparked new Israeli military action, exacerbating the conflict. The teens' bodies were found Monday, more than two weeks after the three were abducted on their way home from school in the West Bank. Naftali Frankel, a dual U.S.-Israel citizen . Frankel, the 16-year-old musician and basketball fan, was also a U.S. citizen who had family in Brooklyn and in upstate New York, his aunt Ittael Frankel told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ""Rest in peace, my child,"" said his grieving mother, Racheli Frankel, according to ynetnews.com. ""We will learn to sing without you. We will always hear your voice in our hearts."" Frankel was the second-oldest of seven children. He was a gifted student and ""a responsible and poised young boy,"" the Israeli Embassy in Britain said in a profile of him after he was abducted. His uncle was working to help bring more Palestinians into Israeli high-tech businesses, Forbes reported. The article by Richard Behar carried the headline: ""Good vs Evil: Israeli Intel Exec Pioneers Hi-Tech With Palestinians. His Nephew, A U.S. Citizen, Is Abducted By Terrorists."" It reported on Yishai Frankel, the 44-year-old general manager of design and development at Intel's headquarters in Jerusalem, who was spearheading integration efforts for the company. ""There's no doubt that people who kidnap young kids are destructive and they hurt the Palestinian cause as equally as it's hurting the Israeli cause. It doesn't help anyone,"" the uncle was quoted as saying. ""So, am I surprised? No, I'm saddened. But that's reality. Does that mean I feel bad things about the good people I work with, among the Palestinians? No. These are good people. It's no secret that every society has bad people."" Victim's cousin: Support helped deepen ties . His American cousin Manny Halberstam described him as someone ""always full of joy and full of positivity"" who ""made his parents' lives a lot easier by being such a good older brother."" ""There's this perception that spending time in Israel, spending time in the West Bank, could be pretty dangerous. The truth is, when you're there in the West Bank, up until a few weeks ago, when you're there, you really feel pretty safe. You don't feel like you're in danger at all. And I think, unfortunately, in response to this incident ... that sense of safety is going to change,"" Halberstam said. In an interview with Brooke Baldwin on ""CNN Newsroom,"" Halberstam had a message for all the people ""with a strong moral conscience"" who have been protesting the abduction of the boys, as well as the abductions of more than 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria.  Supporters for the Israeli teens used the hashtag #BringBackOurBoys, following the lead of #BringBackOurGirls. ""By no means was the time and energy that we invested in these campaigns a waste, because through our efforts, we strengthened our sense of community and we deepened our ties with each other.  And I think, in that sense, we've moved the world to the type of world in which these types of incidents occur less frequently."" Gilad Shaar, oldest of six . Gilad Shaar, also 16, was ""gifted"" and ""always smiling,"" his grandfather Ezra Sha'ar told Israel's Channel 2, according to israelnationalnews.com. ""He was a boy who loved to learn, to do everything for the community and for society."" He ""loved his country"" and took a lot of trips across Israel, the grandfather said. He spoiled his five younger sisters, Shaar's American aunt, Leehy Shaar, wrote in an open letter on June 23 in the Los Angeles-based Jewish Journal. ""He loves to bake cakes,"" she added. ""And they are truly delicious."" She told CNN's Jake Tapper on Monday that she was still in shock. ""I'm holding his picture, and I see his smile,"" she said. ""He's so young and innocent. ... It's just too sad to even imagine."" ""I've lost my only son. How can I sum up your life, your acts, in a few sentences?"" Gilad Shaar's grieving father asked Monday at a memorial service, according to the Jerusalem Post. His former counselor said that as a child, Shaar threw a birthday party for his school's goldfish, journalist Ben Hartman of the Jerusalem Post reported on Twitter. Eyal Yifrach, beloved brother figure who sang on YouTube . At 19, Eyal Yifrach was the oldest of the victims and ""a big personality,"" according to his friend and roommate. ""Eyal is the type of person everybody would want as a brother,"" Micky Zivan told The Times of Israel. Zivan said his pal would leave a jar of cookies near the study hall with a sign that read ""Please take."" ""We're crying, but these are tears of strength and love,"" said Uri Yifrach, Eyal's father, according to ynetnews.com. To the killers, he said, ""You are wrongdoers, the nation of Israel promises that your day will come. We will not break. We are humanitarians, we have love and it will triumph. ... We're here, and you can't change that. We're a strong nation."" A few months ago, Eyal Yifrach sang at his cousin's wedding in a performance posted on YouTube, the Jewish Press reported.

"""Brothers, what we do in life echoes in eternity"" (line from the film Gladiator) Gladiators, ready? From the ancient ruins of Rome, a new empire rises. But with a nod to the past, the city's newest gladiator James Pallotta's eyes light up when his thoughts turn to historic sites like the Colosseum. For if all roads lead to Rome, the AS Roma president is leaving no stone unturned in his intention to marry the Eternal City's historic past with Italian football's new emerging force. ""I have one big goal,"" Pallotta tells CNN, with an infectious smile. ""I want to get the city to let us play somebody like Barcelona or Bayern Munich or someone like that at the Colosseum."" While the idea might have the marketing department rubbing their hands with glee, Pallotta could have his work cut out, persuading those maintaining these sites to allow Francesco Totti and Daniel de Rossi to put on an altogether different kind of gladiatorial show. Commissioned by Emperor Vespasian, the Colosseum remains Rome's most iconic monument and while others may not have ever considered bring the modern day Roman legion to entertain the masses, Pallotta is not like any other owner. ""We'll do a pay-per-view on it, $25 around the world,"" adds the Bostonia, elaborating on the idea. ""We could get 300 million people wanting to watch that around the world -- a game in the Colosseum which they'll never see again. ""We take that money, which could be billions of dollars, and then set up a foundation in Rome to fix up the antiquities even faster and put the rest towards inner city programs in Rome."" Vespasian died before he could see the Colosseum completed by his son, Titus, in AD 80, with the 55,000 arena becoming an integral part of Rome's history. Pallotta jokes he wouldn't mind seeing a few lions let out of the traps to speed up the match tempo, and the 56-year-old American-born investor, who took over the job of rebuilding Roma in 2012 , is clearly a man in a hurry. While millions flock to the Italian capital to gaze upon the likes of St Peter's Basilica, the Pantheon and the Sistine Chapel, Pallotta wants future visitors to embrace a new modern Roma. ""When you walk around the city, you cannot keep your head down,"" he said. ""You have to look up because of the architecture and every step you take is amazing. ""For us not to have Rome be a significant part of what we are doing with the team would be foolish."" A fixture between Roma against world class opposition at the Colosseum or perhaps more realistically, at the Circus Maximus given rock concerts have been staged there, is just one of Pallotta's many ideas. Neither Barca nor Bayern responded to CNN's request to see if they would consider playing against Roma in one of these venues in a friendly. However, more tangible is Pallotta's intention to provide Rome with a new stadium which the club hopes will be ready for the 2016-17 season. Able to accommodate up to 60,000 people, the arena is intended to become the focal point for a new chapter in the club's history. A ""Peak Performance Center"" will be built adjacent to the stadium providing facilities for the club's first and youth teams to train, while a deal has been struck with local authorities to extend the metro line allowing easier access for supporters. A new club village, which will host restaurants, bars and shops will also be built with the 13,500 square meter fanzone helping to create thousands of jobs. Given that Rome was not built in a day, Pallotta has big plans for Roma's youth academy and the city's youngsters. ""In the past year, we had Roma kids on our shirts which is the foundation we set up for inner city programs in Rome,"" explained the American. ""In terms of the youth side of things, we've got good programs but what we've instituted is a new educational framework. ""I didn't think we were doing enough. We know only three or four kids are going to make it to Serie A or the Premier League, so what are they going to do when they're 18 or 19? ""Are they going to be a clerk somewhere? Or get a menial job with no education? ""So we instituted a 9th-12th grade formal program which is online and this will help them get into college. ""They'll get accredited if they can't make it in football and we'll help them."" A fan of NBA franchise Boston Celtics, Pallotta is well aware of the role that history can have in promoting a brand and he has used some of the NBA's ideas to help reinvigorate Roma. A Hall of Fame was set up following a vote by supporters, while the club's logo was changed and the name 'AS Roma' registered as a trademark. He is hoping that the likes of inspirational captain Totti, known as 'el Capitano,' will remain at the club when he retires in an ambassadorial role. Pallotta talks about how each of the players is like a son to him, while he insists that those who work in the kitchens or security department equally command his respect. ""Francesco is going to be with us forever,"" says Pallotta with that trademark smile as he talks about the 38-year-old player, who made his debut for Roma at the age of 16. ""Part of the role will be defined by him on what he wants to do. ""We would like him to be around the pitch, talking to people who are coming into the club and telling them, 'I've been here 20 years, this is what Roma's all about.' ""You would love to have him with the youth team and once in a while actually going out there and having a drill with them. ""And the other thing you'd love is for him to be an ambassador for us. If I'm a nine-year-old and Totti walks in and sits down with you and your parents and says 'I was here and this is what is going on at Roma' then the kids will be thinking 'OK, wow.'"" While the past and future are being taken care of, the present is very much up to those on the field of play. Roma, which faces Bayern Munich in the Champions League Tuesday, has made an encouraging start to the domestic and European season. Under head coach Rudi Garcia, the team has impressed with the likes of Totti, Miralem Pjanic, and Mattia Destro all catching the eye. All three men played a vital role in Roma's 3-0 win over Chievo last weekend -- a result which leaves the team in second place and just one point behind leaders Juventus. Bayern represents the biggest test faced by Roma at the Stadio Olimpico so far this season but for Pallotta, it is these kind of challenges which has put his club back in the big time. ""People are starting to talk more about what is going on at Roma,"" Pallotta says with a smile. ""It's a long-term thing. You can do it in one or two years and people will think it's a fluke, but the objective is to do it over 20 years and have that stability. ""We want to be in the Champions League, compete for the title which I feel we can do this year.""

Among other things, the measure would require workers -- with the exception of police and firefighters -- to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions. Collective bargaining would be limited to wages, though any pay increases beyond the inflation rate would be subject to voter approval. Democrats chanted ""shame, shame, shame"" moments after the vote, pointing their fingers at the exiting Republican lawmakers. But the fight over the bill appears far from over. It still must clear the Wisconsin Senate, a step that is likely to prove far more contentious. Fourteen Democratic senators have fled to neighboring Illinois to prevent a quorum from voting on the issue, and they remained absent early Friday. Gov. Scott Walker reiterated his call for Democrats to return to the Legislature, defending the bill. ""Collective bargaining is a fiscal matter,"" said Walker, who toured multiple state districts Friday in an effort to pressure the absentee lawmakers. But Democrats said the governor's proposal is tantamount to union-busting. ""The vote we took wasn't the easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do,"" Assembly Majority Leader Scott Suder, a Republican, said early Friday. ""I continue to urge my Democrat colleagues in the Senate to come back to Madison so that they can debate this bill and do their job for the taxpayers of Wisconsin."" Thousands have protested the legislation in recent days. On Thursday, Walker also called on Democrats to come back to Madison ""and do their job."" The absence of the Democrats prevents a quorum from voting on the bill. ""It is a serious breach,"" said University of Chicago law professor Richard Epstein. ""We're looking at a set of novel and unprecedented actions. But a breakdown of the democratic process and mayhem are two different things."" If the Democrats are ""willing to go to the mattresses on this, then it has got to be worth a lot of money,"" he said. At a Thursday night news conference, Walker said if the Legislature does not pass his budget bill, state aid to local governments could be cut, brushing off critics who said the legislation will destroy public employee unions in the state. ""Wisconsin state employees have the strongest civil protections in the country. That's not going to change in this bill,"" Walker said. ""It's not about the union boss coming in from other parts of the country. It's about whether we protect the taxpayers and the workers."" One lawmaker who left the state, Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller, said in a response from Rockford, Illinois, that Walker should ""recognize that he got what he wants"" in concessions on pension and health insurance contributions and relent on curbing collective-bargaining rights. The confrontation reached a fever pitch after Walker was recorded during a prank phone call discussing the idea of duping absentee Democrats by luring them back to ""talk, not negotiate,"" allow them to recess and then have the 19 Republican senators declare a quorum. The Republican-led Senate presumably then would be able to move forward on the controversial legislation. The state had faced a suggested deadline Friday to balance the budget. The crucial date is March 16, state officials said. Wisconsin is confronted with a $137 million budget shortfall by June 30 and a $3.6 billion gap by 2013.

"United Nations (CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council is considering a new draft resolution that includes a no-fly zone over Libya and additional economic and political sanctions. But council nations remain divided on the no-fly zone proposal. Germany's U.N. ambassador said his country has questions about such a zone. India's U.N. ambassador asked, ""Who will implement the no-fly zone? Who would provide assets for it?"" China's U.N. ambassador said his country is concerned about deteriorating conditions in Libya but didn't say whether Beijing backs a no-fly measure. The United States declined to take a public position. A council diplomat said the U.S. is engaged in negotiations on the text. The resolution is in two main parts. The no-fly zone section says the council ""decides to authorize a ban on all flights in the airspace of Libya in order to help protect civilians."" It authorizes member states to ""take all necessary measures to enforce compliance."" Another element refers to helping in the delivery of humanitarian food and supplies. There is far more support in the council for the sanctions part, rather than the no-fly-zone. The Arab League recommendation of a no-fly zone carries some weight with reluctant council nations. But the Arab League declaration that there should be ""no foreign intervention"" has perplexed delegates. That's why Lebanon, the lone Arab member of the Security Council, has been asked to get clarification on this stance from the Arab League. Lebanon's U.N. ambassador said Libyan diplomats at the United Nations will be asked for information on places and safe passages that can be protected by a no -ly zone in an effort to help answer some nations' questions on the zone. Lebanese Ambassador Nawaf Salam told reporters his country is in favor of a no-fly zone that would have a deterrent effect on Libyan government forces.. Asked about French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's remarks that events on the ground may made a no-fly-zone irrelevant, Lebanon's U.N. ambassador declared ""nothing is too late but may not be enough."" Security Council consultations resume at 11 a.m. Wednesday. France's U.N. ambassador, Gerard Araud, said he doubts a vote will occur Wednesday because the resolution has a long and technical text.","India's ambassador: ""Who will implement the no-fly zone?""

"Turkey has temporarily closed crossings to and from Syria along its border due to fighting between opposition groups inside Syria, the Turkish Commerce and Customs Ministry said Wednesday. The announcement came shortly after the United States and Britain suspended non-lethal aid to the Syrian opposition. Syrian National Coalition spokesman Louay Safi called the move ""a temporary measure to sort out the situation in northern Syria,"" where the Free Syrian Army lost a weapons depot to the Islamic Front in fighting in recent days. The aid consisted of wood, medical items, non-military equipment like generators and communication equipment, he said. ""I can't give you a particular date but I hope this can be solved,"" he added. Several U.S. administration officials said Wednesday that the fate of Salim Idris, a top rebel commander supported by the West, was uncertain in the wake of the seizure of the warehouse. U.S. officials said he had left Syria. They added that the seizure of the depot, a warehouse, could prove key in shaping how the United States deals with the Syrian opposition. U.S. Ambassador to Syria Robert Ford is expected to travel this week to the region to meet with opposition members. The officials said U.S. authorities were considering expanding their contacts with moderate Islamists who are not affiliated with al Qaeda. The Islamic Front, which announced its formation last month, is an alliance that includes tens of thousands of fighters from some of Syria's most powerful Islamist groups, including Ahrar al-Sham, Suqour al-Sham, the Islamic Army and the Tawhid Brigade. The groups control territory in key areas across Syria and have been fighting forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad along the critical lines of Damascus and Aleppo, among other places. The front's formation has diminished the stature of the Western-backed Free Syrian Army and its leadership abroad, the Syrian National Coalition, as leaders inside the country have sought to distance themselves from a command structure criticized for failing to serve the opposition's needs on the ground. The alliance was formed after the al Qaeda-linked Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant -- known as ISIS -- succeeded as the predominant military force in northern Syria, marginalizing and even fighting Syria's more moderate factions. ISIS's largely foreign fighting force poses a threat to rebel groups competing for funding, resources and influence in Syria. The U.S. government suspended its aid Wednesday amid the instability near the Turkish border, State Department officials said. The suspension does not affect humanitarian aid efforts, they said. The UK Foreign Office, in a statement, said it was ""investigating events that took place over the weekend. While that investigation is under way, we will not be making any deliveries of equipment to the Supreme Military Council. ""We intend to resume support as soon as we and the SMC are satisfied the conditions on the ground allow the SMC to take safe delivery of equipment provided."" The blockage of passage to Turkey could have implications for refugees. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported in September that nearly 500,000 Syrians had registered or were awaiting registration as refugees in Turkey, and those numbers have been increasing since. Meanwhile, a huge storm dubbed Alexa descended Tuesday and Wednesday on the region, dropping snow and rain whipped by high winds onto Turkey, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, with the latter most affected, the UNHCR said. In the Bekaa in eastern Lebanon, where thousands of Syrian refugees were living in tents, emergency crews were distributing aid, it said in a statement. ""Reports from Syria and parts of Turkey spoke of similarly grim conditions there,"" it said. The Syrian conflict began in March 2011 after government forces cracked down on peaceful protesters during the Arab Spring movement and is now a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 100,000 people have died in the conflict.","U.S. officials: Fate of rebel commander Salim Idris is uncertain .

"Richard III was the last English king to lose his life on the battlefield. Scientists who have been testing his remains -- found under a parking lot in the English city of Leicester -- now believe they know how he died. The 15th-century king was best known to modern Britons as the hunchbacked Shakespearean villain accused of murdering his nephews, the ""Princes in the Tower,"" to usurp the throne. His life has always been a controversial chapter in English lore. Although he ruled for only two years (1483-85) and died at the age of 32, there has been an ongoing debate over Richard III's portrayal in both English history and English literature. According to historians, the king's defeat and death at Bosworth Field ended the Wars of the Roses and marked the end of the Middle Ages in England. Though he was a royal, his body was given to local monks, and he was buried in a crude grave in an unknown location. It was not until archaeologists from the University of Leicester discovered his remains under a parking lot in 2012 that people learned where his body had been buried. Since that time, both scientists and medical researchers have studied the remains to better understand how King Richard III lived and died. Now, researchers have used modern forensic analysis to reveal that he suffered 11 injuries at or near the time of death, according to a new study published in The Lancet. Of those, three had the potential to cause death quickly: two to the skull and one to the pelvis. And the scientists believe that the skull injuries were the ones that killed the last monarch from the House of York. Leicester to be final burial place of Richard III . ""Richard's injuries represent a sustained attack or an attack by several assailants with weapons from the later medieval period,"" said Professor Sarah Hainsworth, one of the authors of the study. ""The wounds to the skull suggest that he was not wearing a helmet, and the absence of defensive wounds on his arms and hands indicate that he was otherwise still armored at the time of his death."" The injury to his pelvis might have been inflicted after his death, the team surmised, since the kind of armor that would have been worn by the king in the late 15th century would have protected that area. ""I think the most surprising injury is the one to the pelvis,"" Hainsworth said. ""We believe that this corresponds to contemporary accounts of Richard III being slung over the back of the horse to be taken back to Leicester after the Battle of Bosworth, as this would give someone the correct body position to inflict this injury."" There were nine injuries to the skull in total and two elsewhere on the skeleton. The team used whole-body CT scans and micro-CT imaging of injured bones to analyze trauma, according to a news release from The Lancet. They also looked at tool marks on the bones to try to establish what kind of weapons were used. ""The most likely injuries to have caused the king's death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull -- a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon, such as a halberd or bill, and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon,"" said Professor Guy Rutty, a co-author of the study. ""Richard's head injuries are consistent with some near-contemporary accounts of the battle, which suggest that Richard abandoned his horse after it became stuck in a mire and was killed while fighting his enemies."" Although the findings are interesting to historians, the question remains: Do they change the accounts of King Richard III's last moments in battle? Since none of the wounds overlapped, the researchers were not able to tell in exactly what order they occurred. ""The (investigators) provide a compelling account, giving tantalizing glimpses into the validity of the historic accounts of his death, which were heavily edited by the Tudors in the following 200 years, "" said Heather Bonney of the Natural History Museum in London. ""I am sure that Richard III will continue to divide opinion fiercely for centuries to come."" After a legal battle, it has been decided that the medieval king will be reburied next spring in Leicester Cathedral, just a stone's throw from where his remains were uncovered. Bones reveal king's taste for luxury food, wine . Richard III had worms, scientists say .","Scientists have analyzed King Richard III's skeletal remains to see how he was killed .

"It was an experience like no other. As my train from Beijing slowly traversed over an old iron bridge, I looked at the murky river below. A man stood waist-deep in the water casting a net. On one side of the river, China. On the other, the world's most isolated country -- North Korea. Soon, the first North Korean buildings appeared along with a small, abandoned fairground hidden in the shadow of some houses. The train made a sudden stop. People flooded a station platform. We'd stopped at Shinuju Cheongnyeon Station across the bridge that links Shinuju with the Chinese border city of Dandong. A group of North Korean border officials in neat uniforms boarded the train, collecting passports from passengers. Three hours later, the train got moving again. Green fields surrounded by hills (mountains make up more than 70% of North Korea) appeared on both sides of the track. An enchanting landscape unfolded. Valleys and flat areas were filled endless fields of rich crops. It made me think about the country's reported chronic food shortages. Finally, 24 hours after leaving Beijing, the train arrived in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital and home to more than 3 million people. A group of North Korean guards and minders were waiting -- all foreign visitors and tour groups must be accompanied by guards, who are referred to as ""guides"" or ""officials."" I was given a brief introduction on how to behave, and informed of other restrictions and guidelines. The North Koreans impose strict rules on what visitors are allowed to photograph, who they can talk to and where they can walk. For instance, it's seen as an insult to crop out hands, feet or head when taking photos of statues or pictures of government leaders or officials. The guards also act as human shields between foreign visitors and the North Korean people. They followed me almost everywhere I went. It was under these restrictions that I visited the country for a total of nine days in the summer of 2012. While there, I found that capturing mundane scenes from people's daily lives on camera suddenly become extraordinary. I'm told that candid pictures of normal people are usually restricted by the government. I photographed all sorts of scenes: pedestrians in Pyongyang, topless men playing volleyball, a group of women who sweep the streets and commuters riding on the back of a truck. This was often as close as I got to the locals -- any direct contact with the North Korean people is virtually impossible. As well as fear and reservation, and the intimidating scrutiny of the guides, most North Koreans cannot understand English. Chatty guards . The guards were a different story. One of them, Mr. Kim, talked. A lot. He told me about his years in the North Korean Army, where he became a major. For his loyalty, he said was rewarded with trips to Eastern Europe. Once, while on a stopover in then East Berlin, he told me he'd visited the city's famed Alexanderplatz. For some North Koreans, the most exotic vacation possible is closer to home -- the coastal town of Wonsan, about 200 kilometers to the east of the capital. Here, North Koreans looked to be enjoying a laid back summer holiday at the beach. Minus a few obvious differences, it could have been a scene from another part of Asia. Everyone looked relaxed and happy. People were swimming, sunbathing and playing ball games. Small sail boats that had the North Korean flag printed on their sails were available for hire. The stretch of beach I visited was fenced in and Westerners were allowed to walk around freely within that perimeter. This was the closest I could get to ordinary North Korean people and it was in sharp contrast to the poorer, harsher views of rural life I got during the trip east. Back in Pyongyang, before my departure, there were signs of outside influences slowly emerging. There was the city's first hamburger shop, which the locals refer to as McDonald's. Two Italian restaurants had also recently opened. One of those, a pizza restaurant, was the venue for my last night in the country. Inside, a woman with a microphone stood engulfed in cigarette smoke. She sang one Italian classic hit after another -- with almost no accent. As in other parts of Asia, karaoke is a way of life in North Korea, usually existing hand in hand with cigarettes and alcohol. Three young women in tight skirts were running the kitchen, sweating while working with a brand new pizza oven. Most customers were tourists like me, business people or embassy staff -- the price for a pizza is too high for most North Koreans. Like other North Koreans I'd met or photographed, I felt from the staff a distinctive curiosity, tinged with a shyness of not knowing how to react to the increasing numbers of visiting foreigners. They all seemed genuinely friendly, polite and well educated. For me, North Koreans seem to be no different than any other people.

"A teen shot by his cousin during last month's rampage at a Washington state high school has died, bringing the total fatalities to five, including the gunman. Andrew Fryberg, 15, was hospitalized after the October 24 shooting in the cafeteria of Marysville Pilchuck High School.  He died Friday. In a statement announcing his death, the family thanked Harborview Medical Center for his care and asked for privacy. ""Our family is overwhelmed with the love and care that has been provided to our loved one during this time and you all will forever hold a special place in our hearts,"" the statement said. The four victims died on different days. In addition to  Fryberg,  Zoe Galasso died at the scene while Gia Soriano and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit died days later. All the latter three girls were age 14. Another student, Nate Hatch, 14, recovered and was released from hospital this week. Hatch and the latest victim were cousins of the gunman, Jaylen Fryberg, 15, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the scene. The boys were close friends, nearly inseparable and lived close to one another, their grandfather, Don Hatch, said last month. The popular freshman opened fire in the crowded lunchroom last month at the school in Marysville, about 30 miles north of Seattle. All the victims were invited to the same lunch table by the shooter, authorities said. Shortly before the attack, the gunman sent a selfie to an ex-girlfriend of himself holding a gun, a law enforcement official said. It is unclear if it is the same .40 caliber pistol he pulled out of a black backpack and fired. It's unclear how many shots were fired, but he had at least one bullet left when teacher Megan Silberberger confronted him. He used the final shot to end his life, authorities said.","Andrew Fryberg, 15, was hospitalized after the October 24 shooting .

"Derik, Kurdish-controlled northern Syria (CNN)It wasn't until jihadist militants mounted a relentless siege of Kobani, a border town within sight of international television cameras, that much of the world realized ethnic Kurds were an effective fighting force within Syria. But as much of the rest of Syria ripped itself apart in a vicious civil war, Syria's Kurdish minority spent three years quietly building a series of mini-states in the north of the country. They refer to these three enclaves as Rojava.  Until recently, some outside observers saw them as something of a success. ""They tried to run them as pretty autonomous statelets that were actually rather admirable in some ways.  They included many different ethnic groups, faith groups, and they tried to be inclusive,"" said Hugh Pope, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, a conflict mediation organization. Bulletins pasted on walls on the streets of one Kurdish-controlled town urge business owners to post signs in the three official languages of Rojava: Kurdish, Arabic, and Syriac -- an ancient Christian language spoken in the Middle East for nearly 2,000 years. ""The municipality will help in preparation and translation,"" the bulletins printed by the municipality of Derik.  ""Our language is our identity, our history, our existence and our dignity."" In some ways, the Kurdish-controlled zone feels a world away from many other battle-scarred towns in northern Syria. These areas have barely been targeted by the Syrian government airstrikes and barrel bombs that pummel rebel-held cities and towns, killing at least 182 civilians last week alone, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Unlike the atmosphere in territory controlled by Islamist militias, women in Rojava walk freely on the streets, their hair and faces uncovered. And everywhere, there are posters and graffiti celebrating the bravery and martyrdom of Kurdish fighters from the People's Protection Units, or YPG. ""Our martyrs do not die.  They live on in memory!"" a Kurdish commander announced at a memorial ceremony for slain fighters.  The commander, a woman dressed in green camouflage wearing a pistol on her belt, stood in front of scores of uniformed female Kurdish militants who performed military parade drills with Kalashnikov assault rifles. A pillar of the Kurdish movement's ideology rests on gender equality. The fiercely secular YPG stands in sharp contrast to its bitter enemy the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).  In territories it controls, ISIS militants dramatically reduced freedoms of women and issued public statements justifying the kidnapping and enslavement of thousands of women from the Yazidi religious minority in Iraq. ""We as women defend and protect our people,"" said Hadiye Yusuf, the female co-president of the largest of the 3 Kurdish enclaves, in an address at the memorial ceremony. ""We carry weapons to protect our homes and avoid becoming slaves of ISIS,"" she added. At the conclusion of the ceremony, female fighters as well as the mothers and widows of YPG members killed fighting ISIS, chanted ""Biji sera Apo,"" or ""Long Live Apo."" Apo is the nickname of Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.  For 30 years, militants from this Marxist-inspired Kurdish separatist movement fought a guerilla war against the government in nearby Turkey.  To this day, Turkey, as well as its NATO allies the United States and the European Union, officially label the PKK a terrorist organization. YPG leaders insist the PKK is a fraternal, though distinctly separate organization. The YPG's iconography and membership suggest otherwise. PKK leader Ocalan's portrait sits at the center of many posters of slain YPG fighters.  In addition, during two trips CNN journalists made to Rojava, CNN encountered at least a dozen armed Kurdish militants of Turkish origin. In an interview with CNN, co-president Hadiye Yusuf said in her youth she had been a PKK fighter, before eventually becoming an activist in a women's association. The Syrian Kurds' close links to the PKK put Rojava at odds with the Kurdish zone's neighbor to the north: Turkey. That left the enclave of Kobani vulnerable when ISIS mounted its assault last month. ""When push came to shove in Kobani, the YPG fighters were terribly exposed and have been dealt very cruel blows,"" said the ICG's Hugh Pope. More than 200,000 refugees fled across the border to Turkey to escape the ISIS advance.  Meanwhile, Kobani's Kurdish defenders were pushed back almost to the border fence with Turkey in their grim struggle against the jihadi offensive. American airstrikes, and a series of weapons and ammunition air drops, succeeded in loosening the ISIS siege.  But the US move to help the Syrian Kurds strained relations with Turkey, whose president called the American aid drops ""a mistake."" While the Syrian Kurds have become a point of tension between two NATO allies, they are also enjoying soaring popularity among Kurds scattered across different countries in the Middle East. Last August, YPG fighters mounted a daring rescue operation across the border into neighboring Iraq.  They evacuated thousands of of Iraqi Kurds from the Yazidi religious group, who were trapped by ISIS on a barren mountain. Over the last month, the YPG's defense of Kobani have electrified and united Kurds often fractured by linguistic and political divisions. But the popularity has come at great cost. Hundreds of YPG members have been killed, and many more wounded, in the war against ISIS. At the memorial ceremony for fallen fighters last weekend, a widow named Khalisa Gharzi sat with her daughter and son watching the speeches. She was in the final month of her pregnancy with her daughter Zhanda last year, when her husband Ramadan was killed in a battle with ISIS. Gharzi said her husband's body had been mutilated when it was recovered, with one of his ears severed. ""I am angry and sad about what happened to him, but I'm still proud because he was a fighter,"" Gharzi said.  ""If I didn't have these children, I myself would go and fight.  Because this is a just war."" Not far away, her 3-and-a-half-year old son Hogur played next to rows of female fighters who sat on the parade ground clutching their rifles. The boy was dressed in the green camouflage uniform of a future Kurdish fighter.

"(CNN)After five months of detention in North Korea, Jeffrey Fowle arrived home in Ohio early Wednesday for an emotional reunion with his family. Stepping off the plane at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and onto the tarmac, he was embraced by family members, including his three children. ""It's a good sign that the North Koreans released this man unconditionally,"" former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson told CNN's ""New Day.""  ""They usually demand a price."" Richardson has helped negotiate the release of prisoners in the past, including from North Korea. Pyongyang's move is ""a signal to the U.S. that says, 'All right, let's start talking,' "" and perhaps restart nuclear negotiations, he said. 'Fig leaf' statement . A North Korean government official told CNN that Fowle was released after leader Kim Jong Un issued a ""special dispensation."" ""Comrade Kim Jong Un, the First Chairman of the National Defence Commission, in deference to agreement between the Supreme Leaders of the DPRK and the US, granted a special dispensation for the American Jeffrey Edward Fowle, who was being indicted, to be released after his case had been dismissed,"" an emailed statement read. Former White House spokesman Jay Carney called the statement ""a fig leaf."" Kim needed to free Fowle ""to try to thaw relations a little bit, and he needs to pin it on the United States,"" said Carney, who is now a CNN commentator. The Obama administration, for which Carney was the spokesman, continues to ""press very hard"" for the release of Americans being held in North Korea, as previous administrations did, he said. North Korea accused Fowle of leaving a Bible at a club for foreign sailors and interpreted the act as a violation of law. Although the hermetic state contains some state-controlled churches, the totalitarian regime forbids independent religious activities, viewing them as potential threats to its authority. So Fowle, 56, languished in detention, one of three Americans imprisoned in the country. A U.S. government plane picked up Fowle in Pyongyang on Tuesday. ""He has been evaluated by a doctor and appears to be in good health,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. ""We're thrilled; we're overjoyed,"" said Jim Shihady, assistant pastor of Bethel Baptist Church, which the Fowle family attends in Miamisburg, speaking Tuesday to CNN affiliate WHIO. ""My phone's been ringing. The texts have been coming in, and people wanting to make sure we've heard the good news."" Two still detained . Matthew Miller and Kenneth Bae are still being held in North Korea. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said the United States has no updates on their status and called on North Korea to release them immediately. Bae, a Korean-American missionary, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in 2013. He told CNN he was working eight hours a day, six days a week, at a labor camp but was being treated ""as humanely as possible."" Miller, accused of tearing up his tourist visa and seeking asylum upon entry, was taken into custody in April of this year. He told CNN that his situation was ""very urgent"" and that he would soon be sent to trial and ""directly be sent to prison."" 'Admitted my guilt' Last month, Fowle spoke with CNN in a situation controlled by North Korea. He pleaded for U.S. help and described the conditions of his detention. In the interview, he said he had ""no complaints"" about his treatment. ""It's been very good so far, and I hope and pray that it continues, while I'm here two more days or two more decades,"" he said. North Korean officials monitored and recorded the interviews. CNN was unable to assess independently the conditions under which the men were being held. ""It's a covert act and a violation of tourists' rules,"" Fowle said of trying to leave the Bible. ""I've admitted my guilt to the government and signed a statement to that effect and requested forgiveness from the people and the government of the DPRK."" As a prisoner of the dictatorship, he could not speak freely. Fowle said at the time that he expected his trial to start within a month. City will hire him back . While Fowle was detained, Miamisburg terminated his employment as a municipal worker, providing a $70,000 severance package. Officials said he had exhausted his leave. But the city says it will hire him back. ""We wish Jeff well. We're excited to have him return,"" City Manager Dave Hicks told WHIO.

"While the world has been focused on eliminating Syria's chemical weapons, a vicious war within a war has gained momentum in northern Syria. It is a complex conflict that pits al Qaeda affiliates against more moderate rebel factions and against Syria's 2-million strong Kurdish minority. But it also threatens to spill far beyond Syria's borders. The largest Kurdish group -- the Democratic Union Party (PYD) -- raised the stakes last week by declaring the autonomous region of ""western Kurdistan"" in a part of Syria that normally produces about one-third of the country's oil. Other rebel factions condemned the move as a step toward a declaration of independence and the breakup of Syria. The opposition Syrian National Council said the PYD and its allies represented ""a separatist movement, disavowing any relationship between themselves and the Syrian people, who are struggling for a united nation independent and free from tyranny."" What happens in this region is of acute concern to the governments of Turkey and Iraq, and to the Kurds of northern Iraq, all of which have their own interests and allies there. For the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Kurdish success at the expense of the Free Syrian Army and Islamists is the least worst outcome, dividing the opposition and depriving its main adversaries of an operational hinterland. The government retains military outposts in places like Qamishli, the largest Kurdish city, in what appears to be a tacit understanding with the Kurds. Northern Syria has now become a patchwork of fiefdoms, with villages and border crossings changing hands and shifting alliances among opposition groups: yet another obstacle for the United States and other countries trying to kick-start a political process in Syria. The PYD is demanding its own place at the table in any peace negotiations as the Kurds' representative. A growing threat from ISIS . On the battlefield, the PYD has focused its firepower on the al Qaeda-affiliated Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), driving it out of several border villages and taking control of areas along the Syrian border with Iraq. Kurdish ""popular protection units"" now control the crossing into Iraq at Yarubiya, potentially giving the Kurds an opportunity to export oil and gain revenue. The crossing is on the main highway to Mosul and Baghdad. ISIS is far from down and out, however. It has vastly expanded its presence in northern Syria this year thanks to an influx of hundreds of foreign fighters. In October, ISIS seized the town of Azaz on the Syrian-Turkish border after heavy clashes with the Free Syrian Army's Northern Storm Brigade. It accused the brigade of being in league with Kurdish ""separatists"" and warned the Free Syrian Army ""not to be dragged into what is planned by them for the enemies who plot day and night, and seek by all means to pit these factions and the Islamic State against one another."" ISIS also seized the Bab al Hawa crossing on the Turkish border from an FSA brigade, giving it the ability to bring in weapons and other supplies. ISIS has gained a gruesome reputation for torturing and murdering prisoners taken during clashes with other rebel factions. A video posted by the Syrian Observatory on Saturday showed several FSA fighters who had been tortured and killed; the mediator sent to negotiate for their release was also reportedly murdered. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, writes that according to one former prisoner, the ISIS ""emir"" in Azaz is a 16-year-old who has personally taken part in the torture of captives. Recognizing the growing threat from ISIS, the Syrian National Council has accused it of ""aggression towards Syrian revolutionary forces and indifference to the lives of the Syrian people."" Islamist groups form alliance . Another al Qaeda affiliate, the al Nusra Front, is also involved in this mosaic of conflict. It has been trying to take control of areas north and east of Aleppo, Syria's largest city, attacking Kurdish villages in the process. But al Nusra and ISIS appear to loathe each other as much as they do the non-Islamist rebel groups. Landis, who runs the blog Syria Comment, says al Nusra and another Islamist group, Ahrar al-Sham, ""are working together more closely than ever both to counter ISIS and to take power from weaker factions of the Free Syria Army."" It's another sign that the Syrian opposition continues to fracture on the battlefield but also that al Nusra needs allies as it seeks to take on ISIS and the Kurds. Kurdish militias, in turn, have evicted al Nusra from several villages along the Turkish border in recent weeks. But human rights activists claim the Kurds have also targeted Arab villages. At a local level at least, ethnic cleansing appears to be redrawing the map of northern Syria. The PYD insists it does not want to see the breakup of Syria, nor ethnic conflict. But as in Iraq 10 years ago, the Kurds in Syria sense an opportunity to right old wrongs, and especially reverse the Arabization of Kurdish areas decreed by Bashar al Assad's father. In the 1970s, Hafez al Assad essentially rendered the Kurds stateless and encouraged Arabs to settle in areas bordering Turkey, such as Hasakah province. About 60,000 Kurds were displaced in the process. Writing in the current edition of the Combating Terrorism Center's Sentinel, Nicholas Heras says ""Hasakah presents a complex human terrain where conflict is driven by the patchwork authority of the Syrian military and local and long-standing communal antagonism. ... Hasakah's oil resources are also important and a source of frequent conflict between Arab and Kurdish armed groups. "" Heras sees an opportunity for the Kurdish militia in Hasakah province, if it protects minorities there. But it will, he writes, ""need to continue to demonstrate battlefield successes against its antagonists, primarily Sunni armed groups such as the Salafi-jihadi organizations and tribal militias."" Al Qaeda-linked group strengthens hold in northern Syria . Spillover into Turkey, northern Iraq . Turkey is already seeing fighting between the Kurds and other groups spill into its territory, with errant rocket fire killing several Turkish civilians over the past few months. Turkish forces have responded with howitzers, and Turkish authorities have begun building a border wall in several areas along the 820-kilometer (510-mile) border with Syria. Ankara doesn't want to see either al Qaeda or the Kurds prevail in northern Syria. Beset with its own Kurdish problem, it has no desire to see the PYD emerge as the dominant player. The PYD has long been an ally of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey, which has fought a guerrilla war against the Turkish state for nearly 30 years. There is now a fragile truce while negotiations on a political settlement stutter on, but should those negotiations fail, the PKK could use Syria's implosion to its advantage. Activists in northern Syria say hundreds of PKK fighters have already crossed the border. The Turkish government has tentatively reached out to the PYD, whose leader Saleh Muslim Mohammed visited Ankara in July. But in subsequent interviews, he has accused Turkey of helping other Kurdish groups against the PYD and allowing Islamist militants to cross from Turkey into Syria, accusations denied by Ankara. Muslim told Reuters this weekend that the Turks ""are trying to divide the Kurds by bringing certain (Kurdish) parties into the Syrian National Coalition."" The Kurds of northern Iraq have also been pulled into Syria's war, not least because the fighting has pushed tens of thousands of Syrian Kurds across the border. There were just under 200,000 Syrians registered in refugee camps in northern Iraq in late October, according to UNICEF, the great majority of them Kurds. The support of the Kurdish regional government for brethren over the border has brought a swift response from al Qaeda, which carried out two suicide bomb attacks in the Iraqi-Kurdish capital, Erbil, in September, killing several people. The Iraqi Kurdish leader, Masoud Barzani, responded by warning: ""We will not hesitate in directing strikes (against) the terrorist criminals in any place."" But at the same time, Barzani is wary of the PYD's ambitions and has been trying to unite other Kurdish groups as a counterweight against it. Barzani has invested heavily in a good working relationship with Turkey -- seeing it as a route for exporting oil from northern Iraq -- and has no desire to see the PYD provoke Ankara. After its declaration of autonomy, Barzani accused the PYD of being in league with al Assad and of wrecking a golden opportunity for Kurdish unity in Syria. He was in the Turkish city of Diyarbakir on Saturday to meet Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and back his negotiations with Turkey's Kurds. The Shia-dominated Iraqi government in Baghdad has other concerns, especially about al Qaeda's new freedom of action in Syria. The scale and frequency of al Qaeda attacks inside Iraq have increased, with the violence there now at its worst since 2007. ISIS now has a rear base in northern Syria from which to plan attacks in Iraq, and it may have the support or at least tolerance of several powerful Sunni tribes that straddle the border. Whatever happens around Damascus and in other theaters in Syria, the northeast threatens to become a vortex of conflict into which different Syrian groups, foreign fighters and outside powers are inexorably dragged.

"""The flirtation of young girls can often trigger violence."" That's the message from police in Baranya County, Hungary, as part of a campaign to raise awareness against rape. As if that wasn't enough, the message was paired with a video showing a young woman being approached by a hooded man outside a nightclub. The young woman is then shown lying on the ground. Several Hungarian advocacy groups are now voicing ""dismay"" with the regional police department's efforts, saying the campaign blames women, rather than characterizing them as potential victims who should be protected. ""(The video) scares and humiliates the victims and exonerates the perpetrators to go unpunished,"" the groups said in a joint statement. ""... These kind of films evoke misogyny and contempt for women."" The video, titled ""SelfieKlip,"" was released almost a week ago by authorities in Baranya County in southern Hungary. It features young adult actors, including dressed-up women who are out clubbing, partying and flirting with young men. The hooded attacker approaches one of the women, later depicted lying on the ground, near the end of the video. In a statement posted alongside the video, police say, ""Experience has shown that, in order to prevent such acts (of violence), how women communicate ... plays a huge role. The flirtation of young girls can often trigger violence."" The statement goes on to say that if a woman flirts with a man, then rejects him, ""this may create anger."" Police also urge women to ""radiate confidence with ... behavior."" ""Self-confidence is important,"" the statement adds, ""so it is important to believe in ourselves to avoid becoming a victim."" The combination of the video of partying young women and the statement outraged a coalition of Hungarian women's rights groups, which claims it ""completely ignores that sexual violence"" happens because of a decision by the attacker, not the victim. ""The mission of the police is to protect and serve the public, rather than blaming the victims, or potential victims, or to pass on the responsibility on them,"" the groups said.","Police in southern Hungary put out a video, statement to raise rape awareness .

"(CNN) -- A Pennsylvania man who walked into a gym aerobics class and opened fire, killing three women and wounding nine before turning the gun on himself, ""had a lot of hatred in him,"" police said Wednesday. Pregnant aerobics instructor Mary Primis was teaching class when the gunman opened fire, critically injuring her. George Sodini, 48, brought four handguns into the LA Fitness gym outside Pittsburgh and used three of them, firing at least 36 times around 8 p.m. Tuesday, Allegheny County Police Superintendent Charles Moffatt said. Sodini, a member of the gym, was found dead in the aerobics room, lying on top of one of his guns about seven feet from one of the victims. Authorities believe Sodini targeted the aerobics class, because a schedule was found in his home with that class circled, Moffatt said. But police do not believe he targeted anyone personally. An online diary, as well as notes at the scene and at his home, have led them to believe he was targeting women in general. Read an edited version of the diary (PDF) In the note found at the scene in Sodini's gym bag, he complains he had never spent a weekend with a woman, never vacationed with a woman and never lived with a woman, and that he had had limited sexual experiences, Moffatt said. He makes similar complaints in his online blog, which also documents his growing rage at women for rejecting him and at the world he felt had abandoned him. Witnesses told police the gunman was dressed in black when he entered the class, shut off the lights, walked about 10 feet and opened fire. Mary Primis, 26, an aerobics instructor who is 10 weeks pregnant, was shot twice. ""I remember thinking I wanted to hold my breath because I was afraid, if he saw that I was breathing, he would shoot again,"" she told CNN affiliate WPXI from her hospital bed. Asked if she thought she was going to die, she said, ""I wasn't sure."" Her husband, Alex Primis, said she was shot once in the left shoulder and again through the back of her shoulder blade. This was to be her last week teaching before taking time off for her pregnancy, Primis said. Sodini apparently had ""practice runs"" before the shooting Tuesday, Moffatt said. Someone at the gym had showed him how to shut off the lights, he said, not knowing his plans. ""He just had a lot of hatred in him, and he was hell bent on committing this act,"" Moffatt said.  Watch Moffatt describe contents of diary » . Sodini worked as a systems analyst in the finance department of K&L Gates, a law firm with an office in Pittsburgh, since 1999, Mike Rick, a spokesman for the firm, said. Neighbors described him as reclusive and said he had stopped talking to them in the past few years. On Tuesday, Sodini visited the gym three times -- the first about 11 a.m., a second time at 7:40 p.m. and a third time at 7:56 p.m., Moffatt said. Members of the gym are required to swipe a card to check in, but do not have to check out, he said. The first 911 call was dispatched at 8:16 p.m. Three of the four guns found with Sodini were traced back to him, and authorities are in the process of tracing the fourth, Moffatt said. They were two 9 mm semi-automatics, a .45-caliber revolver and a .38 in his pocket. Sodini also had 30-round ammunition clips that were illegal before the assault weapons ban was lifted in 2004, police said. Police know Sodini made a telephone call at 7:45 p.m., and believe he may have left the gym to make it. Authorities are attempting to locate the person he contacted, Moffatt said. Sodini did not mention killing himself in the note found at the scene, which was mostly typed with handwritten notations, but did mention it in a handwritten note found at his home, Moffatt said. Police seized Sodini's car for processing, but no guns were found in it, he said. They also seized his computer and were examining it. The shooting victims were taken to the three major hospitals in the area. Moffatt said he believed none of those who remained hospitalized Wednesday had life-threatening injuries. County officials said counselors were being made available to area residents in the wake of the shooting. Police spoke to a pastor mentioned on Sodini's online diary. The man said Sodini attended his church but stopped in 2006, and that there was a minor incident involving a woman who felt ""he was paying too much attention to her,"" Moffatt said. The pastor spoke to Sodini, and it stopped, he said. Moffatt said police have no knowledge of any mental health issues involving Sodini, but are still puzzled at the violence. ""I can't ever make sense of murders,"" he said. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","NEW: Police find gym schedule with class circled in gunman's home .

"A woman blamed for a security scare aboard a U.S.-bound jetliner will be sent back to France and won't face criminal charges, federal prosecutors in Maine said Wednesday. Lucie Zeeko Merigot is being turned over to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency after a court appearance Wednesday in Bangor, U.S. Attorney Thomas Delahanty announced. The 41-year-old Frenchwoman had been booked into the Penobscot County jail for interfering with a flight crew late Tuesday, about 12 hours after US Airways Flight 787 was diverted to Bangor, but Delahanty said prosecutors decided against charges after the FBI questioned crew members and flight attendants into Wednesday morning. Federal officials said the flight from Paris to Charlotte, North Carolina, was diverted as a precaution after Merigot claimed to have a surgically implanted device inside her. In a written statement, Delahanty said Merigot's note, in French, said she was ""simply a victim of a group of doctors"" and that she had ""an object in her body that is out of my control."" She told a flight attendant that she did not know whether the object could hurt her or others, but doctors who examined her found no sign of recent surgical scars. Mystery object in the air investigated after pilot report .

"(CNN) -- In this high-stakes election, Americans are making use of every available opportunity to get the word out about the candidates and issues. For some, that means making Halloween political. Oliver Smith and Matt Fett created these impressive pumpkin portraits of Barack Obama and Sarah Palin. Many of these people shared their Halloween politicking on iReport.com. A few of them, like Mark Weyermuller of Wilmette, Illinois, have gone all-out, turning their yards into full-on political displays. Weyermuller's features life-size figures of Barack Obama, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, and Sarah Palin, and he says he's waiting for his Joe Biden mask to arrive in the mail. He also has a sign up -- held by a witch, appropriately -- that reads ""Witch do you like for vice-president?"" ""We do this every year with current event figures,"" said Weyermuller, adding that ""The political characters tend to scare the neighbors and the kids more then most traditional ghosts and goblins."" Weyermuller even added a figure of Joe the plumber to the lawn after the final presidential debate. ""He is now the star of the election, Halloween and this front yard,"" he said. iReport.com: A political yard for Halloween . Melissa Cruson's family builds a giant spider web in their Colleyville, Texas, yard each year for Halloween. But this year, they decided to give it a political twist at her daughter's suggestion. ""While buying the supplies that we needed for the web, my daughter, who is in the sixth grade, mentioned that 'this year we should put Obama and Hillary in the web!' We thought it was a great idea and went with it,"" she said. So this year, in addition to the traditional giant spiders, the Cruson family's web features a smiling John McCain sitting in front of the web, where Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are trapped. ""The comical part of this [is that] my husband and I are just about as nonpolitical as you can get,"" Cruson said. ""Yet it appears that we have made a pretty loud political statement this year with this display and the attention it has received. But we do know that this is a very critical election for our country."" Cruson said her family continuously receives visitors who want to pose for photos with the political web. Staffers at the local Republican headquarters even heard about the display and ""went crazy over it."" iReport.com: Caught in a political web . Perhaps the most elaborate political Halloween display we've seen on iReport.com can only be seen from the air. Baggenstos Farms in Sherwood, Oregon, created a corn maze with the theme ""Election 2008."" The maze features likenesses of McCain and Obama along with the candidates' names and the word ""vote."" Greg Hughes, who is studying to become a pilot, was on a training flight near Portland, Oregon, when he spotted the display. He grabbed his video camera to capture the maze as his instructor flew the plane. ""Now that's a yard sign!"" said one of the commenters on Hughes' iReport. iReport.com: A political crop circle? Other iReporters are displaying their candidate of choice on Halloween in simpler ways. Political pumpkins displaying the candidates' names, likenesses, and slogans are becoming popular with Democrats and Republicans in the days before the election.

"Very few confidants and former aides were frenzied when Hillary Clinton came under fire for questions about her age, health and wealth. Their view, for the most part, was Clinton is obviously healthy - look at the schedule she keeps - and wealth won't be a problem because they can be countered by her proposed policies and actions to help the middle class and poor. ""They (Republicans) are just throwing stuff against the wall to see what will stick,"" said a Clinton friend and former aide. ""This will not stick. This is not the way to attack her."" However, some Clinton associates -- all of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly --  have quietly expressed concern that one of the most effective critiques could be that her presidency, should she run and be elected, would be nothing more than President Barack Obama's third term. The Clinton friend and former aide told CNN last week that the best way to go after Clinton is to use this against her: ""If you like Obama, you will love Hillary."" ""She was in his government, she was at his side,"" said the source. ""That is, the way to go after her is four more years of the same old thing. The question they should ask her is 'Tell me 10 things that you disagree with him on.'"" Others in Clinton's current and former orbit see the ""third-term Obama"" question as a possible issue. But they were quick to note that Republicans have more pressing problems. ""It is a valid question,"" said a longtime Clinton aide. ""But the other side of the aisle has got plenty of their own problems. They may have a deep bench, but they certainly have no starter."" Another longtime Democrat who worked for former Vice President Al Gore in 2000 said Republicans will no doubt try to tack any Democratic nominee to Obama, if they see it could work for them. Gore, Bill Clinton's No. 2 for eight years, struggled to overcome ""Clinton fatigue"" in his 2000 presidential campaign that fell just short. Republicans are, in fact, already trying to bind Clinton to Obama. Most recently, Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice presidential nominee in 2012, said  Clinton ""will be very formidable"" but ""beatable."" ""I think she is beatable because the record is not very good,"" Ryan said in an interview with USA Today. ""I don't think people are going to want to have an Obama third term and no matter how she tries to shake that label, she won't be able to."" While those questions aren't getting as much attention as those aimed at Clinton's wealth and speaking fees, Ryan is not the first Republican to already go after her this way. In June, shortly after Clinton's memoir ""Hard Choices"" hit bookshelves, the Republican National Committee released a video casting the Obama presidency as a ""team effort"" that included Clinton as America's top diplomat for four years. The Web ad flashes a simple message: ""Hillary, Obama's Third Term."" Their goal is simple: Republicans want voters to think Obama and a third term, not the third term of Bill Clinton, who left office scandal-plagued but is more popular now. He would become first spouse if his wife were elected in 2016. Highlighting the candidate following a flawed incumbent is a well-worn path. Again, think back to Gore and then, more recently, to Sen. John McCain, who was the Republican nominee after George W. Bush, a wartime president who left the job deeply unpopular. The last time a single party controlled the White House for more than eight consecutive years -- and the only time in the past 60 years -- was from 1981-93 when Ronald Reagan served two terms and his vice president, George H.W. Bush, succeeded him for one. Bush rode Reagan's coattails to victory, pushing an agenda of four more years. Clinton would not have that luxury, if she ran. While Obama remains popular with the Democratic base, his overall approval rating has hovered in the low 40s for the past few months. Does that matter? Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and Gore's 2000 campaign manager, said whether or not Clinton needs to break with Obama ""all depends on the political climate and environment in mid 2015 to 2016."" ""In 2000, I had to answer this question,"" she said. ""And the answer is always the same. Each year is different and every candidate must make his or her case to the voter of why they represent some else."" Clinton tried to create some distance between herself and Obama earlier this month on foreign policy during an interview with The Atlantic. ""Great nations need organizing principles, and 'Don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle,"" Clinton told The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg, knocking Obama's mantra on avoiding overseas pitfalls. The split and the subsequent beltway kerfuffle shows how difficult it is for one party to hold the White House for more than eight years. What's more, any future split between Clinton and Obama fits nicely into the storyline from their contentious 2008 primary race, making it an easy story for media to seize on. Not all Clinton defenders agree with the idea that Ryan's attack line is effective, especially those at Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton communication and rapid response group. ""As a leading voice in the Republican 'do nothing' Congress, Paul Ryan is the last person who should be dishing out political advice,"" said Adrienne Elrod, the group's spokeswoman. ""Hillary Clinton is one of the most admired and trusted public figures in America and should she run for President, she will run on her own record and implement her own vision for moving our country forward.""","Some former Hillary Clinton aides are concerned tying her to Barack Obama will be effective .
""That is the way to go after her is four more years of the same old thing,"" said one friend .
Others say ""It is a valid question,"" but that Republicans have bigger problems than Clinton .
The last time a party controlled the White House for more than eight years was 1989-93 ."
"Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made clear what he meant when he said Israel should be ""wiped off"" the map and touched on everything from the Holocaust to homosexuality in a wide-ranging interview that aired Monday on CNN's ""Piers Morgan Tonight."" The president, speaking through a translator, also said what his country would do if attacked by Israel, and he slammed an anti-Islam film that has triggered protests in the Muslim world. ""If a group comes and occupies the United States of America, destroys homes while women and children are in those homes, incarcerate the youth of America, impose five different wars on many neighbors, and always threaten others, what would you do?  What would you say? Would you help it? ... Or would you help the people of the United States?"" Ahmadinejad asked in response to whether Israel should be ""wiped off"" the face of the map, as he once said. Obama confronts Iran, Syria at U.N. ""So when we say 'to be wiped,' we say for occupation to be wiped off from this world. For war-seeking to (be) wiped off and eradicated, the killing of women and children to be eradicated. And we propose the way. We propose the path. The path is to recognize the right of the Palestinians to self-governance."" When asked whether he believes in a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Ahmadinejad declined to comment. ""I cannot express an opinion. That is their prerogative,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""But the people of Palestine must be allowed by everyone, and helped by everyone, to allow them, to give them the right to choose for themselves."" In New York this week to visit the United Nations, Ahmadinejad spoke at a meeting on the rule of law Monday and is scheduled to address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon met with the Iranian president over the weekend and warned him of the ""potentially harmful consequences of inflammatory rhetoric,"" according to a U.N. statement. During his speech Monday, Ahmadinejad accused ""some members of the Security Council with veto rights"" of having ""chosen silence with regard to the nuclear warheads of a fake regime, while at the same time they impede scientific progress of other nations."" Though he didn't name the countries, he was clearly talking about the United States, Israel and his own country. Some world powers, particularly Western nations, suspect that Iran is seeking to build nuclear weapons. Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. When asked by CNN's Morgan what Iran would do if Israel were to attack it, Ahmadinejad said, ""Any nation has the right and will indeed defend herself."" ""But my question is this: Why should the world be managed in such a way that an individual can allow himself to threaten a rich and deeply rooted historical, ancient country such as Iran? A great country, such as Iran, based on an excuse of his own fabrication. ... Another country can say, 'I am guessing that country B is doing activity X, therefore I will attack that country' ... can this be ... a successful formula for the management of the world?"" Again there, the president was likely referring to Iran's disputed nuclear program. Asked whether he feared a war or military conflict with Israel was imminent, Ahmadinejad said: ""The Zionists are very much, very adventuresome, very much seeking to fabricate things, and I think they see themselves at the end of the line and I do firmly believe that they seek to create new opportunities for themselves and their adventurous behaviors."" Among other topics the president touched on in the interview taped in New York over the weekend were: . Anti-Islam film . Ahmadinejad denounced the film, ""Innocence of Muslims,"" that portrays the Prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer. The online video has led to a wave of global unrest. ""Fundamentally, first of all, any action that is provocative, offends the religious thoughts and feelings of any people, we condemn,"" he said. Photos:  Anti-U.S. demonstrations worldwide . ""Likewise, we condemn any type of extremism. Of course, what took place was ugly. Offending the Holy Prophet is quite ugly. This has very little or nothing to do with freedom and freedom of speech. This is the weakness of and the abuse of freedom, and in many places it is a crime. It shouldn't take place, and I do hope the day will come in which politicians will not seek to offend those whom others hold holy,"" Ahmadinejad said. ""We also believe that this must also be resolved in a humane atmosphere, in a participatory environment, and we do not like anyone losing their lives or being killed for any reason, anywhere in the world."" The privately produced film sparked protests against the United States, where it was made. While most of the demonstrations have been peaceful, some were marred by violence that has left more than two dozen people dead -- among them U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans killed in an attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that reportedly followed a demonstration against the film. When asked by Morgan whether he thought protesters should stop threatening U.S. staff abroad, Ahmadinejad said he cannot say what other people or nations should do, but that he believes ""extremism gives birth to following and subsequent extremists."" Syria . A long-time supporter of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, Ahmadinejad told CNN's Morgan the crisis in Syria must be resolved through dialogue, and without outside interference. He condemned the violence, which has left more than 26,000 people dead since March 2011, according to opposition activists. ""We must all say enough of this violence, right now,"" Ahmadinejad said, adding that he is working to organize a group to bring the two sides together. ""We do believe that freedom, the right to choose, the right to vote, respect and justice is the fundamental right of all people. All people must obtain these rights. No one has the right to restrict a people and nation, but we believe as a friend of nations, we must help the nations around the world to obtain these rights through peaceful paths, though peaceful actions."" The Holocaust . The conversation was contentious at times, particularly when the topic turned to the Nazi Germany extermination of the Jews last century. Ahmadinejad has long questioned the existence of the Holocaust. ""I pass no judgment about historic events. I defend the human freedoms. Whatever event has taken place throughout history, or hasn't taken place, I cannot judge that. Why should I judge that? I say researchers and scholars must be free to conduct research and analysis about any historical event,"" the Iranian president said. Homosexuality . ""I'm sorry. Let me ask you this. Do you believe that anyone is giving birth through homosexuality? Homosexuality ceases procreation. Who has said that if you like or believe in doing something ugly, and others do not accept your behavior, that they're denying your freedom?"" he asked Morgan. ""Proper education must be given ... the education system must be revamped.  The political system must be revamped. And these must be also reformed, revamped along the way. But if you, if a group recognizes an ugly behavior or ugly deed as legitimate, you must not expect other countries or other groups to give it the same recognition."" Jews . When asked how he would feel if one of his children dated a Jew, Ahmadinejad replied, ""I would have to see who that Jewish man or woman would be. I see love amongst people as completely acceptable. There are many Jews living in Iran with whom we are very close. There are ... some Muslims that marry into Jewish families or marry Christians."" ""I -- we have no such problems,"" he added. ""Of course, I think none of us should represent the whole population of the United States, but we believe that color, religion, native tongue, ethnic background shouldn't create differences or distances between people, nor should it be the sole reason to bring people closer together. It has always been like this."" Osama bin Laden . Ahmadinejad also discussed his reaction to Osama bin Laden's death last year by American Navy Seals under President Barack Obama. ""I would have been happier to see a transparent trial, a formal trial, and find out the root causes of all of the events of the last few years,"" the Iranian president said.

"A stunning catalog of torture and the widespread abuse of even the weakest of North Koreans reveal a portrait of a brutal state ""that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world,"" a United Nations panel reported Monday. North Korean leaders employ murder, torture, slavery, sexual violence, mass starvation and other abuses as tools to prop up the state and terrorize ""the population into submission,"" the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights (COI) in North Korea said in its report . The commission said it would refer its findings to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for possible prosecution. It also sent a letter warning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he could face prosecution for crimes against humanity, and said other options include establishing of an ad hoc tribunal by the United Nations. Even before the report's release, China, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and staunch ally of North Korea, has said it would not to allow human rights charges to proceed to the ICC. The almost yearlong investigation traced the abuses directly to the highest levels of the North Korean government while simultaneously blaming world leaders for sitting on their hands amid untold agony. The U.N. panel released its 400-page report after hearing from more than 320 witnesses in public hearings and private interviews. North Korea is a state, it concluded, ""that does not content itself with ensuring the authoritarian rule of a small group of people, but seeks to dominate every aspect of its citizens' lives and terrorizes them from within."" ""The suffering and tears of the people of North Korea demand action,"" commission Chairman Michael Kirby told reporters. The government of North Korea -- also known as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or DPRK -- rejected the report as a ginned-up effort to undermine its government. ""It is nothing more than an instrument of political plot aimed at sabotaging the socialist system by defaming the dignified images of the DPRK and creating an atmosphere of international pressure under the pretext of 'human rights protection,'"" the government said in a prepared statement. North Korea did not respond to requests for access to the country and information about its human rights practices, according to the commission. China had previously stated it would not approve human rights charges on North Korea to go to the International Criminal Court. On Monday, prior to the report's release, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said, ""Submitting human rights issues to the International Court of Justice won't help improve a country's human rights condition."" She maintained that China advocates ""constructive dialogue and cooperation to resolve differences on human rights issues."" The commission of inquiry sought access to parts of China that border North Korea during the 11-month investigation, but was denied. The commission also requested a visit to Beijing to meet relevant officials and experts on North Korea issues -- a request that was also denied by China with the reasoning that based on its ""position on country-specific mandates, especially on the Korean peninsula, it would not be possible to extend an invitation to the Commission,"" according to the report. In the report, the commission recommended that China abstain from forcibly repatriating North Koreans who've escaped their country, due to the punishment they face once they are returned. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department expressed support for the UN report and urged North Korea ""to take concrete steps -- as recommended by the [Commission of Inquiry] -- to improve the human rights situation for the North Korean people."" ""We look forward to thoroughly reviewing the report and discussing its recommendations with our partners, who share our deep concern about the human rights situation in North Korea."" The group Human Rights Watch released a statement saying that ""the devastating findings of this inquiry should not be ignored."" ""Since the crimes were perpetrated by state actors, only an international tribunal can properly carry out criminal investigations aimed at holding perpetrators accountable,"" said Kenneth Roth, executive director at Human Rights Watch. During the compilation of the report one witness, a survivor of a North Korean prison camp, told the commission of seeing a guard beat a nearly starving woman who had recently given birth, then force the woman to drown her baby. Others told of being imprisoned for watching soap operas, trying to find food for their families, traveling without permission or having family members considered suspect by the government. ""Because we saw so many people die, we became so used to it,"" one prison camp survivor told the commission. ""I'm sorry to say that we became so used to it that we didn't feel anything."" Kirby that he hoped the report would galvanize the world to act. ""We cannot say we didn't know,"" he said. ""We now do know.""","U.N. report warns North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that he could be prosecuted .

"(CNN) -- The ouster of Tunisia's longtime ruler has cast a shadow over the surrounding region, but few analysts were willing to predict Tuesday that the revolt would spread to other countries. Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was Tunisia's president for 23 years before Friday, when weeks of protests forced him into exile in Saudi Arabia. Tunisians complained that the president's family and supporters had grown rich while their living conditions stagnated and their voices were stifled. But while the governments of nearby nations like Algeria, Libya and Egypt face similar criticism, the level of repression and the concentration of power and corruption were far more extreme in Tunisia, said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. ""I think most regimes in the region are viewed with a mix of disdain and resignation by their population,"" Brown said. Few may support their government, but ""It's not as if there's much that can be done about it,"" he said. Neighboring Algeria was also wracked by rioting last week, triggered by the spiraling costs of basic food items after its government slashed price supports for staples like milk, oil and sugar. State-run media reported at least three people had died in the clashes. Libya's longtime strongman, Moammar Gadhafi, mourned Ben Ali's ouster and warned in a nationally televised speech that Tunisia was facing ""unjustified chaos."" And in Egypt, at least two people have set themselves afire in public this week -- the same type of protest that triggered Tunisia's demonstrations in December. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, one of the top U.S. allies in the region, has ruled his country since 1981. Tuesday, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry tried to tamp down speculation that his government faced anything like the uprising that forced Ben Ali from power. ""What happened in Tunisia cannot easily be repeated in any other country,"" Housam Zaki, a foreign ministry spokesman, said Tuesday. ""Every nation has its specific circumstances and every nation has its political, economic and social situation. It is very hard to compare between the situation which existed in Tunisia and led to the latest reaction by the people there (to) any other country, Arab or not."" And though other North African states are dominated by authoritarian governments and plagued by poverty and corruption, a Tunisia-style uprising ""would play out much differently"" elsewhere, Brown said. The well-entrenched police state established under Ben Ali left Tunisia with few alternatives to his ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally, he said. ""In other countries, there are much more well-organized political forces that would step in,"" he said. But John Entellis, an analyst at Fordham University in New York, warned that discontent is ""bubbling over continuously"" in the region. The United States, meanwhile, counts many of those governments as partners in its battle against al Qaeda and its allies. ""It's not in our interest to try to keep this lid down artificially, because ultimately the explosion will be even worse later on than it would be in the short term,"" Entellis said. Leaked U.S. diplomatic cables released since November by the website WikiLeaks painted a scathing view of Tunisia's now-ousted leader and his associates. One described Ben Ali's extended family as a ""quasi-mafia"" that pushed for a taste of any venture they saw. Their assessments of some other countries in the region are less critical, but still jaundiced. Algeria's government ""is fragile in ways it has not been before, plagued by a lack of vision, unprecedented levels of corruption and rumblings of division within the military rank and file,"" a December 2007 cable from the U.S. Embassy in Algiers states. The country's weak economy ""has Algerians, especially youth, feeling gloomy and grim about the fate of their country as it drifts into the new year."" ""We do not sense an explosion coming right away. Instead, we see a government drifting and groping for a way forward,"" the cable states. In Libya, meanwhile, Gadhafi -- a military officer who seized power in 1969 -- has promised sweeping economic and political reforms since 2006. But international observers say that push has stalled despite the elevation of his son, Saif al-Islam -- once a leading reform advocate -- to a top position in the government, and the Gadhafi family has ""strong interests"" in Libya's oil and gas sector and numerous other interests in the country, according to a 2006 cable disclosed by WikiLeaks. But unlike Ben Ali's family, the Gadhafis avoid extravagant displays of wealth at home, the U.S. cable described. ""Compared to egregious pillaging of state coffers elsewhere in Africa, or the lavish spending of Gulf Arabs, the Libyans don't see much to complain about in their leader's lifestyle, as long as he does a good job of making sure other people get a piece of the pie,"" the cable states. ""And when Libyans do complain, they are removed from access to financial rewards."" Brown said the events in Tunisia are unlikely to yield a rerun of 1989, when Communist regimes across Eastern Europe imploded before a string of popular uprisings. ""I would say we're dealing with 1975,"" he said. ""We've got kind of tired regimes that have just lost their ideological sense of direction, they've lost popular support -- but they're just there, and they don't look like they're going anywhere.""","Governments of nearby nations face similar criticism .

"(CNN)""This used to be a land of bandits, wolves and bears,"" says Daniele Kihlgren, surveying the countryside around ancient houses of Santo Stefano di Sessanio. High above the barren Gran Sasso hills in Italy's central Abruzzo region, this tiny hamlet, barely changed since medieval times, was in danger of reverting to its wild past until Kihlgren showed up with a vision. ""When I first got here on my motorbike, I was wandering, totally lost. This unspoilt place, with no traces of modernity, struck me like Saint Paul on the road to Damascus,"" he says. Kihlgren, an Italian-Swedish businessman, has since made it his life's mission to rescue such crumbling villages by turning them into high-end resorts that blend in with their surroundings. Sextantio (Via Principe Umberto, Santo Stefano di Sessanio; +39 0862 899112) in Santo Stefano is one of several so-called ""diffuse hotels"" that eschew the usual hotel model of grouping rooms and facilities under one roof. Instead, Sextantio's 29 rooms, spa, wine bar, restaurant and reception lie scattered in separate buildings formerly used as barns, stables, pigsties, wine cellars and farmers' or shepherds' lodgings. Wood and stone cottages have been restyled as suites, the village dungeons serve as a wedding room and a former witch's lair now hosts business meetings. The hotel even makes use of a medieval brothel. Santo Stefano di Sessanio is a maze of cobbled streets, steep stone stairs, arches, vaults, gargoyles, hidden grottoes, frescoed loggias and crumbling walls covered in ivy. There are also ruins -- the remains of the houses collapsed during the 2009 earthquake that rocked nearby L'Aquila. Slaughtered pig . Kihlgren gives me the grand tour, describing his early days trying to acquire property in the hamlet -- leading to surreal situations for both him and the villagers. ""When I knocked at people's doors offering to buy their dwellings, they thought I was crazy,"" he says. ""Once a local slaughtered a pig right in front of my eyes with Bach playing in the background."" Today the village may be marginally less rustic, but Sextantio's charm lies in its sympathetic use of historic structures. At the reception, housed in a former donkey stable at the hamlet's entrance where nativity scenes are staged at Christmas, the concierge hands me the biggest and heaviest room key I've ever encountered: 30 centimeters of pure iron. ""That way you'll never lose it,"" she says. A path leads to my room -- La Bianca -- one of the closest cottages to the reception (the farthest one lies 200 meters away). I open the squeaky bolt of a heavy wooden door and enter a snug, warm room filled with the scent of embers and orange peel -- a perfume created by the hotel to evoke a typical hearth scent. Old furniture, including a spinning wheel and museum pieces, are juxtaposed with modern sculptures and sleek, luxurious bathroom facilities. Showering in the elegant white resin tub is an experience. Rinsing involves using a pitcher to collect running water from a low tap, a throwback to the past. There's no television, phone or minibar, but it's not totally offline. There's a powerful Wi-Fi signal throughout the buildings. Bird's nest . Lying back on my wrought iron king size bed, I spot an old bird's nest among the wood ceiling beams. ""This is what I call 'authentic' Italy,"" says Kihlgren. ""I wanted to restyle the buildings as we found them and bring back to life the so-called secondary human heritage: that of poor, outcast communities who for centuries stood as Italy's shame. ""That's why I kept the cracks in the walls and the fireplace hearth soot: these are layers of history. ""Sextantio is the opposite of colonialist tourism. Clients here want to discover the village identity and mingle with locals."" Outside, in the center of the hamlet, silence rules. No cars are allowed. Just 50 residents still live here and, walking around, I come across elderly women sitting on doorsteps and art restorers at work. Occasionally a passerby looks at me shyly, but greets me with a hello. ""Even when the hotel is fully booked you'll feel on your own,"" says Annunziata Taraschi, who has an unusual job as Sextantio's anthropologist, collecting the village's oral tradition and lost customs. While that might be great for guests, locals aren't so sure. ""It's one thing coming here as a visitor, and another living here"" says Dina Rusciolelli, owner of La Bettola di Geppetto, the village tavern. ""After a while you can go nuts."" There are no complaints about the food though -- a mix of gourmet and traditional. Sitting at the scarred wooden tables of the Cantinone, a large dining room 50 meters from reception, Franco Cannioli serves me pan bagnato -- a dish of bread and vegetables -- with cured meats, lentil soup, pecorino cheese, pears and nuts. Bloodsucking witches . There's a glass of Montepulciano di Abruzzo red wine on the table. Evening meals are taken in La Locanda Sotto gli Archi, the hotel's grotto restaurant located on the other side of the hamlet where chef Simone Iezzi serves a daily changing menu that includes signature dishes like ricotta cheese ravioli, pork chops and fried breaded porcini mushrooms. After an afternoon nap, I'm greeted in the hotel's tea room and craft shop by Giovanna Fiorenzi, who sits at an old spinning frame making wool carpets, bed covers and giving weaving lessons to guests. She also spins a few old tales, telling me about spirits haunting the woods and witches who suck the blood of crying babies. She serves licorice and artichoke herbal tea alongside traditional Ferratelle waffles. She also makes Genziana, a sweet and sour alcoholic drink made from Gentian roots. There's a crystal bottle of Genziana and a crackling fire waiting for me when I get back to my room in evening. The next morning I'm woken by birdsong and light filtering through small, wooden-framed windows. Breakfast is a buffet table laden with homemade yogurt, pies, ricotta cheese and a ham leg over in the restaurant. It's fine to wander over there before getting ready for the day to savor one of the great treats of these hamlet hotels.

"How many ways can political reporters, pundits and book reviewers write that Hillary Clinton's memoir ""Hard Choices"" is devoid of salacious details or titillatingly news? Many, apparently. John Dickerson, Slate's chief political correspondent, wrote that it was ""risk-free telling of Clinton's world travels"" and Ana Navarro, a CNN Republican pundit, described it as ""50 shades of boring."" The New York Times book review was even more stark: ""There is little news in the book."" Clinton's book is a thorough retelling of her time as America's top diplomat, not a salacious tell-all written by somebody who is done with a life in the public sphere. In a methodical way, Clinton chronicles her time as secretary of state by jumping from hot spot to hot spot, describing each detailed problem as, quite expectedly, a ""hard choice."" One of the most telling aspects of the book, however, is what's not in it. Here are the five things that are noticeably absent -- or not discussed in detail -- within the 656 pages of Clinton's ""Hard Choices."" Hillary Clinton by the numbers . 1. Gossip: Former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates used his tell-all memoir ""Duty"" earlier this year to blast many of his former colleagues. He wrote that Vice President Joe Biden ""has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades"" and described President Barack Obama's administration as distrustful and suspicious of military leaders. The book was a way for the oft-subdued Gates to settle a few scores with Washington as he left to take over the Boy Scouts of America. Clinton's book is not at all like that. It is careful, measured and thoroughly devoid of backbiting. Sure, Clinton describes Russian President Vladimir Putin as a ""thin-skinned and autocratic"" and former Chinese President Hu Jintao as an ""aloof chairman of the board,"" but most of the time Clinton describes people in more diplomatic, less derisive terms. Putin on Clinton: 'It's better not to argue with women' Instead of a tell-all, Clinton's book serves as a tome to diplomacy. She sums this up in her chapter on Iran in which she writes, ""Engagement and pressure. Carrots and sticks. This is the nature of diplomacy."" And she sums up the lack of gossip in the book's ""Author's Note,"" which was released weeks before the book came out. ""While my views and experiences will surely be scrutinized by followers of Washington's long-running soap opera -- who took what side, who opposed whom, who was up and who was down -- I didn't write the book for them."" 2. Keystone XL pipeline: Zero. That's the number of times Clinton writes about the controversial pipeline, a 1,179-mile-long project that would move oil from Canada to refineries in the United States. The pipeline has been a hot button issue since it was first proposed in 2008 and more recently as Obama and current Secretary of State John Kerry mull whether to approve the project. Effort to approve Keystone collapses in the Senate . Republicans have seized on the issue and have hammered Democrats for not approving what they argue is a way to stimulate jobs. Environmental groups contend that the pipeline would be harmful for the environment and just deepen the United States' dependence on fossil fuels. Though Clinton devotes a chapter of her book to energy and jobs and another to climate change, the pipeline goes unmentioned in both. Clinton writes in a chapter titled ""Climate Change: We're All In This Together"" that ""America's ability to lead in this setting hinges on what we ourselves are willing to do at home"" ""The problems posed by global warming were evident, despite the deniers,"" Clinton notes. ""There was a mountain of overwhelming scientific data about the damaging effects of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases."" Clinton has been hesitant to talk about Keystone since she left State. At a March event in Vancouver, Clinton declined to comment on the ongoing debate over the pipeline because she said it would be unfair to Kerry, who is currently handling the Keystone question. ""She said it just wouldn't be appropriate to comment. She choose her words really carefully,"" said Iain Black, the organizer who introduced Clinton at the closed-to-the-press event. Clinton's State Department was tasked with overeeing whether to approve the pipeline and in a 2010 speech to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, Clinton said she was ""inclined"" to approve it, according to the Washington Post. 3. NSA and Edward Snowden: Clinton gets into very little depth when it comes to Edward Snowden, the former contractor at the National Security Agency who obtained and helped publish troves of documents that have shed light and raised questions about U.S. surveillance practices. Snowden and the NSA have been one of the biggest national security issues over the last  year, but in her memoir, Clinton devotes only a few pages to the debate and mentions Snowden only three times. ""His leaks revealed some of America's most sensitive classified intelligence programs,"" Clinton writes before discussing what Snowden revealed and some of the questions he raised. After a few paragraphs, though, Clinton finds herself somewhere between liberty and security and without answering a number of those questions on domestic surveillance. ""With liberty and security, it's not that the more you have of one, the less you have of the other. In fact I believe they make each other possible,"" Clinton concludes. ""Without security, liberty is fragile. Without liberty, security is oppressive. The challenge is finding the proper measure: enough security to safeguard our freedoms, but not so much (or so little) as to endanger them."" A year after Snowden, the real costs of NSA surveillance . 4. Boko Haram: In the weeks before the book's release, the Clinton State Department's failure to designate the tribal group that captured more than 200 schoolgirls in April as a terrorist organization was big news. On Clinton's watch, the State Department -- at the urging of a number of experts on Nigeria and Boko Haram -- decided not to list the group as a foreign terrorist organization, but Kerry, her successor, designated the group as a terrorist organization in November 2013. Republicans seized on Clinton's decision, especially after a Daily Beast article raised the issue. But Clinton only mentions Nigeria once and never mentions Boko Haram. She notes, in a short story about Nigeria, that ""corruption was the major impediment to growth in most of Africa,"" including Nigeria, but doesn't mention the terrorism that has ravaged the oil-rich nation's eastern territories. The omission is noteworthy because Clinton has made extensive comments about Boko Haram since May. How national Republicans plan to talk about Clinton's book . 5. Any more certainty on 2016: Clinton waits 595 pages until she references the possibility that she will run for president in 2016 and then only repeats how she commonly answers the question. ""Will I run for president in 2016?"" she asks. ""The answer is, I haven't decided yet."" ""Right now I believe we should be focused on the work to be done in our country that can't wait until 2016."" She then writes about a walk that she and Bill Clinton took where they talked about the future. ""We both know I have a big decision in front of me,"" Clinton writes. ""Ultimately, what happens in 2016 should be about what kind of future Americans want for themselves and their children-and grandchildren. I hope we choose inclusive politics and a common purpose to unleash the creativity, potential, and opportunity that makes America exceptional. That's what all Americans deserve."" Clinton became more open to talking about 2016 as her book's release date neared. While in January 2013 she told a questioner that she was ""not thinking about anything like that right now,"" she told People Magazine earlier this month that she knows she has ""a decision to make.""

"(CNN) -- Whether you are shooting with a DSLR or a smartphone, one goal all photographers strive for is photographing a scene that quickly gets to the heart of the story without explanation or embellishment. So how do you do that? Well, the answer doesn't always lie with a fancy camera. Excellent visual communication is primarily driven by your unique visual sense, the time spent shooting and a deep connection to the story. In essence, you must do more than take pictures. You must make them. Images that transcend snapshots require extra effort. Once you've gone through the above gallery and learned how to compose your images, you may find the following tips helpful to take your photojournalism skills to the next level. Personal projects . When I meet someone trying to break into photojournalism, I try to get a grasp of their motivation and inspiration. One of the best ways to do this is to have them show me personal pictures, frames they made that were not for an immediate assignment. It is important to photograph things you care about, even if they may be insignificant to others. What matters is that you get invested in a subject and continue to photograph it over time. This is considered a personal project. Almost every story I have done for CNN was a subject I was interested in and pitched to the editors. For starters, I recommend choosing something simple. I have seen terrific projects that people have done on their relatives or friends, or on the places they live or hobbies they enjoy. You should photograph every aspect of your project. Get the details and get the wide shots that show the entire scene. By dedicating yourself to a project, you'll become more in tune with the way your camera works. You'll also begin to understand how to tell a story and how to make informative pictures. A personal project will not only improve your photography skills, it will also prepare you to capture breaking news when it unfolds. One lens . It is no secret that most photographers love gear, but it is easy to get bogged down worrying that you don't have the right gear for the job, or maybe you feel like you could do a better job if you just had that one other thing. I disagree with this premise. Photojournalism is about the subject, not about the camera. Whatever you shoot with, if you find the moment or composition that tells the story, then you've done well. Many of the greatest photojournalists have worked with very minimal gear. I personally shoot the majority of my work with one lens, roughly a 35mm. It is great for getting close to the subject and allowing me to show bits of the environment they are in. If you focus on mastering whatever equipment you have at your disposal, then you'll be better prepared for whatever news situation you encounter. Spend time learning all of the options that you can get from a specific lens, and then you'll find you are able to think less about the equipment and more about subject. Start by figuring out how close you can focus with your favorite lens, then practice shooting tight. Take a few steps back to shoot a wider environmental portrait. Finally, get as far back as you can to show the scene and try different angles on your subject. You'll find each lens is extremely versatile and you're only limited by how you can navigate the scene. After you get comfortable with composition, you need to learn how your aperture (and exposure) can help you tell the story. Shooting wide open, using aperture f2.8 on most lenses, gives you a shallow depth of field that emphasizes the part of the images you are focused on. A good example might be focusing on a single person, isolating him from a crowd. Stopping down, using a smaller aperture like f11, or f16, will give you a maximum depth of field, which can help to show a wider scene like devastation from a tornado. Smartphone photography . One essential part of being a photojournalist is having access to a camera that shoots large enough files to be useful. For many professionals, this means a few heavy, expensive DSLRs with an array of lenses and other equipment. But for many, this type of photo equipment is out of reach, so point-and-shoot cameras or camera phones are a viable alternative. For small cameras, the same principles of good photography apply. Thoughtful composition, proper exposure and excellent storytelling will help your images get noticed. The smaller cameras do have a few challenges that need to be addressed. Read the manual. Because many of these cameras shoot only in an automatic metering mode, it is more critical that you know how the camera function works. Beware of camera shake. Camera phones are small and lightweight, which makes them easy to carry and unobtrusive to use in chaotic situations, but this also makes them more difficult to hold steady. Consider purchasing a small, flexible tripod, and use it when the light levels are lower. Also, hold and release the ""shutter"" button, rather than tap it. This will reduce the amount of camera shake. Shoot in bright light with the sun to your back. This will solve many of the technical limitations of a camera phone. Clean your lens. Your pocket is not really the cleanest place to keep your camera. Don't use the digital zoom. The digital zoom crops the images, reducing the file size and the overall quality of the image. Set your resolution as high as possible. You can always reduce the file size later. Shoot lots, and edit out the poor images. The more you shoot, the more choice you have when editing. Go easy of the photo editing apps. Tools such as Hipstamatic and Instagram are fun to play with and can lend a certain personalization to your images, but they can harm or destroy the journalistic integrity of your images. As a rule, image alteration should not change the content of the image. Technical alterations, such as color correction or contrast change, are acceptable as long as they do not change the content of the photograph.

"Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard offered an apology Thursday to the mothers, children and families affected by forced adoptions. An untold number of unwed women in Australia were forced to give up their children for adoption over decades during the 20th century. ""To you, the mothers -- who were betrayed by a system that gave you no choice and subjected you to manipulation, mistreatment and malpractice -- we apologize,"" said Gillard, speaking in the Great Hall of Parliament House in Canberra. Addressing those ripped from their families, she said: ""To each of you who were adopted or removed, who were led to believe your mother had rejected you, and who were denied the opportunity to grow up with your family and community of origin, and to connect with your culture, we say sorry."" Gillard's comments came about a year after a Senate committee that investigated forced adoptions released its report, which included a recommendation for a national apology. The report found that some mothers signed adoption papers while under the influence of medication. Others were not advised of government payments that may have been available to them. ""Most common of all was the bullying arrogance of a society that presumed to know what was best,"" Gillard said. The report estimated there were 140,000 to 150,000 adoptions between 1951 and 1975, and as many as 250,000 from 1940 onward. It determined it was impossible to say exactly how many of those were forced. Gillard pledged support for families that continue to be affected by such adoptions, committing $5 million Australian to improving access to specialist support and records tracing. ""We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation's history,"" she said.","Forced adoptions were widespread in Australia for decades .

"(CNN) -- Following the liberal footsteps of Colorado and Washington, Alaska, Oregon and the District of Columbia passed ballot initiatives to legalize marijuana this month. Florida's medical marijuana law failed, but only because as a constitutional amendment it needed 60% support; 58% voted in favor of it. In 2016, another five to 10 states will likely consider legalization -- possibly Arizona, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. It's not surprising. Opinion polls show that marijuana legalization now commands majority support across the country. Do these developments mean that full legalization is inevitable? Not necessarily, but one would hope so. Marijuana legalization is a policy no-brainer. Any society that professes to value liberty should leave adults free to consume marijuana. Moreover, the evidence from states and countries that have decriminalized or medicalized marijuana suggests that policy plays a modest role in limiting use. And while marijuana can harm the user or others when consumed inappropriately, the same applies to many legal goods such as alcohol, tobacco, excessive eating or driving a car. Recent evidence from Colorado confirms that marijuana's legal status has minimal impact on marijuana use or the harms allegedly caused by use. Since commercialization of medical marijuana in 2009, and since legalization in 2012, marijuana use, crime, traffic accidents, education and health outcomes have all followed their pre-existing trends rather than increasing or decreasing after policy liberalized. The strong claims made by legalization critics are not borne out in the data. Likewise, some strong claims by legalization advocates -- e.g., that marijuana tourism would be a major boom to the economy -- have also not materialized. The main impact of Colorado's legalization has been that marijuana users can now purchase and use with less worry about harsh legal ramifications. Yet despite the compelling case for legalization, and progress toward legalization at the state level, ultimate success is not assured. Federal law still prohibits marijuana, and existing jurisprudence (Gonzales v. Raich 2005) holds that federal law trumps state law when it comes to marijuana prohibition. So far, the federal government has mostly taken a hands-off approach to state medicalizations and legalizations, but in January 2017, the country will have a new president. That person could order the attorney general to enforce federal prohibition regardless of state law. Whether that will happen is hard to forecast. If more states legalize marijuana and public opinion continues its support, Washington may hesitate to push back. But federal prohibition creates problems even if enforcement is nominal: Marijuana business cannot easily use standard financial institutions and transactions technologies such as credit cards; physicians may still hesitate to prescribe marijuana; and medical researchers will still face difficulty in studying marijuana. To realize the full potential of legalization, therefore, federal law must change. The best approach is to remove marijuana from the list of drugs regulated by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the federal law that governs prohibition. Standard regulatory and tax policies would still apply to legalized marijuana, and states would probably adopt marijuana-specific regulations similar to those for alcohol (e.g., minimum purchase ages). State and federal governments might also impose ""sin taxes,"" as for alcohol. But otherwise marijuana would be just another commodity, as it was before the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937. A more cautious approach would have Congress reschedule marijuana under the CSA. Currently, marijuana is in Schedule I, which is reserved for drugs such as heroin and LSD that, according to the CSA, have ""a high potential for abuse ... no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States ... [and] a lack of accepted safety for use."" Hardly anyone believes these conditions apply to marijuana. If marijuana were in Schedule II, which states it as ""a high potential for abuse ... [but a] currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States,"" doctors could legally prescribe it under federal law, as with other Schedule II drugs such as cocaine, methadone and morphine. Given the broad range of conditions for which marijuana may be useful, including muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis, nausea from cancer chemotherapy, poor appetite and weight loss caused by chronic illness such as HIV, chronic pain, stress, seizure disorders and Crohn's disease, doctors would have wide reign to prescribe, making marijuana all but legal as occurs under the broadest state medical marijuana laws, such as California and Colorado. Medical science would also face fewer regulatory hurdles to marijuana research. This ""medicalization"" approach, while perhaps politically more feasible than full legalization, has serious drawbacks. Federal authorities such as the Drug Enforcement Administration could interfere with marijuana prescribing -- as sometimes occurs with opiate prescribing. Taxing medical marijuana may be harder than taxing recreational marijuana. And the medical approach risks a charge of hypocrisy, since it is backdoor legalization. But medicalization is still better than full prohibition, since it eliminates the black market. For 77 years, the United States has outlawed marijuana, with tragic repercussions and unintended consequences. The public and their state governments are on track to rectify this terrible policy. Here's hoping Congress catches up.","Alaska, Oregon and District of Columbia recently legalized marijuana .

"Four weeks away from the 2014 midterm elections and even some Democratic operatives struggle to imagine a scenario where they retain control of the U.S. Senate. The terrain and current momentum seem all but overwhelming and against them. A new CNN/ORC poll out Thursday morning suggests a Republican lead over a Democratic incumbent, this time in Alaska, and does nothing to calm Democrats' nerves. ""If you put a gun to my head, I guess I'd say that we're going to lose the Senate,"" one Democratic consultant told me in a moment of anonymous candor. It's not even so much that President Obama is an Ancient Mariner-esque Albatross around their necks, though he is. ""I love the guy and I don't think there's anything he could do to fix it,"" the Democratic operative says, ""but he's a real drag. But the bigger drag is the economy overall -- even though the economy is getting better, people aren't feeling it because wages are stagnant."" Related: GOP challenger leads in Alaska . The other issue is that many of the Democrats defending their seats in GOP-leaning states had a fresh new Obama in 2008 helping to sweep them into office -- and often then, just barely. The class of 2008 were a bunch of Obama babies -- and now that's working against them. It's hard to explain to youngsters, but in 2008 then-Sen. Obama won Indiana and North Carolina and almost even won Montana and Missouri. Millions of Americans turned out to vote for him and in doing so in red states boosted Democrats like Sen. Mark Begich in Alaska. Begich only beat then-Sen. Ted Stevens, 47.9% to 46.7% six years ago. Begich has hovered in the low 40s in recent polling; he trails his GOP opponent Dan Sullivan by six percentage points among likely voters in the CNN / ORC poll out Thursday morning. Senate math is hard for Democrats . The basic math, for those of you not as fixated as the rest of us, is the following: The GOP needs to win at least six seats (though the number may end up being seven given the weirdness in Kansas -- more on that later.) Republicans start off basically half way there. Montana, West Virginia and South Dakota -- where three incumbent Democrats have said farewell -- are considered easy GOP pickups, with the GOP candidates ahead in polls by double digits. That leaves seven competitive Senate races where Democrats are playing defense: solid red states Alaska, Arkansas, and Louisiana; and blue-ish Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire, and purple-ish North Carolina. Democrats are feeling cautiously bullish about exactly two of these races, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH, and Sen. Kay Hagan, D-NC. Hagan is instructive in this way, she currently polls at 44% against her GOP opponent Thom Tillis, with 40%. As Obama squeaked in a 49.9%-49.5% victory against Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for North Carolina in 2008, Hagan defeated then-Sen. Elizabeth Dole, R-NC, 52.7% to 44.2%, and North Carolina elected a Democratic governor and handed Democrats victories in eight out of 13 House races. Four years later, North Carolinians opted for Mitt Romney, a GOP governor, and Democrats were down to four out of 13 U.S. House seats.  Hagan could certainly pull out a win this November, but it won't be because she's riding a wave -- it will be because she successfully fought against it. Related: Key senate races . Here is the obligatory ""to be sure"" paragraph: each race is its own individual microcosm, incumbents have advantages challengers do not, four weeks is a lifetime in politics, Dewey Defeats Truman, insert cliché here. The Senate GOP Leader, Mitch McConnell, has a competitive race in Kentucky , though I know few Democrats who think he won't eke it out at the end of the day. And Kansas is a weird one, with the Democratic candidate having withdrawn, and Republican Sen. Pat Roberts facing an independent challenger who hasn't said with which party he'll caucus. Democrats are hoping if the final vote comes down to Independent Greg Orman, he'll remember that Democrats cleared the field for him. A CNN/ORC poll out Wednesday showed the race in a virtual tie with Roberts just one percentage point ahead. Related: Roberts rebounds in Kansas poll . The Democratic operative noted that his party was benefiting from some GOP struggles, namely the Republican party's inability to raise as much money as it had wanted to, infighting among GOP Super-PACs, and general infighting among conservatives."" But midterm elections are generally more difficult for the party that holds the White House. And opposition to Washington appears to be a motivating factor for a lot of voters. ""A lot of these races are tight right now, but this isn't the sort of environment where late-deciding voters are going to break for Democrats,"" the Democratic consultant said, adding that with Democrats in tight races but under 50% right now, it's tough to imagine all of them breaking in favor of the party that holds the White House. Those Democrats include the ones fighting for their jobs in all seven of these toss-ups. Remember that the GOP only need win three of these and the most recent polling, which could clearly change between now and election day, suggests extremely close margins or a Republican advantage in all of them: . ·         Alaska (Republican up 50-44 in CNN / ORC poll) ·         Arkansas (Republican up 45-41 in CBS / NYT / YouGov poll) ·         Louisiana (Republican up 47-41 in CBS / NYT YouGov poll) ·         Colorado (Democrat up 48-45 in CBS / NYT / YouGov poll) ·         Iowa (42-42 draw in Loras College poll) ·         New Hampshire (Democrat up 48-41 in CBS / NYT / YouGov poll) ·         North Carolina (Democrat up 47-45 in USA Today / Suffolk poll) ""It's going to be bad,"" the consultant said. ""Not 2010 bad, but bad."" Even hapless House GOP candidates running against popular incumbents are proving competitive, the consultant reports. ""You can see why Eric Cantor went down -- people are just so anti-Washington, and that's particularly a problem with Democrats because of ties"" to the president. ""People feel hopeless and think that Washington isn't doing anything.""","Democrats are on defense in seven key senate races .

"For months now, his name has gone hand-in-hand with that of Newt Gingrich. But as the former House speaker prepares to leave the Republican nomination race next week, Sheldon Adelson has to decide what political causes -- and which candidates -- to support. Adelson's not wasting time. The Nevada billionaire and mogul and his wife, Miriam, are two of the hosts for a fundraiser on Friday for House Speaker John Boehner's re-election campaign at Adelson's casino, The Venetian, along with fellow magnate Steve Wynn and the American Gaming Association. The Adelsons have made a big political splash, giving $20 million to the super PAC Winning Our Future that was largely responsible for keeping Gingrich's candidacy alive in the past few months. That includes a $5 million contribution late last month. Adelson dropped some hints Thursday evening telling Jon Ralston of the Las Vegas Sun he wanted to become less visible in the political world and that references to him being a mogul when his donations were reported were ""not helpful to that person."" When asked if he was going to give to the Republican super PAC American Crossroads or its nonprofit affiliate Crossroads GPS, he initially would not answer. Later, he said to Ralston ""I'm going to give one more small donation -- you might not think it's that small -- to a super PAC and then if I give it will be to a C4,"" referring to 501(c)(4) non-profit groups, such as Crossroads GPS, which are not required to disclose their donors. Adelson refused to say if his reference to one ""small"" donation to a super PAC was referring to the pro-Mitt Romney Restore Our Future group. ""I'm not going to tell you...you'll find out when it's reported."" Adelson previously told some supporters of Mitt Romney he would back his candidacy if he became the Republican nominee, according to sources familiar with the matter. What is not clear is how much he and his wife will end up donating or when. Associates have said a major motivation for him is preventing the re-election of President Barack Obama. He thinks Republicans would be stronger proponents for Israel's safety, which friends have said trumps all other concerns for him. ""When the presidential campaign started he said his goal was to defeat Barack Obama, and he was going to do whatever he could to do that,"" one friend told CNN. The future financial support from Adelson is something Romney and his allies would like to see and have sought. The two men met right before the February 4 Nevada caucuses and have spoken on the phone many times. About a dozen donors to the super PAC Restore Our Future met with Adelson in Las Vegas in late March while they were in town for the Republican Jewish Coalition to convince him to ""come on board."" He indicated to them, according to one of the participants, ""it is just a matter of time."" While he was complimentary of Romney in that session, according to one source familiar with the matter, he also has publicly criticized him as not being a bold decision-maker. ""He's not the bold decision-maker like Newt Gingrich is. He doesn't want to -- every time I talk to him, he says, 'Well, let me think about it,' "" he told JewishJournal.com at the end of March. Adelson has been a prolific donor to Republican causes in past years. Earlier this year, he and his wife each donated $2.5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a group dedicated to keeping the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. Adelson was a bundler for John McCain's 2008 presidential candidacy, helping to bring in $219,000 for that campaign. He and his wife contributed almost $215,000 to the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, aimed at electing GOP candidates. Nevada Republicans also expect Adelson to be involved in some fashion to support Republican Sen. Dean Heller's re-election effort against Democratic Rep. Shelley Berkley, according to one Nevada Republican source, and he and his wife last year maxed out their allowed donations to Heller and U.S. Rep. Joe Heck, R-Nevada. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks the role of money in politics, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson rank as the top individuals funding outside spending groups this election cycle. In February, when Gingrich looked to have a serious chance at getting the Republican nomination, he told Forbes magazine he might give as much as $100 million to support the former House speaker. What is unclear is whether he will follow through with that amount and where it may go now that Gingrich will no longer be in the race. In that interview, he defended his donations and said he had nothing for which to apologize. ""I'm against very wealthy people attempting to influence elections,"" he said. ""But as long as it's doable, I'm going to do it. Because I know that guys like (George) Soros have been doing it for years, if not decades. And they stay below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their money. I have my own philosophy, and I'm not ashamed of it. I gave the money because there is no other legal way to do it. I don't want to go through 10 different corporations to hide my name. I'm proud of what I do, and I'm not looking to escape recognition."" The Adelsons came under some criticism from Republicans for their support of the super PAC backing Gingrich, especially when it was airing bitter ads in January questioning Romney's record at Bain Capital and also when it became clear that Gingrich's candidacy stalled. Adelson reacted to the critics in the Forbes interview: ""Those people are either jealous or professional critics."" He added: ""They like to trash other people. It's unfair that I've been treated unfair -- but it doesn't stop me."" Adelson was longtime friends with Gingrich from the time he served as House speaker, and the two shared common beliefs regarding Israel and the need to protect it. ""I am in favor of Newt Gingrich because I like people who make decisions. He is a decision-maker,"" he told the Jewish Journal publication. He also was motivated because he did not want Rick Santorum to become the nominee. ""Rick Santorum ... is too social,"" he also said. ""This man has no history creating anything or taking risks."" He said he knew Santorum and liked him, but ""I don't want him to run my country."" A spokesman for Adelson did not return calls seeking comment on the plans for future donations.","Sheldon Adelson and his wife, Miriam, gave big to pro-Newt Gingrich super PAC .

"(CNN) -- The King of Pop is back in the spotlight -- and not everybody is happy about it. Despite the well of affection for the late Michael Jackson, his ""return"" in the form of a hologram at Sunday night's Billboard Music Awards didn't meet with unanimous approval. The spectral Jackson performed ""Slave to the Rhythm,"" one of the singles from ""Xscape,"" a new album of posthumously released Jackson music. He was accompanied by actual, physically present dancers. Billboard Music Awards: MJ hologram and Kendall's flub get buzz . It was either the most amazing thing ever -- or super creepy, depending on which side of the fence you were viewing it from. Recording artist Trevor Morgan tweeted ""MICHAEL JACKSON HOLOGRAM IS RAD."" New York magazine's Vulture assistant editor Lindsey Weber tweeted ""turns out this michael jackson hologram is just as confusing and uncomfortable as we imagined."" Twitter user Assata H. seemed to fall in the middle, tweeting ""That Michael Jackson hologram kind of scared me...it was cool. But it was weird."" Buzzfeed deemed it ""scarier than the 'Thriller' video"" while Mashable called it ""stunning."" 'Digital formaldehyde' Though the Jackson hologram was new, the debate over whether or not deceased celebs should be brought back is not. The Billboard ""performance"" also resurrected the discussion on whether fans even want to see their favorite artists as holograms. In 2012 a hologram of the late rapper Tupac Shakur stunned audiences at the Coachella music festival. Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley have also been reanimated, after a fashion. The technology bringing Tupac, Sinatra back to life . At the time, National Post writer Matt Gurney argued that dead stars should be allowed to rest in peace. ""The technology is undeniably impressive,"" Gurney wrote in 2012. ""But Shakur is not a fictional character, owned by a studio, but a real-life human being. His work may be owned and licensed, but not his entire being. It is impossible to know how he'd have felt about being on that stage."" Soraya Nadia McDonald with The Washington Post wondered if this latest venture into digitally bringing artists back is the mark of more to come. ""The Jackson hologram raises some questions: Is this where we're headed?"" she wrote. ""Long after Madonna is gone (or perhaps, as with Jackson's hologram, not that long), can we expect to see the Material Girl performing 'Holiday' in a Grammys tribute, suspended in digital formaldehyde, just the way she was in 1983? And if so, what good are music videos?"" The technology seems to have gotten even better. As one person tweeted (we hope jokingly), ""I am very scared why is Michael Jackson alive."" The performance had the full support of the Jackson family estate. According to Billboard, brother ""Jackie Jackson started to tear up as he recalled watching 'Slave to Rhythm' in the audience at the MGM Grand Arena."" ""When he started walking and dancing, I was teary-eyed,"" Billboard reported him as saying. ""It's hard to please Michael's fans and Michael... I'm telling you it's amazing."" Weathering criticism . The performance was supposed to be a tightly held secret for the annual awards show, but that fell apart thanks to a lawsuit meant to stop it. According to the Los Angeles Times, companies Hologram USA Inc. and Musion Das Hologram Ltd. had filed suit against the show to stop the bit, claiming the show was using their technology without permission. Hologram USA acquired patent rights from Musion Das Hologram for projection/staging technology after Digital Domain, the company which created the Shakur hologram, filed for bankruptcy. Oscar-winning Digital Domain had produced special effects for several films, including ""X-Men: First Class"" and ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" A judge ruled that Billboard could use the Jackson hologram. The Washington Post's McDonald didn't find the technology to be all that precise. ""The effect was quite realistic, though at times just jerky enough that Jackson's hologram more closely resembled his representation in the Nintendo Wii game 'Michael Jackson: The Experience' than the man himself. In fact, it was actually slightly less realistic than the Tupac hologram that appeared at Coachella in 2012 (which was actually a projection, not a hologram), but the response was a little different."" Complaints in social media ranged from points about the hologram's youthful appearance (Jackson was 50 at the time of his death in 2009) to the thought that the digital representation's mouth appeared to be ""lip-syncing."" One fan was forgiving, however. ""It's okay,"" sloth queen tweeted. ""I forgive everyone for not making a perfect hologram i understand and accept Michael Jackson was too perfect to recreate.""","A hologram of Michael Jackson gets mixed reaction .

"French President Francois Hollande is considering legal action against the French version of Closer magazine after the publication alleged he was having an affair with actress Julie Gayet, French news agency Agence France-Presse reported Friday. A member of the President's entourage said in a statement to AFP that ""Hollande deeply condemns the attacks on the right to privacy which he has a right to like every other citizen. He is looking into possible action, including legal action against this publication (Closer)."" CNN has reached out to Hollande and Gayet for comment, but there has been no response. But the magazine's director, Stefan Haitaian, did tell CNN that the magazine is in the process of taking the story down from its website at the request of Gayet's lawyer. As of 1:15 a.m. Saturday (7:15 p.m. ET Friday), several stories on the pair's alleged relationship were still up and linked on the magazine's homepage. According to AFP, Gayet, who appeared in one of Hollande's 2012 election commercials, filed a complaint in March over rumors of the affair, which she said were a breach of privacy. Hollande, 59, lives with 48-year-old French journalist and mother-of-three Valerie Trierweiler. The President has four children of his own from his previous long-term relationship with prominent French Socialist politician Segolene Royal. Hollande, who heads France's Socialist Party, was elected President in May 2012. Since then, his popularity has tumbled. A survey last month by French polling organization Ifop gave Hollande an approval rating of 22%, a rise of two points from the previous month, when he hit a record low. At the same time, Closer itself is no stranger to controversy. Last September, a French court ordered the magazine not to distribute or showcase -- in print or online -- topless photos it had published on Britain's likely future queen, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. The court ordered Closer to hand over the original photos to the royal family within 24 hours and to pay them 2,000 euros (about $2,700). Closer is owned by the Mondadori publishing company, which is headed by Marina Berlusconi, daughter of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.","Closer magazine director says story will be taken down .

"President Barack Obama postponed executive action on immigration, but Democrats want voters to know the delay isn't his fault. Blame Republicans instead, according to the latest Democratic latest talking points. Obama had weighed action on immigration -- including moves that could allow a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers -- after congressional action on the issue stalled. The President took the brunt of criticism immediately after the White House announced Saturday he is delaying any unitary action on immigration until after November's midterm elections. He faced accusations of betrayal, bitter disappointment and frustration. And those are from the President's allies -- Democrats and immigration reform proponents who lead communities that voted overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008 and 2012. Since the weekend, Democrats began targeting House Republicans. Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-California, said Monday on CNN's ""New Day"" that she is frustrated with the President but added: ""The real reality is that these House Republicans have refused to work with us, to move a bill that would solve this issue."" Last year, the Senate passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for millions of long-term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security. House Republicans refused to consider the Senate bill, which Obama and Democrats claim would pass if put to a vote. Rep. Tony Cardenas, also a California Democrat, said the ""first blame"" should lie with Congress for not doing taking up immigration legislation. ""Now the President is forced to have to take a measure like executive actions,"" Cardenas said Sunday on CNN's ""State of the Union."" The President's delayed action could protect Democrats in competitive Senate races in conservative states like Louisiana, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina. By focusing blame on Republicans, Democrats likely are trying to placate anger in immigrant communities. But the relationship between those communities and the administration is strained. Immigration advocates are pointing to the 60,000 family members that could be deported before the end of the year as an unfortunate outcome of the President's political calculation. ""Republicans killed the best chance in a generation to enact landmark immigration reform legislation,"" Frank Sharry, executive director of immigration reform group America's Voice, told CNN in a statement. ""President Obama, however, has deported more than 2 million people and failed to deliver on promises of reform, including most recently when he publicly promised to take executive action by the end of the summer.""

"6:06 p.m. EST -- The White House confirmed Friday night that President Obama will nominate Loretta Lynch to become the next attorney general. Loretta Lynch, the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, is expected to be President Barack Obama's pick for attorney general, U.S. officials briefed on the matter said. An announcement is expected in the coming days, though the timing is complicated by the President's plans to travel to Asia this weekend. Lynch is a popular prosecutor who is in her second stint as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of New York, appointed by President Obama in 2010 and also serving in the same post from 1999 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. Current Attorney General Eric Holder announced his plans in September to step down. U.S. officials say the President's decision is not official until there is a formal announcement from the White House. Lynch would be the second woman to serve as attorney general and the second African-American to hold the post. Lynch served on the trial team that prosecuted and won convictions in 1999 against New York City police officers for violating the civil rights of Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant whom police officers beat and sodomized while he was in their custody. That experience could help at the helm at the Justice Department, which is overseeing high-profile civil rights investigations, including one into the Ferguson, Missouri, police shooting of Michael Brown. Lynch has quietly built a solid reputation in New York, where Preet Bharara, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, garners magazine covers and regular media attention for Wall Street prosecutions. Her 2010 nomination won Senate approval on a voice vote, meaning Republicans didn't view her as controversial. In recent months, however, she has led the prosecution of Rep. Michael Grimm, R-New York, for alleged tax fraud. Grimm won reelection this week despite being under indictment, and has called the case against him politically motivated. Lynch was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate to be a U.S. attorney in 2010, but GOP aides said initially Friday they don't know that much about her. Regardless, the scrutiny she will receive to become the nation's top law enforcement official will be much greater than when she was picked to be one of 93 U.S. Attorneys. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who is poised to chair the Judiciary Committee in the new GOP-controlled Senate, and other top Senate GOP leaders never got word about the expected nomination from the White House, according to aides. ""It'd be nice if the White House called to let us know,"" one aide grumbled to CNN. While the administration is not required to inform Congress in advance about Cabinet picks, it is often done to give key lawmakers -- like Grassley and members of leadership -- a courtesy heads-up, or to consult with them and determine whether there would be major opposition. Sen.

"At first blush, Francois Hollande seems comically ill-suited in the role as ardent seducer of fetching actresses. And in many respects the astonishing allegations of his secret love trysts are like the improbable plot of a door-slamming French farce. Hollande's alleged sexual escapades, revealed by the gossip magazine ""Closer,"" are buzzing through the French media and burning up Twitter streams gushing with shock, sniggering and outrage that so much attention is being devoted to something so irrelevant to affairs of state. Yet, at a time when the French are tired of reading how depressed they are, claims of Hollande's bedroom romp may well be a welcome distraction. It may even help him in the polls. Hollande is nonetheless threatening legal action against ""Closer"" for privacy invasion. That gesture itself is extraordinary for two reasons. First, Hollande has not denied the affair with 41-year-old actress Julie Gayet --- the magazine has pulled its article from its online edition under pressure from Gayet's lawyers, but says that does not mean its claims are inaccurate. France's first lady hospitalized after report of Hollande's affair . 'Bizarrely comical' Second, in the past Hollande's predecessors in the Elysee Palace -- notably Francois Mitterrand and Jacques Chirac --- never had to worry about the French press reporting their feminine conquests. Until recently, a media omerta protected the private lives of French politicians from the kind of intense scrutiny that British and American politicians are well accustomed. If the ""Closer"" photo spread is accurate, Hollande's secret assignations with Julie Gayet were bizarrely comical. He was allegedly slipping out the back door of the Elysee Palace, hopping on a scooter and buzzing through the streets of Paris on his way to Gayet's apartment. There's a claim that presidential bodyguard brought croissants to the love nest in the morning. Touching, perhaps, but not very presidential if true. One can only imagine how Hollande's official companion, Valerie Trierweiler, reacted to reports of such assignations. Trierweiler met Hollande when she was a reporter for ""Paris Match"" magazine. He left his long-time common-law wife, Segolene Royal -- the mother of his four children -- for Trierweiler before the 2012 presidential election. According to the claims in ""Closer,"" it would seem he may now have replaced Trierweiler with Gayet, though Trierweiler still occupies one wing of the Elysee Palace. 'Time-honored tradition' In that respect, Hollande would be adhering to a time-honored French tradition of official mistresses stretching back to the Bourbon kings. Louis XV fell under the influence of the Marquise de Pompadour, who was his ""favorite"" at court. A century later Napoleon III was an indefatigable seducer of alluring courtesans. In the Third Republic, George Clemenceau was an infamous womanizer; and Felix Faure famously died in 1899 while enjoying the lascivious attentions of his mistress in the Elysee Palace. The corpulent and affable Hollande may have learned the hard way that, unlike his political mentor Mitterrand, he cannot count on media complicity about his personal indiscretions. He could have realized that while watching Nicolas Sarkozy's personal crises fill the headlines. When the former French president's wife Cecilia left him for another man, ""Paris Match"" published a photo of Cecilia and her new boyfriend. And when Sarkozy began courting the fashion model Carla Bruni, their romance was all over the press, much of it stage-managed by Sarkozy. French vs. Anglo-American media . Traditionally, French and Anglo-American media behavior regarding the private lives of public figures have been a study in contrast. The standard explanation is that the French media never reported on private lives because the French simply don't care about the personal vices of their leaders. The Anglo-Saxon press, on the other, have shown a prurient interest in private vices to pander to a pervasive ""Puritanical"" culture in America and Britain. This may explain why Anglo-American politicians caught with their pants down tend to confess and resign --- or in some cases wheel out wife and children and apologize abjectly, then resign under pressure shortly afterwards. In France, by contrast, politicians tend to sue and stay in office. If French politicians can count on Catholic indulgence in their vices, the law is also on their side. That changed when Dominique Strauss-Kahn -- who was favored over Hollande as Socialist candidate for the French presidency -- was arrested in New York for sexual assault. At first the French media establishment was stunned. The old omerta rules didn't apply in this case. Not only was a criminal act alleged but it was alleged to have taken place in America, where different media laws and attitudes applied. Many in the French establishment fulminated against Anglo-Saxon press abuses in sensationalizing the DSK scandal, but the fact is that the French media jumped in. With the Hollande sex scandal, the French political establishment is predictably coming to his defense and condemning the tabloid excesses of ""Closer."" But again, it hasn't stopped the mainstream French media from covering the story. Legal differences . Beyond Anglo vs. French cultural differences, the law is another factor. While there are distinctions between American and British law, generally speaking the press can report on private lives if claims can be proved to be true. Truth is the test. French law, by contrast, is indifferent to truth. In France, protecting personal privacy trumps the truth. In France numerous politicians and celebrities have successfully sued gossip magazines for violating their privacy. In most cases, however, damages awarded are relatively modest. ""Closer"" magazine -- even if it loses a lawsuit brought by Hollande -- will likely pay a small fine compared with the huge profits from newsstand sales of the alleged Hollande sex scandal edition. French law, even if strict on privacy matters, is increasingly becoming irrelevant with the explosion of social media networks such as Twitter and Facebook. French courts have no extra-territorial jurisdiction over anyone tweeting, posting and commenting outside of France about Hollande's sexual escapades. Even in France, it's impossible for Hollande, or any other public figure, to bring lawsuits against everyone who has violated their privacy on Twitter or Facebook. The alleged Hollande sexual scandal proves that the old media omerta rules and predictable legal gesticulations don't work anymore in France. It's a new game with new rules.","Closer magazine has alleged Hollande is having an affair with actress Julie Gayet .

"The world saw another side of Nepalese mountaineering in April last year when a brawl was reported between European climbers and Sherpas 22,000 feet up Mount Everest. Now Nepalese authorities plan to station security officials at the base of the world's highest peak from the spring climbing season beginning in March. Up to nine officers from the police and army will be sent to the mountain to try to resolve conflicts on the spot rather than having to appeal to authorities in Kathmandu. ""The police will be the state's representative at the mountain to verify incidents that have to be reported to the authorities,"" said Dipendra Poudel, a mountaineering official. ""It's [part of] our effort to make mountaineering respectable."" Mount Everest: By the numbers . Confrontation with Sherpas . The Swiss mountaineer Ueli Steck and the Italian Simone Moro were ascending Everest by a new route last April when they were reportedly confronted by a group of Sherpas laying ropes for other climbers who accused them of getting in the way. The Europeans said the Sherpas threatened and then attacked them, including throwing rocks. The Sherpas said the climbers had caused ice to drop on them and had ignored requests not to advance until the ropes had been laid. The issue was resolved after a meeting mediated by a Nepalese army official leading an expedition. With police at base camp, Nepalese liaison officers -- who accompany expeditions to ensure they abide by local laws -- will no longer have to report incidents at the nearest police station a seven-day trek away, said Gyanendra Shrestha, who has worked as such an officer. Beginning this year, the Nepalese government will also have a secretariat headed by a civilian at Everest base camp, to which security officials will report. ""We plan to have a meteorologist and communications expert at the secretariat, too,"" Poudel said. Everest men: On top of the world in 1963 . Mountain traffic jams . While the quarrel between mountaineers and Sherpas made headlines in 2013, Nepalese authorities came under fire in 2012 for allowing ""traffic jams"" to build up on the mountain, allegedly contributing to accidents. There have been calls to restrict climbing permits to expert mountaineers, preventing novices from attempting the peak. ""We are looking into the basis for setting [the] criteria [for climbing],"" Poudel said. For the past several years, around 300 foreign climbers have attempted to ascend Everest each spring. To further regulate traffic, beginning this year the government has revised its royalty fees for climbing the mountain. Last year the fee went down from $25,000 per climber to $10,000 if there were more than seven in a team. The result was that climbers who didn't know each other clubbed together in ""artificial"" teams to pay significantly lower royalties. But under new regulations, each foreign climber will pay a flat rate of $11,000 irrespective of the number of climbers. Poudel said it was hoped this would improve safety and make managing teams easier.

"Thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the National Football League on Thursday in a lawsuit that put concussions, and their impact on the brain, under the microscope. The deal calls for the NFL to pay $765 million to fund medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement still needs to be approved by the judge assigned to the case, which involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs. ""It's been a struggle to get to this point, but today I will say I'm very proud that the NFL has decided to stand up for all the former players who are suffering from brain injuries,"" Kevin Turner, a former NFL running back who has been diagnosed with ALS, said during a teleconference. ""Today is so important for those who are ... hurting. This will bring help for them today."" Former NFL player wants brain studied . The case mediator, former U.S. District Judge Layn Phillips, called it ""a historic agreement, one that will make sure that former NFL players who need and deserve compensation will receive it, and that will promote safety for players at all levels of football."" ""My hope is that any players or ex-players that are suffering, or begin to suffer, from symptoms of dementia, will be taken care of in a respectable manner through this settlement,"" said Chris Dronett, one of the plaintiffs, whose husband Shane Dronett committed suicide in 2009 at age 38. Scientists found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, in Shane's brain after his death. At the heart of the lawsuit was plaintiffs' allegations that the NFL led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks. NFL concussions: The facts . The suit alleged that misinformation, which included studies by the committee suggesting no correlation between concussions and long-term brain damage, trickled down to players so that they did not not realize the true risks they were taking while playing. The NFL didn't comment about the settlement, but a league spokesman previously has said, ""Any allegation that the league sought to mislead players has no merit ... and stands in contrast to actions it took to better protect players."" Family members of former players, some of whom are suffering from neurodegenerative illnesses, said they were stunned to find out the lawsuit had been settled so quickly. ""I had two thoughts. First, I'm glad that the league will finally take responsibility,"" said Tia McNeill, the ex-wife of former Minnesota Viking linebacker Fred McNeill, a plaintiff who suffers with symptoms of early dementia. ""The other thing I was thinking is that (the NFL) didn't want to go into the discovery phase of the case."" Study offers clues about how CTE begins . Without a trial, without a discovery phase to reveal evidence, there is no way to discern what the league knew -- or did not know -- about concussion risks, and whether in the face of scientific knowledge, it should have established safer practices for players sooner than it did. In recent years, the NFL has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field and added sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to evaluate more independently injured players. But many have ventured that these rule changes could have been implemented years ago. Tia McNeill said her decision to join the suit on behalf of her ex-husband was less about compensation and more about the NFL acknowledging the potential risks of repetitive traumatic brain injury. What is most important, said Jamal Anderson, a former player and plaintiff, ""is to bring attention to the plight of thousands of players and the importance of taking concussion and head trauma seriously."" In an interview on CNN, Anderson, who played for the Atlanta Falcons in the 1990s, said that by settling, the league was not accepting responsibility for allegations in the lawsuit. But, Anderson said, ""at least they put the proper foot forward to say, 'Hey, these players, the guys who played the game before the current players actually matter.' "" Opinion: Why my son will never play football . The settlement includes a $675 million fund set up to compensate players who have suffered brain injury, or their families; a maximum of $75 million for retired players' medical exams, which could be used to diagnose future neurodegenerative disease; and $10 million devoted to research and education. The rest of the settlement would be devoted to legal fees and the cost of administering funds to plaintiffs. The funds will be doled out over 20 years. Meanwhile, the impact of the settlement may never fully register for former players such as Fred McNeill. Tia McNeill, who has not yet shared the news of the lawsuit's settlement with her ex-husband, said she can predict his reaction. ""I think he will pay attention for a minute, say 'Oh wow,' and then not really think about it until someone brings it up again,"" she said.  ""It's not something he'll remember tomorrow.""

"Dan Marino, considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in National Football League history, is suing the NFL over concussions, according to court documents filed last week in Philadelphia. Marino, a Hall of Famer who starred for the Miami Dolphins for 17 seasons, and 14 other former players filed a civil lawsuit in federal court that says the league knew for years there was a link between concussions and long-term health problems.

Patrice Biancone, head of Trierweiler's Elysee office, told CNN, ""She needed rest. We are hoping that she will leave the hospital at the beginning of this week."" He said that the first lady entered a hospital after allegations surfaced in the French tabloid Closer linking Hollande romantically to actress Julie Gayet.

"Dan Marino, considered one of the greatest quarterbacks in National Football League history, is withdrawing his name from a concussion lawsuit against the NFL, according to published reports. The news, first reported by the South Florida Sun Sentinel, comes a day after media reports that the Hall of Fame quarterback and 14 other players had filed a lawsuit that claims the NFL knew for years of a link between concussions and long-term health problems and did nothing about it.

"(CNN) -- Is college worth the cost? The question has echoed in the halls of government, over the family dinner table and throughout the media for decades. But the alarm bell has rung even louder in recent years, when student loan debt in the United States grew to over $1.2 trillion and tuition increases continued at nearly triple the rate of inflation. Just this summer the debate about the cost of college seemed to reach a fever pitch, as dueling perspectives seized national headlines. On the one hand, Senator Elizabeth Warren bemoaned the fact that ""Millions of young people... can't buy homes, they can't buy cars ... all because they are struggling under the weight of student loan debt."" In the same vein, President Obama declared that ""we're still seeing too big a debt load on too many young people"" as he signed an Executive action that would extend income-based repayment programs for graduates who can't earn enough to handle loan payments. But on the other hand, a Brookings Institution study released just days later offered a starkly different message. Prominently covered by the News/Opinion vertical at The New York Times called ""The Upshot,"" the study said that ""the impact of student loans may not be as dire as many commentators fear."" David Leonhardt of the New York Times crystallized the argument with a headline reading, ""The Reality of Student Debt is Different From the Cliches."" He pointed out that students with six figure debt loads represent a fraction of the overall picture and cited data that the ratio of borrowers' monthly loan payments to monthly income has remained consistent when measured since the early 1990s. The authors of the study further questioned whether student debt was creating any kind of drag on the economy at all. So the question arose, was all this effort for student loan reform at the highest level of government an overreaction? Perhaps just a symptom of simplistic media coverage? Was The New York Times' own magazine cover about ""boomerang kids"" (featuring a recent graduate with $80,000 in debt living at home) or  its front-page series on ""Degrees of Debt"" (featuring ""a generation hobbled by the soaring cost of college"") just another media clichÃ©? Certainly a media organization can accommodate competing perspectives, but was the take away that we should finally stop worrying and sign every student up for more loans already? It became quickly apparent, however, that the Brookings study had its flaws. One notable omission was the fact that 70% of the class of 2014 would graduate with an average debt of $33,000 per borrower, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. Analysts also criticized various aspects of the study's method. For example, using data from 2010, the Brookings authors define ""young households"" as homes headed by people ages 20-40. This dataset includes people who graduated college in the early-1990s, when average debt per borrower was less than half what it is today. Perhaps even more importantly, this dataset excludes young people still living at home with their parents and therefore not the heads of their households. Such an exclusion is significant, since one in five college graduates under age 35 still live at home, and they are most likely the graduates with the highest debt levels (hence the phenomenon of ""boomerang kids""). Another important caveat is the fact that the average repayment period on student loans has increased from 7.4 years in 1992 to 13.4 years today. So while monthly payments may be similar to what they were twenty years ago, they now last for almost double the time. This is where the meme of ""student debt slavery"" enters the conversation. It used to be the case that student loan debt could be paid off by the time one might decide to start a family and buy a home. But now, there is a sense that student loan debt will haunt borrowers deep into adulthood, negatively affecting their ability to make life choices that are part of a healthy future and a key to the health of our economy. Perhaps the biggest oversight in the Brookings study, though, is that the data includes only borrowers actually making monthly repayments on their debt. Thus the study doesn't include all those who are in default, deferment or forbearance. And as data released in August revealed, less than half of student borrowers are actually paying their federal loans back on time, with defaults on the rise. So the Brookings argument reads a bit like a tautology: those who are not having trouble paying back their loans are not having trouble paying back their loans. But lets take a step back from all of this data-crunching about student debt, and consider an even more fundamental question: is higher education a public good that benefits the whole country, or is it simply a private good that adds to an individual's net worth? This is the culturo-historical perspective that Ivory Tower seeks to explore in order to come to a more nuanced understanding of whether college is worth the cost. From the arrival of the first colonists in New England, college in America has been a place for the moral development and intellectual uplift of young people. By the time of our nation's founding, college had expanded from an institution simply meant to train the clergy to a critical component of a nascent democracy. An educated citizenry, according to Jefferson, was the best defense against tyranny. With the emergence of a new industrial economy in the 19th Century, college education became both a source of individual edification and national prosperity, and with the Morrill Acts of 1865 and 1890, the federal government created free (or nearly free) institutions accessible to people who never would have dreamed of going to college before. Private institutions also embraced this notion of education as a public good, with the wealthiest philanthropists of the era, such as Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and Peter Cooper endowing institutions for the benefit of both individual students and the broader society. In the 20th Century, the GI Bill of 1944 continued this tradition, offering free college education to millions of returning veterans, and laying the groundwork for an economic boom and vast expansion of the middle class. The federal student loan program itself began as a small part of Lyndon Johnson's vision for a Great Society, as he aimed to increase access to college through the Higher Education Act of 1965. But by the 1970s, this tradition was derailed, and the emphasis shifted to the private good of education. State legislatures, inspired by the example of Ronald Reagan, made the argument that if students were receiving a wage premium from college, they should pay for it themselves. This attitude resulted in shifting the cost of college increasingly onto the shoulders of individual students through more and more student loans. At the same time, colleges and universities have found themselves in an ever more perverse arms race to compete with each other. As students have become more like customers, colleges have become more like businesses trying to attract those customers with fancier dormitories, recreation centers, and other amenities not essential to their core academic mission. And while the soaring ""sticker price"" of college has been at least somewhat offset at many institutions by increased financial aid, many of those discount packages actually include loans. Indeed, only 1.25% of the over four thousand institutions of higher education in the country offer financial aid that meets a student's full need. Returning to data and statistics, perhaps the most significant number one can cite in terms of the value of college is the $1 million lifetime earnings premium a bachelor's degree confers. For some, this statistic puts the debate about whether college is worth it to rest. But while we can say that statistically a bachelor's degree is worth it, that does not mean ""college"" as a whole is worth the cost. Indeed, 68% of students at public institutions do not graduate in 4 years, and 44% fail to graduate in 6 years. That means that nearly half of the students who are signing up for a public university education will not enjoy the wage premium promised to them, yet they may still be saddled with debt. For students like these, the question of whether college is worth it is far more complicated. And in an economy where the disparity between the wealth of high school graduates and college graduates is increasingly stark, the choice to not go to college seems like financial suicide, even if the choice to take on debt may seem very risky as well. As Anthony Carnevale from the Georgetown Center on Education and the Workforce puts it, ""The only thing worse than going to college is not going to college."" Ultimately, our society should not put so many young people, especially those from less advantaged backgrounds, in such a precarious position, particularly when the potential value of a college education for both students and society is so high.

"The body of former NFL linebacker Jovan Belcher was exhumed Friday in order to perform tests on his brain, a lawyer for the player's family told the Kansas City Star. Attorney Dirk Vandever told the newspaper that Belcher's family hopes tests will provide a clue as to why the four-year veteran of the Kansas City Chiefs shot his longtime girlfriend to death then killed himself about a year ago. Belcher's body was exhumed Friday from a cemetery in Long Island, New York, the paper reported. It was not clear where the body was sent for examination. Vandever didn't immediately respond to CNN's calls for comment Sunday morning. The family wants to know if chronic traumatic encephalopathy, known as CTE, or something else played a role in the murder-suicide, according to the newspaper. CTE is a progressive degenerative brain disease found in some athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. The only way to diagnose CTE is after death -- by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau. Tau has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players, including Junior Seau, Dave Duerson, Terry Long and Shane Dronett, who all committed suicide. It was also found in the brain of Mike Webster, who died in 2002. Suicide latest in a string among former NFL players . Dr. Bennet Omalu, the first forensic pathologist to diagnose CTE in NFL players, told CNN time is a factor in the Belcher case. ""There is a reasonable probability that the (brain) tissues would have degenerated, but until you open the body up, you may not know if there would be viable tissue for reasonable analysis,"" he wrote in an e-mail to CNN on Sunday. Omalu said there was a 50-50 chance that the study of the brain would yield results after the body had been buried about a year. He said he had performed two such studies himself. ""The exhumation and analysis has to be performed by a forensic pathologist who has the experience and expertise, otherwise it has the potential of coming to naught,"" he said. Scientists are working to identify some common symptoms of the brain disease in living players. Experts say athletes with CTE often struggle with memory and decision-making. Some exhibit mood and behavior problems such as depression and hopelessness, or violent, explosive behavior. A few show no symptoms at all. In 2002, Webster, a Hall of Fame center for the Pittsburgh Steelers, was the first former NFL player to be diagnosed with CTE. After his retirement, Webster suffered from amnesia, dementia, depression and bone and muscle pain. Mother screams as baby cries in released Belcher 911 tapes . Other athletes have demonstrated erratic behavior, such as Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, 36, who died in a 2004 high-speed chase. Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Chris Henry died at age 26 after falling from the bed of a moving pickup during a fight with his fiancee. Issues surrounding brain damage, and other potential long-term cognitive and emotional consequences of repetitive brain trauma, have become a serious concern for  the NFL. The league settled a concussion lawsuit for $765 million in August. At the heart of the lawsuit were plaintiffs' allegations that the NFL led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks. The deal calls for the NFL to pay for medical exams, concussion-related compensation, medical research for retired NFL players and their families, and litigation expenses, according to a court document filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. The agreement involved more than 4,500 plaintiffs. Belcher -- who was 6-foot-2 and weighed 228 pounds -- played for the Chiefs from 2009 to 2012, appearing in 59 games. On December 1, 2012, the 25-year-old linebacker fatally shot his girlfriend, Kassandra Perkins, in the same home with their 3-month-old daughter before heading to the team's practice facility, thanking his coaches, and turning his gun on himself. In an November article on Bleacher Report, a friend of Belcher's said the linebacker played through his physical problems. ""Jovan suffered multiple concussions,"" said Kash Kiefer, a former punter at Maine and one of Belcher's closest friends. ""But in football, you don't complain. You play. That was Jovan. He played.""

"The political strategist spearheading the Senate Republicans' campaign effort declared Thursday, perhaps not surprisingly, his party will take control of the Senate in November, after close to a decade in the minority. ""We are going to win the Senate, I feel very good about that,"" NRSC executive director Rob Collins said. ""These races have been tough.  They have been a grind.  But we are seeing movement in the right direction and I feel really good about where we are and think we're going to take the Senate and we're going to take it on election night,"" Collins said, predicting the GOP will win the 6 seats it needs to control the Senate, even if races in Louisiana and Georgia are close enough to require run-offs in the weeks ahead. Democratic campaign operatives in Washington also have expressed confidence in recent days they will hold the Senate.  Public polls show a number of races shifting -- for and against each party -- as voters become more focused on the candidates, something that is likely to continue for the final three weeks of the campaign. No matter who wins, Republicans should pick up seats and the Senate likely will be narrowly divided. Collins said the credit for the party's expected success belongs to a disciplined crop of GOP challengers and good stewardship from political handlers in Washington who provided special debate and speech training for their candidates.  That training allowed campaigns to avoid the types of gaffes and missteps that derailed several GOP candidates in 2012. ""Joni Ernst raised $6 million because she's a good candidate,"" Collins said about the Republican Iowa candidate who is neck in neck in a race Democrats didn't originally expect to be close.  ""That training, we believe, helps make her that much better a candidate.  And when our candidates don't have problems, they don't say things that reflect poorly on our party or their campaign, it just helps in every category."" Speaking to reporters in the ""Majority Room"" of NRSC headquarters on Capitol Hill, Collins ticked through the most competitive races of the term, saying in each case the GOP candidate was poised to win.  He did acknowledge the Georgia Senate race has ""tightened up"" as Republican David Perdue battles a well-funded campaign from Michelle Nunn, the daughter of a respected former senator.    Perdue has faced criticism for his comments about outsourcing jobs as a businessman.  The NRSC recently pumped $1.4 million into the race, in part, to help Perdue get better known in some parts of the state. Foreign policy, terrorism, Ebola, and ISIS are high on voters' minds, Collins said.  Those ""constant crises"" -- coupled with President Obama's high unfavorable ratings -- have created openings for Republicans. On Ebola, Collins praised his candidate's deft handling of a politically sensitive subject. ""I think our candidates have been thoughtful and they have been cautious to strike a correct tone of concerns of this administration's handling of it without being outside the lines or going beyond the fact,"" he said. Asked what would happen if Democrats defied his predication and retained control of the Senate, Collins quipped, ""I'll be in an unmarked grave in Kentucky,"" which, of course, is home to Sen. Mitch McConnell, the man who would become Majority Leader of the Senate if the GOP wins.","NRSC director feels ""very good"" about GOP Senate victory in November.
He attributes potential GOP success to strong candidates like Joni Ernst in Iowa.

"Sometimes it takes a disaster to inspire innovation. There is a major drought in California. It's not the first state to face a water shortage recently, and it's definitely not the first time California has had to battle drought, but it could drag on for a decade and have a significant impact on all Americans who rely on California farms for food. Residents, the government and the agriculture industry are hoping for some high-tech solutions for a very old problem. Surprisingly, given its California location, Silicon Valley isn't a hotbed of drought and water research. Most local investors and venture capitalists aren't looking to invest in something that will take at least 10 years to pay off. They want software, cheap-to-make mobile apps that gather and monetize data about people, and consumer goods like phones, smart watches and futuristic thermostats. ""Water doesn't always fit the venture capital model,"" said Scott Bryan, COO of Imagine H2O, a San Francisco nonprofit focused on helping water-technology companies get their ideas off the ground. As the United Nations observes World Water Day on Saturday, it's fitting that the biggest water research and innovation hubs are scattered around the globe. Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Israel are global leaders in the industry out of geographic necessity. In the United States, there are water-research centers clustered in Fresno and San Diego in California, and in Fort Collins, Colorado, Boston and Milwaukee. In Milwaukee, the roots of the water industry go back 100 years and are tied to the city's big breweries. Now there are 150 water-tech companies in the region, and five of the 11 largest companies in the world either have their headquarters or a major operation there. Green roofs and tree trays . Dean Amhaus runs The Water Council, which has created the Global Water Center, a Milwaukee complex with almost 100,000 square feet of research space, labs, offices and conference rooms. Researchers and entrepreneurs come together to collaborate on water-technology issues. The space houses intriguing startups such as Hanging Gardens, which builds ""green"" roofs that help collect storm water. There also are products that help detect leaks, waste-water treatment research, and tools for better tracking water usage and waste. Agriculture accounts for 70% of all our water usage, so much of the current technology focuses on helping farms use water more efficiently. Solutions range from the high-tech, like using big data and infrared aerial monitoring to give farmers more precise water information, to the simpler but ingenious, such as specialized plastic trays that fit around the bases of young trees. Imagine H2O's latest class has a crop of promising agriculture technology companies. WatrHub wants to be the Bloomberg Terminal of agriculture. The Toronto-based company was founded by a former Microsoft employee and a former Apple employee. They're using their experience working with big data sets to scrape together all the available information that might be useful to water and wastewater systems in North America. Getting better information is also what inspired the two founders of WellIntel. They have invented a monitor that gathers real-time data from water wells using sonar. Farms or rural homes with wells on their property can choose to keep their information private or share it anonymously with WellIntel, which uses the data to help government agencies and others see the bigger picture of water shortages. Then there's the plastic tray, the brainchild of an Israeli company called Tal-Ya which claims it can reduce water consumption by up to 50 percent. The lightweight square funnels rainwater or irrigation water toward the base of a tree and blocks sunlight, which kills weeds. It also captures any evaporating soil moisture, condensing it and trickling it back to the roots. As a bonus, the reflective surface redirects light back to the plant to aid in light absorption. All the companies have seen a recent uptick in interest in their products. ""Everybody for the most part has been tuned out on water (shortages) because within the U.S. it's not really been a big issue,"" said Amhaus. ""The situation in California has raised huge attention to the fact that we actually do have a problem."" 'Forcing innovation' Companies and industrial farmers have financial incentives to test new water-saving technologies. But convincing regular consumers to change their ways is trickier. One part of public awareness means doling out practical advice on how to save water at home, such as only watering lawns at night, not running the dishwasher until it's completely full, and taking shorter showers. Oftentimes, people won't be spurred to action without some sort of incentive, or at least evidence that a lack of water has a negative impact on their lives. Eventually, the fruits and vegetables people expect to get in grocery stores won't be there, or they'll be much more expensive because they're imported from other countries. Saving money on water bills isn't going to be a big motivator, according to Amhaus. ""Right now water has been cheap and it will continue to be cheap,"" he said. ""It's not the price, it's whether its even going to be available."" Christian Siems sells equipment to farms and vineyards and works with Tal-Ya. He sees first hand the steps the agriculture industry is taking to combat a looming water shortage. The drought has inspired many companies to test out new solutions.

"On March 19, 2003, Iraq was invaded by an ""alliance of willing states"" headed by the U.S. and UK. My U.N. inspection team and I had seen it coming -- and I felt an emptiness when, three days before the invasion, an American official called me to ""ask"" that we withdraw from the country. While we were sad to be ushered out in the midst of a job entrusted to us by the U.N. Security Council -- one that we were doing well -- there was a certain relief in knowing we had all made it out safely. We had worried that our inspectors might be taken hostage, but as it turned out the Iraqis had been very helpful during our time there. So it was that a few hundred unarmed U.N. inspectors left Iraq, to be replaced by hundreds of thousands of soldiers who began an occupation that would have a horrendous cost in lives, suffering and resources. FULL COVERAGE: The Iraq War, 10 years on . I headed the U.N. inspections in Iraq at the time of the war 10 years ago. Today, I look again at the reasons why this terrible mistake -- and violation of the U.N. charter -- took place and explore if any lessons be drawn. Here are my thoughts. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, George W. Bush's administration felt a need to let the weight and wrath of the world's only superpower fall on more evil actors than just Afghanistan's Taliban regime. No target could have seemed more worthy of being crushed than Iraq's brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein. Sadly, however, the elimination of this tyrant was perhaps the only positive result of the war. The war aimed to eliminate weapons of mass destruction, but there weren't any. The war aimed to eliminate al Qaeda in Iraq, but the terrorist group didn't exist in the country until after the invasion. The war aimed to make Iraq a model democracy based on law, but it replaced tyranny with anarchy and led America to practices that violated the laws of war. The war aimed to transform Iraq to a friendly base for U.S. troops capable to act, if needed, against Iran -- but instead it gave Iran a new ally in Baghdad. WATCH NOW: Iraq's phantom WMD . The Bush administration certainly wanted to go to war, and it advanced eradication of weapons of mass destruction as the main reason. As Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz has since explained, it was the only rationale that was acceptable to all parts of the U.S. administration. The WMDs argument also carried weight with the public and with the U.S. Congress. Indeed, in the autumn of 2002 the threat seemed credible. While I never believed Saddam could have concealed a continued nuclear program, I too thought there could still be some biological and chemical weapons left from Iraq's war with Iran. If not, why had Iraq stopped U.N. inspections at many places around the country throughout the 1990s? However, suspicions are one thing and reality is quite another. U.N. inspectors were asked to search for, report and destroy real weapons. As we found no weapons and no evidence supporting the suspicions, we reported this. But U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfield dismissed our reports with one of his wittier retorts: ""The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence."" Rumsfeld's logic was correct, I believe, but it was no excuse for the American and British governments to mislead themselves and the world, as they did, by giving credit to fake evidence or assuming that if weapons items were ""unaccounted for"" that they must exist. They did not exist. We inspected many hundred of sites, including dozens that had been suggested to us by various governments' national intelligence organizations. In a few cases we found conventional weapons -- but no weapons of mass destruction. The governments that launched the war claimed to be 100% convinced that there were such weapons, but they had 0% knowledge of where these weapons were. I am not suggesting that governments should ignore information coming from their billion dollar intelligence programs. Such information is indispensable and collected with many means that are not available to U.N. inspectors. However, I think one lesson from the Iraq war is that we should pay equal attention to the results of multimillion dollar international reports that are based on extensive professional inspections on the ground. In 2003, the alliance of willing states did not do that. After the war it was reported that I and several others in New York had had our offices bugged during this period. If I was bugged, as I find very likely, I regret that those listening in did not pay more attention to what I had to say. FAREED ZAKARIA: 5 lessons of the Iraq War . Fortunately, enough states did listen, and the U.N. Security Council was saved from green-lighting a war that was justified by false evidence. The political leaders who have been criticized as responsible for launching the war on false premises have asserted that they acted in good faith, and that interrogation of leading Iraqis showed that the regime planned to revive its weapons program as soon as sanctions disappeared. I am not questioning the good faith of the political leaders, but rather their poor judgment in bringing war and death to a country on flimsy grounds. On February 11 -- less than five weeks before the invasion -- I told U.S. national security adviser Condoleezza Rice I wasn't terribly impressed by the intelligence we had received from the U.S., and that there had been no weapons of mass destruction at any of the sites we had been recommended by American forces. Her response was that it was Iraq, and not the intelligence, that was on trial. ARWA DAMON: Iraq suffocates in cloak of sorrow . And during a telephone chat with Tony Blair on February 20, I told the British prime minister that it would be paradoxical and absurd if a quarter of a million troops were to invade Iraq and find very little in the way of weapons. He responded by telling me intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted his weapons of mass destruction program. At any rate, whatever view one took of the evidence of weapons, no one could believe in 2003 that prostrate Iraq was a threat to any other state. I cannot judge whether Iraqi prisoners were sincere when they talked about Saddam Hussein's intentions to revive weapons programs after the end of sanctions. They might have said what they thought their Western interrogators wanted to hear. Either way, the risk of a revived weapons program was remote and hypothetical -- and the U.N. foresaw a system of reinforced monitoring to continue in Iraq and to provide an alarm bell even after a lifting of sanctions. The most important lesson of the Iraq War, I think, has been that an overconfidence in military power has been replaced by an understanding that there are severe limitations on what can be achieved by military means. OPINION: Media's failure on Iraq still stings . Intervening swiftly with arms and crippling strikes might be easy for a great power, but achieving desired political aims is another matter and exiting may be hard -- the phrase ""If you break it, you own it"" comes to mind. Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq have been long and costly engagements with very mixed results. Since then prudence has held the U.S. back in the case of Libya and so far in Syria. Another important lesson is that today armed  international interventions are likely to be condemned by much of the world unless they are clearly  in self-defense or have been authorized by the Security Council. Iraq was neither. Unless we remember this going forward, I fear there is nothing stopping this kind of tragedy from being repeated.","Blix: Lead-up to war shows we must rely on international inspectors' reports .

"Chad Pregracke, an Illinois man who has dedicated his life to cleaning the Mississippi River and other U.S. waterways, is the 2013 CNN Hero of the Year. Pregracke organizes community cleanups across the country through his nonprofit, Living Lands & Waters. About 70,000 volunteers have pitched in, helping Pregracke collect more than 7 million pounds of trash in the past 15 years. ""The garbage got into the water one piece at a time,"" Pregracke said earlier this year. ""And that's the only way it's going to come out."" Pregracke was recognized during Sunday night's airing of ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" along with the rest of this year's top 10 CNN Heroes -- everyday people doing extraordinary things to help change the world. He was chosen as Hero of the Year through a five-week public vote on CNN.com. ""I'll just keep on cleaning up America's rivers and loving every minute of it,"" said Pregracke when he accepted the award. For being named CNN Hero of the Year, Pregracke receives $250,000 to continue his work. That is in addition to the $50,000 that each Hero receives for making the top 10. During the show, Pregracke pledged to spread some of his Hero of the Year money to the rest of the top 10 Heroes: ""I've met so many great people today, the other Heroes, and I'm really moved by all their stories and all the things they do around the world. ... I'm going to give 10 grand to each of them, because they're awesome."" Pregracke, 38, grew up in East Moline, Illinois, where the Mississippi River was in his backyard. As a teenager, he worked as a commercial shell diver and began to notice the heaps of debris in the fabled waterway, which supplies drinking water to 18 million people in more than 50 U.S. cities. ""I saw thousands of barrels, thousands of tires, cars, trucks and tops of school buses. ... I got sick of seeing it and just wanted to do something about it,"" said Pregracke, whom some have called ""the rivers' garbageman."" For nine months out of the year, Pregracke lives on a barge with members of his 12-person crew. They go around the country with a fleet of boats, and they try to make cleanup fun for the volunteers who show up in each city. They use skits, music and mock motivational speeches to get the volunteers amped up, and sometimes they even do a little karaoke. Teams also compete to see who can find the ""best"" garbage. ""We do everything in our power to get people excited about it,"" Pregracke said. ""We want people to leave feeling good about what they did so they'll come back."" Close to 90% of what they recover is recycled; Pregracke said the rest gets disposed of properly. In addition to the river cleanup, Pregracke has launched a floating classroom barge where his staff educates high school students and teachers about the damages of pollution on river ecosystems. In 2007, his nonprofit implemented a program to plant 1 million trees along river shorelines to protect and restore the natural environment. The group is halfway to its goal. Pregracke says his nonprofit has already held more than 700 cleanups on 23 rivers, but he says he's just getting started. He views his work as a different kind of service to the country. ""A lot of people call me a conservationist or an environmentalist, but the thing is I'm no different than anybody else,"" he said. ""I just want to be known (as) a hardworking American."" This is the seventh year CNN has conducted its annual search for CNN Heroes. In those years, the campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com. This year's top 10 were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN. In addition to receiving $50,000, each will also receive free organizational training from the Annenberg Foundation, a leading supporter of nonprofits worldwide. The Heroes will participate in a customized version of the Annenberg Alchemy program, which offers practical guidance to help strengthen organizations for long-term success. Here are the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013, in alphabetical order: . Dale Beatty: Making life easier for disabled veteransAfter Dale Beatty lost his legs in the Iraq war, his community thanked him for his service by helping him build a home. To pay it forward, Beatty co-founded Purple Heart Homes, which has helped build or modify homes for dozens of disabled U.S. veterans. ""We wouldn't leave someone behind on the battlefield,"" Beatty said. ""Why would we do it at home?""Read Beatty's story . Georges Bwelle: Bringing health care to the jungleFor decades, Georges Bwelle watched his father suffer, unable to get the medical attention he needed. Now a doctor, Bwelle travels into the jungles of his native Cameroon nearly every weekend, providing free medical care for those who don't have access to good health care. ""To make people laugh, to reduce the pain, that's why I'm doing this,"" he said.Read Bwelle's story . Robin Emmons: Creating an oasis in a 'food desert'More than 72,000 people in Charlotte, North Carolina, lack access to fresh produce. When Robin Emmons discovered this problem, she took action. ""I decided to rip up my whole backyard and make it all a garden for people in need,"" she said. Since 2008, Emmons has grown more than 26,000 pounds of fruits and vegetables for area residents.Read Emmons' story . Danielle Gletow: Granting wishes for foster kidsFoster children don't often get the things other children do, but Danielle Gletow is trying to help change that. She posts their wishes online so the public can help grant them. ""I'm here to be the mom to all these kids who might not feel like they have one,"" she said. Since 2008, her group has helped grant more than 6,500 wishes in 42 states.Read Gletow's story . Tawanda Jones: Giving kids a way off deadly streetsTawanda Jones is using dance to empower the youth of Camden, New Jersey, one of the poorest cities in the country. Through Jones' drill team program, at least 4,000 children have learned discipline, respect and community service -- and all of them have graduated high school. ""We need to take back our city and, most importantly, take back our youth,"" Jones said.Read Jones' story . Richard Nares: Helping sick kids get to chemoFor many children fighting cancer, it can be extremely tough to make it to their chemotherapy appointments. But Richard Nares started a group that gives them transportation and support. ""No child should miss their cancer treatment due to lack of transportation,"" said Nares, who lost his son to leukemia in 2000.Read Nares' story . Kakenya Ntaiya: Educating girls for the first timeKakenya Ntaiya is inspiring change in her native Kenyan village. After becoming the first woman in the village to attend college in the United States, she returned to open the village's first primary school for girls.

"The measles outbreak that began when unvaccinated Amish missionaries traveled to the Philippines has more than doubled in size in 10 days, Ohio health officials reported Friday. At least 155 people have caught the highly contagious respiratory disease, according to the Ohio Department of Health. That's up from 68 infected as of May 13. This is not unexpected, said Melanie Amado, public information officer for the Ohio Department of Health. ""We believe people are still getting exposed,"" she said. ""It happens in spurts.""  The incubation period for measles -- meaning how long the virus can stay in the body without producing symptoms -- is up to 21 days. Amado said the number of cases had slowed down, but then picked up to about 20 cases per day this week. So far all the cases are within the Amish community and have been contained to six Ohio counties. Ohio health officials said some patients have been hospitalized, but most have recovered on their own. Measles is a highly contagious disease that causes fever, runny nose, reduced appetite and rash. It can cause severe illness and death in some people, and is easily preventable through vaccination. The measles outbreak began with a group from Christian Aid Ministries, who went on a mission to the Philippines earlier this year. Philippines is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20,000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation. All the affected counties, plus a neighboring county, are offering measles vaccine clinics to help those who want to get vaccinated. Amado said those in the Amish community who have declined to be vaccinated are being asked to try to quarantine themselves at home to reduce the spread of the disease. There have been 15 measles outbreaks in the United States so far during 2014. ""This year represents the highest number of cases reported in the United States during this time period in 18 years,""  Dr. Greg Wallace, head of measles activities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an e-mail. Ten years ago there were 37 measles cases in the United States, the lowest number since 2000, when the disease was considered eliminated in this country. The highest number of cases since then was 220 in 2011. The CDC is reporting a total of 216 cases in 18 states from January 1 to May 16. This week's numbers, including the latest tally from Ohio, will not be verified and compiled by the CDC until next week. 5 things to know about measles .","Ohio measles outbreak grows to 155 cases, state health officials say .

"They know your name, your phone number, where you live, your buying habits and, in many cases, what you are interested in buying -- sometimes even before you do. Meet Acxiom, sometimes described as ""the biggest company you've never heard of."" But they've heard a lot about you. Acxiom is one of the largest data-brokering firms in the world. It is just one of hundreds of companies who are peering into your personal life, collecting data that is generated from everything you do online, and much of what you do in the real world. The company recorded $1.1 billion in sales last year offering ""analytical services"" on 144 million households. And that's just a fraction of the evolving -- some say loosely regulated -- big-data industry.  Data is now a $300 billion-a-year industry and employs 3 million people in the United States alone, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. Acxiom Chief Executive Officer Scott Howe agreed to speak with CNN in his first television interview since taking the top job at the company a year ago.  The former Microsoft executive wants to ""demystify"" what companies like Acxiom do and how they collect information. ""Companies like Acxiom are trying to get intelligent about what you might be interested in and who you are. Such that we can deliver more relevant advertising to you, and we can deliver offers and products and services in which you might have interest,"" Howe told CNN. ""All the information we collect and utilize is secure, appropriate, and legal."" Howe said Acxiom's clients range from small businesses to large Fortune 500 companies. He envisions ""Big Data"" companies helping consumers by helping to eliminate the spam that clogs our inboxes and the ads that clutter websites. ""I don't think there is a person in the world who wouldn't agree that data generates tremendous value for both people and for businesses,"" he said. Howe said he believes his company's marketing platform has a dramatic impact on the economy, both for consumers and for businesses. ""I get access to free content, relevant offers.  Advertising is more like education, all useful and relevant,"" Howe said. He said this detailed marketing information is critical in breathing success into business. ""We collect things like contact information, demographics and your preferences on things. And we'll aggregate that information to try to discern a picture of what people want,"" Howe explains. Critics of data-brokering companies say that the average consumer has no idea that their intimate personal details are up for sale on these sites. They argue that having this information one click away could be a privacy risk. ""The other side of the coin is that important decisions are being made about you, the real you, based on the virtual 'you' that's made up of all this data,"" said Sarah Downey, a privacy analyst with Abine.com, an online-privacy company based in Boston. ""Decisions like your credit score, your insurance rates, or even if you get a job. And these things are serious, they have serious import in people's lives and sometimes they are wrong."" There are hundreds of companies specializing in collecting marketing data and creating profiles of millions of consumers across the country. But unlike the national Do Not Call List, which gives consumers a one-stop location to have their telephone numbers removed from telemarketing databases, data marketing does not have a universal opt-out system. Abine.com created a subscription service called ""Delete Me"" that removes people's information from the web. For $99 per year, they will coordinate to remove all of your information from data-broker sites. It's a tremendous amount of work because each data broker site has a different procedure to remove personal information: phone calls, e-mails, faxes, and/or certified letters. And many times these companies require users to submit more personal information just to opt out. Don Jackson, a security researcher for Dell SecureWorks, warns that data mining could open the door to hacking, identity theft and stalking. ""I don't think anybody is being intentionally malicious, but from a security standpoint you want to know how the data is being used, Jackson said.    ""That information becomes powerful at that point, and it can be misused. We have seen cases where just basic information, just very few pieces from social networks, can lead predators to potential victims, for example. That's a common scenario, actually."" Currently, there is no comprehensive federal regulation for data brokers. Last March, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report on protecting consumer privacy in which they recommended that Congress consider legislation overseeing online privacy, data security and breach notification, and data brokers. President Barack Obama has said updates to U.S. laws are urgently needed to keep pace with the many threats that Americans face in cyberspace.  But the Senate's most recent cybersecurity legislation stalled this summer on a procedural vote. Howe says Acxiom supports effective regulation, and that his was the first data-brokering company to employ a chief privacy officer.

"It's the war that never really ended -- leaving the Korean peninsula splintered in 1953. The brutal war that raged 60 years ago killed more than two million Koreans, separated thousands of families, and created the world's most heavily fortified border. It also drew the alliances that exist today. The armistice agreement that ended the war is a truce, rather than a peace treaty. Starting on Tuesday, North Korea threatened to dismantle the armistice, as it has done so in the past. In 2009, North Korea said its military would no longer be bound by the agreement because South Korea was joining a U.S.-led anti-proliferation plan. In 2003, Pyonyang's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) announced that it may have ""no option"" but to stop honoring the armistice because of the United State's ""persistent war moves."" This time, KCNA declared that come March 11, North Korean forces will ""completely declare invalid"" the armistice agreement, because ""the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces"" have violated it. It cited joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises as ""an open declaration of a war"" and slammed the countries using its trademark colorful language. ""The U.S. is, however, working with bloodshot eyes to swallow up the DPRK (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's official name), not content with having incurred the pent-up grudge of the Korean people which can never be settled. What matters is that the South Korean puppet forces steeped in worship and sycophancy toward the U.S. are dancing to its tune,""  KCNA said. The latest flare-up stems from tougher sanctions passed in the U.N. Security Council against North Korea in response to its nuclear test on February 12. Pyongyang carried out its third nuclear test, despite international condemnation. Here's a look into the tension between the Koreas and why a Cold War conflict still affects global dynamics. Causes . For most of the first half of the 20th century, Japan controlled the Korean peninsula as its colony. By the end of the World War II as Japan neared defeat, the allies agreed to an independent Korea. The United States and Soviet Union divided postwar occupation of Korea along the 38th parallel and the two sides were ideologically opposite. To the north was Kim Il-Sung, the grandfather of North Korea's current leader, Kim Jong-un. As a communist guerrilla leader, Kim Il-Sung had trained in Moscow and resisted Japanese rule in Korea and Manchuria. With revolutionary credentials, he was favored by the Soviets. In the south, a separate election in 1948 brought Rhee Syng-Man, a U.S.-educated independence advocate who was intensely anti-Communist, as the first president of the Republic of Korea. Both Rhee and Kim wanted to unify the peninsula under their respective governments. Tensions festered between the two sides, backed by their respective superpower allies. How the war broke out . On June 25, 1950, a surprise attack by North Korean soldiers who crossed the 38th parallel easily overwhelmed South Korean forces. The United States leapt to the defense of the South. As South Korean, U.S. and U.N. forces fought back and gained ground into North Korea, Chinese forces joined the war on the North's side later that year. The fighting continued until the signing of the armistice in July 1953. The terms of the armistice included the creation of the Demilitarized Zone, a heavily fortified 155-mile long (250 kilometers) 2.5-mile wide line separating the two countries. The toll of the war included about 1.2 million deaths in South Korea, 1 million deaths in North Korea, 36,500 deaths for U.S. troops and 600,000 deaths for Chinese soldiers. The Korean rivalry . Immediately after the war, the North became economically prosperous with the backing of the Soviet Union. However, as the USSR collapsed in the 1990s, so did the North Korean economy and the rice rations distributed to its people disappeared. A famine in the 1990s is believed to have killed as much as 10 percent of the population. In stark contrast, South Korea had a turbulent start after the war with autocratic leadership and struggled as one of the poorest economies in the world. But the country's economy gained ground in the late 1960s, which is now heralded as a model for economic miracles. It now ranks as the fourth largest economy in Asia. President Park Chung Hee was one of the founders of modern Korea who took power after a coup d'etat and ruled with a heavy hand for 18 years before his assassination in 1979. Some in South Korea regard him as the cornerstone of the country's present prosperity; others view him as a dictator. His daughter, Park Geun-hye became the new president of South Korea last month. She took office with a pledge to keep South Korea safe against the threat of an increasingly hostile North Korea. Tense relationship . In the last 60 years, diplomacy between North and South has zigzagged from conciliatory to bellicose. During more friendly times, the two countries arranged emotional family reunions for those separated by the war in 2000, their leaders shook hands in a 2007 Pyongyang summit and ran freight trains across the border. South Korean president Kim Dae-jung won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for his efforts for ""peace and reconciliation"" with North Korea, although his legacy remains mixed. But periods of rapprochement have been counterpointed by violence, with incidents such as the 1983 bombing that killed members of the South Korean cabinet visiting Myanmar and another bombing in 1987 that blew up Korean Air Flight 858, killing all aboard. Despite investigations that found that North Korea carried out both attacks, the government in Pyongyang has steadfastly denied involvement. More recently, the North shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong leaving two marines and two civilians dead. Pyongyang claimed Seoul provoked the 2010 attack by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the Yellow Sea. That same year, North Korea was also accused of sinking a South Korean warship, killing more than 40 sailors. The incidents caused widespread anger in South Korea. Relations have remained fraught, especially after North Korea's nuclear testing last month, which the South Korean government has denounced as ""an unforgivable threat to the Korean peninsula's peace and safety."" China, a long-standing ally to North Korea since the war, backed the UN resolution for more sanctions against the nation. The sanctions target uranium enrichment and luxury goods -- aimed at North Korea's ruling elite. China has previously resisted strong sanctions on the Kim regime, which it supports economically. In a Financial Times editorial that received significant attention in Asian media, Deng Yuwen, a senior editor of the Study Times, the journal of China's Central Party School, urged China to ""re-evaluate its longstanding alliance with the Kim dynasty."" ""Even if North Korea was a useful friend during the cold war, its usefulness today is doubtful,"" Deng wrote.","A brutal civil war 60 years ago drew the alliances that exist today .

"You have good manners, right? After all, you (usually) keep your elbows off the table and say ""Please pass the salt,"" right? But when you head abroad, things get a little more complicated. Case in point: Rest your chopsticks the wrong way, and you might remind a Japanese friend of their grandmother's funeral (Rule 2). But knowing what the etiquette rules are won't just save you from some awkward situations, says Dean Allen, author of the ""Global Etiquette Guide"" series. It can also help you make friends. ""It's really a statement of your openness and awareness of the fact that the people you're with... may in fact see the world differently,"" he says. ""It's simply going to get you out of the tourist bubble."" Sound good? Then here are 15 rules to keep in mind. Budget Travel: 21 Girl trips you absolutely love . In Thailand, don't put food in your mouth with a fork. Instead, when eating a dish with cooked rice, use your fork only to push food onto your spoon. A few exceptions: Some northern and northeastern Thai dishes are typically eaten with the hands -- you'll know you've encountered such a dish if the rice used is glutinous or ""sticky"". Also, stand-alone items that are not part of a rice-based meal may be eaten with a fork. But, says Leela Punyaratabandhu, a food writer who blogs at SheSimmers.com, the worst thing to do at a traditional, rice-based meal would be to use chopsticks. ""That is awkward and inconvenient at best and tacky at worst,"" she says. In Japan, never stick your chopsticks upright in your rice. Between bites, your chopsticks should be placed together right in front of you, parallel to the edge of the table -- and nowhere else, says Mineko Takane Moreno, Japanese cooking instructor and co-author of ""Sushi for Dummies."" (If there is a chopsticks rest, you use it, putting the tips you've been eating with on the rest.) But sticking them upright in a bowl of rice is even worse: During funerals in Japan, the rice bowl of the deceased is placed before their coffin...with their chopsticks upright in the rice. So what would she rather see: Someone doing that at a meal, or asking for a fork? Mineko doesn't hesitate. ""Asking for a fork,"" she says. Budget Travel: 12 elevators you need to see to believe . In the Middle East, India and parts of Africa, don't eat with your left hand. In South India, you shouldn't even touch the plate with your left hand while eating. That's largely because the left hand is associated with, um, bodily functions, so it's considered to be dirty. In fact, says Allen, don't even pass important documents with your left hand. A lefty? Then it's okay to use your left hand -- as long as you take your right hand out of the game. At a traditional feast in Georgia, it's rude to sip your wine. At what Georgians call a supra (traditional feast), wine is drunk only at toasts. So wait for those... and then down the whole glass at once. On the upside, says Georgia-based photographer and videographer Paul Stephens, the glasses tend to be on the small side. In Mexico, never eat tacos with a fork and knife. Worried about spilling refried beans and salsa all over your front? Tough. Mexicans think that eating tacos with a fork and knife looks silly and, worse, snobby -- kind of like eating a burger with silverware. So be polite: Eat with your hands. In Italy, only drink a cappuccino before noon. Some Italians say that a late-day cappuccino upsets your stomach, others that it's a replacement for a meal (it's common to have just a cappuccino, or a cappuccino and a croissant, for breakfast). Either way, you won't see Italians ordering one in a café at 3pm -- and certainly not after a big dinner. Do so, and you'll be instantly branded a tourist. If you need that coffee fix, though, an espresso is fine. In Britain, always pass the port to the left -- and remember the Bishop of Norwich. It's unclear why passing port on the left is so important; some say it has to do with naval tradition (the port side of a boat is on your left if you're facing the helm). Regardless, passing the decanter to the right is a big gaffe. So is not passing it at all. If you're at a meal and the decanter stalls, then ask the person with it, ""Do you know the Bishop of Norwich?"" If they say they don't know him, reply, ""He's a very good chap, but he always forgets to pass the port."" It sounds weird, but it's true. This is such a nationwide tradition, the Telegraph wrote an article on it. Budget Travel: Can you spot the travel rip-off? In France, don't eat your bread as an appetizer before the meal. Instead, eat it as an accompaniment to your food or, especially, to the cheese course at the end of the meal. That said, one thing that would be a faux pas anywhere else -- placing bread directly on the table and not on a plate -- is perfectly acceptable in France -- in fact, it's preferred. In China, don't flip the fish. Although you might be used to flipping over a whole fish once you've finished one side, don't -- at least when you're in China, especially southern China and Hong Kong. That's because flipping the fish is ""dao yue"" in Chinese, a phrase similar to ""bad luck."" Plus, says Allen, ""to flip the fish over is like saying that the fisherman's boat is going to capsize."" The most superstitious will leave the bottom part untouched, while others will pull off the bone itself to get to the bottom. In Italy, don't ask for parmesan for your pizza -- or any other time it's not explicitly offered. Putting parmigiano on pizza is seen as a sin, like putting Jell-O on a fine chocolate mousse. And many pasta dishes in Italy aren't meant for parmesan: In Rome, for example, the traditional cheese is pecorino, and that's what goes on many classic pastas like bucatini all'amatriciana, not parmesan. A rule of thumb: If they don't offer it to you, don't ask for it. Don't eat anything, even fries, with your hands at a meal in Chile. Manners here are a little more formal than many other South American countries. So while it might be the most practical to just pick up those fries with your fingers, don't do it. ""The greater need is to identify with European culture, so food is [eaten] with a knife and a fork,"" Allen says. In Korea, if an older person offers you a drink, lift your glass to receive it with both hands. Doing so is a sign of respect for elders, an important tenet of Korean culture. After receiving the pour with both hands, you should turn your head away and take a discreet sip, says Stephen Cha-Kim, a Korean-born worker's rights advocate who regularly visits family in Korea. ""To this day, if anybody hands me anything, both hands shoot out instinctively,"" Cha-Kim says. Similarly, don't start eating until the eldest male has done so (and don't leave the table until that person is finished). Budget Travel: The 6 most inspiring travel films of the year . Never mix -- or turn down -- vodka in Russia. The beverage is always drunk neat -- and no, not even with ice. Adding anything is seen as polluting the drink's purity (unless the mixer is beer, which produces a formidable beverage known as yorsh). But there's another faux pas that's even worse, says Allen: when you're offered the drink and you turn it down. Since offering someone a drink is a sign of trust and friendship, it's a good idea to take it. Even if it is 9am. When drinking coffee with Bedouins in the Middle East, shake the cup at the end. Typically, anyone Bedouin -- or Bedouin-related -- will continue to pour you more coffee once you've finished unless you shake the cup, meaning tilting the cup two or three times, when you hand it back. It's such an important tip, says Middle East-based freelance correspondent Haley Sweetland Edwards, that last year, Bedouins she was eating with in Qatar made her practice it until she got it right. In Brazil, play your tokens wisely. At a churrascaria, or a Brazilian steakhouse, servers circle with cuts of meat and diners use tokens to place an order. If a server comes out with something you want, make sure your token, which you'll have at your table, has the green side up. If you don't want any more, flip it with the red side up. Since the meat can be never-ending, it's important to strategize -- if you leave that token green side up you could end up ordering a lot more than you intended.

"Scoop up some soil on Mars, heat it up, cool down the steam and ... slurp, slurp! You've got water! Mars might appear dry as a desert, but astronauts may someday be able to tap its soil to quench their thirst. Research recently published suggests that the soil from the Martian surface contains about 2% water by weight. This is one of several insights emerging from data that the Mars rover Curiosity has been collecting. Five studies in the journal Science were published last week based on data from the rover's first 100 days on the Red Planet. ""The community was surprised that there was a large amount of water trapped in the ... Martian soil,"" said Chris Webster, manager of NASA's Planetary Sciences Instruments Office. Curiosity, representing a $2.5 billion NASA mission, has been on Mars since it made a dramatic landing there August 6, 2012. Earthlings celebrated as the two-ton rover arrived, carrying with it the most sophisticated suite of instruments and cameras to explore the surface of another planet. Thanks to Curiosity, scientists now know more than ever about the composition of the Martian soil. ""It's the first time that the soil has been analyzed at this level of accuracy,"" Webster said. Turning on the faucet . The rover's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument helped scientists probe the soil by heating a sample up to 835 degrees Celsius. The gases that came off included oxygen and chlorine as well as water vapor. Based on the ratio of isotopes within, scientists believe this water is coming from the recent Martian atmosphere. ""If you take about a cubic foot of dirt with the amount of water that we found and heated it up, you could get a couple of pints of water out of that,"" said Laurie Leshin, dean of science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, who led this study. ""It was kind of exciting to me to see that, wow, it would be a significant amount."" More broadly, the analysis gives us new information about the hydrological cycle on Mars, said John Grotzinger, lead scientist on the Curiosity mission. ""Somehow, there's a process on Mars where, even though there are just trace quantities of water in Mars's atmosphere, this noncrystalline material is able to absorb it like a sponge and bind it into its framework,"" Grotzinger said. The technical details about how future astronauts would use the soil as a resource for water haven't been worked out, Webster said. A condenser would be required to cool the water steam into a liquid form after heating up the soil. But from what we know so far, he said, it would be drinkable. ""This is a reservoir for water on Mars that we had not really appreciated before,"" Grotzinger said. More than 100,000 want to go to Mars and not return . Soil types . Scientists are also learning about the diversity of the soil on Mars. Pierre-Yves Meslin, a scientist at Universite de Toulouse in Toulouse, France, and colleagues used data from an instrument that fires a laser to analyze the soil and rock on Mars. It's called the ChemCam Remote Micro-Imager. One main soil type on Mars, they said, is made of fine-grained particles and carries a significant amount of hydrogen. Scientists say this reflects the dust that covers the whole Martian surface. The dust that covers Mars is more akin to a fine sand than the fluffy film on the floors of neglected attics on Earth, Webster said. The other main soil type was coarse and is local to Gale Crater, the area where the rover is exploring. These particles, up to 1 millimeter in size, reflects what rocks in this area are made of. Previous rovers -- Pathfinder, Spirit and Opportunity -- had less sophisticated technology to analyze soil but their insights about the mineral composition of the Martian soil are similar to what Curiosity found, Meslin said. With ChemCam and Curiosity's other instruments, the latest rover can give scientists a deeper understanding of the composition, as well as how this soil was formed. Complications with organics . New scientific insights also present the issue of chemical compounds that may complicate the search for life on Mars. Curiosity is not capable of detecting life directly; it wouldn't confirm either modern life or ancient fossil organisms. It can, however, determine if the ancient environment was habitable -- which the rover told us it was -- and look for organic compounds. Finding those compounds wouldn't prove the existence of life, either, because they can come from other sources. But the appearance of organic molecules would suggest that the environment is good at preserving them. The release of chlorine and oxygen when the rover heated up soil suggests the presence of a chemical called perchlorate, at a 0.5% level in the soil, Leshin said. This substance can destroy organic carbon in a chemical reaction when the rover heats up soil. And so far, Curiosity has not directly detected organics in the soil. Potentially the rover could avoid this problem using alternative techniques, which wouldn't heat the soil so much that perchlorates break down. ""Perchlorate is reacting with some organic compound to produce these simple molecules,"" Grotzinger said. ""It leaves us asking the question: Is this from Mars, or is it something we brought with us? And right now we don't know."" Perchlorate in the planet's abundant dust could present a toxicity problem to humans on Mars; on Earth, it's known to cause thyroid problems, Leshin said. The dust could generally pose a health problem as well -- both physically interfering with respiration and being a chemical hazard. Mars is known to have massive dust storms. ""It's one of the significant concerns to human exploration,"" Webster said. Still no methane . Scientists are interested in whether Mars has methane gas, which could be an indicator of the planet's habitability. About 90% to 95% of the methane in Earth's atmosphere is biologically derived, said Sushil Atreya, a University of Michigan researcher and co-investigator for SAM, said in November 2012. But the rover still has not detected methane gas, as scientists noted in Science earlier in September. Even if there were methane, nonbiological sources such as volcanic activity can produce it. It's still possible that methane will turn up in future measurements, however, Webster said. Studies: Martian atmosphere was destroyed long ago . Where it's going now . Curiosity is about one-fifth of the way to Mount Sharp, its final destination, where it will climb while testing the peak's sedimentary layers that have formed over time. Mount Sharp is 3.4 miles high, and its rock layers represent a series of chapters of the planet's history and the environmental conditions present in various eras. Along the way, the rover stopped at a location called Waypoint 1, where scientists found a conglomerate rock that would have been found in an ancient stream bed. The rock with the pebbles has strange veins, filled with material that scientists don't quite understand. ""The implication of that is that again we're seeing the involvement of water, and it looks like this water was very widespread across the landing area,"" Grotzinger said. It appears that the river would have extended from the rover's landing site all the way to Waypoint 1. The entire area that Curiosity has been driving across would have been covered by a stream bed, at one point or another, in the ancient history of Mars. Curiosity isn't the only moving human-made object on Mars. The Opportunity rover, which launched in 2004, is still chugging along. In 2020, NASA plans to send an even more advanced rover to ""explore and assess Mars as a potential habitat for life, search for signs of past life, collect carefully selected samples for possible future return to Earth, and demonstrate technology for future human exploration of the Red Planet."" NASA recently announced a competition for proposals of what instruments the 2020 rover could carry. It, too, may get humans closer to drinking water, and possibly even showering, on Mars.

"Momentum appears to be building for a breakthrough deal on Iran's nuclear program, with top diplomats flocking to the site of ongoing talks. Hours after a Western official said a deal could be reached ""as soon as tonight,"" discussions ended Friday night, a senior U.S. State Department said. They are set to resume Saturday morning. By that point, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Secretary William Hague should both be in Geneva. They'll have company in the form of French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who headed to the Swiss city Friday night according to an European Union diplomatic source, and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, according to his ministry's website. They all join Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov as well as EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, who have been the key players in the latest round of discussions. Together, these diplomats represent all five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council plus Germany -- together known as the P5+1 -- which has been negotiating with Iran about their nuclear program. The hastily rearranged plans indicate that these Geneva talks are continuing past their scheduled conclusion Friday, though the hopes clearly go beyond just talking. After talking to Ashton and the U.S. negotiating team, Kerry ""made the decision to travel here with the hope that an agreement will be reached,"" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said. The Western powers have been working toward an agreement to roll back Iran's suspected march toward a nuclear weapon. On the other side, Tehran has been looking for loosening of the economic sanctions that are strangling its economy. Zarif said Friday there is wide agreement except for a couple of points, the semi-official Iranian Students News Agency reported. ""It should become clear today if we want to reach to a conclusion in the ongoing round of talks or further negotiation events are needed,"" Zarif said, according to ISNA. ""Numerically speaking, perhaps 90% of progress has been made, but there (are) one or two issues which are of great significance."" A major sticking point to an agreement has been Iran's right to enrich uranium, officials involved in the discussions said. Iran wants the explicit right to do so to be part of the deal -- which would likely extend six months and ideally be a precursor to a more sweeping pact -- diplomats told CNN. Western powers, on the other hand, prefer ambiguity on this matter: They don't want that point written into the agreement, but if Iran states its right to enrich uranium, the West won't dispute it, the diplomats said. Talks in context . The latest round of talks comes as a change of leadership in Iran has changed that country's priorities. President Hassan Rouhani, who was elected earlier this year, has made lifting tough economic sanctions against his country a priority. During a visit to the U.N. General Assembly in September, Rouhani's moderate diplomatic approach raised hopes in the West of a thaw in relations with Tehran and progress in negotiations on its nuclear program. Despite the sanctions against it, Iran today has 19,000 centrifuges and is building more advanced ones, according to Mark Hibbs, a nuclear policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. At the same time, the sanctions have crippled Iran's economy. Most world powers believe Iran is realistically at least a year away from building a nuclear weapon, Hibbs said. Iran insists it seeks to use nuclear power only for peaceful purposes. The international community led by Israel, the United States, France and others demands that Tehran dismantle its ability to enrich uranium and other technology needed to develop nuclear weapons. Iran recently signed a deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency that agrees to give the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency access to long-unseen nuclear sites, including a heavy-water reactor in Arak. Controversial approach . Rouhani's new approach has helped bring the parties back to the table, but any deal will have its critics. Israel, the United States' closest ally in the region, staunchly opposes the tentative plan. ""It's a bad deal -- an exceedingly bad deal,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told CNN this week. Netanyahu opposes lifting some sanctions now without getting further concessions to ensure Iran would be unable to continue with uranium enrichment and other steps. Some U.S. lawmakers aren't sold on the new plan. On Tuesday, a bipartisan group of six senators urged the administration to reject the proposed deal with Iran and accept only an agreement that better dismantles Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons. But President Barack Obama said the current sanctions put in place during his administration had forced Iran to the negotiating table because of economic contraction and frozen oil revenue. He said the proposed deal would ""open up the spigot a little bit"" on some of the frozen revenue while leaving in place the bulk of the most effective sanctions involving Iranian oil exports and banking. But Obama also stressed that all options, including military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, remained on the table as far as the United States was concerned. U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice said the plan would benefit the global community. ""The international community would have unprecedented access to Iran's nuclear facilities and full transparency into what they're doing, so they wouldn't have the ability to sneak out or break out,"" Rice said.","Official: Talks end for the night, will resume Saturday morning .

"Among chief executives, Steve Jobs was an outlier. CEOs of public companies are generally hands-on, but Jobs was involved in practically every detail, from determining which industries Apple should invade to the material used for the iPhone's screen. Jobs even got directly involved in customer service, which was a part of Apple's business for which he exercised a great deal of attention and patience. He fielded e-mails about broken laptops and intervened on support calls. By comparison, a representative for AT&T, Apple's longtime carrier partner for the coveted iPhone, threatened a customer, who had twice e-mailed company CEO Randall Stephenson complaining about price hikes, with a cease-and-desist notice. ""I don't think even Steve Jobs can spin 2 GB for $25/month as a good thing for the consumer,"" the customer, Giorgio Galante, wrote in his recap, as reported by Wired, which is a CNN.com content partner. Unlike other leaders, Jobs was not only handling an unusual number of his company's own basic customer service inquiries, but he also fielded some of Stephenson's, since AT&T and Apple were conjoined on various business interests relating to the iPhone and iPad. When a customer asked Jobs via e-mail in 2008 why BlackBerry owners could tether their phones to their computers for wireless Internet access but the same could not be done with an iPhone, Jobs wrote, ""We agree, and are discussing it with ATT."" The feature eventually came. Asked about tethering an iPhone to an iPad on AT&T, Jobs replied only, ""No."" Jobs consoled another AT&T customer, Mark Trapp, who expressed his frustration over his cell carrier's plans to discontinue unlimited data plans. ""I think its (sic) going to work out just fine for almost all customers. Try it,"" Jobs wrote, but he was less supportive in a message to another customer, Dennis Wurster, about the same matter: ""It's between you and ATT."" Steve's proclivity for responding to e-mails, and the reputation that came with that, made his inbox a prominent target for customers looking to overstep rows of supervisors to get broken computers replaced and generous credit for service outages. This approach intensified as his legendary reputation and Apple's customer base grew. Apple took notice and repurposed the messages to be used as data points for internal use, evidenced by a graph charting customer complaints about the ill-fated Internet service, MobileMe. Long before that, however, Jobs was extraordinarily embedded in handling customer complaints. On October 11, 1999, not long after Jobs returned to a dying company and took on the title of interim CEO (or iCEO), he fielded an inquiry from a customer named David about iBook laptop shortages. ""We are doing the best we can with a limited supply (which is finally now increasing). Please remember that some of the first pre-orders came from CompUSA,"" Jobs wrote. Dozens of stories have floated around the Web about the times when an e-mail to Jobs yielded a phone call from an executive support team and an outcome that far exceeded reasonable expectations. In 1999, a customer got his G4 Tower desktop repaired after an e-mail to Jobs resulted in a phone call from the mysterious Executive Relations team. In 2001, a student software developer was told by Apple support that, despite his sob story about dropping the hard drive connected to his laptop causing damage, they couldn't resolve an issue that resulted from physical abuse. After writing to the CEO, he got a call from one of Jobs' associates who asked him several questions and then tempered his expectations by saying similarly that he did not meet the standards for a comped repair. But a month passed after he took his computer in for repairs, and there was still no charge from Apple. The customer recalled on an Internet message board: ""I contacted the support people, and they said the charges had been waived by 'someone higher up.' Uncle Steve must be smiling on me."" Jobs would not always grant customers' wishes, and he certainly did not buy into the adage that ""the customer is always right."" For example, a customer complaining about Apple not honoring its warranty for his computer received the following response from Jobs in 2008: ""This is what happens when your MacBook Pro sustains water damage. They are pro machines and they don't like water. It sounds like you're just looking for someone to get mad at other than yourself."" Jobs didn't often pick up the phone to go back and forth with customers, but at least one Apple customer, Scott Steckley, recalls a time when an e-mail to Jobs, explaining how there seemed to be no end in sight to his wait for a computer repair, was met with a phone call. ""Hi Scott, this is Steve,"" Steckley recalled hearing from the other end of the phone. ""Steve Jobs?"" he asked. ""Yeah,"" Jobs said. ""I just wanted to apologize for your incredibly long wait. It's really nobody's fault. It's just one of those things."" ""Yeah, I understand."" Then Jobs explained that he expedited the repair. ""I also wanted to thank you for your support of Apple,"" Jobs said. ""I see how much equipment you own. It really makes my day to see someone who enjoys our products so much and who supports us in the good times and bad.""","Apple's Steve Jobs sometimes fielded customer service inquiries by e-mail .

"ISIS, a top intelligence official said more than a year ago, has ""ruthlessly grown in effectiveness."" In October a senior administration official said the terror group represented ""a major and increasing threat"" -- to the region and the United States. Eight months ago, the military's top intelligence official warned ISIS ""will attempt to take territory."" ISIS threat: Syrian town fears massacre . Those were the public assessments of ISIS coming from President Barack Obama's own administration dating back more than a year. So why is the President saying now his intelligence agencies misjudged the terror group, currently being pummeled by U.S. and coalition airstrikes? In an interview with ""60 Minutes,"" Obama admitted the U.S. ""underestimated what had been taking place in Syria"" that allowed the country to become ""ground zero for jihadists around the world."" He cited his director of national intelligence James Clapper, who told the Washington Post in mid-September the U.S. ""underestimated ISIL [the government's name for ISIS] and overestimated the fighting capability of the Iraqi army."" CNN exclusive: ISIS fighter says U.S. airstrikes aren't effective . Those remarks echoed Obama's own statement from early August, when he told reporters ""intelligence estimates"" hadn't accurately predicted ISIS' advances through Iraq and Syria. In remarks and testimony, however, U.S. officials have been warning of ISIS' rise going back more than a year -- while at the same time warning of the limited intelligence-gathering capacity inside the countries where ISIS was expanding. Obama subtly pushes back against Clinton, Panetta on Syria . The warnings extend as far back as July 2013, when David Shedd, then acting as deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told a conference that al Qaeda-affiliated groups were gaining strength in Syria. ""It is very clear over the last two years they have grown in size, grown in capability and ruthlessly grown in effectiveness,"" he said at a CNN-sponsored panel at the Aspen Security Forum. ""They will not go home when it is over. They will fight for that space. They are there for the long haul."" Since then, officials have warned that ISIS wasn't going anywhere -- including in October, when a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call that the danger from ISIS was intensifying. ""This is really a major and increasing threat to Iraq's stability ... and it's an increasing threat to us,"" said the official, who was previewing a visit to Washington by then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki. Next step: Keeping anti-ISIS coalition together . The warning had ramped up by February, when the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency told lawmakers ISIS was looking to gain ground. ""[Al Qaeda in Iraq/ISIL] probably will attempt to take territory in Iraq and Syria to exhibit its strength in 2014, as demonstrated recently in Ramadi and Fallujah, and the group's ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in Syria,"" Mike Flynn wrote in prepared testimony for the Senate Armed Services Committee. The terror groups, Flynn wrote, had ""exploited the permissive security environment to increase its operations and presence in many locations and also has expanded into Syria and Lebanon to inflame tensions throughout the region."" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday that Obama wasn't blaming his intelligence services when he said they ""underestimated"" ISIS. ""The way that I would describe it is that everybody did; that everybody was surprised to see the rapid advance that ISIL was able to make from Syria across the Iraqi border and to be able to take over such large swaths of territory in Iraq did come as a surprise,"" Earnest said. He added it was also difficult to assess ahead of time how well Iraqi security forces would be able to defend their own country because of the sectarian divisions in Iraq's government. He admitted there was some doubt that the forces would fend off ISIS's incursions. ""And I think that proved to be true in the end that ISIL was able to make significant gains because of the Iraqi security forces weren't able to withstand their advance,"" Earnest said.","Top officials have long been warning about the threat posed by ISIS .
President Obama said the U.S. ""underestimated"" the group's rise in Syria .

"Prominent Chinese-Australian artist Guo Jian has been detained by Chinese authorities ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen crackdown, according to friends. His arrest came soon after the artist was profiled in a Financial Times article, which featured his latest installation -- a diorama of Tiananmen Square covered in ground meat. In the article, Guo was highly critical of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) actions during the 1989 incident, in which he served in the late 1970s. Guo was taken from his home in eastern Beijing on Sunday night, and contacted friends by text message to let them know that he had been arrested. Friends contacted by text message . Artist Melanie Wang told the Sydney Morning Herald she called Guo after receiving a text message and he told her he'd been taken to a detention center. He said officers said he'd be released in 15 days. Guo was an active participant in the 1989 demonstrations, which lasted weeks and culminated in PLA troops opening fire on a largely student crowd which had occupied the central Beijing landmark. Guo, it was revealed in the FT's ""Lunch with the FT"" article, published on May 30, also took part in a hunger strike at the time of the student protests. Another of Guo's friends told CNN he phoned the artist Sunday night to talk about the FT article. After receiving no answer, the artist sent a message back, saying that he was ""with police"" and then a following SMS saying, ""don't call me."" Following this, the friend received another message, this time in Chinese, saying he had gone to Tongzhou police station, near the Songzhuang art colony where he lives and works. Protesters march ahead of anniversary . Artwork ""provocative"" ""I would characterize his (new artwork) as somewhat provocative so I assume that, plus the month we are in, and imminent anniversaries, might have had something to do with it,"" the friend said. The person added that Guo was well aware of the risks that creating art of this nature might engender. ""The purpose of the installation was a commemoration of the Tiananmen massacre. He's not naïve about this stuff, he's fully aware of how things can go down."" Prior to finishing the project, Guo asked the friend not to tell anyone about it, for fear that the authorities would stop him from working on it. Australian support . The Australian government released a statement Monday, offering its assistance to the artist, who holds an Australian passport. ""The Australian Embassy in Beijing has contacted Chinese authorities to seek further information on the reported detention of Mr Guo Jian and to underline our strong interest in the matter,"" a spokesperson for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said. ""The Australian Government stands ready to extend all possible consular assistance to Mr Guo."" Amnesty International released a statement Monday condemning Guo's arrest, and noted that detentions have been on the rise in the build up to the 25th anniversary, compared to previous years. Authorities across the country have arrested a number of prominent dissidents and critics of the government ahead of the anniversary of the massacre, which falls on June 4. ""Guo Jian is the latest victim of the Chinese authorities' merciless campaign of repression ahead of the Tiananmen anniversary,"" said William Nee, China Researcher at Amnesty International. ""He along with the scores of others detained for peacefully speaking out about the bloodshed of 1989 must be immediately released."" ""Highest"" levels of freedom . When asked about criticism of China's human rights record, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Hua Chunying previously told CNN that human rights shouldn't been viewed in the ""criteria of the United States."" ""Our society is moving forward, the living standards of people have improved and level of freedoms are at their highest,"" she said. In the FT article, Guo recalled the moment, 25 years ago, when troops opened fire on the Tiananmen demonstrators. ""I didn't believe it, even though I had been a soldier,"" Guo is reported as saying. ""In the army I had never seen that sort of violence. Then I saw the tracers and people falling around me -- they were just gone. I suddenly realised, shit, this was war."" No official count has ever been released, but estimates of the dead in the incident range from hundreds to thousands, most of whom were killed by PLA soldiers.","Artist Guo Jian detained by Chinese authorities .

"We're one of the first generations to have to deal with the torrent of information about things very far removed from our own lives. For most of history, it was extremely difficult to come by information about what was happening anywhere else. And you probably didn't mind. What difference would it make, if you were a crofter in the Hebrides, northern Scotland, to learn that a power struggle was brewing in the Ottoman Empire? Much of what we now take for granted as news has its origins in the information needed by people taking major decisions or at the center of national affairs. We still hear the echoes in the way news is reported; timing is assumed to be critical, as it really would be if we were active agents. If you don't have the latest update you might make a terrible blunder or miss a wonderful opportunity. Ease of communication and a generous democratic impulse mean that information originally designed for decision-makers, now gets routinely sent via the media to very large numbers of people. It is as if a dossier, with the latest news from Kiev, which might properly arrive on the desk of a minister has accidentally been delivered to the wrong address and ends up on the breakfast table of a librarian in Colchester or an electrician in Pitlochry. But the librarian or electrician might quite reasonably turn round and politely point out that they can't do anything with this knowledge and that, surely, the files have come to them by mistake. They don't, but only because habit has closed our eyes to the underlying strangeness of the phenomenon. Every day the news gives us stuff that is both interesting for some people and irrelevant to you. So one reads a very insightful article on the prospects for political reform in Pakistan, meaning that if you were wondering whether Pakistan was a good place to locate a new factory you'd be able to make a better-informed decision. Or there are revelations that tensions in the Cabinet are more serious than previously supposed. So if you were wondering whether this might be a good time to launch your leadership bid, this would be a good piece to read. But otherwise...? The modern idea of news is pleasantly flattering. Yet it's really quite strange. We keep getting information that isn't really for us to know what to do with. No wonder we're sometimes a bit bored. It's not our fault. The news is also rather jealous. It wants to distract you from a private sense of purpose. It would be dangerous if hardly anyone paid attention to what the government was doing, or what was happening to the environment or events in Kiev. But it is not right to go from this to the demand that everyone should be interested in every item at the very moment when the news machine requests their attention. Indeed, we badly need people whose attention is not caught up in the trends of the moment and who are not looking in the same direction as everyone else. We need people scanning the less familiar parts of the horizon. There was a time when a particular country in crisis hadn't reached the headlines, when the approved legislation hadn't even been formulated, when few people were interested in coral reefs... These things had to get going, and to do so, they needed a pool of independent thinkers of a kind who turn today's unpromising themes into tomorrow's mainstream, ""obvious"" topics of interest. Indifference to big banner events can be churlish. But it can also be the mark of deep and important originality. Let's treat the phenomenon of not being interested in some stories with cautious respect. The news wants you to keep reading, but you also know there are times you should stop. The news is the best distraction ever invented. It sounds so serious and important. But it wants you never to have any free time ever again, time where you can daydream, unpack your anxieties and have a conversation with yourself. There are countless difficult things hiding away deep within us which we should give some thought to even though the desperate temptation is to keep clicking and looking. We need news sabbaths. We need long train journeys on which we have no wireless signal and nothing to read, where our carriage is mostly empty, where the views are expansive and where the only sounds are those made by the wheels as they click against the rails. We need plane journeys when we have a window seat and nothing else to focus on for two or three hours but the tops of clouds and our own thoughts. We need relief from the news-fuelled impression that we are living in an age of unparalleled importance, with our wars, our debts, our riots, our missing children, our after-premiere parties, our IPOs and our rogue missiles. We need, on occasion, to be able to rise up into the air, to a place where that particular conference and this particular epidemic, that new phone and this shocking wildfire, will lose a little of their power to affect us -- and where even the most intractable problems will seem to dissolve against a backdrop of the stars above us. We should at times forego our own news in order to pick up on the far stranger, more wondrous headlines of those less eloquent species that surround us: kestrels and snow geese, spider beetles and black-faced leafhoppers, lemurs and small children -- all creatures usefully uninterested in our own melodramas; counterweights to our anxieties and self-absorption. A flourishing life requires a capacity to recognize the times when the news no longer has anything original or important to teach us; periods when we should refuse imaginative connection with strangers, when we must leave the business of governing, triumphing, failing, creating or killing to others, in the knowledge that we have our own objectives to honor in the brief time still allotted to us.","It's of course vital we watch what our government is doing, or what is happening in Kiev, writes Alain de Botton .
However much of the news has little relevance to our lives, and we do not need to know it, he writes .
De Botton: Instead we should honor our own objectives in the brief time still allotted to us ."
"Vice President Joe Biden isn't buying the growing consensus heading into Election Day that Republicans are poised to take control of the Senate. ""I don't agree with the oddsmakers,"" Biden said in an exclusive interview with CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. ""I predict we're gonna ... keep the Senate."" But even if Republicans do win the chamber for the first time in nearly a decade, Biden didn't seem to think the victory would have much impact on the administration's priorities. ""I don't think it would change anything, in terms of what we're about,"" he told Borger. ""We know what we have to get done the last two years.  And -- quite frankly -- going into 2016, the Republicans have to make a decision whether they're in control or not in control. Are they gonna begin to allow things to happen? Or are they gonna continue to be obstructionists?  And I think they're gonna choose to get things done."" Biden's comments come as Republicans appear to have the momentum going into Tuesday's elections. New polls over the weekend showed key races moving in the GOP's favor, especially in Iowa, where Republican Senate candidate Joni Ernst's lead over the Democratic candidate is growing. The vice president has played a crucial role for the administration during this election season, appearing with Democratic candidates across the country at a time when President Barack Obama's popularity is waning. Biden was in Florida this weekend campaigning with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist as part of a trip that also took him to California and Nevada. Biden's rigorous campaign schedule has raised questions about whether he might run for president in 2016, particularly if Hillary Clinton decides to enter the race. Though Biden wouldn't say whether he would run for president, he made clear that he wouldn't base the decision on Clinton's plans. ""That's not the reason not to run or to run,"" he told Borger. ""The question is ... am I convinced I am best positioned of anyone else to lead the country the next four years?"" In the more immediate future, Biden said he didn't see the White House changing how it does business if the GOP wins the Senate majority. ""We have to be more direct and clear about exactly what it is we're looking to do,"" he said. ""And look, we're -- we're ready to compromise."" he said. Biden added: ""I think they're gonna be inclined -- because the message from the people, and I'm gettin' it all over the country, is they're tired of Washington not being able to do anything."" While Biden has traveled to dozens of races this year, Obama has mostly stayed in Washington because many Democrats in tight races did not want him to campaign with them. That, Biden said, is up to individual lawmakers. ""It all gets down to what the specific issues in that-- in that district are, or that state is.  And each senator makes a judgment about whether or not it'll be-- he thinks it's helpful or hurtful,"" he told CNN. One reason Democrats are facing such headwinds this year is because of polls showing voters angry, afraid and mad at Washington. ""The public is concerned and frightened because it's a frightening world.  A lot has happened,"" he responded, pointing out that problems that are eased or resolved -- such as the crisis in Ukraine -- get less attention. So should the public not be worried? ""I think the public should not be as anxious as they are,"" Biden told Borger. ""But it's understandable why they are.  There is no existential threat to the United States right now.  There are fewer than five cases of Ebola in the entire United States of America.  The American public gains confidence in the fact of the way this is being handled; that science does matter."" He went on: ""You look at what's happening with ISIS. ISIS is not an existential threat to something happening to someone in the United States of America.  It's a serious problem overseas but it's confusing and frightening.  And it's totally understandable.  We've gotta figure out-- we, the President and I, have to figure out how to better communicate exactly what's being done.  That's part of the problem.  That's part of the dilemma"" As 2016 chatter intensifies, Biden said he is focused on his job right now. ""There's plenty of time to make that decision,"" he said. ""There really is.  I mean, look, everybody talks about how, you know, everything is gonna be gone by the summer.  And I don't see that at all."" Borger asked where he is in his decision making process. ""I just haven't focused on (it),"" he said. ""I haven't made up my mind what I'm gonna do."" Biden said persistent questions about a possible Clinton campaign don't upset him. ""It really doesn't bother me at all,"" he said. But he has some ideas about what a campaign might look like. ""I mean if I run, I'm confident I will be able to mount a campaign that (is)... gonna be credible,"" he said. ""And I'm gonna be serious.""","Vice President Joe Biden says he doesn't ""agree with oddsmakers"" on the 2014 midterm elections .

"Accra, March 6 1957. Tens of thousands of rejoicing people flood the streets of the city center.  Shouts of ""freedom, freedom"" fill the air as men, women and children sing and dance, celebrating the birth of a new state and the beginning of a new era: an independent Ghana. At midnight on that historic day, Britain's Union Jack was taken down above Parliament House in the capital, replaced by Ghana's new flag -- a black star at the heart of a red, gold and green tricolor. At that moment, to the cheering of an ecstatic crowd, Ghana became the first African country south of the Sahara to break the chains of colonialism. The event triggered a liberation movement that was destined to sweep the entire continent and eventually lead to the demise of colonial rule in Africa. In the years since independence Ghana has navigated tumultuous periods of army rule and political uncertainty. However the West African country is hailed as one of the continent's success stories -- the international community has often lauded Ghana as a beacon of peace and stability while U.S. president Barack Obama called it a ""model for democracy"" in Africa. Rich history . Located on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea, Ghana is a country of more than 25 million people, known for its rich history, cultural heritage and natural beauty. The country is often described as ""Africa for beginners,"" combining long stretches of sandy beaches, lush tropical forests and diverse wildlife. The country takes its name from a great ancient kingdom, situated some 500 miles northwest of the modern-day state, which flourished until the 13th century. Ghana was formerly known as the Gold Coast because of the abundance of the precious metal found there. The first contact with Europeans began in the late 15th century with the arrival of Portuguese sailors and the establishment of direct commercial sea routes with Europe -- mainly as a supplier of gold. Over the following centuries, traders from Britain, the Netherlands and other Europeans countries also joined in, as the focus shifted to the lucrative export of slaves amid a growing demand for labor in the American and Caribbean plantations. During that period, several stone forts and castles were erected along the coast, many of which dot Ghana's shores to this day. Slave forts like Elmina and Cape Coast have become significant historical monuments that attract many visitors, especially people of African descent from the United States . By the latter decades of the 19th century, the British and the Dutch were the only European traders still operating on the coast, while the union of the Ashanti states, centered in the city of Kumasi, became increasingly dominant. In 1874, two years after the final withdrawal of the Dutch and following several hard-fought battles with the Ashanti, the Gold Coast was declared a British colony. Rocky road . After gaining its independence from the UK, Ghana was proclaimed a republic in 1960. One of the first civil engineering projects of the new nation was the Akosombo Dam completed in 1965. It created Lake Volta, one of the world's largest man-made lakes and brought electricity to millions. To this day hydroelectricity accounts for around 85% of the country's electricity generation, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. However in the years that followed independence, the newborn state was hit by severe economic and political troubles. Independence leader Kwame Nkrumah became known as the founding father of Pan-Africanism -- an ideology of African solidarity that spread across the continent and the wider world. He led the country as president until he was toppled by a military coup in 1966 amid growing dissatisfaction over corruption, declining living standards and spiraling foreign debts. Although a general election was successfully held in 1969, Ghana was soon to enter a new period of political uncertainty and economic stagnation that lasted for more than a decade. A series of coups and countercoups began in 1972 and continued until the early 1980s when a former air force second lieutenant called Jerry Rawlings solidified power. Gradually, economic and political conditions in the country improved and Rawlings went on to win two presidential elections in 1992 and 1996. He was replaced by John Kufuor in 2001, in what was the first peaceful transfer of power between democratically elected governments since 1957. John Atta Mills won the 2008 elections and remained president until his death in June 2012. He was immediately replaced by John Dramani Mahama, formerly Ghana's vice president, who was sworn in as the country's new president -- a position he holds to this day after winning the elections on December 7, 2012. Gold, cocoa and oil . Despite its relatively small size, Ghana is today one of Africa's leading countries and one of the few in the continent expected to meet the Millennium Development Goal of halving the poverty rate by 2015. It has one of the fastest growing economies in the continent, driven largely by its rich natural resources and strong agricultural production. Gold and cocoa are both traditionally major sources of foreign currency for the country, while in 2007 economic expectations were raised higher following the discovery of major offshore oil reserves.","Ghana gained independence from Great Britain in March 1957; formerly named Gold Coast .

"(CNN) -- There's a sad irony in the fact that one of the great tests of America's freedom of speech should involve a movie that, according to some reviewers, utterly sucks. Variety calls ""The Interview"" an ""alleged satire that's about as funny as a communist food shortage, and just as protracted."" Yet this ""comedy"" about two TV guys tasked with assassinating North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un has sparked a cyberterror campaign that amounts to extortion. What is being threatened? Well, it started with the leaking of Sony emails by online hackers, which has caused tremendous embarrassment to the company and a little humor for the rest of us. But now hackers claiming to be the ""Guardians of Peace"" -- the group that said it was behind the Sony hack -- seem to have quashed not only the New York premier planned for Thursday, but caused Sony today to announce that it would cancel the film's December 25 theatrical release. The hackers had threatened the lives of cinema-goers and those within the vicinity of theaters, and actively invoked memories of 9/11. Is this assault on artistic license coming directly from the North Korean regime? We don't know. But it should never be forgotten that North Korea has financed terrorism in the past, including the bombing of passenger jets. Why would they take such offense at ""The Interview""? Probably because it goes directly after the image of Kim. North Korea isn't your typical atheist communist dictatorship. It's far more like the religious-nationalist regime of Japan during the Second World War, in which the leader is elevated to the status of a living god. Put it all together and it's understandable why theaters chose to take the hackers seriously and pull the movie. Of course, it would be nice if they could take a stand for freedom of speech, but they have a wider responsibility to the physical safety of the public. The tragedy is that all this fuss isn't about something approaching a serious work of art. But aside from being trashily commercial, modern Hollywood also has a bit of a blind spot when it comes to making movies about bad people overseas. We often see evidence of greedy capitalists on Wall Street, or nasty homegrown Christians attacking gays and lesbians. But serious films about the shocking homophobia of the African continent, anti-religious persecution in China or the obvious evil of North Korea are strangely few and far between. This may well be because the marketing people calculate that something so depressing won't exactly be box office gold. Thus totalitarianism crops up in U.S. cinema either as fantasy (the Empire in ""Star Wars"") or as something to laugh at (""Team America"" also tackled North Korea, albeit with genuine wit). Proof positive of the essentially cowardly nature of Hollywood is that executives reportedly screened the ending of ""The Interview"" for the State Department -- and won official blessing. Perhaps this cyberterrorism will convince Hollywood that there are wicked people beyond their shores and that it is worth making far more intelligent movies about them -- movies that go beyond cartoon stereotypes of East and West and deal with the realities of authoritarianism. Until then, there are so many questions about the consequences of the recent threats: What happens if someone advertises a private screening of ""The Interview""? If Netflix decides to make it available for home users, what would the terrorists threaten to do? If the threats are the offspring of the regime's fetid imagination, perhaps it reveals something about their limited understanding of how the modern world works. In the age of the Internet, you can't easily censor a movie or withdraw it from the public domain. And do they really expect U.S./North Korean relations to hinge on the willingness of Washington to try? There is something depressingly farcical about this whole story. Hopefully, it won't turn violent.","Timothy Stanley: Ironic that test of free speech centers around lousy movie ""The Interview""
He says hackers that may be linked to N. Korea threaten lives of moviegoers -- it's extortion .
He says it makes sense that theaters chose to pull movie for patrons' safety .

"Tacloban, Philippines (CNN) -- As the Philippines faced a long, grim path to recovery in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, the storm plowed into northeastern Vietnam early Monday, packing powerful winds and forcing hundreds of thousands to evacuate. Philippine authorities warned that the typhoon may have killed thousands there, leaving behind a trail of devastation on a scale they'd never seen before. No electricity. No food. No water. Houses and buildings leveled. Bodies scattered on the streets. Hospitals overrun with patients. Medical supplies running out. And a death toll that could soar. The Philippine Red Cross estimates that at least 1,200 people were killed by the storm, but that number could grow as officials make their way to remote areas made nearly inaccessible by Haiyan. Others put the toll much higher: The International Committee of the Red Cross said it's realistic to estimate that 10,000 people may have died nationally. The grim task of counting the bodies was just beginning Monday as authorities sifted through the rubble of what was left behind in hard-hit cities like Tacloban on the island of Leyte. The official toll stood at 255 Monday, according to the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council. ""I have not spoken to anyone who has not lost someone, a relative close to them. We are looking for as many as we can,"" Tacloban Mayor Alfred Romualdez told CNN. Interactive map of the storm . 'This is really, really like bad' Desperately needed aid was making its way into the storm-ravaged city of Tacloban on Monday. C-130 planes arrived, carrying food, water and supplies. Other planes left -- some of them carrying body bags with storm victims. A steady stream of typhoon survivors arrived at Tacloban airport, looking for food, water and escape. Magina Fernandez was among them. She had lost her home and business. And she was desperate to leave on the next military plane. She made an anguished plea for help. ""Get international help to come here now -- not tomorrow, now,"" she said. ""This is really, really like bad, bad, worse than hell, worse than hell."" She directed some of her anger at Philippines President Benigno Aquino III, who on Sunday toured some of the areas hit hardest by the typhoon, including Tacloban. Many of the people in the city, population 200,000, are angry at the authorities' slow response to the disaster. Aquino said there was a breakdown, especially at the local government level. ""They are necessary first responders, and too many of them were also affected and did not report for work,"" he explained, saying that contributed to the slow delivery. Aquino said the government will coordinate with the local units and put more people to work. Supplies become scarce . In Tacloban, the search for food and water led to increasingly desperate efforts. Video showed people breaking into grocery stores and cash machines in the city. National police and the military sent reinforcements to the city Sunday to prevent such thefts. And authorities said they were sending several hundred additional security personnel into the city to keep law and order. Another dire scene played out in the city's only functioning hospital. Doctors couldn't admit any more wounded victims -- there wasn't enough room. Some of the injured lay in the hospital's cramped hallways seeking treatment. ""We haven't anything left to help people with,"" one of the doctors said. ""We have to get supplies in immediately."" Complicating the search efforts is the lack of electricity in many parts of the storm's path. The northern part of Bogo, in the central Philippines, suffered a blackout Sunday, and authorities said it will take months to restore power. Crews search for victims, survivors . Romualdez, Tacloban's mayor, told CNN that reports 10,000 people may have died in Leyte province were ""entirely possible."" ""People here were convinced that it looked like a tsunami,"" he said. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it is fairly realistic to estimate that 10,000 people may have died nationally, because many areas are unreachable by organizations. ""In the western islands of Philippines, for instance, no one can evaluate the casualties,"" said ICRC spokesman David Pierre Marquet. ""It could effectively be a number close to 10,000,"" Marquet told CNN. ""But the notion that 10,000 people are dead in Tacloban alone is not possible."" Aid groups struggle to reach those suffering . The UN's World Food Programme is setting up logistic pipelines to transport food and other relief items. ""The main challenges right now are related to logistics,"" said WFP representative Praveen Agrawal, who returned to Manila from the affected areas on Sunday. ""Roads are blocked, airports are destroyed."" Interactive map of the storm . WFP spokeswoman Bettina Luescher said the U.N. group was gearing up its global resources to send enough food to feed 120,000 people. ""These high-energy biscuits will keep them alive,"" she said. Luescher pleaded for financial support from the international community and directed those wishing to donate to wfp.org/typhoon. ""Those are families like you and me, and they just need our help right now,"" she said. Philippines gets more than its share of disasters . Typhoon makes landfall in Vietnam . The massive losses in the Philippines have put much of Vietnam on edge. Authorities evacuated around 600,000 people from vulnerable areas as the typhoon neared, the Vietnamese government's official online newspaper VGP News reported. Haiyan made landfall around 4 a.m. Monday (4 p.m. Sunday ET) with sustained winds of 120 kph (75 mph) and gusts of 150 kph (93 mph). At least six people were initially reported to have died as a result of the storm, according to VGP. The storm had weakened by the time it hit Vietnam, and it was downgraded to a tropical storm after making landfall. But it's still expected to cause heavy rain and flooding in northern Vietnam and southern China. Tropical cyclones with sustained surface winds of 74 mph or more are known as typhoons when they form west of the international date line. East of the line, they're known as hurricanes. An enormous blow . Haiyan may be the strongest tropical cyclone in recorded history, but meteorologists said it will take further analysis to confirm whether it set a record. The typhoon was 3.5 times more forceful than Hurricane Katrina, which hit the United States 2005. It wasn't the storm's 250-kph (155-mph) gusts that caused most of the damage -- it was a mammoth storm surge that reached up to 5 meters (16 feet) high. ""This disaster on such a scale will probably have us working for the next year,"" said Sandra Bulling, international communications officer for the aid agency CARE. ""Fishermen have lost their boats. Crops are devastated. This is really the basic income of many people.""

"American hikers Josh Fattal and Shane Bauer bounded down the steps of the aircraft that took them from Iran to Oman late Wednesday, rushing into the arms of loved ones who had sought their freedom for more than two years. The pair, released earlier in the day from an Iranian prison, arrived in Muscat, the capital of Oman. Their families and hiker Sarah Shourd -- who was arrested with them but freed last year on medical grounds -- hugged the young men. Shourd is Bauer's fiancee. Before leaving the Muscat airport for an undisclosed location, Fattal and Bauer released brief statements. They took no questions from reporters. ""We're so happy we are free and so relieved we are free,"" said Fattal. ""Our deepest gratitude goes toward his majesty Sultan Qaboos of Oman for obtaining our release. We're sincerely grateful for the government of Oman for hosting us and our families."" Bauer said: ""Two years in prison is too long and we sincerely hope for the freedom of other political prisoners and other unjustly imprisoned people in America and Iran."" The families earlier expressed their joy, relief and gratitude at the pair's release. ""Today can only be described as the best day of our lives,"" they said in a statement. ""We have waited for nearly 26 months for this moment and the joy and relief we feel at Shane and Josh's long-awaited freedom knows no bounds. ""We now all want nothing more than to wrap Shane and Josh in our arms, catch up on two lost years and make a new beginning, for them and for all of us."" President Barack Obama also welcomed the ""wonderful news,"" saying he was thrilled and could not feel happier for the two men's families. He thanked Oman, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and the Swiss government for their assistance. Fattal and Bauer were released earlier Wednesday on bail of $500,000 each and their sentences for spying convictions were commuted, Iran's judiciary said, according to government-run Press TV. The departure of the two from Iran effectively meant the bail money will be forfeited and kept by Iran. The lawyer for Fattal and Bauer, Masoud Shafiee, told CNN the $1 million bail had been paid by the Omani government. Fattal spoke with his brother, Alex, by phone after the release, according to a source familiar with the hikers' release who asked not to be identified. The family has not yet said how long everyone will stay in Oman before heading to the United States. Shourd is no longer wearing an engagement ring Bauer made from a thread from one of his shirts while they were in prison together because she had lost the ring while traveling round the United States working for the release of her fiance and Fattal, said Samantha Topping,  a spokeswoman for the families. Oman's envoy to Tehran, Salem al Ismaily, earlier said in a statement the pair were in the custody of the Omani government and would spend a couple of days in Muscat ""before heading home."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appreciates ""the decision of the Iranian authorities to positively respond to international appeals on humanitarian grounds,"" according to a statement. ""He commends all parties who helped to secure their release."" Fattal and Bauer arrived at Tehran's Mehrabad International Airport late Wednesday in a convoy of diplomatic cars. The convoy had earlier left the country's notorious Evin Prison through the front gates, accompanied by a police escort, but Bauer and Fattal were not visible. Swiss and Omani officials had waited outside the prison to receive the Americans. Switzerland represents U.S. interests in Iran because there is no American embassy there, and Oman has acted as a broker between Washington and Tehran in the past. Oman helped secure the release of Shourd, posting her bail last September, a senior Obama administration official said at the time. The two men's release comes a day before Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is due to speak at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Asked at the United Nations about the news, Ahmadinejad's chief of staff, Esfandiar Mashaei, said: ""Yes, we were expecting their release, us and the president."" High-profile American Muslims including boxing legend Muhammad Ali had called for their release, and a high-profile delegation of American Christian and Muslim religious leaders met Ahmadinejad in Iran last week to plead for their freedom. ""We were very happy to learn about their release today,"" said Nihad Awad, national executive director of the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR), who was part of the delegation to Tehran. ""We are extremely happy for the hikers, their families and the country."" Bauer and Fattal, both 29, were convicted last month of entering Iran illegally and spying for the United States, and each was sentenced to eight years in prison. Their attorney, Shafiee, went into the prison earlier Wednesday with paperwork to show that bail had been paid for each of them. A judge had signed the bail papers that morning after several days of delays. Fattal and Bauer were arrested along with Shourd in July 2009 after apparently straying over an unmarked border between Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran. Bauer and Shourd told their families in May last year that they had gotten engaged in prison and planned to get married after their release. Fattal plans to be best man at the wedding, the hikers' relatives said in a statement at the time. Shourd, in an interview with CNN a year ago, said Bauer had asked her to marry him while they were imprisoned so that they could have something to sustain them through their days in Evin, and give them hope for their future together. Shourd was freed almost exactly a year ago on medical grounds. Her release came a week before Ahmadinejad addressed the U.N. last year. One analyst said the timing last year was no coincidence. ""I think President Ahmadinejad really wanted to use this as a way of building up a store of goodwill just before he comes to New York,"" Columbia University Prof. Gary Sick said last year after Shourd came home. The Americans say they accidentally crossed into Iran when they veered off a dirt road while hiking near a tourist site in the Kurdish region of northern Iraq. They denied the charges and appealed the sentence while serving time in prison. Ahmadinejad said last week that the release of Fattal and Bauer was imminent, setting off a roller coaster ride of expectations. The judiciary shot back that only it could make decisions about their release. An Omani official flew to Iran on September 14 to help work on any negotiation, a Western diplomat told CNN at the time.","U.N. secretary-general appreciates Iranian action .

"Legal scholars expressed little surprise Thursday that the conservative chief justice of the United States -- John G. Roberts Jr. -- proved to be the key vote in upholding the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act. Breaking down the court's decision . ""Had the court ruled as the four dissenters would have had it -- in a 5-4 decision, red versus blue -- that the signature act of a Democratic administration was unconstitutional, I think that would have been a very serious threat to the legitimacy of the court,"" said Timothy S. Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Lexington, Virginia. What the health care ruling means to you . ""I think Americans are already very skeptical about the rule of law in the United States and believe that the court is essentially a third political branch,"" he said in a telephone interview. The 57-year-old Roberts may have been thinking about the court's perceived legitimacy and about his own legacy when he crafted the decision, which couldn't have been an easy one, Jost said. ""I think he probably had to think very long and hard about how to rule in this case,"" the professor said. No matter what it does, high court is seen as political . In 2005, when then-President George W. Bush tapped Roberts to be the 17th chief justice of the United States, then-Sen. Barack Obama voted against his confirmation. During his confirmation hearing, Roberts said he saw his role as a potential justice to make rulings based on the Constitution and not to set policy -- or, as he described it, ""to call balls and strikes, not pitch or bat."" ""I come before this committee with no agenda, no platform,"" he told the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time. ""I will approach every case with an open mind."" Since then, Roberts' stances on campaign finance and affirmative action had led some observers to brand him a judicial activist. Obama: Supreme Court ruling on health care a victory for all Americans . But Neal Katyal, a professor of law at Georgetown University in Washington, said that Roberts, ""more than almost any justice on the court today, appreciates the institutional role of the Supreme Court and American democracy. He's a student of history, and I think today's decision was a really resounding reflection of the chief justice's values, which are (that) law is not just politics and the Constitution is not just politics, and we should think about decisions impartially and dispassionately and come to the right ones."" Katyal, who served in the Justice Department under the Clinton administration, called Thursday's decision ""a resounding victory for the rule of law in America."" Ruling plays into campaign narrative for both sides . ""I wasn't that surprised"" by the decision, said Randy E. Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown who helped write the brief for the National Federation of Business that challenged the law. ""I said from day one that the Supreme Court always bends over backwards to uphold laws of Congress. That's the reason why our fight was always an uphill fight."" The law's ultimate fate, he predicted, will be decided not in any court but at the ballot box in November. ""The people will decide whether they approve of this tax, this so-called tax that has been imposed upon them,"" he said in a telephone interview. And the election may also be about appointing justices who do not bend over backward to uphold the laws of Congress, he said, ""because the Congress cannot be the judge of the scope of its own powers, and we need an independent judiciary to do that."" Regardless of what happens this fall, presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that Roberts himself made a difference with his ruling Thursday -- not only affecting how some view the court, but how they see the chief justice himself. The historian compared Roberts to former Chief Justice Charles Evan Hughes, a former Republican governor and presidential candidate who nonetheless sided with liberal justices -- and Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt -- in finding Social Security to be constitutional. ""Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts has etched himself in history now,"" Brinkley told CNN. ""This, today, showed that Roberts had ... deep thought. He really played the constitutional lawyer and justice here, and I think his stock goes very high."" How the justices voted, what they wrote .

"(CNN) -- Libya is the latest North African country to experience internet trouble as democratic protests continue to sweep the region. The massive Saharan country, long controlled by the dictator Moammar Gadhafi, has suffered ""rolling blackouts"" of its internet connections during the regime's ongoing violent crackdown on protestors, according to the internet traffic monitor Renesys. The cause of these internet service cuts, however, remains uncertain. Possibilities include a government crackdown, an internet traffic overload or simple power outages, said Jim Cowie, Renesys' co-founder. ""If this had happened in any other country I might have said, 'Oh, that's just a provider. Maybe they had a power outage in their data center and their servers wouldn't start up,"" he said. CNN's Ben Wedeman, one of the few independent journalists on the ground in eastern Libya, wrote that ""the electricity was working. The cell phone system is still functioning, though you can't call abroad. The internet, however, has been down for days."" Google's online ""Transparency Report"" shows internet searches from Libya, which is controlled by anti-government demonstrators, have been happening at below-average levels in recent days. And Arbor Networks, a network security company, issued similar findings. International internet traffic to and from Libya was shut down on Saturday morning from about 1 to 8 a.m. and again on Sunday during the same timeframe, according to Renesys' analysis, which was posted on the company's blog and is based on traffic data the company collects from internet service providers around the world. It's almost as if the country had instituted a ""overnight internet curfew,"" Cowie said, adding it's possible that Gadhafi's government wanted to crack down on cyber dissidents who are known to organize online while other people sleep. Reports of wider-spread internet outages could be an indication that Libya is using more sophisticated methods to control the internet, some of which wouldn't be visible to international traffic monitors like Renesys. Iran, for example, is known for shutting down internet traffic at the neighborhood level, or removing capacity from the local internet to the point that local and international Web traffic simply overload the system, Cowie said. ""You remove capacity until everybody is squeezing through a small soda straw,"" he said. Libya's internet blackouts are somewhat similar to those instituted by neighboring Egypt's government during protests in that country. Egypt, however, completely shut down internet access for five days during protests against the regime of Hosni Mubarak, who was forced to resign after 30 years. That move appeared to be an attempt by the government to shut down access to blogs, e-mail, Facebook and Twitter, which were used heavily by some of the people who helped organize the anti-Mubarak protests which toppled his government after 18 days on the streets. Wael Ghonim, a prominent Egyptian protestor, issued a warning to other dictators in the Middle East and North Africa, saying, ""If you want to liberate a society, just give them the internet."" It's unclear how much of a role the internet and social media sites have played in organizing the protests in Libya. The news network Al-Jazeera reports Facebook was used to help coordinate the start of the protests in Libya, which went into full swing on February 17. ""In a country where public dissent is rare, plans for Thursday's protests were being circulated by anonymous activists on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter,"" the news organization writes. ""One Facebook group urging a 'Day of Anger' in Libya, which had 4,400 members on Monday, saw that number more than double to 9,600 by Wednesday."" Some authoritarian regimes restrict internet access, as was the case in Egypt, as a way to try to stay in power. Others, like Syria, China and Russia, filter some websites and use the internet as a way to monitor their citizens and steer public discourse. The internet infrastructure in Egypt and Libya is quite different, Cowie said. ""The key thing to remember is the massive difference in scale between the two countries. Egypt's internet was thousands of prefixes. Libya's internet is about a dozen prefixes,"" he said. An internet prefix is like an online ZIP code. It's a number used to group devices that access the internet. Libya has 13 of these online zip codes out of the 400,000 internet prefixes that make up the entire internet, Cowie said. That makes the country a ""very small corner of a very big universe."" Also of note: Only about 6% of Libyans are on the internet, compared to nearly a quarter of people in Egypt, according to the ITU, an agency of the United Nations that focuses on the internet and communications. CNNMoney: Why Libya can't shut down bit.ly . Libya's access to the international internet is controlled by a single company, which is run by the state, Cowie said. That would make it easier, in theory, for the country to shut down internet connections than it was in Egypt, where the government had to call several internet service providers and order them to cut service as part of emergency law. Meanwhile, as Wired.com reports, a Twitter activist called Arasmus has created a map of the few unconfirmed internet reports that are coming out of Libya.","Libya experiences ""rolling blackouts"" in internet access .

"Former president of Poland, Lech Walesa, was a founder of the Solidarity trade union group that helped bring about about the downfall of communism in Poland in 1989. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and was the country's president from 1990 to 1995. His eponymous Lech Walesa Institute was set up in 1995 to support concepts of independence, ethics and state decentralization. CNN asked him about his recollections from 25 years ago and his thoughts on the future of Poland. CNN: What are you strongest memories from this time 25 years ago? Lech Walesa: I prefer to look at today and tomorrow. Sometimes, however, it's good to take a look back to learn a lesson from the past. There have been so many events with influence on the present time that they form a chain of events reaching back much further than 1989. It all dates back to 1970, when the social discontent reached its peak and forced many of us to take to the streets. Next, we witnessed the election of Karol Wojtyła to the Papacy, the August Agreements, the creation of Solidarity, the imposition of martial law, the Round Table Talks, the partially-free election in 1989, then my presidency as a seal of freedom and lastly the admission of Poland to NATO and to the European Union. I consider all these elements to be consecutive links in the chain of freedom, without which neither Poland nor Europe would be free. CNN: What was the biggest challenge you faced personally during your days with Solidarity before 1989? Lech Walesa: The most important one was to persevere in unity. To stick to our goal. Not to be broken down. And yet we were so badly impacted by martial law. In prison we went through an ordeal. We were not broken down. Our faith was never shaken. It was strengthened by what happened in August 1980. This is our great victory. At that time, nobody expected us to succeed. We had a vivid memory of the tragic events of December 1970. We knew we had to work together. Already on the first day we set up an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee and started to work on the demands. We eventually managed to hammer out 21 demands, which were signed on December 31st together with the government, which was represented by Mieczysław Jagielski. This was our greatest challenge and greatest victory. Soon after, our tiny union had 10 million members all over Poland. The 1980s were a time of struggle to build an organization and its structures. It was also a fight for unity and perseverance in the path we had chosen. Although weakened, we were not defeated and so we lasted until 1988 and 1989. We lost a couple of battles, but we won the war for democracy and freedom. It's because we were working in solidarity. And the world was in solidarity with us. CNN: What gave you the strength to continue the struggle against the communist government in Poland? What qualities do you think you had that made you do what you did? Lech Walesa: This is made up of several things. One of them was our faith that this sick, unfair system must finally collapse. We didn't know how to make it happen, how to get organized so as not to repeat the mistakes made in 1970 (during the protests). In my opinion, divine providence helped us at this stage. It's then that a Pole who became pope helped us to organize ourselves in prayer and also made us understand our inner strength. His regular visits to Poland, although hindered by the communist authorities, played this role. The masses celebrated by the Holy Father gathered millions of Poles. We could see that we were many, that we were millions. Before that, we had been scattered and divided. It was the first time in post-war Poland that the Polish nation had joined forces on such a massive scale. I'm sure that had there been no pontificate of John Paul II, the Fall of Communism wouldn't have happened as quickly or as peacefully as it did. The Holy Father did not call us to fight, but gathered us in prayer. And we were able to match actions with words. CNN: Do you have any regrets from your life during the anti-communist days? Lech Walsa: Concerning our peaceful struggle, I have no regrets whatsoever. Of course, when I look at it today, from the perspective of years, I wish I had done a few things differently, but as for the path we took, I wouldn't have changed it. Despite such a great victory, I have a feeling that I missed something. When I was fighting, when I was repeatedly arrested and in prison or when I traveled all over the country to coordinate the activity of unions, my wife and the children were left behind at home. Regrettably, I was not with them. It's probably my greatest failure: I was not with my family when they needed me most. For this I want to thank my wife Danuta. For the fact that she put up with me and brought up our children to be good people. CNN: How do you see Poland today? Lech Walesa: We are now in a very different place, in a new era. Today we can say with confidence that we live in a democratic Poland, in a firmly established free market economic system, in a country built on solid foundations of international cooperation and in a country of high aspirations and hopes for further development. Our success has been noticed. There are many who point to Poland as an example of wise economic policy. We are amongst the few countries that emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed. The 2012 European Championship was another type of promotion of Poland and an opportunity to show off our achievements. I'm also very happy to see that even those projects, which seemed doomed to failure due to the very last decisions of the communists, have in fact been able to be saved, such as my beloved Gdańsk Shipyard, the cradle of ""Solidarity"". Today it is slowly rising to its feet again and building ships after many years of struggle and hope for its rescue; there is a chance that jobs can be safeguarded and that the symbol of the Polish transformation can be saved. This fills me with happiness, even if the costs of transformation were high. Today Poland is a truly beautiful, modern and open country. CNN: Is it the country today as you hoped it would be when you cast your vote in June 1989? Lech Walesa: Back in 1989, nothing was a foregone conclusion. We had to build a state system almost from scratch. The difficult (political and economic) reforms of minister of finance Leszek Balcerowicz and the prime minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki allowed us to make further changes. In conjunction with Boris Yeltsin, I negotiated the withdrawal of Red Army troops from Poland. We then became a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and today we are also a member of the European Union. At that time, I didn't even dream that we would manage to achieve all that, and in such a short time. It's true, Poland as we see it today is beyond anything we could have dreamt of at that time. However, I regret that not everything worked out as it should have. My presidency ended after five years and I had a plan that would have required two terms to fully realize. Later on, the politics of Aleksander Kwaśniewski were not in line with my concept. CNN: Do you think democracy in Poland and other former communist states is in good shape? Lech Walesa: It might seem so, but we still have a problem with the sense of responsibility for the country amongst our citizens. We recently held the election to the European Parliament, a very important election, in which decided who would be representing us at the European Union. The average turnout throughout the EU was low -- only 43%. In Poland, however, it stood at 23%. And even lower than that in Slovakia and in the Czech Republic. It's alarming. First we expect ""old Europe"" to accept us and treat us on an equal footing and then we renounce our right to vote. Moreover, parties with extremist views are on the rise. These parties promote ideas that contradict democracy and the European Union's reason for existence. We must therefore wake up, because if we continue to be indifferent, we may ourselves destroy our great dream of international solidarity. On the other hand, I'm a 100% democrat and if parties with such an outlook on life enter the parliament, I have no choice but to accept it. I only call for votes during the next election to be cast in a well-conceived manner. CNN: What is the biggest challenge facing Poland and Polish society today? Lech Walesa: The biggest challenge for Poland, Europe and the world is the reshuffling and widening of structures. I have already been saying it for quite some time: we must evolve past thinking in terms of the nation state and the European state. We live in an era of intellect, information and globalization. We live under new conditions that require us to create a totally different set of programs and structures. It's a task not only for Poland, but also for the entire population of contemporary Europe and the world at large. Our present systems do not meet our current needs. The new era offers us new challenges. We who destroyed communism, whose downfall has triggered a domino effect of transformation throughout Europe, should provide an example and inspiration for the entire world. We must show how to change even the most difficult reality through purely democratic means, without the use of violence. Today we must ask ourselves which world we are going to built in this new era and how democracy and globalization are going to look. For a long time already, I have been calling for the development of a Decalogue of universal values that would serve as a lasting reference point for this new Europe and the world. We must define and accept laws establishing common principles, which would allow nations and religions to co-exist in a spirit of respect for differences and friendly cooperation. Once such a universal basis is established, we will succeed in building lasting and safe communities. Otherwise it may be hard to maintain the world as it is at present.","Poland's former president  Lech Walesa talks to CNN's Dean Irvine .

"A vicious attack at an anti-racism demonstration in Stockholm, Sweden, on Sunday proved the protesters have a legitimate concern. A group of 40 far-right extremists threw stones, bottles and fireworks at a group of 200 people holding an organized, legal demonstration to oppose racism and growing neo-Nazi sentiment in the area, Stockholm police spokesman Sven-Erik Olsson said Sunday. Two demonstrators and two police officers were injured and taken to the hospital, Olsson said. The incident led to 28 arrests, and the suspects could face a maximum charge of attempted murder, though Olsson said more likely, those arrested will be charged with assault and violence against a police officer. The suspects will likely appear in court Sunday night and be released pending trial, according to Olsson. Demonstrators chose the Kalltorp area of Stockholm for their event because neo-Nazi graffiti recently has blighted buildings there, Olsson said.","40 neo-Nazis confronted 200 anti-racism demonstrators in Stockholm on Sunday .

"Polish cities, attitudes and styles: they've all developed their own distinct identities since the country parted with communism almost 25 years ago  -- but can the same now be achieved with Polish cuisine? That's the aim of Wojciech Amaro, an award-winning Polish chef and the man behind the country's first Michelin Star restaurant, who is intent on changing perceptions of his country's culinary craft. ""We're trying to draw a new line for Polish cuisine,"" Amaro explained. ""(This means) having a new combination (of ingredients) but in the end, people can feel this is Poland on the plate."" See also: Poland captured on instagram . In the modest-looking ""Atelier Amaro"" restaurant in central Warsaw, Amaro serves up his unique brand of gastronomic excellence. His inventive style saw him awarded with the prestigious Chef de l'Avenir award from the International Academy of Gastronomy in 2008 while Atelier Amaro was given a Michelin Star in April 2013. Yet despite his passion for all things Polish and contentment with his Warsaw studio, Amaro has spent much of his working life abroad learning from some of Europe's most famous chefs. The aim was to build up a bank of ideas and tastes before returning home to set up shop in Poland, he said. His previously nomadic life enabled Amaro to hone his skills in high-pressure kitchens across London. He also spent time in Catalonia, Spain, at the El Bulli restaurant of Ferran Adria, the man often referred to as the world's greatest chef. See also: Polish street art goes bigger than Banksy . Amaro says his time overseas was professionally formative. ""I took all my ideas and dreams and I brought them back,"" Amaro says. ""This country had no such education system in gastronomy. I wanted to learn from the best and one day come back and do something with Polish cuisine."" As with Britain's Heston Blumenthal or René Redzepi, who heads the Danish restaurant Noma, Amaro is highly regarded for his scientific approach to food. He spends much of his time tinkering with conventional ideas and refining ingredients down to their elemental forms, many of which are sourced from all over Poland. Prior to opening the restaurant, Amaro spent a year searching his home country to locate the best ingredients and gain inspiration from Poland's forgotten culinary traditions. He racked up more than 60,000 kilometers (37,000 miles) in the process and now relies on many of the producers he met in his travels as suppliers for his restaurant. When CNN visited, Amaro was busy in his kitchen compressing pumpkin, beetroot, and sweet potato (all sourced in Poland, of course) into a vacuum machine which he says brings out their hidden flavors. See also: Poland's medieval majesty . ""We actually pay respect to the tradition because we use the ingredients that could be at some point forgotten,"" Amaro said. ""We bring them back to life and we create new dishes out of them."" For the proud Pole, this painstaking process is not just about creating food he finds challenging and rewarding. It's about creating a new Polish identity that everyone can share. ""You can really feel that. You have this sense of, you know, living in this country that (there) is something booming,"" he enthused. ""We (the restaurant) just want to be part of that and do our job in terms of cuisine and gastronomy, so it's really an amazing time,"" he added.","Wojciech Amaro is a Polish chef aiming to put his country's culinary craft on the map .

"Singer Phil Everly -- one half of the groundbreaking, smooth-sounding, record-setting duo, the Everly Brothers -- has died, a hospital spokeswoman said. He was 74. Patricia Aidem, a spokeswoman at Providence St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, confirmed Everly's death on Friday, but could not provide additional details, citing the family's request. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Phil Everly and his brother, Don (now 76), ranked among the elite in the music world by virtue of their pitch-perfect harmonies and emotive lyrics. Rolling Stone labeled the Everly Brothers ""the most important vocal duo in rock,"" having influenced the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkel and many other acts. Along the way, they notched 35 Top 100 songs -- more than any other vocal pair. The Everly Brothers' sound -- with Don's lower register generally complementing Phil's higher voice -- was the backbone of dozens of hits. The two began as songwriters before signing a deal in 1957 with Cadence Records. They became international sensations over the next five years with tunes such as ""Bye Bye Love,"" ""Wake Up Little Susie,"" ""When Will I Be Loved"" and ""All I Have to Do Is Dream."" In terms of record sales, their chief rivals during this stretch were Elvis Presley and Pat Boone. Their style -- a product of their blend of rock 'n' roll with Appalachian folk, bluegrass and other genres more closely aligned to their Kentucky roots -- helped them earn inductions in both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Country Music Hall of Fame. ""The amount of music that can be directly traced to the Everly Brothers is incredible,"" wrote one admirer on Twitter. ""Thanks, Phil...and 'Bye Bye.'"" Phil and Don were born in the business, the offspring of country and western singers Margaret and Ike Everly. The Everlys sang with their parents in live shows and on the radio. In the mid-'50s, while still teenagers, they moved to Nashville to be songwriters. In 1957, they found a Felice and Boudleaux Bryant song, ""Bye Bye Love."" According to ""The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll,"" 30 acts had rejected the song, but the Everlys -- with the key guitar contributions of Chet Atkins, who played on many of their hits -- took the song to No. 2 on the pop charts. ""They added Bo Diddley riffs, teenage anxieties and sharkskin suits but -- for all that -- the core of their sound remained country brother harmony,"" read their bio on the Country Music Hall of Fame's website. After averaging a Top 10 hit every four months over the next few years, the Everly Brothers inked a 10-year pact with Warner Brothers Records (formerly part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner, though now owned by Access Industries) in 1960. More success followed -- including ""Cathy's Clown,"" which the duo wrote -- and they stayed particularly popular in Britain. ""Bye Bye Love"" was ""the first thing that really killed me,"" Paul Simon once recalled. He called Art Garfunkel immediately upon hearing the song, according to a Simon biography, and the two set to work on their own act. The Everlys also served to bond the nascent Beatles. Upon hearing ""All I Have to Do Is Dream"" in 1958, the young group -- which had just added George Harrison to a lineup that included John Lennon and Paul McCartney -- couldn't wait to cover it. ""When we first heard it, it blew us away,"" McCartney said in Mark Lewisohn's new Beatles biography, ""Tune In."" By the 1970s, the pair was performing in a band that also included legends Warren Zevon and Waddy Wachtel. But their time together came to a sudden end in 1973, when Phil stormed off the stage during a show in California. The brothers reunited on stage and in the studio 10 years later, leading to more albums, including ""EB 84"" (including the McCartney-written ""On the Wings of a Nightingale"") and ""Born Yesterday."" Their remaining years were highlights by occasional shows, hall of fame inductions and various other honors, including a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1997.

"Lara Logan, the CBS correspondent at the center of a discredited October 27 report about the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, is taking a leave of absence from work, the network said Tuesday. Logan's longtime producer, Max McClellan, is also taking time off. CBS suggested that the leaves of absence were punitive measures for the shortcomings in the Benghazi report, which has stung the reputations of both Logan and the program that televised her report, ""60 Minutes."" With the staff announcements on Tuesday and the release of an internal review, CBS tried to demonstrate that it has figured out what went wrong with its Benghazi report and taken steps to stop similar mistakes in the future. ""The '60 Minutes' journalistic review is concluded, and we are implementing ongoing changes based on its results,"" a CBS News spokeswoman said Tuesday. 'We were wrong': CBS's Lara Logan apologizes for Benghazi report . But the network declined to comment further on what changes were being implemented or on when Logan might return to work. Logan has not talked publicly about the Benghazi report since she apologized for it on November 10, and it looks unlikely that she will talk anytime soon; although she had been scheduled to host a high-profile fund-raising dinner for the Committee to Protect Journalists on Tuesday night, the committee says her colleague Scott Pelley, the anchor of the ""CBS Evening News,"" is going to fill in for her. Jeff Fager, the chairman of CBS News and the executive producer of ""60 Minutes,"" said in an internal memorandum that he asked Logan and McClellan to take leaves of absence. Fager said he, not Logan, was ultimately responsible for the mistakes associated with the October 27 report. ""I pride myself in catching almost everything, but this deception got through and it shouldn't have,"" he said. The exceptionally rare steps by CBS were applauded by Media Matters, the liberal media monitoring group that was among the first to criticize Logan's conclusions about Benghazi. ""From the start of this controversy, Media Matters has demanded that CBS review the flawed '60 Minutes' report and take appropriate action. Today, the network has done that,"" the group's chairman, David Brock, said in a statement. ""We hope this serves as a lesson learned to CBS about the danger of misinformation."" The missteps in the report stemmed from an interview with Dylan Davies, a security contractor who was in Benghazi on the night of the assault, which left four Americans dead, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Davies claimed in the interview that he was present at the compound, but that account contradicted what he had previously told the FBI, the State Department and his own employer. 'We were wrong': Lara Logan apologizes for Benghazi report . CBS executives have said that they didn't know the details of the government interviews of Davies but did know that he'd told his employer a different story. ""This crucial point -- his admission that he had not told his employer the truth about his own actions -- should have been a red flag in the editorial vetting process,"" said Al Ortiz, the head of standards and practices for CBS, in the network's internal review, which was shared with employees on Tuesday. Ortiz also faulted the ""60 Minutes"" staff with keeping its interview to itself — something that outside critics said weeks ago when questions about the report were first raised. ""The fact that the FBI and the State Department had information that differed from the account Davies gave to '60 Minutes' was knowable before the piece aired,"" Ortiz wrote. ""But the wider reporting resources of CBS News were not employed in an effort to confirm his account. It's possible that reporters and producers with better access to inside FBI sources could have found out that Davies had given varying and conflicting accounts of his story.""

"Dan Condon believes in recycling. Just not when it comes to his hotel towels. Condon composts when he's at home in Boulder, Colorado. He eats local, organic and fair-trade food and drives a Honda CR-Z hybrid sports car. You might call him green. Except he's not so green when he travels for his work at an education nonprofit and stays in a hotel, which happens about 10 weeks per year. There, he uses a new towel every day. And don't try to bribe him with a drink or dessert coupon to get him to reuse the same one. ""I could care less about rewards for environmentally conscious behavior unless it's miles,"" Condon wrote in an e-mail. If hotels can't convince a hybrid-driving recycling enthusiast like Condon to go green while traveling, how can they possibly convince everyone else? 9 glamorous movie-star hotels . That's the problem of hotels trying to ""green"" your hotel stay. After guests have paid a pretty penny for a night at the inn, even the most environmental guests may want to treat themselves to fresh towels every day and those little bottles of sweet-smelling shampoo. Despite the fact that most people describe themselves in surveys as environmentally conscious and as preferring green products, there's a big gap between consumer attitudes and consumer behaviors when it comes to going green, said Michael Giebelhausen, a marketing professor at the Cornell University School of Hotel Administration. ""It can be nice to have fresh towels, and not doing so is a sacrifice,"" said Giebelhausen, whose current research focuses on the impact of hotel sustainability programs on guest satisfaction. ""Participating requires some effort, and there's some cost to be incurred on the part of the consumer."" Guests who go green are happy . Nearly 90% of hotel guests are offered the chance to do something sustainable during their stays, and about two-thirds will participate, according to Giebelhausen's analysis of 2011 data from the J.D. Power and Associates North America Hotel Guest Satisfaction Study. Those guests who participate in a hotel's green programs report that they are more satisfied with their stays than guests who do not participate. Participating in a hotel's sustainability program provides ""a feeling that it was good to be green, it made them feel good about themselves, and that translated to the service provider,"" Giebelhausen said. 8 getaways we wish we could afford . ""These guests, who are ostensibly receiving a lower level of service, report being more satisfied overall with their stay."" There's just one catch: Guests who don't participate in voluntary sustainability programs reported the lowest levels of satisfaction with their hotel stays.  ""One explanation for these findings is that when people don't live up to their ideals, and vice versa, this affects how satisfied they are with the entity that presented them this 'moral dilemma,'"" Giebelhausen said. Sustainability is becoming the norm . It makes business sense for hotels to go green: Increasing sewage rates, stricter water use requirements and more recycling options are all convincing hotels to reduce their water and energy costs, said hotel industry veteran Pat Maher, an environmental consultant and ""green guru"" for the American Hotel & Lodging Association. More than 75% of U.S. hotels have linen and towel reuse programs, 59% have guest or internal recycling programs, and 46% have a water-saving program, according to a 2012 American Hotel & Lodging Association survey of its members. They also have ""back of the house"" programs that include low-flow shower heads, faucets and toilets; energy-efficient light bulbs, high-efficiency appliances and other efforts. Some are required by local governments; others just make business sense. That translates into real dollars: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has found that hotels and other lodging facilities use more than 510 trillion BTU of energy annually at a cost of more than $7.4 billion. That energy use generates 54 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions, equal to the emissions from more than 11 million passenger vehicles, according to the agency. Beyond Mickey Mouse: Best cruises for 2013 . The EPA reports that the lodging industry could save $745 million annually by reducing energy use by 10%. That translates to 60 cents more revenue per room night at limited-service hotels and $2 at full-service hotels. Annoyed that the hotel's bottom line benefits from your sacrifice? Some hotels are trying to make water-saving behavior pay for their guests. Participating Sheraton Hotels & Resorts gives guests a $5 food and drink voucher or 500 Starwood points for every day they decline housekeeping's services (except departure day). Part of the Kimpton culture . Some hotels are making green cool. It seems to be an easier sell for hip, higher-end chains like Kimpton Hotel & Restaurant Group's properties, which cultivate an edgier base of customers. About 85% of hotel guests participate in the chain's towel and sheet reuse program, said Mike DeFrino, Kimpton's executive vice president of hotel operations. Bill Kimpton started the boutique hotel chain by rehabbing older buildings and turning them into hotels. Although Kimpton died in 2001, the company that bears his name still has the reputation he cultivated. Most locations welcome guests to mingle at a lobby cocktail hour, lounge in their animal-print robes and bring their pets on their stay. And many locations will lend guests a goldfish as part of the Guppy Love program. ""I think our guests expect us to push the envelope and try things that are different than what the mass-appeal hotels are doing,"" DeFrino said. DeFrino's convinced that some guests don't actually mean to ask for new towels but are much like his teenage daughter, who tosses her towels on the floor at home for no good reason. ""Once it's on the floor, you're going to get a clean towel,"" he said. (Hotel guests, not his daughter.) The pressure on a mid-priced chain . It's trickier for other hotel chains, where sustainability isn't necessarily part of the appeal to the customer. The mid-priced chains are competing for a more price-sensitive business and leisure traveler. Hampton Inn, which offers a hot breakfast at its nearly 1,900 company-owned and franchise locations across the country, has two environmentally friendly options for disposable plates, bowls and cutlery: 100% biodegradable Enviroware or Taterware, a resin material made from potato starch. The chain's takeout coffee cup sleeves are made from 100% recycled fiber, and the towel reuse program simply asks customers using a door hanger to ""reuse or replace"" towels. No big deal either way, the sign suggests. ""We're delivering these messages in a light-hearted way. ... It's not preachy or paternalistic,"" said Jennifer Silberman, vice president of corporate responsibility for Hilton Worldwide, which owns Hampton. More happens behind the scenes at Hampton, which benefits from LightStay, Hilton's company-wide sustainability system that tracks the sustainability of 200 operational practices at nearly 3,900 properties around the world. Hilton has saved more than $147 million since 2008 through efficiency projects, including reporting through LightStay, Silberman said. Satisfying the luxury guest . You'd think environmental sustainability programs would hit a roadblock with luxury guests, who want the best of everything.  Not so, said Sue Stephenson, vice president of Ritz-Carlton's Community Footprints, the chain's social and environmental responsibility program. ""It in no way diminishes the luxury experience,"" Stephenson said. ""We still have the best towels, linens and amenities."" Many Ritz-Carlton guests now use the same sheets two nights in a row (introduced in 2011) and hang up their towels to use another day (introduced in 2009). ""We've not had a single negative guest comment but have certainly had positive guest comments,"" Stephenson said. ""Guests want to see we're doing the right thing."" It helps that the onus is really on the business to be responsible in its construction, hotel operations, food service and landscaping, she said. ""The majority of what can be done for the environment is what we can do as a business,"" Stephenson said. No matter the price point, no hotelier can afford to lose a guest because he or she doesn't like the way a hotel communicates its message. Even Kimpton's DeFrino said the boutique chain won't roll out an environmental initiative if tests show that customers don't like it. But in Kimpton's case, DeFrino found that guests approve of their efforts. ""Our guest satisfaction has improved since our green initiatives were introduced, and it's given us confidence that efforts have not deteriorated the guest experience,"" he said. The tide may be turning . It's possible that younger people used to recycling and saving water will bring those attitudes into their hotel stays as they age. Ritz-Carlton's Stephenson sees children leading their parents into caring about the environment on their hotel stays. Betting that more and more consumers want to choose environmentally friendly hotels right now, travel website TripAdvisor is launching its GreenLeaders program this year to let travelers know which hotels have sustainable practices. About 71% of travelers reported that they planned to choose hotels based on sustainability over the next year, compared with 65% in the previous survey, according to an April 2012 Trip Advisor survey. Yet while 81% of hotels have some green programs, almost a quarter don't communicate that fact to their guests, said TripAdvisor spokeswoman Alison Croyle. The website is accepting applications from hotels to qualify for a ""GreenLeader"" or ""GreenPartner"" label on the TripAdvisor site based on their sustainable practices. The program will rely on traveler feedback, and any discrepancies could trigger an independent audit of the hotel. That's information that Genevieve Hein, 33, who always hangs up her towels at hotels to reuse them the next day, would enjoy having. ""Trying to limit my impact on the environment makes me feel good,"" said Hein, assistant director of residence life at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. ""When I go against my green principles for the sake of convenience or to go with the flow, I feel bad about myself and guilty. I can't imagine how those feelings would enhance my vacation, which is supposed to be all about feeling good."" Do you like to participate in a hotel's sustainable programs, or do they irritate you?

"Much is made of the power of football: the way ""the beautiful game"" transcends cultural boundaries, knits together communities and makes grown men cry. But perhaps football's greatest --and most little-known -- achievement was its role in the downfall of communism in Europe. When Polish team Lechia Gdansk faced off against Italian club Juventus in the 1983 UEFA Cup Winner's Cup, Gdansk's stadium was packed with Polish supporters. And, while the Italian side may have won the match (a respectable 3-2), the truest triumph belonged to Gdansk. At the time, Poland was under martial law: soldiers patrolled the streets, the country's borders were sealed and activists were imprisoned without charge. Defiance of communist rule was considered crushed. But here, in this stadium, something shifted. At half-time, the thousands-strong crowd began chanting the name of revolutionary Polish trade union Solidarity, which, in trying to activate social change, had been banned under martial law. Solidarity's leader, the charismatic Lech Walesa, stood, revered, among the unified crowd. Some years later, he would be president. ""I remember the atmosphere,"" Jarzy Jastrzebowski, says the club's trainer at the time. ""It was unforgettable."" He recalls how, at half-time, ""In the dressing room we heard all this noise and people were chanting 'Solidarity!' (Then) we saw Lech Walesa getting up and raising his hand (to make) the famous Solidarity symbol."" That Gdansk would rally behind this revolution should come as no surprise: the Solidarity movement began in the city's shipyards. It was the birthplace of an organization that, according to Karol Nawrocki and Mariusz Kordek in their book, ""Lechia v Juventus - More Than a Game"", 10 million people belonged to in the early 1980s. And, as the match showed, Gdansk was more than Solidarity's birthplace, it was its beating heart. Rations, curfews, reduced civil liberties and a crumbling economy characterized Poland at this time. But, as Jastrzebowski puts it, ""This match gave us a lot. A new ideology and new freedom was born, because people couldn't express what they wanted to freely in the streets."" The stadium, the match, had become a refuge for protest. And it left no doubt that the ruling Communist government had failed to quash its opposition. State television censored transmission of the game, showing it without sound following the half-time chants, worried the rest of the country would hear the dissension. But it was too late. Walesa himself has summed up the power of that day, supposing the authorities had only allowed him to attend the match because ""they didn't think Solidarity still had any life in it. But they were wrong. That match gave us some strength for what would come next"". What came next was years of struggle that ended with the 1989 Round Table Agreement, in which Walesa played a seminal part. This paved the way for semi-free parliamentary elections in Poland, a Solidarity-led government, and inspired a wave of revolutions that brought down communist regimes in Eastern Europe. Come 1990, Walesa was in office as president. Not many may know what a football match in Gdansk did for democracy in Europe, but Lechia Gdansk fans will never forget. Nor will the team's current goalkeeper, Mateusz Bak who was born the same year the match took place. ""Still, in 2014, when you play a game here you can sometimes see a flag in the crowds with the 'Solidarity' name on it,"" he says. ""Our fans remember the times because it happened here, you know? Everything happened here."" Send in your best shots from Poland .","The match between Lechia Gdansk and Juventus fueled the downfall of communism .

"World powers and Iran resumed talks Thursday in Vienna, Austria, aimed at reaching a permanent deal on the future of Tehran's nuclear program ahead of a looming deadline. This is the final round of talks before an interim six-month agreement reached between Iran and the so-called P5+1 group of nations -- the United States, the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany -- comes to an end July 20. Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William Burns and EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton on Wednesday, ahead of the first full session Thursday. Michael Mann, a spokesman for Ashton, told reporters in Vienna that the six world powers were committed to reaching an agreement ahead of the deadline. He described the atmosphere at the talks as ""very workmanlike, very serious, very determined"" and said the negotiations would continue for ""as long as it takes"" for a deal to be forged. The deadline could potentially be extended. Ashton also met Thursday with the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which would play a key role in the implementation of a final agreement, Mann said. Under the interim deal, Iran cut back on parts of its nuclear program and the six nations reduced economic sanctions. For example, Iran agreed not to install new centrifuges, used to enrich uranium. The P5+1 nations agreed to suspend sanctions on gold and precious metals, Iran's auto sector and Iran's petrochemical exports. Iran insists that its nuclear program is peaceful, but the world powers fear it has ambitions to build nuclear weapons. Tricky negotiations . Tehran has sounded a more positive tone toward the West since President Hassan Rouhani was elected last year to succeed the more volatile Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iran's state-run Press TV quoted the country's top nuclear negotiator, Abbas Araqchi, as saying a deal could be reached if ""the Iranian nation's nuclear rights are consolidated and respected."" But there's no guarantee that the two sides will be able to overcome their differences around the negotiating table. Iran wants the final deal to recognize its right to have a peaceful nuclear program. Its negotiators have also signaled they would accept tougher inspections and limits on production of enriched uranium. But in return, Iran wants the world powers to lift their crippling sanctions. However, the world powers expect a final deal that adds further checks and limitations to Iran's nuclear program. They have even suggested demanding that Iran dismantle some nuclear facilities and shut down thousands of centrifuges, and they may also want some sanctions to stay in place. Iranians on the streets of Tehran told CNN they want to see a nuclear agreement. ""It's best if we reach a compromise,"" said poet Mohammed Rostami. ""It will help the economy and open things up to the rest of the world."" ""We have to be hopeful for a deal, otherwise young people will keep leaving Iran,"" said graphic artist Behnaz. Kerry: Iran's leaders have a choice . In an opinion piece published Monday in The Washington Post, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Tehran ""to back up its words with concrete and verifiable actions,"" saying this should not be hard if it is being honest about its intentions. ""All along, these negotiations have been about a choice for Iran's leaders,"" he wrote. ""They can agree to the steps necessary to assure the world that their country's nuclear program will be exclusively peaceful and not be used to build a weapon, or they can squander a historic opportunity to end Iran's economic and diplomatic isolation and improve the lives of their people. ""Diplomacy and leadership are marked by tough calls. This shouldn't be one of them."" However, despite all the months of talks, Western negotiators still don't know which way Iran will go, Kerry said -- and a discrepancy remains between what the Iranians say they want from their nuclear program and the content of that program so far.","Negotiators for Iran and six world powers resume nuclear talks in Vienna, Austria .

"(CNN) -- Endeavour -- the boat's name is befitting of its journey twice to the brink of destruction and the tireless work that went in to restoring the 1934 vessel to its former glory. It was ""an absolute Armageddon battle start to finish to get the boat done,"" Elizabeth Meyer tells CNN's Mainsail show. The American's painstaking restoration job, which began 30 years ago, is credited with a resurgence in the interest in the gargantuan J-Class boats that used to battle it out for America's Cup supremacy, a far cry from the space-age designs of the competition's current multihulls. She is the granddaughter of Eugene Meyer -- former U.S. Federal Reserve chairman and the first president of the World Bank -- and the niece of Katharine Graham, who owned and published the Washington Post at the time of the 1970s Watergate scandal. Her own pre-yachting claim to fame was building a home for Jackie Onassis in Martha's Vineyard, resulting in the pair becoming friends -- while the proceeds from that business helped her move into boat restoration work. Meyer has done it all under the auspices of three mottoes: ""press on regardless,"" ""full speed ahead"" and ""fools rush in where angels fear to tread"" -- the final words first penned by Alexander Pope in ""An Essay to Criticism"" in 1709. Criticism is something she has encountered at every crossroads. ""A woman who is a forceful person who knows what she wants is a 'bitch,' "" the 61-year-old explains. ""If I had been a man I'd be a 'hard-hitting businessman that made my own money' and 'Boy, he really knows what he wants.' ""But as a woman I was completely attacked by everybody."" That varied from being warned off by American sailors of the J-Class era (""You must not do this, they're too dangerous, these things are killers, you'll ruin your life and kill people with it"") to local authorities in the United Kingdom cutting off the power at the improvised yard where she was restoring Endeavour and then demanding $50,000 in rent. Meyer also had problems with the tax department, which ""sent people around that looked like Inspector Clouseau"" after confusing her company with one of a similar name. It left her feeling like she was ""being attacked by a giant army and trying to get this boat done and trying to find the money."" Taking on the project of restoring Endeavour after discovering her in England, Meyer lived in Fawley, a village on the southwest coast in close proximity to an oil refinery and a power station. ""There was toxic waste, a sewage treatment plant and I was very, very ill from that and the mold in the house I was renting,"" she recalls. But she has lived to tell the tale and the J-Class yacht scene is now thriving with races organized each year in Rhode Island's Newport, where she lives, and Falmouth and Cowes. Restorations have followed Meyer's, and replicas too, with five since rebuilt, four new vessels built from scratch and two more in the offing. Her parents, both doctors -- a psychiatrist and epidemiologist -- had a keen interest in the water. Her father was a powerboater and fisherman, her mother a sailor who regaled a young Meyer with stories of the J-Class yachts. ""My mother thought of them as the pinnacle of what a sailboat should be,"" she says. ""So I was sort of indoctrinated that way at a young age and I never stopped thinking it and I still think it. ""So, we sailed, we canoed, we camped, we fished, we did everything. But I thought I had missed seeing the most extraordinary example of a sailboat that would ever exist and I always regretted that."" That all changed in 1984, when -- while traveling with friends in Europe -- she persuaded the editor of Nautical Quarterly to commission her to write an article on the remaining J-Class vessels, which existed in varying degrees of disarray. Just 10 were built, between 1930 and 1937, and most had been scrapped. Sailing on Velsheda, the only J-Class survivor at the time, she spotted the 130-foot Endeavour for the first time -- berthed on a mud flat -- and visited her the next day. ""Endeavour was the most beautiful J ever designed and built,"" Meyer says. ""There was something super exceptional about that boat. ""So I thought of her already and when I went to see her, she was out of the water. The shape is so sculptural and beautiful. ""It had not crossed my mind to restore one of these things. I had not got money at all to do something like that and I wasn't planning to do it."" Endeavour had repeatedly changed hands. Sold to a scrap merchant, she was saved by a buyer at the 11th hour in 1947. After sinking in the 1970s, two new owners stepped in to pay Â£10 and refloated the boat. The owner before Meyer did not have the funds to fully restore her. ""I thought, 'Someone really ought to restore this. I will.' And then I immediately went 'Oh no' because I knew I would do it and I said, 'Would you consider selling her to me?' And he said 'yes' and then I was stuck, I had to do it."" She initially borrowed money against real estate investments at Martha's Vineyard, which she eventually had to sell, as well as her share of her business restoring houses. Everyone and anyone advised her against it -- but she didn't listen. At the time, the British shipbuilding industry was in serious decline and Meyers says she ran the project ""out of two rented Portacabins located on the spit next to the hull of Endeavour"" and ended up completing the project in the Netherlands. ""I could not afford Endeavour for one single instant from the day I bought her,"" Meyers says. ""I had to sell everything I had, I had to charter the boat every second I owned her, and I did not sleep once in all those 18 years, I had to sell her. ""It crushed me, she was the apple of my eye and I'd be sailing her today as a classic still in all those regattas."" Endeavour, which Meyer had chartered for $60,000 a week, or $12,000 a day, in order to cover the upkeep, sold for $15 million in 2000. Despite the adversity, the financial worry, the lack of sleep, there were no regrets. ""It always felt worth it every minute of the way,"" she says. ""I never questioned for one second that I should do this and that it was going to be wonderful. I had complete confidence."" Endeavour was the brainchild of Thomas Sopwith, who made his name with the Sopwith Camel plane with which the English Royal Air Force fought World War I and who used his own aviation know-how to create what was the finest vessel of her day. But in half a century it went from coming close to winning the America's Cup to be found with no keel, rudder, ballast or interior. Meyer dismisses one oft-mentioned theory about what happened to the yachts. ""People talk about the Js and say, 'Oh, they were broken up for war materials,' but that's absolute nonsense. They were broken up for scrap value and we're not that sentimental in the U.S. The British are more sentimental, so you built four Js altogether and three of them still exist. The Americans built six and they're all cut up."" The infatuation in these yachts is clear to see. When Meyer organized an event in 1989 pitching Endeavour and Shamrock -- another of her restoration projects -- she needed 90 sailors to act as crew. Six times that registered their interest in taking part. Among those involved was CNN founder Ted Turner, who skippered the 1977 America's Cup winner Courageous. ""They were a little bit like the 'stars' are today, and they were connected with royalty because yachting was really up until the '30s a royal sport in England -- large yachts like that,"" Meyer says. ""There's something about the Js that is representational of the ultimate sailboat. They look like the meaning of 'sailboat.' I think they strike people that way. Sort of like the Eiffel Tower strikes people as just this amazingly enticing object."" Many, including Meyer, thought they would never be seen again. Her tireless work -- carried on through the International Yacht Restoration School that she founded in Newport in 1993 -- ensured that is not the case. ""Many people have that fundamental restoration urge. I think it's inherent in the human nature,"" Meyer says. ""When they see something remarkable that has fallen into disrepair, they think 'Let's fix it up.'""

"Why do you go to galleries? Is it because you like to keep up with what's going on in the arts? Because a poster caught your eye? Because of something someone said on Twitter? Or because you want to satisfy yourself that you're cleverer than the latest ""celebrity charlatan?"" Grayson Perry, one of Britain's leading contemporary artists, is under no illusion as to why people go to museums -- the first piece in his new show at the British Museum is, he admits, ""me getting my revenge in first."" The work, ""You Are Here,"" is a pot in the Turner Prize-winning ceramicist's distinctive style, covered in figures explaining the worthy, and not so worthy, motivations behind their visit to the show. Cheeky, yes, and full of Perry's quirky sense of fun, but like the rest of the ""Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman"" exhibition, it is also a love letter to museums and galleries in general -- and to one in particular: The British Museum. Crammed with more than eight million objects collected over the past 250 years, the museum's stores are a vast repository of centuries of human history, and human achievement. Over the past two years, Perry has been let loose inside what the museum's boss Neil MacGregor calls ""one of the great imaginative storehouses of the world,"" free to pick and choose items for his show from its immense collection. From that bewildering array, he has selected just under 200 items which inspired, amused and intrigued him -- from an earring with part of the wearer's ear still attached, via religious artifacts, to cheap souvenir pin badges. He has paired them up with items from his own artistic past, and in many cases created whole new works suggested by the sparks they set off inside his brain. Welcome, the artist says, to ""a short tour through my head."" The British Museum has been a place of pilgrimage for Perry since he was a child -- though he admits to a sense of disappointment on his first visit, because the model boats in the Egyptian collection were not as shiny and new as the cars he played with at home. ""People come here and they stand outside and take photographs of themselves as proof - 'I was here, I made the pilgrimage,'"" he says. For him, the museum is a place that allows him to travel the world, just 20 minutes away from the comfort of his own home. ""A lot of my world travel, I've done in the British Museum,"" he explains. ""I've never been to India, I've never been to Africa -- one of the pieces I made for the show is actually called ""I've never been to Africa"" -- I make no bones about it, I am what I am. ""The world is full of ""experience junkies"" who want to go around the world having an amazing time. I'm not one of them,"" he deadpans. At the heart of the exhibition is the eponymous ""Tomb of the Unknown Craftsman,"" a ship, sailing into the afterlife, bedecked with casts of some of the museum's ""celebrity artifacts"" -- mummies, sculptures, busts, plaques -- ""freighted,"" Perry explains, ""with the greatest hits of the British Museum."" And at the center of the centerpiece? A humble flint axe. ""The tool that begat all tools,"" Perry says, describing the ""incredibly powerful, visceral moment"" when one of the museum's curators handed him a box filled with ancient stone tools, and invited him to pick one up, cementing his links with the first craftsmen who created them. As MacGregor points out, Perry is not the first to find inspiration in the museum's historic galleries -- but he has taken it further than anyone else. ""Throughout the museum's history, artists have used the collection to inspire them, to make their own art, but until now, none of them has used it to make his own museum, his own civilization."" In doing so, MacGregor says, Perry has made everyone -- even those who work at the museum -- look at the objects differently. This is Perry's aim. He wants to inspire in his turn, just as he has been inspired. ""I hope that when people leave, they want to make something, they want to look at the world afresh.""","Artist Grayson Perry trawled the British Museum collection for objects which intrigued him .

"Editor's note: John M. McCardell Jr., president emeritus at Middlebury College, is founder and president of Choose Responsibility, a nonprofit organization that seeks to engage the public in debate over the effects of the 21-year-old drinking age. John McCardell says the 21-year-old drinking age isn't preventing widespread binge drinking. (CNN) -- One year ago, a group of college and university presidents and chancellors, eventually totaling 135, issued a statement that garnered national attention. The ""Amethyst Initiative"" put a debate proposition before the public -- ""Resolved: That the 21-year-old drinking age is not working."" It offered, in much the way a grand jury performs its duties, sufficient evidence for putting the proposition to the test. It invited informed and dispassionate public debate and committed the signatory institutions to encouraging that debate. And it called on elected officials not to continue assuming that, after 25 years, the status quo could not be challenged, even improved. One year later, the drinking age debate continues, and new research reinforces the presidential impulse. Just this summer a study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry revealed that, among college-age males, binge drinking is unchanged from its levels of 1979; that among non-college women it has increased by 20 percent; and that among college women it has increased by 40 percent. Remarkably, the counterintuitive conclusion drawn by the investigators, and accepted uncritically by the media, including editorials in The New York Times and The Washington Post is that the study proves that raising the drinking age to 21 has been a success. More recently, a study of binge drinking published in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced that ""despite efforts at prevention, the prevalence of binge drinking among college students is continuing to rise, and so are the harms associated with it."" Worse still, a related study has shown that habits formed at 18 die hard: ""For each year studied, a greater percentage of 21- to 24-year-olds [those who were of course once 18, 19 and 20] engaged in binge drinking and driving under the influence of alcohol."" Yet, in the face of mounting evidence that those young adults age 18 to 20 toward whom the drinking age law has been directed are routinely -- indeed in life- and health-threatening ways -- violating it, there remains a belief in the land that a minimum drinking age of 21 has been a ""success."" And elected officials are periodically reminded of a provision in the 1984 law that continues to stifle any serious public debate in our country's state legislative chambers: Any state that sets its drinking age lower than 21 forfeits 10 percent of its annual federal highway appropriation. But it's not 1984 anymore. This statement may seem obvious, but not necessarily. In 1984 Congress passed and the president signed the National Minimum Drinking Age Act. The Act, which raised the drinking age to 21 under threat of highway fund withholding, sought to address the problem of drunken driving fatalities. And indeed, that problem was serious. States that lowered their ages during the 1970s and did nothing else to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol witnessed an alarming increase in alcohol-related traffic fatalities. It was as though the driving age were lowered but no drivers education were provided. The results were predictable. Now, 25 years later, we are in a much different, and better, place. Thanks to the effective public advocacy of organizations like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, we are far more aware of the risks of drinking and driving. Automobiles are much safer. Seatbelts and airbags are mandatory. The ""designated driver"" is now a part of our vocabulary. And more and more states are mandating ignition interlocks for first-time DUI offenders, perhaps the most effective way to get drunken drivers off the road. And the statistics are encouraging. Alcohol-related fatalities have declined over the last 25 years. Better still, they have declined in all age groups, though the greatest number of deaths occurs at age 21, followed by 22 and 23. We are well on the way to solving a problem that vexed us 25 years ago. The problem today is different. The problem today is reckless, goal-oriented alcohol consumption that all too often takes place in clandestine locations, where enforcement has proven frustratingly difficult. Alcohol consumption among young adults is not taking place in public places or public view or in the presence of other adults who might help model responsible behavior. But we know it is taking place. If not in public, then where? The college presidents who signed the Amethyst Initiative know where. It happens in ""pre-gaming"" sessions in locked dorm rooms where students take multiple shots of hard alcohol in rapid succession, before going to a social event where alcohol is not served. It happens in off-campus apartments beyond college boundaries and thus beyond the presidents' authority; and it happens in remote fields to which young adults must drive. And the Amethyst presidents know the deadly result: Of the 5,000 lives lost to alcohol each year by those under 21, more than 60 percent are lost OFF the roadways, according to the National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. The principal problem of 2009 is not drunken driving. The principal problem of 2009 is clandestine binge drinking. That is why the Amethyst presidents believe a public debate is so urgent. The law does not say drink responsibly or drink in moderation. It says don't drink. To those affected by it, those who in the eyes of the law are, in every other respect legal adults, it is Prohibition. And it is incomprehensible. The principal impediment to public debate is the 10 percent highway penalty. That penalty should be waived for those states that choose to try something different, which may turn out to be something better. But merely adjusting the age -- up or down -- is not really the way to make a change. We should prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol in the same way we prepare them to operate a motor vehicle: by first educating and then licensing, and permitting them to exercise the full privileges of adulthood so long as they demonstrate their ability to observe the law. Licensing would work like drivers education -- it would involve a permit, perhaps graduated, allowing the holder the privilege of purchasing, possessing and consuming alcohol, as each state determined, so long as the holder had passed an alcohol education course and observed the alcohol laws of the issuing state. Most of the rest of the world has come out in a different place on the drinking age. The United States is one of only four countries -- the others are Indonesia, Mongolia and Palau -- with an age as high as 21. All others either have no minimum age or have a lower age, generally 18, with some at 16. Young adults know that. And, in their heart of hearts, they also know that a law perceived as unjust, a law routinely violated, can over time breed disrespect for law in general. Slowly but surely we may be seeing a change in attitude. This summer, Dr. Morris Chafetz, a distinguished psychiatrist, a member of the presidential commission that recommended raising the drinking age, and the founder of the National Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse admitted that supporting the higher drinking age is ""the most regrettable decision of my entire professional career."" This remarkable statement did not receive the attention it merited. Alcohol is a reality in the lives of young adults. We can either try to change the reality -- which has been our principal focus since 1984, by imposing Prohibition on young adults 18 to 20 -- or we can create the safest possible environment for the reality. A drinking age minimum of 21 has not changed the reality. It's time to try something different. It's not 1984 anymore. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John M. McCardell Jr.","John McCardell: 135 college officers joined in questioning 21 as drinking age .

"A Montana teacher who served 31 days in jail for raping a 14-year-old girl who later killed herself must be re-sentenced, the Montana Supreme Court ordered Wednesday. The court ruled that Stacey Dean Rambold's original sentence was inadequate and outside legislative guidelines, which it said should have ensured Rambold spend at least two years behind bars. The justices also barred Judge G. Todd Baugh, who drew a firestorm of criticism for levying the original sentence last year, from imposing the new sentence, saying a new judge was needed ""to preserve the appearance of fairness and justice."" Authorities said Rambold raped Cherise Morales, one of his students at a Billings, Montana, high school, in 2007. Morales committed suicide in February 2010, before the case went to trial. Rambold pleaded guilty to sexual intercourse without consent, and last year Baugh sentenced him to 15 years in prison, with all but 31 days suspended. That meant serving 31 days in jail and more than 14 years on probation. Baugh's comments at the sentencing in August sparked controversy. He said the girl looked older than her years and was ""probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant,"" according to the Montana attorney general's office, which appealed the sentence. In Wednesday's decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that Baugh used an inapplicable statute to impose the 31-day sentence. When read properly, Montana law mandates a minimum four-year prison sentence -- with a suspension of no more than two years -- for the rape of children under 16 by someone at least three years older, the court ruled. Explaining its decision to give the new sentence to a different judge, the court blasted Baugh's previous comments about the case. At the August sentencing, Baugh said the victim looked older than her years and was ""probably as much in control of the situation as was the defendant,"" according to the Montana attorney general's office. Baugh's comments reflected an improper bias and ""cast serious doubt on the appearance of justice,"" state Supreme Court Justice Michael E. Wheat wrote in Wednesday's ruling. Baugh apologized for the comments in November. Writing to a judicial review board, he said: ""I am sorry I made those remarks. They focused on the victim when that aspect of the case should have been focused on the defendant."" But he defended the overall decision in December, calling it ""the right kind of sentence."" The review board filed a complaint against Baugh in February, saying his actions in the Rambold case ""eroded public confidence"" in the judicial system. In Wednesday's ruling, Wheat wrote that the state Supreme Court would address the complaint in a separate hearing. Baugh told CNN affiliate KTVQ in January that he would retire at the end of the year, and that his decision wasn't related to the Rambold controversy. Authorities said Rambold had sexual relations with Morales in fall 2007, when she was 14 and a student in one of his classes at Billings Senior High. She confided in a church group leader, and Rambold was charged in October 2008.","Court: Man should have served at least two years behind bars .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's autopsy is done, but its release is on hold, as is the court case over the iconic singer's estate. Katherine Jackson has accused the executors of her son Michael's estate of ""keeping her in the dark."" The autopsy results will not be released indefinitely because of the ongoing investigation into the singer's death, according to authorities. The Los Angeles coroner's office said Monday that it would abide by a request from the police department to keep Jackson's cause and manner of death confidential. Investigators are trying to determine whether anyone should be charged in Jackson's June 25 death. The singer's physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, gave the anesthetic propofol to Jackson in the 24 hours before the singer died, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation. The source asked not to be named because the individual was not authorized to speak to the news media. Propofol is commonly known by the brand name Diprivan. The court case about Jackson's estate also has been stalled. On Monday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff delayed for a week his decision on whether to approve several contracts for the Jackson's estate to give the children's new lawyer -- whom he will appoint -- time to weigh in on the deals. Jackson's three children will get their own lawyer because the judge overseeing the probate of Jackson's will is concerned that their interests might sometimes conflict with their grandmother's. The delay was questioned by lawyers for the estate and the companies involved. They warned the judge that delaying the deals could cost the estate millions of dollars. The contracts would provide for Jackson tribute concerts in London starting next July, and an exhibition of Jackson memorabilia that would travel to at least three cities, according to Kathy Jorrie, a lawyer for concert promoter AEG Live. ""The longer we wait, the more time passes, frankly, the less interest there will be on the part of the public to come see it,"" Jorrie said. The judge has already approved a contract to allow Columbia Pictures to use video that AEG Live shot of Jackson's last rehearsals for a documentary due out this fall. Columbia is a division of Sony. Sony Pictures issued a news release Monday announcing that it would deliver the movie ""This Is It"" to theaters starting October 30 ""with the full support of the estate of Michael Jackson."" Court papers filed last week revealed Columbia Pictures would pay a minimum of $60 million for the rights to make the Jackson movie. Katherine Jackson's lawyers, while endorsing the movie deal, have objected to terms given to AEG, saying it is too generous to the company. Jackson's lawyers objected to the estate's agreement to let AEG recover all its expenses from that money and then take 10 percent of the remainder. It also gives the company a perpetual share of the profits from the video rights. AEG Live's lawyer said the company had made many concessions to the estate and could not make more. The judge previously has said he might approve the contracts even over Katherine Jackson's objection. Jermaine Jackson, Michael Jackson's older brother, told CNN's Larry King last week that he likes the deals, which he said could bring in nearly $100 million into the estate. Katherine Jackson and Jackson's three children are the main beneficiaries of the estate, which is controlled by Jackson's former lawyer, John Branca, and longtime Jackson friend and music executive John McClain. Branca and McClain were named in Jackson's will as executors. Katherine Jackson is considering a challenge of their control of the estate. The decision to name a guardian ad litem, or lawyer appointed by the court, for the children came at the end of a Monday's hearing. Katherine Jackson was appointed last week as the guardian for the children, but she was not made the guardian for their interest in her son's estate.","LAPD to coroner: Don't issue Jackson report; investigation continues .

"(CNN) -- Three years after the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the now-defunct law prohibiting gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from serving openly in the armed forces, many Americans might not know that a significant form of discrimination still exists: The U.S. military bans transgender people. Military recruiters are required to turn down attempts by transgender Americans to enlist. If, after joining the military, service members are discovered to be transgender, they are fired. No other federal agency operates this way. Because of the Pentagon's ban, an estimated 15,500 transgender people serving in the military have to hide and lie about who they are. This has devastating consequences for them, and makes it impossible to access medically necessary health care without risking discharge. Careers are ruined, and the military wastes resources training competent service members and then firing them when their gender identity is discovered. That's just what happened to Landon Wilson, a transgender man who served as a Navy cryptologist in Afghanistan last year. Landon was so good at his job that his superiors put him up for a promotion. But in the course of preparing the paperwork, a colleague discovered that Landon was born a girl, so he was sent home and ushered out of the Navy. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced three months ago that he is open to reviewing the ban, and the White House expressed support. However, since Hagel's announcement, no progress has been made toward a resolution, and some observers have questioned whether the military could include transgender personnel without difficulty. Transgender ex-Navy SEAL: Here's a question for you . To answer that question, a commission of leading legal, military and medical experts, including the U.S. Army's former chief medical officer, has completed a study on how to implement inclusive policy. The commission, which I co-chair, conducted an analysis of foreign military forces, as well as U.S. military experiences of previously excluded populations. Our research indicates that allowing transgender personnel to serve will be neither burdensome nor complex. We found that as with any policy change, the implementation of an inclusive approach should be handled in a thoughtful and deliberate manner. That said, we found that the administrative and regulatory changes needed to implement inclusive policy are minimal, and that strong leadership will be sufficient for avoiding any potential problems. Before implementing the repeal of ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the Pentagon created an internal working group that took a year to formulate advice about how to repeal the ban. Its guidance was based on extensive research, including a survey it administered to 400,000 service members. Additionally, the military commissioned the RAND Corporation to complete a simultaneous study on the same implementation questions the internal Pentagon working group was considering. While the working group and the RAND report produced useful recommendations, the snail's pace approach to implementation was based on the need to build political support, not by any complexities involved in lifting the ban. Because ""don't ask, don't tell"" was a congressional statute, the administration had to persuade a bipartisan coalition in Congress to support repeal, and the extensive research on implementation helped those efforts. But eliminating the restrictions on transgender service membersâ€”and embracing them as equal and respected members of our nation's armed forcesâ€”does not require the repeal of any law. Since the ban can be lifted without waiting for Congress, there is no reason for delay: The Obama administration should immediately announce a moratorium on firing transgender service members, and begin implementing a policy of inclusion. President Obama has made it clear that when Congress will not help him solve the nation's problems, he can and will take executive action to get meaningful work done. Lifting the military's transgender ban is a win-win opportunity because the policy will strengthen both the armed forces and our democracy.","Shannon Minter: ""Don't ask, don't tell"" gone, but military still bans transgender people .

"Streets turned into rivers and parts of UCLA turned into lakes after a massive water main break sent 8 million to 10 million gallons of water gushing through parts of Los Angeles. The deluge was so massive that swift-water rescue crews with boats had to ferry away several stranded people. At least three motorists were rescued from underground parking garages where stairwells had turned into raging waterfalls. Dozens of vehicles were partly submerged, UCLA said. At least two of the inundated garages belong to the university. And while authorities managed to stop the water hemorrhage by Tuesday night, the situation might not clear until later Wednesday. ""I'd like to tell you we'd have it fixed by the morning, but I don't think that's really possible,"" James McDaniel of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power said Tuesday night. He said crews will work through the night, trying to dewater the massive crater caused by the explosion. Much of UCLA deluged . The UCLA campus, on the city's west side, suffered much of the damage. The flooding covered the court of Pauley Pavilion, home to the Bruins' basketball, volleyball and women's gymnastics teams. The facility had just gone through a multi-million-dollar renovation two years ago. ""Unfortunately, Pauley Pavilion took quite a bit of water,"" Chancellor Gene Block told reporters Tuesday night. ""It's painful."" Water covers volleyball courts . At least one outdoor athletic stadium turned into an island of grass surrounded by a sea of murky brown water. But UCLA academic and residence halls were not affected, the university said, and classes will continue Wednesday. A geyser on Sunset Boulevard . Just before rush hour Tuesday, the 93-year-old water main burst under the world-famous Sunset Boulevard. The explosion busted through several lanes of the street and sent a geyser of water shooting into the sky. But no one was injured in the ordeal. It's not clear exactly what cause the burst. But it happened at a very bad time for the city and state. Drought-stricken California recently passed statewide water restrictions, and Gov. Jerry Brown declared a drought emergency in January. ""Unfortunately we lost a lot of water -- around 35,000 gallons a minute -- which is not ideal in the worst drought in the city's history,"" Los Angeles city councilman Paul Koretz said. ""So we ask everybody to try harder to conserve water.""","Authorities estimate 8 to 10 million gallons of water spilled .

"They've been trained to focus for weeks at a time on a single goal. They know how to clearly identify obstacles and form step-by-step plans to overcome them. They're obsessed with improving specific skills but judge success only by overall progress made in the world they've decided to conquer -- as realistic or fantastical as it may be. It's precisely these traits that make video-gamers great bodybuilders. Take a moment to laugh, if you must. Now hear us out. Brian Wang and Dick Talens were the stereotypical video-gamers in high school. One was scrawny, the other fat. They grew up playing marathon sessions of ""EverQuest"" and ""Counter-Strike."" ""I literally would wake up and play all day, eating intermittently,"" Talens said. ""OK, when I say intermittently, I mean eating a lot."" But by the time the men met at the University of Pennsylvania in 2004, they had traded an obsession with video gaming for an obsession with weight-lifting. As they shared stories at the gym, they realized their healthy transformation had been easier for them than for most. Why? Because they were -- and would always be -- gamers. ""People don't realize that video games are an expression of personality,"" Talens said. ""There's certain qualities that people have. They're obsessed with improving the stat sheets, getting to the next level; they pay a lot of attention to detail. Guys who play ('World of Warcraft') ... are very intense about whatever they do. They can turn that addiction and all its characteristics into fitness."" It's a theory they're taking to the bank. Talens and Wang are the co-founders of Fitocracy, a website that's turning gaming geeks into fitness geeks. The site has 70,000 users in its beta version and hopes to open to the 60,000 on a waiting list in the next couple months. Fitocracy members can ""level up"" by earning points for their workouts. New levels unlock special challenges or ""quests"" that are designed to push users out of their comfort zones. For example, a runner might have to do yoga, or a bodybuilder might have to tackle a 5K. Still, one has to wonder: What would make a virtual warrior trade in his sword and shield for a pair of dumbbells? The same thing that got him interested in playing video games in the first place, Dr. Scott Rigby says. Rigby and Dr. Richard Ryan are co-authors of the book ""Glued to Games: How Video Games Draw Us In and Hold Us Spellbound."" As experts on human motivation, they have identified basic psychological needs -- similar to physical needs like food, water and sleep -- that video games satisfy. First, Ryan says, is the need to feel competent. In real life, you get the chance to ""level up"" only once every couple years: like when you earn a promotion at work or get married. In games, you always know what you have to do to get to the next level. ""In video games, you're constantly getting information about your achievements and (learning) how to do things better,"" Ryan says. ""There's an opportunity to develop a mastery that's very much a key motivator."" That translates well to fitness, where tracking your accomplishments enables you to progress quicker. You know you've improved when you run an extra mile or dead lift another 50 pounds. A second motivator in video games is the feeling of freedom and autonomy, Rigby says. People like to know they have control over their future. In video games, you can choose your path, the skills you want to improve, even your outfit. Making the same choices in your fitness regimen helps you feel empowered. ""Games make the goals really clear,"" Rigby said. ""You have to run from point A to point B, deliver a message, kill this bad guy. You have a very clear sense of 'If I just do these steps, I will succeed.' And let's call them quests because it sounds heroic. And who doesn't want to feel like a hero?"" Fitocracy user Michael Perry says that what's most important to him is the community on the website, which resembles that of his favorite online game, ""World of Warcraft."" In any massively multiplayer online role-playing game, you work with other players to conquer enemies. Your team expects you to show up and do what needs to be done. He gets the same sense of accountability from the members on Fitocracy. ""When I was playing WoW all the time, I had to make sure everything I was doing was right. I researched it down to the T. I made sure I was hitting spells right at the right time. I wouldn't miss a raid,"" Perry said. ""I think that translates really well to exercise and bodybuilding because you have to have that level of knowledge, (and) you have to have that commitment."" Rigby says the community around online games, or fitness, satisfies one of the last psychological needs: relationships. ""There's a social component to it. ... You're relying on each other. You really need the other person to watch your back and vice versa,"" he said. ""(Games) build in a sense of 'I matter to others; others matter to me.' "" Of course, motivation isn't restricted to video gamers. Everyone has these basic intrinsic psychological needs and can apply them to fitness. Gamers just have an easier time learning the language. ""What video game players have is a certain understanding for how these sort of fitness structures are built: goal-setting, progression, etc."" Rigby said. ""In other words, it's a world that they know."" Take Vin Diesel, one of the buffest men in Hollywood. Diesel used to play ""D&D"" on his days off as a bouncer in one of New York's nightclubs. He contributed the foreword for the book ""30 Years of Adventure: A Celebration of Dungeons & Dragons,"" writing, ""We were all drawn to the game because it allowed us to become these characters, vastly different in appearance and in actions, but what kept us hooked was the search for the character that represented our higher self.""

"The Somali pirates roaming the waters off the Horn of Africa push global trade costs up by billions of dollars per year and severely affect the economic activities of neighboring countries, a new World Bank report has found. Although hijackings in the region have dropped significantly since last year, piracy could still cost the global economy an estimated $18 billion annually, according to the ""Pirates of Somalia: Ending the Threat, Rebuilding a Nation"" report, launched Thursday in the Somali capital of Mogadishu. Read this: Peace concert rocks Mogadishu . The increased costs come as shippers are forced to change trading routes, sending fuel bills soaring, as well as pay higher insurance premiums and security bills for guards on board. But apart from making international trade more expensive, the threat of piracy in one of the world's most important trade gateways is also an economic blow for neighboring East African countries, particularly in the pillar sectors of tourism and fishing, said the report. Since 2006, tourism spending in East African coastal countries has risen 25% more slowly than other sub-Saharan African nations, mainly because of fewer arrivals from high-income citizens of OECD countries. Piracy in the region is thought to have tarnished its image as a stable holiday destination, with visits to impacted East African coastal nations down by nearly 6.5% relative to visits to other countries. According to the World Bank, exports of fish products from piracy-hit countries have also suffered, declining by  23.8% since 2006, the year the report takes as the starting point of piracy. The World Bank defines piracy-affected countries as Comoros, Djibouti, Kenya, Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, the Seychelles, Somalia, Tanzania, as well as Yemen, Pakistan and the countries of the Persian Gulf. Read this: 'New hope for Somalia' The economy of war-torn Somalia, which last September moved closer to stability after electing its first president on home soil in decades, is also severely hit; piracy-related trade costs increase by up to $6 million annually, without considering that potential sea-based economic activities are constrained by piracy. The authors of the report said the solution to ending piracy will only come with the recreation of a functional Somali state and urged the international community to focus on helping the East African county build a viable political system. ""Piracy is a symptom of the breakdown of Somalia's political system,"" said economist and lead author of the report Quy-Toan Do. ""Go after the system, not just the pirates."" According to the report, 1,068 attacks have been carried out by Somali pirates since January 2005. Of these, 218 resulted in successful hijackings, with an estimated $53 million average annual ransom paid. Between 82 and 97 casualties are believed to have occurred as a result of these attacks. Attacks peaked in 2011, but have declined sharply since, largely because of increased mobilization of international naval forces and tighter security adopted by the shipping industry. A report earlier this week by advocacy group Oceans Beyond Piracy said that maritime piracy cost the global economy between $5.7 and $6.1 billion in 2012, much lower than the World Bank figures.","Piracy off the Horn of Africa costs the world economy $18 billion a year, according to a new report .

"Jeb Bush name-checked Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Mark Zuckerberg on Monday while telling University of South Carolina graduates that ""young people and newcomers are often the great discoverers."" The former Florida Republican governor's commencement speech -- short, optimistic and apolitical -- came the day after he'd said he planned to release 250,000 emails from his days in office. He will also write an accompanying eBook that he'll release next year. Bush's preemptive approach is one of the clearest signs yet of how seriously he is considering a run for president and allows him to address potential areas of criticism before opposition researchers dig in. On Monday, Bush made no references to his own political future, but did sound a number of optimistic notes -- and he told the new graduates not to fear failure. He said graduates shouldn't ""be afraid to shake things up,"" and that they should embrace a rapidly changing economy even when doing so is daunting. ""Most of America feels that way -- you're not alone. And in many ways, that's OK. Because that anxiety can be positive,"" he said. ""When you're thrown into new situations, you don't just challenge yourself. You see things that other people might not see."" The point of his speech, Bush said, was to tell graduates to ""dream big, don't be afraid of change and find joy everywhere you can."" And they shouldn't see their ages as impediments, he said. ""Darwin was 29 when he developed the theory of natural selection. Einstein was 26 when he developed the theory of relativity. And Mark Zuckerberg, for crying out loud, was 19 years old when he developed Facebook,"" Bush said. ""They were young. They didn't have assumptions about things. They just wanted to have an impact,"" he said. ""And that's what happens when you're a newcomer -- you make an impact."" Bush said he'd asked his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush, for advice on what to say. Her response: ""Jeb, speak about 10 minutes and then sit down and shut up."" And he did -- tapping his watch as he sat down, as if to note that he'd landed almost exactly on the 10-minute mark. He also made reference to his father, President George H.W. Bush, telling graduates they should try to match the 90-year-old's zeal for life -- from wearing colorful socks to parachuting out of airplanes to ""judging cheerleader competitions for the Houston Texans -- I think that's on his highlight reel for sure."" ""No matter how many challenges you face, no matter how old you get, remember to have fun in life. Be like my dad, who turned 90 years old this year, and here's a guy who's lived a full, active life, he was shot out of the sky in World War II, he built a business, he served a generation of time in many different positions in public service, and he's had some incredibly painful losses in his life, but he has never stopped having fun,"" Bush said. ""That's why he's my favorite person in the world of all time, and I suspect it's why many others respect and admire him as well.""","Former Florida Gov.

"Kenya swore in its youngest-ever president Tuesday before a massive crowd, including numerous heads of state and American civil rights activist Jesse Jackson. Uhuru Kenyatta became the country's fourth president after a prolonged election dispute that ended up in the Kenyan Supreme Court. Tens of thousands of people packed a Nairobi stadium Tuesday to watch the inauguration. Jackson, a former U.S. presidential candidate, attended the festivities as a private guest. Kenyatta, the 51-year-old son of Kenya's founding leader, won the election with 50.07% of the vote. His chief rival, Raila Odinga, won 43.31% of the vote. Odinga challenged the outcome in court, saying it was flawed and marred by technical problems. After the court upheld Kenyatta's election, Odinga offered the president-elect his congratulations. ""The court has now spoken,"" Odinga said. ""I wish the president-elect and his team well."" Political dynasty . Kenyatta and Odinga are the sons of the nation's first president and vice president, respectively -- stirring memories of a political dynasty that dates back to the 1960s. Their fathers started out as allies in the quest for Kenyan independence from Britain. But the elder politicians' relationship ended in bad blood when founding President Jomo Kenyatta forced out his vice president, Jaramogi Odinga, following a series of disputes. A new opportunity for Kenya . Despite controversy over the recent election results, the mutual acceptance by the two sons could help restore the nation's image as a bastion of stability after disputed election results in 2007 led to bloody chaos. In that election, more than 1,200 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced after Odinga disputed the results, which showed incumbent President Mwai Kibaki as the winner. At the time, supporters of both candidates battled in the streets with crude weapons, not in court. Complicated relations . But the upholding of Kenyatta's victory raises the prospect of complicated diplomatic ties with the West. The International Criminal Court has indicted him for allegedly funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks in the last election in 2007. His running mate, William Ruto, also faces ICC charges at The Hague, in the Netherlands. Both have denied the charges and have said they will cooperate with the court to clear their names. Clashes kill 2 in Western Kenya after election verdict . Beyond borders . Kenya is East Africa's biggest economy and a crucial trade route into the rest of the continent. It provides an important buffer of stability in a region that includes the fledgling Somali government and the politically tense Sudan and South Sudan. Kenya is also a major U.S. ally in the war against Islamist militants in the region and has remained relatively peaceful amid civil wars in neighboring nations.","Uhuru Kenyatta is Kenya's fourth and youngest president .

"Three years ago, a woman gave birth to premature triplets in a small village clinic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  The doctors were not equipped to provide the medical care these tiny patients required, so the parents were told the babies would simply be left to die. But the triplets' father had heard about a new, state-of-the-art hospital just up the road built by Congolese American and former NBA star Dikembe Mutombo.  The father begged the doctors to call the United States. ""So they called me, and they said, 'Mr. Mutombo, there's three babies coming from one person. Can we take them? The man doesn't work; the wife doesn't work.' I said, 'Please, make them live.' "" Mutombo says that phone call is just one example of why he decided to open a hospital in his hometown of Kinshasa. Built with funds raised through his Dikembe Mutombo Foundation, the hospital bears the name of his mother, Biamba Marie Mutombo, who he says taught him the importance of helping others. ""For everything she did for her children and for her family, the value of love and giving back and sharing. Not just with you, not just with your family, but with the people you encounter in life, with your community, and that was the kind of love that my mom gave."" According to an International Rescue Committee study, 5.4 million people have died from war-related causes in the Congo since 1998, making it the deadliest conflict since World War II. Sadly, the outpouring of love taught by Mutombo's mother was cut short when his parents' city came under attack in 1998. Mutombo says that after shooting in the streets, soldiers enforced a curfew and prevented his father from taking his ailing mother to a nearby hospital. About an hour later, his beloved mother died in her living room. For Mutombo, his mom was no less a victim than if she had been shot herself. She's just one of the millions who have died in this civil war whose deaths, he believes, were preventable.  ""There was people who wasn't killed by the gunfight, but they were denied access to the health care,"" he said. ""If there was no chaos in the capital city of Kinshasa, my mom would be alive. ""She had no reason to die."" Mutombo hopes his hospital will help provide medical care desperately needed in the Congo. He says the hospital has treated more than 30,000 patients and employs nearly 400 doctors and nurses. And those triplets? They spent more than three months on life-saving machines and now are thriving toddlers. The parents were so grateful that they named the babies after the 7-foot, 2-inch basketball player. Mutombo laughed as he recalled the story. ""The guy said, 'You saved my babies. So your family gets all the names.' And I said, 'But they're going to get confused on the street one day and think they're my kids!' "" Mutombo's hospital also hired the triplets' father as a sanitation worker so the family can afford to pay for the care their children need. ""You're talking about impact. That's the impact that we are making,""  Mutombo said with a smile. ""We are touching lives. We are changing the living conditions of the people."" He says the next issue he wants to tackle in the Congo is education. ""Half of the population in Africa right now is under the age of 15 years old,"" Mutombo said. ""But we are not finding the time to educate those people because of the violence."" In the next few years, Mutombo hopes to build a school in the Congolese village where his parents grew up.  He says he will name the school in memory of his father, who devoted his entire career to education.","A phone call to former NBA star Dikembe Mutombo saves triplets in The Congo .

"The European Union's foreign policy chief said Sunday there is ""no guarantee"" a comprehensive nuclear agreement with Iran will work out. Catherine Ashton spoke to reporters alongside Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at a news conference in Tehran. ""I have been engaged in discussions with Iran for nearly four years, and I think this interim agreement is really, really important, but not as important as a comprehensive agreement that we are currently engaged in,"" she said, according to published remarks. ""Difficult, challenging, there is no guarantee it will succeed, but I think it's very important with the support of the people of Iran for the work that is going on by the minister and his team and with the support of the international community for my work that we should aim to try and succeed."" In November, Iran and six world powers forged an interim deal, under which Iran agreed to roll back parts of its nuclear program in return for relief from some sanctions. That agreement went into effect in January. The challenge now is to reach a permanent deal acceptable to all sides. The next round of talks between the so-called P5+1 -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany -- and Iran will start next week in Vienna. Ashton's two-day visit to Tehran is the first official visit by an EU foreign policy chief since 2008, according to Iran's Press TV. Besides Zarif, she met with President Hassan Rouhani and other top political and civil leaders. ""One of the things that's been very clear is the support that is given across the political spectrum for the work that is going on currently in Vienna to try and move forward on a comprehensive agreement. ""That does not mean that we'll get an agreement. It does not mean that people have committed to any possible outcome at this stage. But I have had a real sense that people are committed to wanting to see the talks happen and that, I think, is encouraging of itself,"" Ashton said.

"President Barack Obama offered a bullish assessment of his war on Islamic terrorists in Syria and Iraq on Monday, even as he acknowledged small gains by ISIS would mean the U.S. engagement there will be prolonged. Speaking inside a New Jersey airplane hangar with a massive Navy C-130 as his backdrop, Obama said the U.S. was ""hammering these terrorists"" by taking out supply chains and disrupting the network's command structure. ""We have blunted their momentum and put them on the defensive,"" Obama said. ""They may think that they can chalk up some quick victories, but our reach is long,"" he said. ""We do not give up. You threaten America, you will have no safe haven. We will find you, and like petty tyrants and terrorists before you, the world is going to leave you behind and keep moving on without you, because we will get you."" Obama flew to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, near Trenton, to offer his thanks to U.S. military personnel, many of whom have served in combat zones. He said the 3,000 troops who filled the hangar they were like ""Santa in fatigues"" for the work they had carried out on behalf of the United States. During his remarks he noted his efforts to wind down the war in Afghanistan, where the U.S. combat mission will conclude at year's end. The Obama administration initially said 9,800 troops would remain in Afghanistan next year, but earlier this month, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the number would include up to 1,000 additional troops. Hagel said the increased force would help provide ""flexibility"" as the U.S. works to maintain security in the country, which has been beset by a resurgence in Taliban attacks. ""This month, America's war in Afghanistan will come to a responsible end,"" Obama said. ""That doesn't mean that everything's great in Afghanistan. Afghanistan is still a very dangerous place."" In New Jersey Obama was greeted by Republican Gov. Chris Christie, a vocal critic of Obama who has still maintained a amiable relationship with the President. The pair shook hands and spoke for more than a minute on the military tarmac where Air Force One landed on Monday afternoon, before proceeding together to the airplane hanger where Obama delivered his address. Christie, who is considering a run for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, drew fire from fellow Republicans when he hugged Obama during a tour of Hurricane Sandy aftermath in 2012. That outing featured a football throwing contest on the Asbury Park boardwalk; Obama said Monday he wanted a ""rematch"" with the governor.","President Barack Obama traveled to Fort Dix, New Jersey, on Monday to visit troops .

"""When the Ebola outbreak started, it was very terrifying for everybody,"" recalls Michael Chu'no Ike from Nsukka in Nigeria's Enugu State. ""People were afraid it could be transmitted by air and started believing all sorts of rumors about how to boost their immunity."" The virus has killed over 5,100 people worldwide, eight of which have been in Nigeria. While his home country has been declared Ebola free, Ike is creating a voice messaging system to raise awareness about the killer disease in the worst effected countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. ""Over 70% of people in West Africa live in rural and semi-urban areas,"" explains Ike, founder of the HaltEbola mobile service. ""These groups usually do not have access to internet but they have good mobile phone coverage. Therefore, we saw the effectiveness in using the oldest means of communication -- voice -- to reach people."" Ike's vision is to reach people who are afraid to call authorities and ask for help -- the plan is that citizens will receive a call from HaltEbola, but instead of getting advice from a foreign doctor, they will hear a recorded message from local celebrities. ""We have connected with George Weah, the retired Liberian footballer, and we hope to get him involved soon,"" Ike explains. ""People can listen to community leaders more than doctors,"" he claims. ""That's the reality, and to tackle this disease, we need to confront the reality."" The HaltEbola concept impressed judges on the West African Venture Bus, a mobile initiative that travels across Africa connecting entrepreneurs with investors. Ike and his team won the first prize -- particularly fitting given that the competition was nearly scrapped because of fears of contestants contracting Ebola. Communications is key . Ike's messaging platform is, however, just one of the many homegrown initiatives developed and rolled out across West Africa to raise awareness and prevent the spread of Ebola -- from mobile apps and education campaigns to catchy songs and multi-million dollar private donations, Africans are at the forefront of the war against the virus. In Senegal, the ministry of health adapted a novel public health messaging platform designed to educate people about diabetes after the confirmation of the country first's and only case of Ebola. As a result, four million SMS messages were sent to the public warning of the dangers of the disease.  And it worked -- the virus was stopped in its tracks and the World Health Organisation pointed to effective communications when explaining why Senegal succeeded in stamping out Ebola. And in Nigeria a system called UReport has been praised for de-bunking myths about Ebola. Developed by UNICEF, the technology allows citizens to ask questions and get replies in real-time. The added feature is that users can re-broadcast those answers to friends and relatives via SMS. According to Aboubacar Kampo, UNICEF Nigeria's chief of health, the free tool saw the number of subscribers double within first 24 hours of the Ebola outbreak, because of the accuracy of information available on the platform. It was partly due to experts commenting on UReport that citizens started rejecting advice that salt water can protect against the virus -- a hoax which lead to the deaths of at least two people. In Liberia, a text-message system aimed at health workers on the frontline is also gaining traction. Launched by the country's ministry of health and UNICEF, mHero (Mobile Health Worker Ebola Response and Outreach) connects the ministry and health workers in real time by broadcasting messages about care and prevention. The platform also lets health workers know when their hazard pay is available as well as the status of dead bodies in communities. ""Liberians themselves have been at the frontlines of the fight against Ebola from the very beginning while the country waited for international support to materialize,"" explains Saran Kaba Jones, founder of FACE Africa, a group working to improve access to clean water in rural parts of the country. ""The will is there,"" she continues. ""People want to kick Ebola out of their communities, and ultimately they are the ones who are best positioned to do so. So we need to provide them with more resources like mHero."" Musical teaching . Liberia, the hardest hit country in the Ebola outbreak, has also gone on to implement more creative education campaigns. Health officials have teamed up with local musicians to create a catchy way of highlighting the risks of Ebola in a country where roughly half of the population is under 18. Over the thumping techno beat, the chorus runs: ""Ebola is real, it's time to protect yourself, Ebola is real, protect your family..."" And before Bob Geldof announced a new version of the charity single ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" focused on Ebola, famous African musicians including Tiken Jah Fakoly and Amadou & Mariam recorded a song to help raise awareness about the virus. ""Africa Stop Ebola"" is performed in French and regional dialects, and the lyrics are a message about what citizens can do to stop Ebola spreading. Pan-African fund . Funding is key for the growth of messaging platforms and mass public health programs. African business leaders from sectors including banking and mining came together recently, and committed $28.5 million and logistical support at a meeting in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa. The fund, which will be managed by the African Development Bank -- which has provided over $220 million in support -- and overseen by the African Union, will be used to support doctors, nurses and lab technicians. ""The funding is part of a long-term roadmap for the post-outbreak reconstruction of the affected countries,"" explains Harvard Kennedy School Professor Calestous Juma who attended the talks. ""What I saw at the roundtable was a strong sense of collective responsibility and focus on getting the job done."" This pledge may be the largest to date from Africa's private-sector, but it is not the first. In October, Patrice Motsepe founder of African Rainbow Minerals (ARM) and South Africa's first black billionaire, donated $1 million to the Ebola Fund in Guinea. Spotlight on Africa . Despite these cash injections, Ugandan-born social entrepreneur Tms Ruge says support for for local initiatives remains thin. ""Very little of Africa's front line efforts to stop the spread of Ebola is visible in Western Media and as a result, very little material support is going to these organizations,"" he wrote in a recent blog post. It is for this reason he formed the Africa Responds website to promote the work of four community organizations working on the ground in Liberia -- THINK, HOPE, FACE Africa and Africare. ""We, as Africans, have to break the mentality that responding to crises on our continent is the mandate of the international community,"" wrote Ruge. ""It will be Africans themselves who win this war on the ground.""","The deadly Ebola virus has killed over 5,100 people worldwide during this outbreak .

"The mayor of Bolivia's largest city is in trouble for groping a journalist at a public event last week. In a video that's gone viral, Santa Cruz Mayor Percy Fernandez is seen placing his hand on the thigh of journalist Mercedes Guzman April 30. The UNO network journalist is first seen on the video greeting the mayor in the traditional Latin-American style, with a kiss on the cheek. When she sits down in her assigned seat next to him, Fernandez, 75, puts his hand on her leg. For a brief moment, there's a bit of a struggle as the journalist tries to get the mayor's hand off her thigh. The video was aired by Gigavision, a Bolivian TV network. It's not the first time Fernandez's advances have been seen on video. In 2012 he was caught on camera -- also at a public event -- touching city council President Desireé Bravo's bottom twice. Lupe Cajías, president of the La Paz Association of Journalists, denounced the latest incident and strongly criticized the mayor. ""On one hand, I think it reflects the arrogance of power; and on the other hand, a lack of control of (the mayor's) own actions. The two things are probably related.  If you think there's no boundaries because you're above good and evil, then you can grab a journalist's leg or talk with double-meaning in front of the camera without shame,"" Cajías said. After a public outcry and complaints by Guzman's family, the mayor's office sent a video to Santa Cruz media in which Fernandez apologizes for the incident. ""I'm worried that I might've disrespected you while you were performing your duties.  I apologize again to you and your dignified family,"" Fernandez says on the video. Mario Espíndola, the journalist's husband, accepted the apology but said Fernandez's behavior is going well beyond just unpleasant and embarrassing moments.  ""We all obviously want Percy Fernandez to stop doing that because ultimately him, as mayor, is the one who loses the most,"" Espíndola said. But some say the apology was not enough, that it was forced and insincere. Opposition lawmaker Marcela Revollo filed a complaint accusing Fernandez of sexual harassment, sexual violence and discrimination. ""We consider this an expression of violence against all Bolivian women, considering that the mayor's actions have happened before,"" Revollo said after filing the complaint. It's not yet known if prosecutors will call Fernandez to answer to the charges. Fernandez is one of the country's most popular mayors. First elected in 2010 to represent the city of 1.5 million people, he's expected to run for another five-year term in 2015. Pagina Siete, a Bolivian newspaper, published a survey Monday showing that the Santa Cruz leader is at the top of a list of popular mayors in Bolivia. In February, President Evo Morales called Fernandez ""the best mayor in Bolivia"" and appeared with him at a public event. There has been no reaction from the president's office regarding the latest incident and no indication of whether the president still endorses the embattled mayor.","Santa Cruz mayor has been seen making similar advances on video before .

"The Senate passed a spending bill to fund the government through next September — so why haven't they gone home yet? Here's a look at what lawmakers could get done before they can hit the road and head home for the holidays. So what's left on the agenda for Congress? The Senate has to confirm about two dozen nominations, including some higher profile candidates for key administration spots. There are also two major policy items that remain unfinished — a reauthorization of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), a law that helps insurance companies cover Americans in case of terrorist attacks, and the extension of a package of tax breaks that expired in 2013. The House-passed version of TRIA remains somewhat controversial among Senate Democrats and Republican Sen. Tom Coburn, so its future is unclear. And though Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has indicated he'd like to extend those breaks, he hasn't yet given a timeline for action. Didn't Democrats already approve most of those nominees this weekend? They did clear procedural hurdles on most of those nominees during their rare Saturday session — an unintended consequence of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's insistence that the Senate stick around and vote on the constitutionality of Obama's executive action on deportations. The conservative troublemaker was hoping to emphasize GOP frustration with Obama, but instead drew the ire of his colleagues by making them stick around on a Saturday, and by opening the door for Democrats to get a lot of the work of confirming those nominees out of the way. RELATED: Senate sends spending bill to Obama, avoiding government shutdown . Will they get all two dozen nominees confirmed? Many face minimal opposition, but there is a chance that the mere volume of work could leave some of the candidates unconfirmed, if fatigued lawmakers choose to get out of town and home to their families rather than tackle the less important nominees. But Tony Blinken, Obama's nominee for deputy secretary of State, has drawn GOP opposition for comments he made lauding Iraq's stability. Republicans might also make some noise over Sara Saldana, who was nominated to head Customs and Immigration Enforcement, as a way to show their distaste for Obama's executive action on deportations. But those other two items seem pretty straight forward — why are they still up in the air? The controversies surrounding TRIA and the tax extenders bill are in the details. A number of Senate Democrats oppose TRIA because it includes a provision that rolls back a part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill, much the same reason Democrats in both the House and the Senate opposed the government funding bill this weekend. And Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma known for his outspoken commitment to fiscal responsibility, objects to a provision that creates a new federal bureau dealing with insurance companies without allowing states to opt out of it. Coburn is so staunchly opposed, he's said he doesn't mind if it expires and the new GOP-led Senate has to take it up in January. The tax extenders bill is simply an extension of more than 50 tax breaks that expired at the end of last year, and while some lawmakers say the short-term extension creates uncertainty for businesses down the line, it's largely uncontroversial. That seems the more likely of the two to happen this week. But votes don't typically take that long, and the Senate's first votes on Monday aren't scheduled until 5:30 p.m. How are they going to fill all that downtime? By saying goodbye. With 11 senators retiring or leaving after losing this cycle, all are taking their final moments on the Senate floor to thank their colleagues and reminisce on their time in office. Most have said their farewells already, but there may be more tributes to come this week.","The Senate still has around two dozen nominees and two policy items to consider .

"Beijing (CNN)China's 1.3 billion citizens may soon find it much harder to belt out their national anthem at will. A series of rules proposed by the government will set strict limits on when, where and how ""March of the Volunteers"" -- the anthem of the People's Republic since 1949 -- can be performed, state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday. The anthem is not allowed to be played or sung at private weddings and funerals, dancing parties, commercial events, or any other setting with ""an inappropriate atmosphere."" When singing the anthem, people should dress appropriately, stand still and be full of energy, according to the government. Follow the rhythm . The rules then get technical: People must sing the powerful marching song in its entirety, enunciate every word and follow the rhythm. No one is permitted to start or stop singing midway -- and altering the melody, lyrics or musical arrangement is forbidden. No whispering, applauding or talking on the phone, either, while the anthem is played. There is no official word, yet, on how violators would be punished. While some of those rules sound reasonable, others may be overly harsh, especially to Americans who are used to hearing adaptations of ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as varied as Jimi Hendrix's instrumental rock version at the Woodstock music festival, to Whitney Houston's soulful rendition before the Super Bowl. Creative alternatives . Despite the government effort, Chinese people still seem to appreciate creative interpretations of their normally standardized national anthem. At an airport ceremony welcoming the visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping this past summer, a Venezuelan military band -- led by trumpeters going either artistic or astray -- played a refreshingly different ""March of the Volunteers"" with a new tune, an extra section and a bit of jazz flair. While the leaders appeared unfazed on the tarmac, video of the Venezuelan performance quickly went viral across Chinese cyberspace. Upon learning the new anthem decree, most Chinese Internet users seem to be taking it in stride. One widely re-posted comment deadpans: ""At least banning the national anthem at funerals makes sense, as the first verse 'Arise! All those who refuse to be slaves!' would be so inappropriate. Singing that line to an open casket would just be creepy!""","Anthem not allowed to be played or sung in settings with ""an inappropriate atmosphere""

"(CNN) -- When most people think of South Sudan, if they think of it at all, they imagine poverty and war. They imagine a world and people that are far removed from the everyday life that most of us reading this are lucky enough to enjoy. But that was not my experience in the world's youngest nation. What I saw on my three trips through South Sudan were people just like you and me. People with desires and needs. People in love. Mothers and fathers. Sisters and brothers. Friends and enemies. People with resilience, determination. But above all -- hope. A year ago Monday, conflict again erupted in South Sudan. Since then, thousands of people have been killed, nearly 2 million people have been forced to flee their homes, and 6 million South Sudanese -- almost half the country -- have found themselves in desperate need of aid. Last week, as I traveled through Mingkaman, a small village in South Sudan's Lakes state, with the aid organization Oxfam, I met people whose lives have been turned upside down by conflict over the last year, but who still haven't lost their belief that things can get better. At a camp for people who had crossed the Nile to escape the violence that destroyed their homes, a middle-aged Dinka man, who was easily 7 feet tall, told me that armed men had stolen all of his cows -- his main source of income. When I offered my sympathy for his loss, he smiled and said, ""Don't worry, I will get more cows."" Indeed, much of the story of South Sudan is a story of hope. When the country gained independence in 2011 after more than half a century of war, people danced and cried with joy in the streets as they looked forward to a future of peace and development. CNN Photos: A nation on the brink of an abyss . Through the valiant efforts of the South Sudanese people and support from the international community and organizations like Oxfam, things were getting better. New roads were paved, communities without access to clean water saw wells drilled, and violence was drastically reduced. Tens of thousands of young girls were receiving education for the first time. Things were changing for the better. But then last December, a power struggle between the country's president and vice president turned violent and led to a skirmish between some of their supporters that has wreaked havoc across the country. Church leaders and civil society groups have appealed for peace and reconciliation. People I met are opposed to -- and terrified by -- what's happening. But as the summer's rains have ended and the roads are once again passable, the fighting has resumed and is likely to get worse in the coming weeks. Although the conflict has taken on an ethnic tone, people I spoke with were at pains to tell me that this wasn't a conflict between the Dinka and Nuer tribes, who have lived together, worked together, and intermarried for generations. Standing in the midst of rows of newly planted tomatoes, one Dinka man took a break from weeding to tell me that he believed in a peaceful future for South Sudan -- but not without greater action from the international community. ""When you have problems within your family,"" he told me, ""you sometimes can't solve it yourself; you need someone from outside to come in and help you reconcile."" His words were echoed by so many South Sudanese I spoke with, who highlighted the special role of the United States in helping the country achieve peace and gain its independence, and asked for America's assistance again now. As we mark one year since the start of this terrible conflict, we have to do more to support South Sudanese peacemakers and pressure the country's leaders to stop fighting. The resilience of the people of South Sudan can only go so far without a political solution to this conflict. Even now when I think of South Sudan, I don't think of war. I don't think of poverty and children with AK-47s. All of this exists within the country, but I think of the confident cattle herder who believes he will regain his lost cows, even in the face of such despair. I think of the many pregnant young women I met, who were excited for their future and the future of their children, hoping that it would include peace and a chance for a good education. But most of all I think about the many incredible people I met who have lost everything they have in the world, but still manage to keep going and keep hoping for peace. It is for those people that the U.S. must act to keep that hope alive. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.","A year ago, war broke out in the world's newest nation, South Sudan .

"North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un hasn't been seen at a public event for three weeks, including a prominent state meeting that he has attended every year since coming to power in late 2011. On Thursday, Kim was conspicuously absent from the Supreme People's Assembly, which is North Korea's parliament attended by officials of the party, the military and various national organizations. A prominent seat remained empty on stage surrounded by North Korea's top brass. Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea? ""We expected to see him at the Supreme People's Assembly, because he had attended that session every time,"" said Yoo Ho-Yeol, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University in Seoul. ""So we are speculating that he might have problems in his health."" On Thursday, North Korean state TV referred to Kim, saying, ""The wealth and prosperity of our socialism is thanks to the painstaking efforts of our marshal, who keeps lighting the path for the people, like the flicker of a flame, despite suffering from discomfort."" 'Abundant evidence' of crimes against humanity in North Korea, panel says . The 31-year-old leader's absence has fueled speculation that Kim has a health problem, as some observers have pointed to weight gain, as well as a limp when he was seen walking in July. Korea's state-run news agency, KCNA, routinely catalogs Kim's activities and public appearances. A count of KCNA announcements about Kim's public appearances went from 24 events in July to 16 in August. It dwindled to just one event in September. His last listed public appearance was a September 3 concert, which he attended with his wife Ri Sol Ju, according to KCNA. North Korea: 'We were forced to eat grass and soil' While it's difficult to know what's happening in North Korea, the absence of its leader from public view has given hints in the past. ""We had that kind of occasion when Kim Jong Il was seriously sick in 2008,"" said Yoo. That year, the elder Kim's absence from parades and national events raised questions about the leader's health. U.S. and South Korean intelligence believed that Kim Jong Il had suffered severe health problems and possibly a stroke. Kim died at the age of 69, in December 2011, and his son assumed command.

"(CNN) -- Scientists say a very rare find of some 20 fossilized pterodactyls has produced the first clear evidence of a controversial theory of evolution. This image shows the fossilized skeleton of Darwinopterus which was found in north-east China earlier this year. The fossils were found in northeast China earlier this year, embedded in rock dating back 160 million years, and have been called ""Darwinopterus"" after the renowned naturalist Charles Darwin. The creature's discovery has astounded scientists because their age puts them within two recognized groups of pterodactyls -- primitive long-tailed forms and advanced short-tail forms -- and they display characteristics of both. The combination of features indicates that the primitive pterodactyls evolved relatively quickly, and that certain groups of features changed at the same time. Traditional evolutionary theory suggests that one feature -- a tail for instance -- would slowly evolve over time. ""Darwinopterus came as quite a shock to us,"" said David Unwin, from the University of Leicester's School of Museum Studies, which identified the creature, along with researchers from the Geological Institute of Beijing. ""We had always expected a gap-filler with typically intermediate features such as a moderately elongate tail -- neither long nor short -- but the strange thing about Darwinopterus is that it has a head and neck just like that of advanced pterosaurs, while the rest of the skeleton, including a very long tail, is identical to that of primitive forms,"" he said. By comparing the fossil with others from earlier and later periods, scientists have been able to sketch a rough timeline of the pterodactyl's progression. ""The head and neck evolved first, followed later by the body, tail, wings and legs,"" Unwin said. The researchers say more study is needed to substantiate the idea of that evolution could occur relatively quickly, and that whole parts of a plant or animal's body could change at once. The fossils indicate Darwinopterus was about the size of a crow, with long jaws, sharp, pointed teeth and a flexible neck. It had ""hawk-like"" qualities, scientists say, which allowed the creature to kill and eat smaller, feathered dinosaurs which would later evolve into birds. Pterodactyls were prevalent during the Mesozoic Era between 220 and 65 million years ago. The research has been published in the ""Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences.""","Researchers say rare fossil find provides evidence of one theory of evolution .

"(CNN) -- Seriously, how is this not already huge in the United States? According to The Daily Mail, selfie sticks are the must-have gift this season in Britain. The pole is used to extend camera phones more than three feet away, thus allowing users to take group selfies, panoramic shots and the like. Thousands have already been purchased in the United Kingdom. No surprise, given that 2014 is the year of the selfie -- at least, according to Twitter. Selfie sticks first took off in Asia and, according to the Daily Mail, gained popularity among extreme sports enthusiasts who started using it as a way to capture images of themselves in action. The Daily Mail reported that ""The most basic is simply as extendable pole, meaning the selfie-taker sets the phone timer to take a picture. But more advanced versions from Â£14.99 have Bluetooth shutter releases on the handles which link to your smart phone, meaning you can control exactly when you take your picture."" It's that Bluetooth system that caused South Korean officials to ban the use of ""unregulated"" selfie sticks and to declare that they might be hazardous to other devices. Liana Satenstein recently wrote about the device for Vogue under the headline ""The #SelfieStick May Be the Most Shameless Fashion Accessory Ever."" ""The selfie stick may seem solely for the extremely self-involved, but before you point fingers, or sticks, I'm not the only one using it,"" Satenstein wrote. ""Look up #selfiestick on Instagram and almost 40,000 results of beaming couples and families holding the device appear.""

According to the contest's Web site, 117 of the spellers speak languages other than English, and English was not the first language of 33 of the spellers. The first National Spelling Bee was in 1925 and featured nine contestants. In an event that has seen contestants visibly crack under the strain of the national spotlight in past years, Shivashankar -- competing in her fourth national finals -- appeared composed throughout. As she spelled words that included ""phoresy,"" ""hydrargyrum"" and ""huisache,"" she calmly went through the routine of asking each word's pronunciations, origin and roots before ticking them off for the judges. Her father, who is her spelling coach, would tap his foot in time as she spelled the words and at one point appeared so confident that he waved to someone while his daughter was in the middle of spelling a word. Second-place finisher Tim Ruiter of Reston, Virginia, bowed out after misspelling ""Maecenas,"" a generous patron of the arts. Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden, was in the audience to watch the finals, which were nationally televised on ABC. Shivashankar attends California Trail Junior High School.

"(CNN) -- Will Congress reform the CIA? The question seems urgent now that the Senate Intelligence Committee has released a damning report about the use of interrogation methods by the Central Intelligence Agency in the years that followed the tragic attacks on 9/11. The committee reported that the CIA had used extensive forms of ""enhanced interrogation,"" misleading the White House and Congress about what was going on. Waterboarding, mock executions, rectal feeding, sleep deprivation and threats of rape were all part of the program. Not only did the tactics appear to violate acceptable and maybe legal standards of interrogation, but, according to the committee, they were not effective in obtaining necessary information. Now the question that faces Congress is: Will there be reforms to make sure that this does not happen again? There have been a variety of proposals put onto the table, ranging from the appointment of an independent prosecutor to look into the role of high-level Bush administration officials to strict prohibitions on the kinds of facilities that the CIA can maintain to compensation for victims of enhanced interrogation. Former President Bill Clinton said that the nation needs to ""keep pushing"" on this. Gergen: CIA chief Brennan, more credible than torture report? Reform is not impossible. There have been periods of true change. In the 1970s, the shocking findings of Sen. Frank Church's committee on intelligence activities, such as the fact that the CIA had been involved in assassination attempts and spied on U.S. citizens, produced reform. Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which put constraints on federal agents. In contrast, though, the chances for that kind of action today are extraordinarily slim. Despite then editorials and op-eds calling for something to be done, it is difficult to expect any real changes resulting from this report. Why is this case? Why does something so shocking have so little effect? Why are we unlikely to see a repeat of the 1970s when the revelation of rogue unaccountable intelligence agents doing bad things created political pressure for genuine changes? The most important factor is that when it comes to national security, fear usually triumphs over almost everything else. The mid-1970s, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate, were exceptions. As the historians Fred Logevall and Craig Campbell captured in their excellent book ""America's Cold War,"" electoral politics usually moves voters toward favoring militaristic solutions. Politicians in both parties manipulate the anxieties of voters rather than their hopes. This time is no different. Policymakers have been doing this since the 2002 midterm elections when some Republicans blasted Democrats as weak on defense for opposing President George W. Bush's homeland security proposals. Popular culture has also been extremely kind to torture. Americans have been bombarded with a barrage of movies and television shows where agents are seen extracting vital information through devious means. Cheney had no regrets: 'I would do it again in a minute' In the television show ""24,"" Jack Bauer used whatever means necessary to save the world from terrorists. In the movie ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" torture is shown as allowing U.S. agents to find and kill Osama bin Laden. Sen. Dianne Feinstein had criticized the film for shaping public opinion ""in a disturbing and misleading manner."" There have not been as many shows, such as ""Scandal,"" that depict the dark side of intelligence agents (in their case, the supersecret agency B-613). We also have a public that in the post-9/11 era that has grown so cynical about what the government does and what it is capable of doing, that nothing seems to shock any more. With each new revelation comes another round of complaint and lament, but the public rarely makes this a central issue when comes time to vote. The outrage that followed the Church Committee seems quaint. According to a Associated Press/OCR poll, Americans have become much more accepting of torture. Fifty percent of Americans polled in August 2013 said that torture was sometimes justified. Nor can we expect anything of the scale and scope of CIA reform from a Congress that can barely pass a budget. There has already been an intense partisan divide in the response to the report, with some in the GOP warning that this will bring great danger to the party. Even many Democrats are not that eager to take this on. Then there is President Barack Obama, who despite entering the White House on a campaign in 2008 that challenged President Bush's policies, has not done that much to transform them. To be sure, he did announce early in his presidency that he would not accept the use of torture and issued a statement last week saying that the tactics described in the current report did not reflect the nation's values. The torture ban was a hugely important change, but many skeptics still wonder whether that will be tough enough to prevent this from happening again. As Steve Mufson recounted in The Washington Post, Obama rejected creating a ""truth commission"" to investigate the CIA's use of torture or the pursuit of any criminal prosecutions. In other areas, such as NSA surveillance and drone strikes, he has strengthened Bush-era policies. There are many controversial techniques that are still permissible, such as force feeding prisoners on hunger strikes and lengthy, intense periods of solitary confinement. So it's probably best not to expect much from Washington. This is not the 1970s, and the chances for substantive reform are not good. It is a safe bet that the CIA will probably continue to engage in versions of these tactics for many years to come.","Julian Zelizer: Last week's report on CIA activities revealed abuses that can't be repeated .

The word spread so successfully, Clooney told Walters in 2006 that he no longer had to tell women he dated that he planned on staying single. ""You did my work for me,"" he told her. Snagging the perennial bachelor is what grasped the ""most fascinating"" title for his wife. ""Amazingly, Amal has been the subject of very little snark or envy,"" Walters said.

"A Quran teacher in central Somalia was the fifth beheading victim in one week at the hands of Al-Shabaab, the al Qaeda-linked militant group based in Somalia. ""The Quran teacher was snatched from his house in Qandho by Al-Shabaab militants on Friday and they dumped his headless, beheaded body near his home town on Saturday morning,"" local town spokesman Abdiaziz Durow told CNN. The teacher was identified as Mohamed Hussein, 45, a resident of the Qandho near the besieged town of Bulo Burde, 217 miles north of Mogadishu in central Somalia. ""The reason the Quran teacher was murdered is that he was one of the few residents that refused orders from Al-Shabaab to leave his village that was recently seized by Somali and AU troops,"" Durow said. Al-Shabaab had warned local residents to leave their houses in the towns they have seized, according to Durow. Last week, the militant group abducted and beheaded two Somali policewomen in the city of Teyeglow, located in the southwest region. The beheadings prompted a government soldier whose wife was among the victims to kill five Al-Shabaab wives in retaliation. Al-Shabaab also beheaded two government soldiers near the town of Bur Hakaba in the Bay region in south Somalia. Al-Shabaab is a Somali group that was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government in March 2008. It is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state. The group is believed to be responsible for attacks in Somalia that have killed international aid workers, journalists, civilian leaders and African Union peacekeepers.","Officials say Al-Shabaab is responsible for five beheadings .

"It's the second most common cancer for men worldwide, but prostate cancer remains difficult to diagnose, with standard blood tests criticized for delivering a high rate of false positives. But in a study presented in May this year, trained detection dogs were able to identify prostate cancer from a few sniffs of a urine sample with a staggering 98% accuracy, with few false positives. Although the study is by no means conclusive, it joins a growing body of research suggesting dogs could be able to smell out cancers. However, there are numerous practical problems in using dogs to detect cancers in a medical setting (not least training, consistency and identifying exactly which chemicals the dogs are detecting), which is why scientists are seeking to harness the potential detection ability of man's best friend through the development of an ""electronic nose"" capable of making a diagnosis. 'Easily sniffed' Finnish researchers are using a device that conducts molecular analysis of the atmosphere in the ""headspace"" above urine samples, and tests it for the volatile organic compounds associated with prostate cancer. In a study published earlier this year, the method had a detection rate of 78%, and a specificity (the probability of the test being negative when cancer is absent) of 67%. ""We see molecules at the stages when the tumor is very small,"" said lead investigator Dr. Niku Oksala, of the University of Tampere. ""We can also find whether it is aggressive or benign to know what action is needed."" Oksala's team is continuing to refine the method, such as through removing impurities for cleaner sample analysis, but he believes the principle is reliable and can be applied to many other cancers. ""We have found there are over 30 molecule compounds in a tumor that are very smelly and easily sniffed. Eventually this can be used as a test for every cancer in the Western world,"" he added. Around the world, similar approaches are being applied to offer simple diagnosis for the world's greatest killers. In 2011, the Gates Foundation announced funding for a battery-operated electronic nose prototype in India that functions as a breathalyzer test for tuberculosis. The ""NaNose"" is being developed by the Israeli Technion Institute, claiming 90% accuracy in detecting lung cancer from a breath test, and providing enough information to distinguish between subtypes of the disease. New generation . Electronic noses are not a new concept. Medical sensors first emerged in the 1980s, but were unable to deliver reliable diagnoses. But in this new generation of devices, experts believe the field has matured. ""The idea been around for over 20 years with many companies making e-noses they thought would be useful for diagnosing diseases, but they were way oversold and that destroyed the idea for a time,"" says Dr. Gary Beauchamp, director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Pennsylvania. ""While the devices today don't come close to mimicking the nose of a dog, I'm confident that they will help to recognize diseases based on body odors."" Cancerous material can be found easily enough, says Beauchamp, but decoding the mass of combinations that form smells remains a difficulty. ""Odors are a mixture of compounds and that requires pattern recognition. A dog recognizes an individual person through thousands of odors at one time, so you need a device that gives you the same information, and that is the challenge for the next generation."" In the short-term, Beauchamp believes that odor recognition could be used in conjunction with other tests, particularly as a means of non-invasive, early detection that could be followed up if necessary. ""They could become part of a routine examination in much the same way as blood tests ... that seems to me a likely scenario."" There are fears that making diagnosis too widely available could take serious decisions out of the hands of experts, and that unreliable tools could proliferate. But similar techniques are already established outside of medicine, for a range of applications from testing for dangerous chemicals to quality control in food manufacturing. Companies are already moving toward consumer healthcare applications for the electronic nose. British start-up Owlstone is working on a mobile breath-testing system that would give users instant analysis of their breath, offering early detection of conditions such as diabetes, TB or cancers. NASA technology is also being researched as a mobile sensor for lung cancer. As molecular analysis becomes cheaper and more reliable the applications are rapidly expanding.","Scientists developing ""electronic noses"" to detect diseases .

"Russian authorities are failing to protect gay people from persecution and are not prosecuting the perpetrators of a growing number of homophobic attacks, Human Rights Watch says in a new report. Its report calls for a July 2013 anti-gay propaganda law to be repealed, saying many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people interviewed for the report had noticed an increase in persecution since last year. The 2013 legislation bans ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations around minors."" This means the public discussion of gay rights and relationships, anywhere children might hear it, is prohibited. Russian and international rights groups have condemned it as highly discriminatory. Many of the LGBT interviewees for the report released Monday reported increased stigma, harassment and violence against them since 2013, the rights group says. ""The law effectively legalized discrimination against LGBT people and cast them as second-class citizens,"" it says. ""Instead of publicly denouncing anti-LGBT violence and rhetoric, Russia's leadership has remained silent. In some cases public officials have engaged in explicit anti-LGBT hate speech."" The report says that 22 of the 78 victims of homophobic and transphobic violence and harassment did not report attacks to police, as they did not think they would be taken seriously. Law enforcement bodies can prosecute such violence under Russia's hate crime laws, Human Rights Watch says, but not one of the cases documented in the report was investigated as a hate crime. The rights group describes anti-LGBT groups made up of ""radical nationalist men"" luring gay men and children on fake dates before holding them against their will and humiliating them. ""In other cases, LGBT people described being physically attacked by strangers on the subway, on the street, at nightclubs, and, in one case, at a job interview,"" its report says. A transgender woman, referred to in the report as ""Risa R,"" is quoted as saying she was abducted and brutally assaulted in St. Petersburg in 2013. ""They kept calling me a 'faggot' and telling me how much they hated gays. I told them repeatedly that I wasn't gay, that I was a transgender woman, but they did not want to listen,"" she says. ""One of them said, 'You're nothing but a faggot. We will get your brain straight right now.' Several times they threatened to rape me. Then they took pliers from their car and ripped out two of my toenails. Afterwards, they said, 'Now you will be better off. Now you will be pretty.' "" Human Rights Watch says Risa explained that she had not gone to police because she had ""no illusions that the police would investigate."" It quotes an LGBT activist from Pervouralsk, Gleb Latnik, as saying he had reported to police soon after he had been attacked. ""His injuries were visible -- there was significant bruising on his forehead, there were bruises under his eyes, and one eye was swollen shut,"" the report says. ""The police officer who took his complaint said to him, 'It's all right, you're gay so it's normal that you were attacked. Why would you need to file a complaint against anyone?' "" ""Violence experienced by LGBT people in Russia is unmistakably motivated by homophobia, but the authorities deliberately ignore that these are hate crimes and fail to protect victims,"" Human Rights Watch's Tanya Cooper said. The report includes responses from the Russian Prosecutor General's Office and Russian Interior Ministry, and the rights group said neither agency collected statistical data about attacks specifically committed against LGBT people. This month, President Vladimir Putin met with Russian human rights groups, telling them  that Russia's priority was ""a healthy traditional family and a healthy nation."" He said that did not mean that it would persecute those ""of a nontraditional orientation."" ""People have tried to stick this label on us, even people who use criminal law to persecute people of nontraditional orientation. Some U.S. states make it a crime, and though as far as I know these laws are not actually applied and the Supreme Court has suspended them, but they are nevertheless still on the books. We have no criminal penalties,"" he said. Putin said that no one should face discrimination in Russia. ""All people here have political rights, social rights, rights to employment, and no one should face discrimination,"" he said. ""But our strategic choice is for traditional families, healthy families and a healthy nation. One does not exclude the other and does not hinder the other. I think this is a balanced approach and is entirely the right approach.""","A Human Rights Watch report says Russia has failed to prevent homophobic violence .

"Hold the obituary. Experts now think Comet ISON -- or at least part of it -- survived  its close encounter with the sun. Karl Battams, a comet scientist for the Naval Research Laboratory, said it is believed some parts of  ISON's nucleus survived perihelion. ""It now looks like some chunk of ISON's nucleus has indeed made it through the solar corona, and re-emerged,"" he said. ""It's throwing off dust and (probably) gas, but we don't know how long it can sustain that."" However, he said, its fate is uncertain. ""Now it has emerged and started to brighten, we need to observe it for a few days to get a feel for its behavior,"" Battams said. ISON swept about 730,000 miles over the sun's surface Thursday about 2 p.m. ET. A fleet of spacecraft watched ISON plunge toward the sun, including NASA's STEREO satellite,  the European Space Agency/NASA SOHO spacecraft and the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Comets are giant snowballs of frozen gases, rock and dust that can be several miles in diameter. When they get near the sun, they warm up and spew some of the gas and dirt, creating tails that can stretch for thousands of miles. Most comets are in the outer part of our solar system. When they get close enough for us to see, scientists study them for clues about how our solar system formed. Astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom Novichonok discovered ISON last year using a telescope near Kislovodsk, Russia. ISON -- officially named C/2012 S1 -- was 585 million miles away at the time. Its amazing journey through the solar system had been chronicled by amateur astronomers and by space telescopes. ""From the beginning, ISON has confused, surprised and amazed us, and in hindsight its latest little escapade really should not shock us,"" Battams said. ""Nonetheless, this has been one of the most extraordinary comets we have ever encountered, and just goes to reiterate how beautiful, dynamic and exciting our universe is."" Observers have been watching the comet for more than a year, hoping it would survive its sunbath and emerge to put on a sky show, visible to the naked eye in the Northern Hemisphere. Earlier Thursday, NASA scientists had pretty much declared ISON dead at the end of a Google Hangout to watch the comet swing by the sun.  But professional and amateur astronomers were undeterred by the reports and kept analyzing NASA satellites. They found images that clearly show something emerging from the sun. ""What we see here is the dust tail emerging first, pointing away from the sun,"" said Padma Yanamandra-Fisher with the Space Science Institute and a member of the ISON Observing Campaign. A video made by observing campaign member John Maclean shows the comet slicing toward the sun and then something -- apparently ISON -- emerging from the other side.  Maclean is a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society at Norman Lockyer Observatory Sidmouth in Devon, England. The discovery stunned many in the comet-watching community and led some to nickname ISON the zombie comet. Others repeated an old joke about comets and cats. ""Comets are like cats; they have tails, and they do precisely what they want,"" David H. Levy said. This comet also seems to have something else in common with cats -- nine lives. 5 things to know about Comet ISON . 2013: The year of the comet (we hope)","Comet ISON -- or at least part of it --  may have survived, experts say .

"The rough sports he loved may have helped to do Kosta Karageorge in at age 22. The body of the Ohio State University football player and wrestler was found Sunday in a Dumpster. A handgun was found nearby. Police believe he shot himself. His mother told police after he went missing last week that her son had sustained several concussions and suffered from confusion ""spells"" in the past. They appeared to weigh heavily on him in the last text message he sent her from his cell phone. ""I am sorry if I am an embarrassment but these concussions have my head all f***ed up,"" he wrote early Wednesday. It's not clear when or how Karageorge sustained the concussions. Ohio State football coach Urban Meyer told reporters Monday that he was told not to discuss Karageorge's medical history. A team spokesman said Karageorge, a reserve defensive lineman who walked on to the team, had never played in a game and was never on a travel roster. Team physician Dr. Jim Borchers said Friday that the team was not able to discuss or comment on Karageorge's medical care. ""We are confident in our medical procedures and policies to return athletes to participation following injury or illness,"" Borchers said. The wrestling coach, Tom Ryan, told the Columbus Dispatch that Karageorge ""didn't have any documented concussions as a wrestler"" during his three years with the team. Franklin County Coroner Anahi Ortiz said Karageorge's brain will likely be tested for evidence of damage due to concussions. Body found while scavenging . Karageorge had been missing since Wednesday after he missed an early morning football practice. Karageorge's sister, Sophia, told Cleveland.com that he was upset about something Tuesday night and that his roommates said he went for a walk. Police, some on horseback, scoured the area around campus. Students joined in, posting fliers with Karageorge's photo under windshield wipers and on telephone posts. Then on Sunday afternoon, a woman and her son scavenging containers came upon his body, Columbus police Sgt. Richard Weiner said. Police identified Karageorge by his tattoos. The school's Athletics Department expressed shock and sadness over his death. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with the Karageorge family, and those who knew him, during this most difficult time,"" it said in a statement. After night fell Sunday, hundreds of students gathered on campus at a statue of Ohio State's founder to remember Karageorge. They stood in silence, heads bowed. Meyer on Monday called Karageorge's death an ""incredible tragedy.""","Kosta Karageorge's brain will likely be examined for evidence of damage .

"North Korea has ""the world's most advantageous human rights system,"" the country declared in a lengthy report released on Saturday. Its political system ""bestows upon (its citizens) priceless political integrity."" Its economic system ""ensures people an independent and creative working life, as well as affluent and civilized living standard,"" according to a report by the DPRK Association for Human Rights Studies. The 53,000-word report -- which repeats the phrase ""human rights"" over 700 times -- paints a rosy picture of the country. North Korea issued a vehement defense of its human rights record, in response to a damning U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, released in February. That report criticized North Korea's authoritarian rule and said the state ""terrorizes"" its own citizens. The U.N. Commission of Inquiry issued its conclusions after listening to testimonies from more than 100 victims, witnesses and experts regarding North Korea. It also examined satellite imagery and listed a stunning catalog of torture and widespread abuse ""that does not have any parallel in the contemporary world."" North Korea had declined to participate in the inquiry. The human rights plot . North Korea says human rights is an excuse used by the United States to interfere in its affairs. The report repeatedly takes aim at the United States,  saying Washington is plotting to ""eventually overthrow the social system"" and also accused the Americans of invading North Korea in 1950 and starting the Korean War. The war began in 1950 after Communist forces attacked the south. The report denies the litany of the state's abuses saying these are ""racket kicked up by the hostile forces"" and derived from non-credible witnesses, who were paid to ""cook up groundless stories."" ""Pyongyang frames all criticism of their human rights situation as a politicized attack from hostile forces,"" said Sokeel Park, director of research and strategy at LINK (Liberty in North Korea), an international NGO that works with North Korean refugees. North Korea's version of its human rights report was published ahead of Tuesday's U.N. General Assembly, where a discussion and vote on North Korea's human rights situation is expected. ""Pyongyang knows they are increasingly diplomatically isolated and they are trying to reverse that tide,"" Park told CNN. ""They see the growing international consensus on the seriousness of their human rights violations as one facet of that diplomatic isolation, so it makes sense to try to counter that explicitly too."" This includes releasing their own ""human rights report"" to counter the U.N. Commission of Inquiry Report,"" he said. What the report says . Divided into five chapters, North Korea says its report was derived from institutions, NGOs and human rights experts. ""The human rights mechanisms of the DPRK which have been formed and developed in the 70-year-long history is a superior system that thoroughly and practically guarantees the people's human rights in all fields of social life including politics, economy and culture,"" according to the report. It made no mention of its prison system, executions or food shortages. Instead, the report trumpeted its policies of ""universal compulsory education, free medical care and free provision of housings."" The North Korean report also boasted its ""open trial and rights of defense"" -- which ran contrary to the U.S. State Department's assertion that it is not given access or details on charges for U.S. defendants held in the country. On Sunday, Matthew Miller, a U.S. citizen, was convicted of ""hostile acts"" and sentenced to six years of hard labor.","North Korea issues its own human rights report, declares it's a ""superior system""

"We all know the feeling. You are going about your day, making phone calls and texting, when suddenly your smartphone's battery starts to look dangerously low. You don't have a charger with you, and even if you did, there would be nowhere to plug it in. For most people, this means spending a few hours unconnected -- but not for residents of several towns and cities in Serbia. They can charge their phones on the go thanks to Strawberry Tree, the first of its kind public solar-powered charging station, installed in parks and squares across the country. Conceived by Milos Milisavljevic in 2011 while he was still a student at Belgrade University, Strawberry Tree contains 16 chargers for a variety of mobile phones and tablets, as well as its own wi-fi and USB sockets. His creation won the Verge Accelerate startup competition in San Francisco at the end of October -- the only company from outside America to take part -- and already boasts the European Union Sustainable Energy Award. ""We rely heavily on our cell phones for many essential tasks during the day,"" says Milisavljevic, now 26, who founded his company, Strawberry Energy, when he received the first order for his charger. ""You communicate over your cell phone, you are using maps, taking photos, so basically your phone becomes your life. It's a huge problem when you run out of battery because then you are just carrying a brick in your pocket,"" he adds. Strawberry Tree, named so after the symbolism of strawberries as the first fruit of the summer, can work for up to 20 days without sunlight thanks to its in-built solar batteries. It contains reused steel, and 98% of it can be recycled. ""I was fascinated with clean technology, and I wanted to find a way that it could benefit people in their everyday life by solving a common problem -- running out of battery,"" says Milisavljevic. While replenishing cell phone batteries is the device's main function, Milisavljevic wants Strawberry Tree to become a core item of infrastructure in what he calls a smart, connected city of the future. Each charger is equipped with sensors which measure conditions like air pollution, noise levels, and UV radiation in its vicinity. Milisavljevic says he hopes these sensors could in the future enable people to access locally-focused environmental data though an app on their smartphone. ""For example, if you had a network of Strawberry Trees spread around the city, you could check if there's ice on the road in your street, what park is the quietest if you want to relax,"" explains Milisavljevic, ""or if you have asthma or allergies, you could see what's the air quality in the area you're planning to go to,"" he adds. The company's ambitious plans don't stop there. After Serbia was hit by devastating floods in May, large swathes of the country lost power preventing many people from contacting their families for several days. Milisavljevic thinks that his creation could become an invaluable resource in similar scenarios. ""Strawberry Tree could have an emergency button which would send a signal to emergency services that you are in danger, and in any kind of a disaster, for example if the power grid is down, the Tree would be the place where you could call for help and get in touch with your loved ones,"" he adds. Milisavljevic also stresses that in spite of the dramatic changes in the way that people communicate in the last 50 years, cities have remained almost frozen in time: ""Street signs are still street signs, city lights are only city lights, and benches are still just benches. There is hardly any innovation in city living, so our dream is to bring new technology to outdoor public spaces, so we can improve the quality of life in our cities,"" he says.

"(CNN)Michael van Praag, the head of Dutch soccer, has joined the race to become FIFA's next president. The 66-year-old has been at the helm of the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB) since August 2008 and has openly called for the current incumbent Sepp Blatter to step down. He announced his decision to stand on the body's official website and raised concerns about FIFA's current leadership in the process. ""I am very worried about the deteriorating situation at FIFA, the public opinion, the trustworthiness is very bad and with me a lot of people in the world believe so,"" he said. ""I was hoping that a credible, fresh face would stand up to do it but unfortunately that is not the case. So that's why I decided to take my own responsibility, especially after what I said in Sao Paulo and therefore I go for it. ""FIFA has to be normalized and FIFA has to be modernized. In my business life and also in Ajax and also in my association, I went through this exercise many, many times so I have a lot of experience in that respect. So I believe I'm the right person to do it."" Van Praag's announcement comes just a day after Blatter said, in an interview with CNN, that UEFA ""lacked the courage to come in"" and stand against him in the presidential elections. Van Praag is one of a number of candidates hoping to topple the leader of football's world governing body, who has been in the job for 17 years. After being re-elected unopposed in 2011, Blatter could now face van Praag, former PSG and Tottenham footballer David Ginola as well as independent candidate Jerome Champagne in May's ballot. Van Praag was president of the Netherlands' most successful club Ajax between 1989 and 2003, following in the footsteps of his father Jaap. During his reign Ajax added six Dutch league titles to its roll call of honors, the current total now standing at 33. Van Praag has also been a member of UEFA's Executive Committee since 2009. Blatter announced his intention to step down at the end of his fourth term but backtracked at FIFA's congress in Brazil last year, claiming his mission was ""not yet finished."" That decision drew criticism from a number of FIFA member countries, given the allegations of corruption relating to the bidding process for the 2018 World Cup, awarded to Russia, and the 2022 installment, given to Qatar. Van Praag was one of those to suggest Blatter should step down, telling him at a meeting of European officials: ""Few people still take FIFA seriously and, however you look at it, Blatter is mainly responsible. ""You are not making things easy for yourself and I do not think you are the man for the job any longer. ""FIFA's image has deteriorated because of everything that's happened in recent years. People link FIFA to corruption and bribery and all kinds of old boy's networks."" Blatter enjoys firm support from the majority of FIFA's 209 member associations and many see May's elections as a forgone conclusion, despite the last few being blighted by scandal and difficulty. The Swiss enlisted U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia to probe claims that Qatar's former IFA member Mohamed Bin Hammam used a multi-million dollar slush fund to buy support for the bid, charges that Qatar bid have strenuously denied. Garcia quit his role as chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee after objecting to the way his report into the bidding process had been summarized by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert -- the organization's independent ethics adjudicator. Bin Hammam was the only challenger to the president four years ago but withdrew from the race after he was suspended on bribery charges, leaving Blatter to run unopposed amid farcical scenes at the congress in Zurich. The head of European soccer's governing body, Michel Platini, has called on Blatter to stand down, but announced he would not personally be running for president. It remains to be seen whether Ginola, or any of his fellow candidates, can make a significant dent in the support Blatter holds among FIFA's members, and make the May elections anything more than another forgone conclusion.","Head of Dutch soccer announces plans to stand against Sepp Blatter for FIFA head post .

"Karen Garner sometimes catches her husband, Jim, crying in the kitchen of their Virginia home. ""All I'm good for now is doing the dishes and the laundry,"" the former Air Force senior master sergeant complains through his tears. ""I want to come back to him and say, 'No, that's not true' and rattle off some examples ... but I stop myself,"" Garner said. ""Because he's right."" Jim was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease three years ago. He was 48. He lost his job as his cognitive ability declined and now spends his days trying to complete the list of few simple tasks his wife leaves him. He often calls Garner at her job with questions. She worries constantly that this will be the day that he'll get lost or hurt himself or set the house on fire. ""He hasn't done anything yet to cause me concern, but I know it's coming. I know that one day, something will happen,"" Garner said. More than 35 million people worldwide live with dementia today, according to a new report. By 2050, that number is expected to more than triple to 115 million. The majority require constant care; they're dependent -- and that dependence can impact their loved ones in unmeasurable ways. ""People with dementia have special needs for care,"" the report from Alzheimer's Disease International says. ""They need more personal care, more hours of care, and more supervision, all of which is associated with greater caregiver strain, and higher costs."" The 2013 World Alzheimer's Report, titled ""Journey of Care,"" examines global trends related to older people who need dementia care, including those with Alzheimer's disease. 5 things I learned at 'Dementia Village' In the early stages of dementia, patients become forgetful. They get confused about the time or their location. Decisions are difficult. As the disease progresses, patients have a harder time communicating and caring for themselves. By the final stage, patients can no longer recognize their loved ones, eat without assistance or even move. It's a slow, torturous decline, Garner says. Jim breaks some things and loses others. He provides off-the-wall answers to people's questions. He's emotionally detached from their two kids, aged 9 and 12. She worries that her kids won't remember what an ""awesome"" father Jim was. He was the dad who got up in the middle of the night to help with feedings and change diapers. He read to the kids, played with them, took care of them when they were sick. Garner is brutally honest about the impact the disease is having on the family. ""It would be a little bit easier if he would just decline quickly and get it over with,"" Garner said. ""But unfortunately, Alzheimer's doesn't work that way."" People with Alzheimer's live on average four to eight years after they're diagnosed, but some may live 20 years beyond their initial diagnosis. Caregivers, whether they're family or professionals, share many traits, the World Alzheimer Report notes; they often do demanding work with minimal training or preparation. They're also underpaid and undervalued. Professional caregivers usually earn minimum wage and often report poor job satisfaction. Family members, of course, earn nothing and make many personal sacrifices to care for a loved one. ""Because of the progressive nature of the disease and the length of its duration, Alzheimer's care needs only escalate, often to the point of impacting the caregiver's own health,"" Angela Geiger, chief strategy officer of the Alzheimer's Association, said in a statement. And the problem is getting worse. Increasing life expectancies and an aging population are creating a group of seniors that's bigger than the working-age population that supports them, the report says. Approximately 4% of the population in developed countries now is currently over the age of 80; in 2050, experts predict, that number will rise to 10%. The World Alzheimer's Report identifies four areas in which ""specific actions could lead to improvements in the quality of care for people with dementia"" and seven strategies to make this care more affordable. Overall, the report authors say, governments need to make dementia a bigger priority. ""No two families are alike in their needs for care and support, and we need to find ways to make care more person-centred, and care packages more flexible and individualised,"" the report says. ""Earlier diagnosis enables the person with dementia to make decisions about the care that they will receive."" Alzheimer's disease cannot be prevented, cured or delayed. But experts say an earlier diagnosis may help patients live better day-to-day. The 10 warning signs of Alzheimer's . The Alzheimer's Association predicts that by 2050, U.S. costs for caring for the dementia population will total $1.2 trillion. To compare, the total cost worldwide in 2010 was about $604 billion. ""If dementia were a country, it would be the world's 21st largest economy,"" the report says, ""ranking between Poland and Saudi Arabia."" Garner went back to work full-time after Jim lost his job, but she makes less than half what he did. The family used to go on vacations and go out to eat without stretching their budget too much. Now, even back-to-school shopping is a financial burden. ""It's impacted us tremendously, and I don't even pay yet for care of him,"" Garner said. ""When I have to hire someone for in-home care, which insurance doesn't cover, I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to do it."" When Jim was diagnosed, she was a ""woman on fire,"" talking about Alzheimer's all the time, asking Jim about his bucket list, encouraging him to write letters and tape videos for their kids. But as time, and his disease, progress, her life has become a day-to-day struggle to live peacefully in the moment. Unless someone has a family member with Alzheimer's, she says, they can't understand the overwhelming frustration that comes with it. Financially. Emotionally. Dealing with the medical system. Planning for the future. ""And when I say 'frustration,' that word is just not strong enough,"" she says. ""I read articles, and I talk to people, and I know what's coming. There's nothing I can do to stop it."" If you or a loved one has Alzheimer's, visit www.alz.org or call the Alzheimer's Association's 24-hour hot line at (800) 272-3900.

"Once a year, if you drive just several hours north of Cape Town into South Africa's arid Karoo semi-desert, you'll come across a tented town in the middle of a vast expanse of nothing, like a surreal mirage. Here, huge sculptures punctuate the sky and the desert floor is dotted with art works, from multi-story creations to a field of tiny mushrooms that light up at night. Thousands of people, looking like extras from a hundred different movie sets, wear elaborate costumes and body paint and wander around, giving out hot dogs, popcorn, drinks, ice creams and yoga lessons. There's a circus, a post office, a gingerbread house filled with sweets, a Swiss alpine chalet, a saloon straight out of the Wild West and nearly a hundred other themed camps including dance floors, bars and coffee stations. This is AfrikaBurn, Africa's most unique, unusual, exhilarating and mind-blowing festival. Based on Burning Man, which draws 70,000 participants to Nevada's Black Rock Desert each year, AfrikaBurn is not just a music or arts festival. The event, held at the end of April, is a chance to experience a different (albeit temporary) world where creativity, self-reliance, self-expression and communal effort are championed. Other than ice there's nothing to buy, and each participant has to bring everything they need to survive, including shelter, water and food. Fiery spectacles . It's run on a gifting -- rather than bartering -- economy, where each person is supposed to contribute something as a gift, and all the entertainment (ranging from circus shows to DJ performances) and art is conceived of, created and produced by the participants themselves. Over the last three nights of the week-long event, the art works burn in mesmerizing fiery spectacles. When it's all over, everything is packed up, leaving no trace that this parallel universe ever existed. AfrikaBurn has been running for nine years, increasing in size each year -- 9,000 people attended the 2014 event. Out of 130 regional events scattered across the globe affiliated with Burning Man, it's the largest. Its worldwide fame is growing too -- each year more international participants travel to this remote corner of South Africa just to attend the festival, including Americans, many of whom declare that AfrikaBurn is how Burning Man was two decades ago, before it became so big. For many participants, attending AfrikaBurn is a life-changing experience -- it's hard to come out of a week in the desert without looking at the world in a different way. One thing's for sure: it's definitely worth traveling to South Africa for. Here are 12 reasons why you should attend the next AfrikaBurn, which takes place in April 2015. 1. The art installations . The creativity and effort that goes into the art works (95 of which were set up at the 2014 event) of AfrikaBurn, is simply astounding. Some, like ""Subterrafuge,"" made up of six timber cones rising up as high as 100 feet -- a statement against fracking in the Karoo -- have a political stance. Others, such as ""Reflection"" -- a giant wooden construction of a man's torso, arms and face rising out of the ground, which became the backdrop of a laser and projection mapping show -- are just incredibly beautiful structures. Smaller art works are also created to inspire a childlike sense of delight -- think a telephone booth where you can ""call God"" and a wigwam made of wigs. 2. To participate . AfrikaBurn is run on 11 guiding principles, which act like a manifesto and a kind of constitutional self-governing law. One of these principles is participation -- everyone who attends AfrikaBurn is expected to get involved in some way. Most people take part by dressing in elaborate costumes, others run a bar or a dance floor, others create art or help build something, and around 1,000 each year sign up as volunteers. By participating in AfrikaBurn, everyone becomes part of the event, and it's a lot more fun than just being a spectator. 3. The burnings . For many, watching the spectacle of giant art works burning with a crowd of thousands gasping in awe in union is a major highlight of AfrikaBurn. There's something inherently primal about being close to a huge blaze and something deeply profound in the fiery destruction of art that took months to create. The burnings are beautiful and spectacular, but on a deeper level they speak to ideas of transience and presence. 4. To experience a gifting economy . It's extremely liberating to spend a week without taking out your wallet, but what's even more amazing is experiencing the generosity of strangers at AfrikaBurn. The idea is that everyone gives out unconditional gifts -- it's heartwarming to receive unexpected treats (especially things like handmade jewelry or uplifting messages baked into cookies). Even more so to give out the gifts that you've brought. 5. To experience survival mode . Those attending AfrikaBurn get a taste of what it's like to survive in an inhospitable environment of heat, cold, wind and dust storms that leave a layer of sand over everything. They need to bring a tent, cook food over a gas stove (or eat crackers and tinned sardines) and ration water use. There are toilets but no showers and nowhere to buy water. Going into survival mode is part of the fun of AfrikaBurn -- and it also means that when participants get back into ""civilization"" they'll hopefully learn to look at the simplest things -- like running water out of a tap -- with new found appreciation. 6. Theme camps . Set around a big circle known as the Binnekring are over 100 theme camps -- public spaces that all offer something different and form the key components of the festival. There are massage parlors, chill spaces, photo booths, cocktail bars, a general store, post office and even a swimming pool. Each year they're different, so you never know what to expect. 7. Music . At night, AfrikaBurn turns into one giant party, as music blasts from dozens of small, big and almost hidden dance floors. Expect to hear an eclectic range of genres -- everything from hip hop and blues to trance and deep house -- and catch some of South Africa's best DJs playing sets. 8. Mutant vehicles . Most people bring bicycles to AfrikaBurn to get around -- the event is spread over a large area. But the best methods of transportation are the many mutant vehicles, or art cars, that traverse the desert town with no set route or direction. Visitors can jump onto the back of a big purple snail, a porcupine or a rhino, or sail across the horizon in a pirate ship. 9. The location . Not many tourists venture into the Northern Cape, South Africa's largest and most sparsely populated province, but they're missing out on the starkly beautiful desert landscapes of the Karoo. AfrikaBurn is set on a farm alongside the Tanka Karoo National Park -- an underrated reserve that's well worth a visit on the way back to Cape Town. 10. The sky . With its huge horizons and cotton wool clouds, the Karoo has some of South Africa's best sunsets -- each afternoon's sky becomes a painting of pink, apricot and dusky purple, an exquisite backdrop of art works punctuating the sky. It looks more like a movie set on another planet than a festival. At night the sky explodes into a thick blanket of stars -- for those who can tear themselves away from the dance floors, there's some epic stargazing to be had. AfrikaBurn essentials . AfrikaBurn takes place on April 27 to May 3, 2015. Tickets are $95. The first round of 9,800 tickets goes on sale December 19, 2014 at 10:00 GMT (5 a.m. E.T.), and the second round goes on sale on January 30, 2015 at the same time. Cape Town is the closest city to AfrikaBurn, a four-hour drive away on a highway and then a rough dirt road (driving a 4x4 is recommended). Participants will need to bring all their own supplies to the event.

"China is known for chasing superlatives -- now it can add marathon train journeys to its growing list of unparalleled achievements. On December 9, a Chinese freight train, dubbed Yixin'ou, completed a journey of epic proportions: more than 13,000 kilometers, snaking across eight countries and lasting a total of 21 days, making it the longest continuous train ride in the world. The train set off from Yiwu in eastern China on November 18, chugging its way through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, Germany and France, before ending its journey in Spain's capital, Madrid. The train carried 30 containers full of toys, stationery and other items. It'll bring back Spanish products, including wine, olive oil and cured hams, in an effort the Spanish hope will expand their trade footprint in China. Spanish Minister of Public Works and Transport Ana Pastor called the journey ""a major milestone for the rail industry."" The trip was a test run to gauge the possibility of establishing regular service between China and Spain to boost bilateral trade. Madrid Mayor Ana Botella Serrano dubbed it the ""Silk Road of the 21st century."" Regular train services between China and Germany already exist, connecting Chongqing with Duisburg, and Beijing with Hamburg. Earlier this year, Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a Silk Road Fund, part of which will be dedicated to developing trade infrastructure across the Asia-Pacific region.","Yixin'ou, a Chinese freight train, completed the world's longest train journey .

"Former Vice President Dick Cheney led a parade of George W. Bush administration officials who denounced a report on harsh interrogation techniques used against terrorism suspects, saying he would ""do it again in a minute."" Defenders of the CIA's use of interrogation techniques used the weekend's news programs to make a passionate case, following the release of a scathing report, composed by Senate Democrats, condemning the Bush-era practices. In an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Cheney said the methods described in the Senate Intelligence Committee's report -- including mock executions, rectal feeding and sleep deprivation -- don't amount to torture. Torture, Cheney said, ""is an American citizen on a cell phone making a last call to his four young daughters shortly before he burns to death in the upper levels of the Trade Center in New York City on 9/11."" ""There's this notion that somehow there's moral equivalence between what the terrorists do and what we do. And that's absolutely not true,"" he said. ""We were very careful to stop short of torture. The Senate has seen fit to label their report torture. But we worked hard to stay short of that definition."" The Republican added that he had no regrets about the techniques used by the Bush administration. He called the Senate panel's report ""seriously flawed"" and said the committee should have talked to officials involved in the interrogation program. ""I would do it again in a minute,"" he said. Michael Mukasey, Bush's attorney general, said the Senate panel's investigators cherry-picked the evidence they included in the report. The report, he said in an interview with John Catsimatidis on AM 970, is ""jam-packed with untruths"" and will ""demoralize the CIA."" ""It's even worse than that,"" he said. ""They were cherry-picking, throwing away the cherries and they printed the pits."" One of the report's bombshell assertions was that the CIA kept details of its tactics from Bush. The president's former top political adviser, Karl Rove, said that's untrue in an interview with ""Fox News Sunday."" Rove said Bush was briefed on the CIA's tactics and authorized some of the specific ones that were used. ""He made the decision. He was presented, I believe, 12 techniques. He authorized the use of 10 of them, including waterboarding,"" Rove said. All Republicans weren't as defensive of the Bush administration's tactics. Arizona Sen. John McCain argued the tactics outlined in the report do amount to torture, and said he would ""urge everyone to just read the report."" ""These are the communications within the CIA as to what happened,"" he said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""You can't claim that tying someone to the floor and have them freeze to death is not torture. You can't say 183 times someone is waterboarded."" McCain said calling the tactics used under Bush ""EITs"" -- an acronym for enhanced interrogation techniques -- is ""Orwellian.""","Several George W. Bush administration officials defended the tactics used to interrogate terrorism suspects .
Their defense came after the Senate Intelligence Committee released a report on the issue .

"North Korea's government was famously accused in 2002 by U.S. President George W. Bush of helping terrorism and seeking weapons of mass destruction, along with fellow ""axis of evil"" countries, Iran and Iraq. Iraq's leader Saddam Hussein was overthrown after the U.S. invaded in 2003 but the other two countries continued to defy the West by pursuing a nuclear program. So what will happen next after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il? How will the death affect military tensions in the region? After Japan's defeat in World War II, Korea became a divided nation. The capitalist South was supported by the United States and its Western allies, and the communist North became an ally of the Soviet Union. Cold War tensions erupted in 1950 as the North invaded the South, devastating the peninsula and killing up to two million people before the fighting ended after three years with a truce, followed by an armistice. Technically, the two Koreas remain at war, and while the North is believed to have a standing army of one million soldiers, with reserves estimated at more than seven million, few expect it to launch a general assault on the South. What military hardware does North Korea have? Over the past six decades, skirmishes have flared repeatedly along land and sea borders. Deadly naval clashes occurred along the demarcation line in 1999, 2002, 2009 and 2010. Washington also accuses Pyongyang of running a secret uranium-based nuclear program. The United States, along with the two Koreas, Russia, Japan and China, have been involved in what is called the Six Party Talks, but those negotiations have been slow and arduous. Following Kim Jong Il's death, Pyongyang urged an increase in the North's ""military capability,"" prompting Seoul to put South Korean forces on high alert. Martin Navias, from the London-based Centre for Defence Studies, said South Korea raised its alert because it feared Kim Jong Un could be forced to show his toughness with ""saber-rattling"" and flex the North's military muscles. CNN's Christiane Amanpour said it remained to be seen how talks would be affected. ""The issue here,"" she said, ""is whether it will promote more hardline policies from some of the old guard. Whether they will circle the wagons around this young man and whether it will put a stop to the negotiations with the United States or whether they will go through nonetheless."" What, if anything, will change inside the country? The state structure in North Korea, the police, security and military apparatus, is extremely strong, said Peter Beck, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. ""The idea of people rising up is hard to imagine,"" Beck told CNN. Short-term, Beck said, the Pyongyang regime could hunker down and ""remain stable and inward-oriented, sorting out who is in and who is out."" What is in store for North Korea? | Life inside the secretive country . North Korea's Stalinist government has survived mostly by closing itself off and defying the rest of the world. The question is, will this strategy continue to work in the years ahead for the third of the Kim dynasty to rule North Korea? ""The news of the death of Kim Jong Il opens a new chapter in the life of this isolated and repressive regime as it negotiates food aid to stave off starvation for its people and attempts to revive economy amid international concerns over its nuclear ambitions,"" said New York-based Vishakha Desai, Asia Society president who visited North Korea six months ago. So will the country's Stalinist regime endure? Kim's death could provide an opportunity for change, or trigger instability and even chaos. His son, the ""Great Successor"" Kim Jong Un, now inherits a reclusive, unstable regime confronting political uncertainty, diplomatic isolation, economic malaise and food shortages. North Korea has been dogged by famine since the mid-1990s when it was hit by severe food shortage caused by floods, drought and economic mismanagement. United Nations agencies based in Pyongyang say the North is in desperate need of outside aid to feed its 24 million people. GPS: Can Kim's son survive? In recent years, DVDs smuggled in from abroad showing South Korean soap operas have become popular, according to CNN producer Tim Schwarz, who has visited the country. ""The difference today is that North Koreans are no longer under the illusion they are living in paradise on earth. It is vital for the government to improve their economic prospects. But the state still controls people's lives to an extent almost unimaginable anywhere else. ""What may have an influence is Kim Jong Un's privileged upbringing. He has had an unobstructed view of the outside world that few in his country can have had. He was educated partly in a Swiss secondary school. His friends were ordinary European teenagers and he is reportedly a fan of NBA basketball. So it would be reasonable to think that this could give him a more modern outlook. ""It is hard to imagine that North Korea in the second decade of the 21st century will remain in the same kind of time warp as it seemed to be from in the last decades of the 20th. But don't expect Arab Spring-type changes. Even a move to Chinese style market socialism is a long way away."" What is China's role? A significant number of North Koreans have fled to China to seek freedom and a better life. In recent years, economic desperation and diplomatic isolation have prompted Kim Jong Il to visit frequently close allies like China. Why does China support North Korea? Last May, Kim Jong Il visited China again to ask for continued economic and military aid and political support. On this trip Kim went with another urgent mission: to introduce to the Chinese senior leaders his youngest son, Kim Jong Un, as his heir apparent. As North Korea's major ally, experts say, China's support for the young Kim was important. China-North Korean ties are so close they are frequently described ""as close as lips and teeth,"" and the two neighbors were Korean War allies. Of all the regional powers, Beijing has the greatest potential leverage over Pyongyang. China supplies at least 80% of North Korea's oil and significant amounts of food, fertilizer and military aid. The two Communist neighbors have frequent political, military and party-to-party exchanges. Foremost in Beijing's mind, North Korea serves as a buffer, keeping the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea away from the Chinese border. China has a huge stake in North Korea's stability, experts believe. Former CNN correspondent, Mike Chinoy, a veteran Korea-watcher who has visited North Korea several times, said: ""The Chinese have made it extremely clear that they are not going to let Korea go down the drain. They are going to do whatever they need to do to prop it up."" And how will Kim Jong Un fare? Meantime, experts say, all eyes are on the young and untested Kim Jong Un. Why Kim Jong Un remains an enigma . Mike Chinoy, a senior fellow at the Los Angeles-based U.S. China Institute, notes the young Kim's big challenge: ""How does somebody who's not yet 30 win the loyalty and respect and command authority over the entrenched party apparatus, the entrenched military bureaucracy, and the senior party officials who may have been in their positions for a long time?"" Kim Jong Il had two decades to learn the ropes, develop his network of connections and establish his authority under his father, Kim Il Sung's tutelage and protection. Even so, Chinoy said, when Kim Il Sung died in 1994, the young Kim was dogged with speculations: ""Was he going to last?"" By contrast, Kim Jong Un only had two years to ascend last year as a senior party leader and four-star general. The young Kim is expected to rely on powerful backers of close relatives, including Kim's sister and brother-in-law Jang Song Taek, who experts say will serve as regents, tutoring behind the scene. So despite all the problems that Kim Jong Il left behind, some Korea-watchers do not expect North Korea to implode immediately. After his last visit to Pyongyang last August, Chinoy told CNN: ""I was struck by the notion that succession was on track -- not a lot of internal discord about it."" Nor is any huge policy change expected. ""Kim has not been put into his position by a group of young Turks hoping to change the system, but by an elderly and entrenched elite,"" said CNN's Schwarz. ""Their interests lie firmly in continuing the current power structure. ""So while gradual change over time may be possible, if on a limited scale, the imminent collapse of the regime is unlikely.""","North Korea accused by ex-U.S. President Bush of helping terrorism, seeking WMDs .

"ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico (CNN) -- Sen. John McCain on Monday defended his opposition to a Democratic bill that would expand education benefits for veterans, saying it would hurt the military that he hopes to lead. Sen. John McCain is co-sponsoring alternative legislation to the GI Bill that the Senate passed last week. The new GI Bill being debated in Congress would expand education benefits for veterans who served at least three years in the military after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The bill's main sponsor, Sen. Jim Webb, is a Virginia Democrat and, like McCain, a Vietnam War veteran. The Senate passed Webb's bill 75-22 last week. McCain was not in Washington for the vote. Democrats have targeted McCain for his opposition to the Webb legislation. Watch McCain talk about the U.S. debt to veterans . Saying he takes ""a back seat to no one in my affection, respect and devotion to veterans,"" McCain said Webb's bill would be a disincentive for service members to become noncommissioned officers, which he called ""the backbone of all the services."" ""In my life, I have learned more from noncommissioned officers I have known and served with than anyone else outside my family,"" McCain said at a Memorial Day event in Albuquerque. ""They are very hard to replace. Encouraging people to choose to not become noncommissioned officers would hurt the military and our country very badly."" A former Navy officer, McCain was a prisoner of war during Vietnam. McCain, along with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Richard Burr of North Carolina, has introduced an alternative bill that would increase education benefits on a sliding scale based on an individual's years of service. McCain argues his bill would have a smaller impact on retention rates than the legislation that the Senate passed. ""The office of president, which I am seeking, is a great honor indeed, but it imposes serious responsibilities,"" the presumptive GOP nominee said. ""I can only tell you, I intend to deserve the honor if I am fortunate to receive it, even if it means I must take politically unpopular positions at times and disagree with people for whom I have the highest respect and affection."" Over the weekend, Sen. Barack Obama, who appears to be the likely Democratic nominee, again tried to tie McCain to Bush by noting that both of them oppose the GI Bill expansion. ""I revere our soldiers and want to make sure they are being treated with honor and respect,"" Obama said Saturday. ""I think the GI Bill is one way for us to do that, and I hope that John McCain and George Bush decide they believe the same thing."" Sparring between McCain and Obama over the GI Bill got personal last week when McCain said he would not be lectured from someone ""who did not feel it was his responsibility to serve our country in uniform."" Obama hasn't served in the military. Referring to Iraq in his closing comments Monday, McCain said he recognized Americans have grown tired of the war and the mistakes made, ""but we cannot react to those mistakes by embracing a course of action that will be an even greater mistake, a mistake of colossal historical proportions."" ""We must give Gen. [David] Petraeus and the Americans he has the honor to command adequate time to salvage from the wreckage of our past mistakes a measure of stability for Iraq and the Middle East, and a more secure future for the American people,"" he said. Later Monday, McCain will attend a fundraiser in Albuquerque. On Tuesday, President Bush will fly to Phoenix, Arizona, for a fundraiser at a private residence. Bush has been one of the Republican Party's most prolific fundraisers, and McCain will need help to keep up with Democratic fundraising this fall. The McCain campaign said the event will be held at the senator's home because it is more private. But the Phoenix Business Journal said the event was moved from the Phoenix Convention Center due to lackluster ticket sales and concern over anti-war protesters. A McCain aide denied the report on poor ticket sales. The aide also said the event wasn't moved to McCain's private residence to avoid having the senator and unpopular president appear together on camera. ""We have a policy that fundraising events are closed events,"" the aide said, adding that any confusion about the fundraiser originally being open to the press should be chalked up to the campaign ""working out the kinks"" on its first event with Bush. McCain consistently has trailed the two remaining Democratic presidential candidates in fundraising. The $17 million McCain raised in April was dwarfed by the nearly $31 million by Obama and the $21 million by Sen. Hillary Clinton. McCain also trails both Democrats in the amount of cash on hand. He had nearly $22 million in the bank at the end of April, while Obama had more than double that amount -- nearly $47 million -- and Clinton had nearly $30 million. CNN's Alexander Marquardt, Ed Henry, Mary Snow and Robert Yoon contributed to this report.","NEW: Sen. John McCain says general must have time to bring stability to Iraq .

"Beijing (CNN)Earlier this month, ""nut rage"" prompted the pilot of a Korean Air flight on the tarmac of New York's JFK airport to turn back to the gate. Now, ""hot watergate"" has forced a China-bound Thai AirAsia flight to return to Bangkok, angering not just the passengers on board but also the Chinese government and public. Shortly after flight FD9101 took off last Thursday evening from Bangkok for the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, a male passenger asked a flight attendant for boiling water for his girlfriend's instant noodles, witnesses told China's state media. When told they had to wait for the plane to reach cruising altitude, the young man reportedly dumped food on the aisle, stomped on it and yelled at other passengers who tried to calm him down. He was allegedly still fuming as a flight attendant of the budget airline brought a cup of hot water and charged him 60 Thai baht ($2) for it. Another argument ensued when he demanded Chinese currency for change as well as an official receipt, state media reported. As the quarrel dragged on, the man's girlfriend threw hot water on the back of a flight attendant, witnesses said. When the purser demanded the woman apologize, the boyfriend exploded. In a cell phone video taken by a fellow passenger and posted online, a man in a gray T-shirt and jeans can be heard shouting in Mandarin: ""You don't think I have money? ...You caused all the problems and I'm going to blow up the plane!"" When the couple realized the flight was being turned back, the woman reportedly grew hysterical, hitting windows and threatening to jump off the plane, according to state media. The plane -- carrying 174 passengers and six crew members -- hadn't even left Thai airspace before it turned around. ""The captain of the flight decided to return the plane to Don Mueang Airport [Bangkok's secondary airport] deeming her actions as endangering to other passengers and impeding in-flight service,"" the airline said in a statement. Thai authorities reportedly questioned the couple -- along with two of their friends who were also involved in the incident -- and ordered them to pay the flight attendant 50,000 baht ($1,500). The woman was also fined 200 baht ($6) and the other three passengers 100 baht ($3) each for disturbing public order. As news of ""hot watergate"" spread online, many Chinese Internet users lamented that the airline didn't press criminal charges, calling the fines imposed by Thai officials a slap on the wrist for such ""shameful"" behavior. Air rage on the rise in China . Air rage is a common sight in delay-prone China. In recent years, state media has reported numerous dramatic incidents involving irate passengers, ranging from blocking moving aircraft on an active runway to fistfights with airport employees. With the exponential growth of outbound tourism, Chinese fliers now seem to be exporting their rage overseas. In February 2012, a Chinese couple was kicked off their United flight from Guam to Shanghai, after they repeatedly yelled at a flight attendant and told her to ""shut up"" when she tried to move their luggage in the overhead bin to accommodate other passengers. In September that year, a Swiss flight bound for Beijing was forced to return to Zurich when a fight broke out between two Chinese men over a reclined seat. In February this year, a fight erupted between two groups of Chinese passengers before their flight could take off from the Thai resort island of Phuket, resulting in 29 people being taken off the plane. Then, in April, a Thai Airways red-eye from Bangkok to Beijing turned bloody when a brawl involving three Chinese men broke out. During an official visit to the Maldives in September, President Xi Jinping personally asked Chinese tourists to behave themselves while traveling abroad. Last year the government released a lengthy list of do's and don'ts aimed at turning Chinese travelers into ""civilized tourists."" After the latest incident, the National Tourism Administration said in a statement that actions of the four passengers had ""severely damaged the overall image of Chinese people"" and demanded local authorities to review the case. All the warnings and cajoling seem to have fallen on deaf ears, though. When they arrived in Nanjing on the same Thai AirAsia flight the following day, the four passengers refused to disembark, state media quoted a witness as saying. They demanded a written statement from the airline that would exonerate them from having caused the incident Thursday -- delaying the flight going back to Bangkok.","A flight is turned back to Bangkok after a woman throws hot water on a flight attendant .

"The burgeoning field of 3-D printing got a big boost Tuesday night when President Obama highlighted it as something that could fuel new high-tech jobs in the United States. The shout-out in Obama's State of the Union address was perhaps the biggest public endorsement so far of a technology that has its roots in the 1970s, but has recently begun to boom on two fronts -- as an increasingly accessible consumer product and an industrial one that advocates say could change the face of manufacturing. Obama spoke about the National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute, a public-private partnership established in the hard-hit manufacturing city of Youngstown, Ohio, last year to research how cutting-edge 3-D printing technology can be moved from the research phase to day-to-day use. ""A once-shuttered warehouse is now a state-of-the art lab where new workers are mastering the 3-D printing that has the potential to revolutionize the way we make almost everything,"" Obama said. The process of 3-D printing (also known by the clunkier ""additive manufacturing"" moniker) uses computer-created digital models to create real-world objects -- everything from simple chess pieces to more complex objects such as functioning clocks. The printers follow the shape of the model by stacking layer upon layer of material to make the objects. Obama announced plans for three more manufacturing hubs where businesses will partner with the departments of Defense and Energy ""to turn regions left behind by globalization into global centers of high-tech jobs."" ""And I ask this Congress to help create a network of 15 of these hubs and guarantee that the next revolution in manufacturing is made in America,"" Obama said. Edward A. Morris, the director of NAMII, said the organization was ""tremendously honored"" to be mentioned by the president in such a high-profile speech. ""It is rewarding to know that NAMII's efforts to promote innovation and entrepreneurialism within the additive manufacturing sector is highly recognized and supported,"" he said in a statement on the partnership's website. While primarily a novelty among the tech-obsessed, 3-D printing been used successfully for a variety of tasks, from making jewelry or medical supplies to larger projects in industrial design and engineering. A Dutch architect has even announced plans to print an entire innovative building, piece by piece. That's an outlier to be sure, but one that could signal things to come. Three-dimensional printing has entered the public consciousness enough for Congress to be considering legislation banning people from making guns using the technology. A weapon made with a 3-D printer could theoretically be formed from plastic, making it undetectable by traditional security measures. No one is known to have created an entire working firearm with a 3-D printer, although usable parts of one reportedly have been printed. MakerBot, the most prominent maker of 3-D printers that the public can buy, has cracked down on printed guns by enforcing terms on its website that prevent users from sharing blueprints for firearms. It's also MakerBot that's been at the forefront of of the move to put 3-D printers in the hands of the general public. One of the biggest obstacles has been cost. But the company's Replicator 2 desktop printer is now selling at a relatively accessible $2,200, roughly the equivalent of a basic Apple iMac computer. MakerBot was listed this week as one of tech blog Fast Company's top 10 most innovative consumer tech companies with the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google. CEO Bre Pettis said Wednesday that the company's goals are in line with those voiced Tuesday by Obama. ""We created MakerBot to help innovators iterate faster, more affordably and (to help them) invent more,"" Pettis said. ""We're proud to be recognized by the president in his State of the Union address and we're going to do our part to get it done."" While some consumers may have new visions of 3-D printers in their garages, Obama was speaking mostly of the technology's industrial potential. He pitched it as a way to prod what he called an encouraging recent trend: the return of tech-industry and other manufacturing jobs to the U.S. Apple has announced it will begin manufacturing some of its iMacs in the United States this year, a fact Obama noted in his speech. Lenovo, the world's second-largest PC maker, is starting a production line in North Carolina, and Intel is spending a whopping $5 billion to build an Arizona plant to make its processors. Analysts have said that as regulations and wages increase in places like China, and as U.S. workers gain expertise in tech manufacturing, it will increasingly make more sense for U.S. companies to keep their plants closer to home.","Obama's State of the Union address puts focus on emerging 3-D printer field .

Engineers for Airbus Defence and Space in the UK have done just that, building what they call a ""Mars Yard"" just outside London at a cost of about £500,000 ($832,000). It contains 300 tons of sand (about 660,000 lbs), which has been matched to the color measured by NASA's rovers. Even the light levels inside the facility have been adjusted to mimic those on the Red Planet. The idea is to replicate some of the Martian environment so the European Space Agency (ESA) can test a future rover they hope will autonomously navigate the surface. ESA is planning two missions as part of its ExoMars program to shed more light on whether Mars could ever have supported life and in preparation for a possible sample return in the 2020s. An orbiter and prototype lander is due to launch in January 2016 and a rover is planned to follow in 2018. Scientists on the ground want the rover to be able to calculate its own safe route to an object and they say building the Mars Yard will help them prepare. ""It takes 20 minutes for a signal to reach Mars which is too slow for good control from the Earth,"" said Justin Byrne, head of Earth observation and science at Airbus Defence and Space. ""This way the rover can get itself out of trouble. ""We are going to Mars to look for signs of life -- and this is an important step towards that goal,"" he said. Airbus says the Mars Yard will be used up until launch but also kept available after the rover has landed in 2019 so that any potential problems can be simulated and solved back at the facility. The European agency's return to Mars comes more than a decade after its last attempt to land. ESA's Mars Express is still in orbit around the Red Planet and has been sending back data for 10 years. It recently made a close flyby of the Mars moon Phobos with the aim of finding out more about its mass and interior structure. But its lander, Beagle 2, which was intended to search for evidence of life on Mars, was lost on Christmas Day 2003 after it failed to make contact with the orbiter. Exploring Mars is a tough challenge. Many missions have failed since the earliest attempts at landing. A Soviet probe made the first human impact when its lander crashed in 1971. But since then, a series of NASA rovers have provided a wealth of information about the hostile Martian environment. Curiosity has been analyzing samples scooped from the soil and drilled from rocks since landing in 2012. And Opportunity has traveled abound 40km (24 miles) and returned data from the Red Planet for more than a decade. Two more spacecraft are currently en route to the planet. India's Mars Orbiter Mission and NASA's MAVEN orbiter are due to reach their target in September this year.

"(CNN) -- Actress Mackenzie Phillips has said that she believes she had a ""genetic predisposition"" to the life of sex, drugs and rock and roll that have come to define her. Mackenzie Phillips tells CNN's ""Larry King Live"" that her father raped her in 1979. In a 1999 interview on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on ""Why Some Childhood Stars Crash and Burn,"" the former ""One Day at a Time"" star said she didn't blame Hollywood for the years of drug and addiction she had endured. ""I think that for a lot of us, alcoholism and addiction is the root of the problem, not the fact that we were child stars,"" she said at the time. ""Certainly, it lent to the problem, but it wasn't the root of the problem."" By the time she did the interview, her well-publicized addiction to cocaine, drug arrests and stints in rehab had overshadowed an acting career once full of promise. Then, on Wednesday, the 49-year-old actress revealed on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" that she engaged in an incestuous relationship with her father, legendary musician John Phillips, for nearly 10 years. In her tell-all memoir, ""High on Arrival"" -- named after a song her father dedicated to her -- she claims the relationship began in 1979. She claims her father forced himself on her while they were under the influence of drugs on the night before she was to marry Jeff Sessler, a member of the Rolling Stones' entourage. She ended the relationship a decade later, when she became pregnant and realized she did not know who had fathered her child -- her husband or her own father -- and terminated the pregnancy, the actress told CNN's ""Larry King Live.""  Watch Phillips discuss her alleged incestuous relationship with her father » . But before the incest claims -- and subsequent denials from relatives -- Mackenzie Phillips was better known as a child actor full of promise who fell from grace under the toxic guidance of her drug-addicted father. Born Laura Mackenzie Phillips in 1959 to John Phillips and Baltimore socialite Susan Adams, Phillips told People magazine in 1980 that she alternated between two wildly different worlds after her parents divorced when she was three years old. ""My mother concentrated on bringing me up a proper lady,"" Mackenzie Phillips told the magazine. ""And then on weekends at my dad's place, I would find Mick Jagger and Donovan and the Beatles hanging out. I remember crawling all over Paul McCartney."" Her father taught her to roll a joint when she was 10, she tried cocaine for the first time when she was 11 and lost her virginity at age 12, she told Meredith Vieira of NBC's""Today"" show. When she was 12, a talent scout for Francis Ford Coppola spotted her playing in a band with classmates on amateur night at the Troubadour, according to People.com. She eventually landed a memorable role in the 1973 hit coming-of-age flick, ""American Graffiti."" After filming, her mother sent her to a Swiss boarding school, but the rebellious teen didn't last long in exile. She returned to her father's home in Los Angeles under the supervision of her father's sister, Rosemary Throckmorton. When her father and stepmother left for New York in 1974 and never returned, Mackenzie, her brother Jeffrey, moved in with their aunt in ""a little house behind the Hollywood Bowl which we shared with 12 cats,"" according to People.com. Despite her relocations, Phillips' career continued to advance. At 15, she appeared in her second movie, ""Rafferty and the Gold Dust Twins,"" with Alan Arkin. In 1975, she was offered the role of Julie Cooper on CBS' hit sitcom, ""One Day at a Time,"" according to IMDB.com. ""By the time I turned 18, I moved into a little chalet of my own and felt very grown-up,"" Mackenzie told People in an interview in 1980. As her star grew, so did her appetite for drugs, particularly cocaine. A few years later, just after she turned 18, Phillips was arrested when she was found collapsed on quaaludes on a street in Los Angeles. Phillips said on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" that her father's response was, ""Congratulations! Now you're a real Phillips. Now you know that even though they caught you, the rules don't apply."" Her weight loss and erratic behavior disrupted the show's filming and became a source of distress to her co-stars, Bonnie Franklin and Valerie Bertinelli, according to People.com. According to Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh's ""The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows,"" Phillips missed the 1980-81 season while in rehab for addiction issues. When she went to seek treatment at Fair Oaks, a psychiatric hospital in Summit, New Jersey, in December 1980, she joined her father and stepmother, who entered the hospital after being charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics, according to People.com. She left with a clean bill of health, but soon enough resumed using drugs even as she attempted to rebuild her career as a member of her father's new version of the Mamas & the Papas. In her memoir, she recalls arriving at a hotel room to find two packages -- one containing her father's newly published memoir and another containing an eighth of an ounce of cocaine, according to excerpts of the book published on MSNBC.com. After shooting up, she recalls reaching for the book and looking up her name in the index. ""Under my name was a list of subheadings and page numbers. I scanned down the entries: . Phillips, Laura Mackenzie . acting career of... arrested on drug charges... attempts to clean out... in California... childhood of... drug use by... early childhood of... at finishing school in Switzerland... Jeff Sessler and... marriage to Jeff Sessler... Peter Asher and... rape.... shipboard romance on QE 2... ""There it was, my life to date, with highlights selected, cross-referenced, and alphabetized. I had been organized and reduced to a list of sensational and mostly regrettable and/or humiliating anecdotes. Being indexed, particularly under such dubious headings, gave me a weird feeling that definitely wasn't pride. I felt like I wasn't a real person, just a list of incidents and accidents,"" she writes in the book. Her television career experienced a revival in the 1990s, with guest appearances on hot shows including ""Beverly Hills, 90210,"" ""Melrose Place,"" ""Walker, Texas Ranger"" and ""Chicago Hope,"" her profile on IMDB.com states. From 1999 to 2001, she had a regular role in the Disney series, ""So Weird,"" and several other television guest appearances followed, according to IMDB.com. She appeared to be getting her life back on track, eventually giving birth to a son, Shane. She was arrested in for drug possession in 2008 on her way to an ""One Day at a Time"" reunion. Since then, she says she has been drug-free, and hopes that purging herself of the secret incestuous relationship will help her recover. Yet she insists she does not hate her father for what he did. ""I have to say that I loved my father, and I still do. I've been trying to come to terms with this very difficult past,"" Phillips told Winfrey.","Mackenzie Phillips believes she had ""genetic predisposition"" to substance abuse .

"(CNN) -- North Korea twice came back from behind to hold Greece 2-2 in a friendly between two sides heading to the World Cup next month, while fellow finalists Paraguay lost 2-1 to the Republic of Ireland. In a match played at a neutral venue in Altach, Austria, Costas Katsouranis gave Greece the lead in the second minute with a close-range finish. The Koreans leveled when Jong Tae-se beat two players and fired a shot past goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis. Angelos Charisteas came off the bench to put the Greeks 2-1 in front shortly after half-time but, three minutes later, Jong raced down the right flank, cut inside and slammed home his second. Greece substitute goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas had to be at his sharpest to keep out a powerful shot from Cha Jong-hyok that could have won the game for the Asian side. In Dublin, first-half goals from Kevin Doyle and Liam Lawrence helped Ireland to victory over the South Americans. Wolves striker Doyle bundled the opener after Paraguay forward Roque Santa Cruz had headed against his own bar. Lawrence smashed home the second in the 39th minute following a chest down from Doyle. Lucas Barrios pulled a goal back on his Paraguay debut but Giovanni Trapattoni's men held on for victory. The Paraguayans are in the same group as defending champions Italy, New Zealand and Slovakia at the World Cup. Elsewhere, there were disappointing results for two of the African qualifiers as Cameroon drew 0-0 with Georgia and Nigeria tied 0-0 with Saudi Arabia.","North Korea draw 2-2 with fellow World Cup finalists Greece in Austria .

"Sandy is winding down, having spent much of its fury in the past two days crashing into homes and trees, cutting power and wrecking coastal cities. It has claimed at least 40 lives in the United States. The system still reaches from the Appalachians to the Great Lakes and beyond to Canada, and it is triggering winter storm warnings from the mountains of Pennsylvania to those of Eastern Tennessee and North Carolina. A running CNN tally reflects a steady restoration of power to affected areas, but early Wednesday, nearly 6.2 million customers were still without power in 15 states and Washington. Here's a look at how Sandy has affected the United States and Canada. Sandy changes lives forever -- here are three of their stories . CONNECTICUT . -- The death toll stands at two, according to Lt.

"Israel has decided to suspend all working ties with the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland, and will not cooperate with the council's plans for an investigation of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories, Israel's foreign ministry spokesman told CNN Monday. ""Working relations, participating in debates and discussion and exchanging papers, sending information and requesting information, and organizing visits and so on and so on, this is all suspended,"" Yigal Palmor said about the decision by senior management of the Foreign Ministry. The move came in response to a resolution by the Human Rights Council to establish a ""Fact Finding Mission on the Influence of Settlements on Palestinians,"" the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a posting on its website. It described the move as ""yet another surrealistic decision from the workshop of a council that is instrumentalized as a tool to push for one-sided politicized moves instead of promoting human rights."" It accused the council of seeking ""to satisfy the Palestinians' whims and to harm future chances to reach an agreement through peaceful means."" The statement said that turning to international bodies ""is a breach of concluded Israeli-Palestinian agreements."" It said Palestinians should resume ""direct and unconditional negotiations on all core issues within the framework of a comprehensive agreement"" if they want to solve the settlements issue.""Their deliberate choice to foster confrontation and provocation rather than compromise and reconciliation is nothing but a destructive strategy that the international community should firmly reject."" Boy, 9, wants Israel on his U.S. passport . Palmor said the Israelis were discussing possible punitive measures against the Palestinians. But Mohamad Shtayeh, senior Palestinian negotiator, dismissed the uproar and the threat.  ""We know Israel is not in a position to take any measures against the Palestinian Authority because the Palestinian Authority is taking peaceful measures to protect its land and its people and this is something very legitimate and legal under international law,"" he said. In a statement communicated by the media adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister berated the council as ""hypocritical"" and said it ""ought to be ashamed of itself."" In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the United States had ""vigorously opposed the resolution"" on the settlements as counterproductive. ""It's just going to distract efforts to help parties resolve the issue directly, which is what has to happen here, and it takes up time and limited resources that the council ought to be spending on other issues,"" she said.","Israel says it will not cooperate with an investigation of Jewish settlements .

"The debate about inequality just keeps heating up. At the end of the year, President Barack Obama called it ""the defining challenge of our time."" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio just promised a war for equality. Democrats across the country are thrilled at the prospect of raising  the minimum wage. The 50th anniversary of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society speech seems to have riled everybody up. And on Tuesday, Democrats won a small potential victory on behalf of the jobless, squeaking past a procedural hurdle so the Senate can proceed with debate on a bill that would extend emergency unemployment benefits for three months. But behind the headlines, the story is more complex. For one thing, we need to be clear what kind of inequality we care about. Do we want to close the gap between low and high earners, in which case a higher  minimum wage would help? Or is it between the employed and unemployed, where a higher minimum wage is irrelevant or possibly slight harmful -- but where unemployment benefits help a lot? Or is the income inequality we are worried about the one between the poor and the middle class, or the one between the affluent and the really, really affluent -- that is, the top 1% . Most important of all, we need to be clearer about whether we are seeking greater equality of outcomes,  or greater equality of opportunity. Obama reminded us that America has long stood as a nation that promotes equality of rights and opportunities, rather than outcomes. There are big gaps in the United States between rich and poor, mostly because the state is a much less enthusiastic redistributor of income than in other nations. Inequality is a political choice, rather than an economic fact. Taking money from the successful to help the struggling is close to an un-American idea. But as Obama noted, American tolerance of inequality has historically rested upon an assumption of shared opportunity. The trouble is, America is now not very equal in terms of opportunity, either. Scholars are wrestling with the question of how income inequality and intergenerational mobility are related to each other. Intuitively, it seems harder to climb a ladder when the rungs are farther apart. So inequality may cause immobility, in a relationship popularized by the economist Alan Krueger as a ""Great Gatsby Curve."" But it is not a straightforward relationship. For one thing,  there are some nations with similar rates of inequality to the United States, but much higher rates of mobility, such as Canada and Australia. Meanwhile, in other nations with low rates of social mobility, such as Italy, greater government redistribution softens the blow. The children of the poor may end up poor, but their poverty is less biting than in the United States. And of course there are some countries that are both equal and enjoy mobility, such as those in Scandinavia. Inequality and immobility are a toxic combination regardless. An unequal, immobile society will mutate into a stratified one with sharply separated classes, generation after generation. In his speech, Obama stirred low mobility, low wages and high inequality together into a political goulash of ""an economy that works for all Americans."" That's fine for political positioning. But when it comes to policy, choices have to be made. A higher minimum wage will raise incomes among low-income workers but will do little to reduce inequality, since the poorest don't work -- and the incomes of the top 1%, where the real inequality action is, will be unaffected. If the goal is to address income inequality seriously, the solution is to tax the richest more and put that revenue into tax credits and welfare benefits. Doing so will even out incomes but will likely do little to alter the distribution of opportunities. If we want to tackle intergenerational mobility, that money would be far better spent on parenting programs, pre-K schemes, higher salaries to lure talented teachers to tough schools, greater subsidies for smart, poor children going to college and tighter regulation of internships. None of which will influence short-run income inequality one jot. Obama's rhetoric leaned more toward boosting social mobility. But his policy prescriptions tilted more toward addressing inequality and wage levels. Which does he really want? He might of course say both. But it's not realistic to imagine we can become Denmark. The real choice is to try and recover the notion of an open society in the American Dream, currently flourishing in Canada, or accept the slow ossification of the class divide and do a better job of compensating the poor for their increasingly inherited poverty. If we give up on the hope of improving social mobility, the moral claims of European-style egalitarianism will become harder to resist. A large gap between rich and poor is one thing when there's plenty of movement between the two, but quite another when affluence and poverty are inherited. There is a moral justification for a society with high inequality offset by high mobility, grounded in liberal ideas of freedom and fairness. And there is a moral justification for a society with low mobility, softened by low inequality, based on left-of-center egalitarian ideals. But there is no moral justification for a society with a large gap between rich and poor, and little movement between the two. That's the toxic combination we're suffering from right now.","Richard V. Reeves: Inequality debate masks complex issue of inequality vs. social mobility .

"(CNN) -- The year is almost out of here, and boy has it been a whopper. No, we don't mean the economy or politics. We're talking about the ups and downs of Hollywood celebrities. For some, 2013 has been an amazing year filled with all the good things fame can bring: fans, sales and awards. For others, not so much. The less fortunate have had to deal with criticism, lawsuits and blaring headlines. Here are five stars who rocked it out in 2013 -- and five who had the rock fall on them: . Miley Cyrus . Cyrus may not have been named Time's Person of the Year, but for a minute there it seemed possible. At one point Cyrus was leading in an online poll for the coveted title, but ultimately the magazine's editors chose Pope Francis (thank God, right?). Yet even without the honor, it's hard to dispute the obvious: Cyrus kind of owned 2013. Her scantily clad performance with singer Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards in August had everyone talking, and spawned everything from infographics to Halloween costumes. ""You can call Miley Cyrus a lot of things after her bizarre 2013, but poor, uneventful and un-newsworthy aren't some of them,"" wrote Scott Davis for Forbes. ""In one of the most calculated exercises in Marketing 101, Cyrus schooled major brands by understanding that it is not just about becoming the dialog, but orchestrating it and the ecosystem that surrounds it."" Much like her Disney Channel character Hannah Montana, Cyrus seemed to emerge in 2013 as two different people. One, the young woman crazy in love with her gorgeous (now-ex) fiance Liam Hemsworth, and the other an edgy singer who hung out with rappers and twerked in a unicorn onsie. (You can probably thank Cyrus for the fact that you even know what ""twerking"" is despite the dance style having been around for years.) And she didn't stop there. The video for her ode to heartbreak, ""Wrecking Ball,"" featured a nude Cyrus swinging on a wrecking ball, showing the singer suggestively licking a sledgehammer. In November she lit up what appeared to be a joint on stage at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards, performed alongside a crying kitten at the American Music Awards, and she was one of only three female solo artists in 2013 to debut an album with more than 150,000 copies sold (Lady Gaga and Katy Perry were the other two). Cyrus charmed while hosting ""Saturday Night Live""; her cache allowed her to celebrate her 21st birthday by ""taking over"" MTV for the day, and her more than 15 million Twitter followers are happy to retweet her candid photos of anything and everything, including the singer in bed and kissing her dog. Cyrus may be the most visible, but she's not the only celebrity to have a big year. There is also: . Justin Timberlake . The former boy bander had the biggest album of the year, ""The 20/20 Experience,"" which sold 968,000 copies when it debuted in March, held the No. 1 position for weeks and followed that with a second volume, ""The 20/20 Experience -- 2 of 2"" last month. He joined the elite ""Five-Timers Club"" of hosts for ""SNL,"" and his history of rap performances with Jimmy Fallon are viral gold. Timberlake's ""reunion"" with 'N Sync at the VMAs almost exploded the Internet, and he toured with the equally cool Jay Z. Oh, and did we mention he continued to bring sexy back by looking adorable the whole entire time? Kerry Washington . Her success in 2013 was, dare we say, ""Scandal""-ous. Not only does she star on one of the hottest TV shows of the year, but she also graced countless magazine covers, was named best dressed by People and was the Emmy ""It"" girl of the season. Washington also managed to pull off a secret marriage, keep her pregnancy under wraps and host ""SNL"" during a firestorm of controversy regarding the comedy show's lack of diversity. Jennifer Lawrence . Don't you just love her? Lawrence has continued to build a reputation as incredibly approachable and just downright cool. Whether it's giving the best quotes during interviews or inspiring amazing gifs, she is helping to shape pop culture. Along the way she also starred in ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"" one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited films of the year, and ""American Hustle."" We aren't the only ones enthralled by the actress: Barbara Walters selected her as one of the 10 most fascinating people of 2013. Sandra Bullock . Bullock continued to be America's sweetheart. She was equally comfortable in the pages of Vogue as she was dressed up for Halloween with son Louis. Early buzz has her pegged as an Oscar contender for ""Gravity."" She also scored with lighter fare such as the female buddy-cop film ""The Heat"" with Melissa McCarthy. And how many movie stars know the lyrics to the classic hip-hop tune ""Rapper's Delight""? While these celebrities enjoyed a great year, there are a few who didn't fare as well: . Justin Bieber . The poster child for a not-so-great 2013 would have to be Bieber. Where to begin even? It seemed like he stayed in the news with everything from losing his monkey to a car accident and a run-in with a neighbor. There was also lots of speculation about his time spent in Brazil. To pull it all together for you, we prepared a guide to Justin Bieber's bad year. Amanda Bynes . Bynes easily assumed the mantle of troubled starlet that Lindsay Lohan had previously owned. Bynes had quite a bit of legal trouble and some bizarre tweets in which she attacked fellow celebs. Nick Cannon penned a letter of support. After being placed on a psychiatric hold, she eventually went into treatment and now appears to be on the mend. Lindsay Lohan . Speaking of Lohan, her ""comeback"" fell kind of flat. The New York Times painted a less than flattering portrait of her on the set of ""The Canyons"" which, despite having an actual porn star acting opposite her, failed to generate much heat (the SXSW festival passed on it). Even what was billed as a super confessional interview with Oprah Winfrey didn't seem to get people very excited about her and her career. Kimye . It should have been a great year for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. A new baby and an engagement and a new album for him. But the pair spent 12 months being raked over the coals from the body shaming of Kardashian's pregnant body to further shaming after she lost weight and posted a selfie of her ample curves in a revealing bathing suit. Meanwhile, West seemed to court contention every time he opened his mouth -- be it comparing Kardashian to Michelle Obama or deeming himself the No.1 rock star on the planet. It got so bad that people wanted to believe West really said he was ""the next Nelson Mandela,"" but even he wouldn't say that. And let's not forget that now notorious music video. Chris Brown . There is probably little sympathy for Brown for landing on the list of those who had a bad year. The singer has never fully rebounded from pleading guilty to assaulting his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, in 2009. Many didn't know what to make of it when the pair briefly reconciled in 2013. Brown was booked on a hit-and-run charge in July that was later dropped, and in October was accused of assaulting a man in Washington. Brown later entered rehab to deal with anger management issues and consequently was kicked out for ""acting violently.""

"It takes Sanduk Ruit about five minutes to change someone's life. In that time, the Nepalese doctor can make a small incision in his patient's eye, remove the cloudy cataract impairing her vision and replace it with an inexpensive artificial lens. ""Some of our younger surgeons even do it faster than that,"" Ruit told CNN. For many patients, it's the first time they've seen in years, if not decades. In the past 30 years, Ruit has personally restored the sight of more than 100,000 people across Asia and Africa, and taught his rapid-fire technique to countless other eye surgeons in parts of the world as isolated as North Korea. His patients suffer from eye conditions that are mostly preventable. But because of poverty and limited access to public health services they have been unable to seek treatment. Their story is all too common in the developing world. An estimated 39 million people are blind worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Of these, around 90% live in low-income areas and 80% suffer from conditions that can be prevented or cured. Reaching remote communities . Driven by a belief that the world's poorest people deserve safe, affordable and high-quality eye care just as much as anyone else, Ruit has made it his mission to eradicate avoidable blindness. In 1994, he joined the late Australian ophthalmologist and philanthropist Fred Hollows, who was his mentor and close friend, in establishing Tilganga -- an eye hospital in Kathmandu dedicated to providing world-class eye care to the people of Nepal. The hospital manufactures state-of-the-art lenses that are commonly used in treating cataracts or myopia, and exports them to more than 30 countries worldwide. For those who cannot reach urban areas, Ruit and his team conduct mobile eye camps in remote parts of Nepal and neighboring countries, often trekking for days and cleaning out structures like tents, classrooms or even animal stables for use as temporary operating theaters. When the eye patches come off the day after an operation, it's an incredibly moving moment for all involved. Australian photographer Michael Amendolia has been capturing these intimate scenes -- the expressions of relief and tears of joy -- while traveling with Ruit and his colleagues since the early 1990s. To mark the 20th anniversary of Tilganga, Amendolia has released some of his most striking images of Ruit and his team at work in Nepal and other countries in the region, including Bhutan, China, Myanmar, North Korea and Indonesia. Infiltrating North Korea . Amendolia, who described Ruit as ""a maverick in some ways,"" accompanied the Nepalese surgeon on one of the first trips to North Korea in 2006. The Communist state is notoriously closed off to Westerners. International aid workers frequently struggle to reach those most in need, in a country where two-thirds of the population experiences chronic food shortages, according to the United Nations. But Ruit, who believes in leaving politics to world leaders, had persuaded the North Korean authorities to allow his team to conduct the 2006 surgery and training session in the south-eastern city of Haeju after he had treated one of their diplomats stationed at the embassy in Kathmandu. ""It was very restrictive,"" said Amendolia. ""We made the same path from the hotel in Haeju, the same way every day to the hospital, the same way exactly back and that's all we saw of Haeju for the seven or so days that we were there."" Amendolia describes how the North Korean surgeons, who came from across the country, were so eager to learn that they huddled close to Ruit, leaning over the operating table to get a better look as he worked. ""I've never seen an eye operation where (Ruit) had so many surgeons around him,"" he said. In the room where the recovering patients were examined, portraits of then-leader Kim Jong Il and his predecessor Kim Il Sung hung from the wall. Transforming lives . One of the most moving images in Amendolia's collection is that of an 80-year-old North Korean man who sees his son for the first time in 10 years after being completely blind in both eyes. ""Of course, the man who's had the operation is so relieved because he can see again, but the whole family suddenly have a family member who can participate again in everything that happens as home,"" Amendolia said. Patients who are blind in both eyes require constant care, placing a burden on their families that can keep them trapped in a cycle of poverty. But this quick-healing surgery allows them to regain their independence. The same transformative moment is played out for long-neglected patients in the mountains of Nepal, the islands of Indonesia and rural China. Ruit grew up in a small village in the Himalayas so isolated that the nearest school was a week's walk away. When he was 17, his sister died of tuberculosis despite the disease being treatable. The loss left Ruit with a sense of urgency to pursue a path that benefited others, not only himself. It's a decision he doesn't regret. ""I am so grateful that I can make a difference in so many people's lives,"" Ruit said. At 59, that same sense of urgency that motivated him as a young man remains. When asked what it feels like to watch as a patient sees the world clearly the first time, he responded: ""It really recharges you and makes you move forward."" But he cautioned that there remains so much he wants to do.","Nepalese doctor, Sanduk Ruit, has restored the vision of 100,000 people over 30 years .

"(CNN)The moon has risen, and it's quiet around this little Armenian village. Past a field of tilled soil and over a stone wall in a little brick house, the children have been put to bed and there is a kettle on the stove. A woman speaks in a hushed voice on the phone. Her voice is tired but full of emotion. Another woman rises with the dawn and slips a scarf over her hair as she steps into the dew of a new morning. She ushers the livestock with a rough wooden stick to the point of gathering -- from there, the village shepherd will take the animals out to pasture. Still another woman, with aged hands and a furrowed brow, is bent low over a pile of potatoes. She peels them tirelessly as she prepares food for her family. In the Armenian village of Lichk, you will find many hard-working women, but you will not find many men. All these women's husbands are thousands of miles away. Because of the poor economic situation of this village, 90% of its working-age men have left for better-paying construction jobs in Russia. So for eight or nine months a year, women run the village. These are sturdy women. A grit and strength sustain them as they bravely take care of not only their families, but also their village as a whole. Photographer Julien Pebrel had been working in the Caucasus region when he heard rumors of towns without men. He and his translator did some investigating and found the stories were true. He spent two weeks in September 2013 documenting the lives of the women of Lichk. Social media . Follow @CNNPhotos on Twitter to join the conversation about photography. Pebrel stayed with Anoush and Ruzanna, two sisters-in-law who lived together with their families while their husbands worked in Russia. He captured painterly scenes of the village with his Rolleiflex film camera, only using his digital camera in low-lighting situations. ""That's why I love film,"" he said. ""You don't need to do post-production to get some beautiful colors."" And indeed he has captured the feeling of a bygone era. The colors and lighting give the images a storybook quality. There is a great sense of community among the women. Everything is a team effort, from working the land, uprooting vegetables, herding the livestock across dirt roads, sheering curly-haired sheep, baking flat bread and raising wide-eyed little ones. Now this is not to say that there are no men whatsoever in Lichk. Look under the shade of a cool brick wall, and you can find the older generation wearing caps and denim as they tell stories and play cards on splintery wooden tables. These men serve as a source of authority over unruly schoolboys and provide support for their daughters-in-law. But even Pebrel says it is still ""the women who do everything."" In the beginning, Anoush and Ruzanna didn't discuss the emotional toll this separation takes on them. But by the end, they acknowledged that while most of the women in the town do trust their husbands, there is still an underlying fear that the men may lead a secret life in Russia. Worse yet is that some of the men never return. ""We try not to think too much about that,"" the women told him. While there is a great deal of determined patience required for both the husbands and wives, the winter months are a time of pure celebration. When the men return at the end of the year, the village is filled with weddings, parties and births. It's a time of joyful reuniting. (Although Pebrel said he overheard stories of children who did not recognize their fathers when they returned.) Those three months together are savored before the husbands, sons and fathers will pack their suitcases and leave for the majority of another year. Again, the women will unwaveringly take the helm of this village. Despite the fiscal hardships, the exhausting manual labor and the lonely pangs they face, they remain strong and full of love.

""Well, today is important because I will present my candidacy for the president of FIFA."" AT: . ""Big, big announcement, what made you decide to want to try to become the next FIFA president?"" LF: . ""The important thing is the love of football. I care about football so what I am seeing regarding the image of FIFA, not only now but in the past years, I don't like it. ""I've been talking with so many people. Important people in football, football players, managers, presidents of federation, all these things they have to be done. ""Last year was a World Cup year and I was in Brazil and I saw the reaction of the fans regarding the image of FIFA. I think something had to be changed. A change in leadership, change in governance, in transparency and in solidarity, so I think it is the moment for that."" AT: . ""You say you don't like what people have been saying to you about FIFA's image. What have they been telling you?"" LF: . ""Well all the people have the idea that a world organization like FIFA, an organization that has the power to, and the image of football for the world must be different. ""If you search right now FIFA, you know, on the internet, or communications... you see the first words that comes out are scandal -- not positive words regarding the name of FIFA. So instead we have to change first and try to improve the nature of FIFA in the world because football deserves much better than this."" AT: . ""To get to the election you need to be nominated by five national associations and you need to show that you've worked in football for two of the last five years. Have you got those criteria?"" LF: . ""Well I know well the criteria for the candidate of the presidency of FIFA. In the past years I have been working in several roles in Inter Milan, in Portuguese national team, in UEFA, and I have the five letters of support from the different kind of national teams so I can say I am real candidate. After today I'm looking forward to opening debate and to run for the presidency, and try to have the support of federations and have the chance to be president."" AT: .

I was in that position for four years, and after the regulation, the changing of the new president in the club, so I left and began working for the Portuguese national team, and UEFA and commenting on football, so I'm pretty happy with what I made since I retired. ""But I care about football and I care about what is going on right now, and FIFA has made me do this step so I'm trying to do some positive steps."" AT: . ""Being FIFA president is probably more complicated than it looks. Are you ready to learn all the technical rules and regulations that you need to?"" LF: . ""Well I know that.

""Of course I have my ideas about football, what is good for playing and for FIFA right now. But I think my experience of my career, my own life, is a positive thing that allows me to understand how is the game, and of course I need to know from the federations --what they expect and what they want for the future of football."" AT: . ""So you're announcing today that you're in the running to be FIFA president, but how long have you been thinking about it? Was there one moment that made you think I have to run?"" LF: . ""Well I've been thinking regarding this possibility a few months, been talking of course with my family, with the people who are close to me, a lot of agents in football, players, managers, a lot of people. ""There was a moment, after it became public that FIFA ordered to investigate by doing some report about what was happening in bids of Russia and Qatar. After that moment and after that report was not published, I think that was the moment of change and the moment that I saw something needed to be done."" AT: . ""What made you so annoyed about that moment? When Michael Garcia had to resign because he thought not enough had been done."" LF: . ""Well because if you are transparent and if you ask for some investigation, for some report, if you've got nothing to hide, why don't you make public that report? I think that if you have nothing to hide about that, if you're very clear, you have to do it."" AT: . ""So if you were FIFA president would you reopen that investigation and make that report public?"" LF: .

AT: . ""And if you were FIFA president, on your first day in the job what's the number one priority?"" LF: . ""My first priority is know from the federations what they need, but I think one important thing that I have made is to increase the solidarity payments to the federations, because right now FIFA has so many financial reserves that belong to the federations.

Others have been accused of doing it as publicity stunts. How can you reassure people that you're in this for the right reasons?"" LF: . ""Well I respect all the other candidates.

LF: . ""Because I love football, I care about football. I think that life is a challenge and if you don't take the step to improve obviously that is not correct. I think if you don't have challenges every day... For me, it's about giving back to football so many things that football gives to me through my life. ""I think that is most important.

"Violent crime in the United States fell for the fifth consecutive year in 2011 with murder, rape and robbery all going down, although crime remains a serious problem in many urban areas, the FBI said on Monday. The report of all crimes reported to police nationwide showed slightly more than 1.2 million violent incidents nationwide, while property crimes hit a nine-year low. Compared with 2010, the new figures show violent crime down 3.8 percent overall. Property crime was down 0.5 percent. Among violent incidents reported to police, murders were down about 0.7 percent, robberies dropped 4 percent, aggravated assaults declined 3.9 percent, and forcible rapes were down 2.5 percent. Despite the positive trend, crime remains a serious problem in many urban pockets riddled with gangs, drugs, and poverty. There were 14,612 murders last year, on average one every 36 minutes.  That's a small decline from 14,722 in 2010, but it's a decrease of nearly 17 percent from a decade ago. Most victims were male and in cases where race was known, 50 percent were black and 46 percent were white. Statistics showed 514 murders in New York and 431 in Chicago. Guns were used in two thirds of the nation's murders last year, 41 percent of robberies, and 21 percent of aggravated assaults, the report showed. The closely watched Uniform Crime Reports do not include explanations for the consolidated figures, and the FBI does not comment on the data. However, criminologists point to a variety of factors for the continuing decline in overall violence. They cite a more settled crack cocaine market, an increase in incarcerations, an aging population, data-driven policing, and changes in technology that include a big increase in surveillance cameras. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said crime has continued to decline from a peak in the 1990s but now is decreasing at a slower rate. ""I call it the limbo stick effect,"" Fox said. "" You can only go so low. You're never going to get down to zero crime."" The FBI crime statistics differed from a telephone crime survey released by the Justice Department early this month. That report actually showed crime increasing last year, but attributed the change to a jump in simple assaults. Fox said many of those assaults described to interviewers were non-injury pushing and shoving incidents not reported to any law enforcement agencies. He also noted the increase that the Justice Department reported was from an all-time low in the crime rate the previous year, suggesting crime is entering a low level where police officials hope it will stay for some time.","Crime still falling from 1990s peak but decreasing at slower rate, expert said .

"Floods continued to devastate communities alongside the surging River Elbe in Germany's northeastern Saxony-Anhalt state Wednesday. Hundreds of people are being evacuated from their homes in the towns of Stendal and Aken, with the army using helicopters and amphibious vehicles to help move them to safety. ""One-hundred-and-fifty people refused to be evacuated, but were forced to leave their homes by authorities,"" a spokesman for Saxony-Anhalt's Interior Ministry in Magdeburg said. The evacuation process is still under way. In total, 45,000 people have been asked to leave their homes in Saxony-Anhalt, the state currently worst affected by the flooding. About 11,500 rescue workers are operating in the area. The village of Fischbeck, about six miles from Stendal, is completely flooded after a nearby dike was breached. Efforts to repair the dike have failed despite the deployment of two army helicopters to drop giant sand bags. Police who turned back a CNN team who tried to reach Fischbeck described the situation as critical and dangerous. Although the water level around Stendal is already falling, the water continues to flood villages downstream such as Klietz and Wust. Soldiers can't hold back the water . ""We expect the water to devastate further cities. Consequently we are trying to build new emergency dikes to stop the floods,"" said a spokesman for Saxony-Anhalt's interior ministry. Annette Friedebold, the owner of an animal park in Weissewarte, told CNN how she'd been forced to evacuate most of the 400 animals housed there, starting last Tuesday. ""We built small evacuation islands for the animals that had to stay. Fortunately, all of them survived the flooding. But it is going to take at least three months until everything will be rebuilt,"" she said. The flooding is the worst she has seen in more than 30 years working in Weissewarte. The village lies about 3.5 miles from the River Elbe, which is swollen from heavy rains at the start of the month. Record water levels along the Elbe as it makes its way to the North Sea have caused flooding in the Czech Republic, as well as eastern and northern Germany. Friedebold, who now has to travel through the park by boat to check on those animals who were left there, expects her park to be flooded for weeks to come. Like many other people in the affected regions, Friedebold hopes to receive donations. ""In 2002, when the last big flooding occurred, we thought we would have to file for bankruptcy. But we were lucky because a lot of people were there to help us,"" she said. ""A lot of our animals are still shocked and scared. But they have to be strong now."" Among the creatures still in the park are wild pigs and lynx. The latter sought refuge in the trees when the flood waters came. ""I still cannot believe what the water has done to me and my park,"" Friedebold said. The crest on the River Danube, which has also brought flooding to southern Germany, Austria and Slovakia, is expected to reach southern Hungary on Wednesday and the country's southwest a day later. Serbia is preparing for the Danube's waters to peak there in the next four days.","The army uses helicopter and amphibious vehicles to evacuate areas stranded by floods .

"As she positions herself for a potential presidential run in 2016, Hillary Clinton sought to shine her spotlight Monday on one of her longtime goals: narrowing the gender gap around the world through the use of data. The former Secretary of State spoke briefly Monday at an event with former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to give a progress report on their joint 2012 initiative known as ""data2x"" -- an effort intended to spark ""a gender data revolution"" -- which is a partnership of the Clinton Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies and the United Nations Foundation. Clinton noted that her quest to improve the data about the status of women around the world stemmed from her years as Secretary of State when she would try to broach those topics with other world leaders, who would ""smile and nod"" but often not take the topic seriously. ""You can't understand what the problem is if you don't have a good grasp of what the facts and figures are,"" Clinton said. At the State Department, she learned, she said, that she could not rely solely on the moral argument that women's rights should be considered human rights. Clinton said she wanted to use to data to build a case strong enough ""to convince the skeptics, based on hard data and clear-eyed analysis, that creating opportunities for women and girls across the world directly supports everyone's security and prosperity, and therefore should be an enduring part of our diplomacy and development work."" ""After all, good decisions in government, in business, in life, are based on evidence rather than ideology or gut feelings or anecdotes,"" Clinton said. The former Secretary of State did not address other topics in the news Monday -- namely last week's release of a Senate Intelligence Committee report on the CIA's use of torture as part of its interrogation practices during the presidency of George W. Bush. (President Obama banned the use of those techniques after taking office in 2009). Clinton has been closely monitoring progress on gender issues since her years as First Lady in the White House. It was at the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 that Clinton famously declared that ""human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights"" -- setting the course for her advocacy as a U.S. Senator from New York and later as Secretary of State. She and her daughter, Chelsea Clinton, have targeted their efforts through a Clinton Foundation initiative known as the ""No Ceilings"" project. At an event in February with her daughter Chelsea and philanthropist Melinda Gates, Clinton announced that the Clinton Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were embarking on a global review to track women's progress across the globe since the 1995 conference. That report will be released next spring.","Hillary Clinton joins forces with Michael Bloomberg on gender gap .

"Five people have fled from a cafe in the heart of Sydney where a dramatic hostage taking is unfolding Monday. But an unknown number of people remain in the cafe, held by at least one armed hostage taker. Hundreds of police officers have shut down a usually bustling area in Australia's most populous city amid the crisis. Chilling images from local media showed people, believed to be hostages, with their hands pressed against the glass of the Lindt Chocolate Cafe in Sydney's central business district. Footage showed them holding up a black flag with Arabic writing on it that reads: ""There is no God but God and Mohammed is the prophet of God."" Three people who were seen running out of the cafe ""are now out of the building and they are now with police,"" said New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn, declining to give details about whether they escaped or were let go. Video from CNN affiliate Seven Network later showed two more people running out of the cafe. Authorities said many of the details about the situation remained unclear, including the number of people inside the cafe and the motivations of the hostage taker. ""We don't know whether this is politically motivated, although obviously there are some indications that it could be,"" Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters. The Islamic writing on the banner stoked fears that the crisis in Sydney could be linked to extremists. Australia, which is part of the international coalition fighting the terrorist group ISIS in the Middle East, said in September that it had foiled a plot by Islamic militants to carry out a public execution. New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said it wasn't yet clear whether the situation at the cafe was a terrorist event but that police are on ""a footing that would be consistent with a terrorist alert."" Burn said police negotiators are now in contact with a hostage taker, who appears to have taken staff and customers captive as people were heading to work on Monday morning in the Martin Place area. Chris Kenny, an editor at The Australian newspaper, said he was at the cafe Monday morning. He left shortly before the siege started. ""As police quickly swarmed and cleared the area, I turned to see a man against the window, facing out with his hands raised,"" he wrote in his account of the incident. ""At first I was relieved thinking this was the gunman responding to police -- but soon the awful realisation the customers were being forced against the windows."" Seven Network reported that at least 13 people are being held at the cafe, but Scipione declined to say how many were in there. Police barricaded off streets and evacuated buildings near the cafe, bringing an eerie quiet to a district typically buzzing with pedestrians and vehicles. The Martin Place train station was shut down, according to police. They urged people to stay away from the area, but some local office workers gathered at the scene to try to find out what was going on. The buildings evacuated included the U.S. Consulate General, said Alicia Edwards, a spokeswoman. All personnel have been accounted for, although it's not known whether there are any U.S. citizens among the hostages. U.S. President Barack Obama has been briefed on the situation.","At least five people have fled the cafe, Seven Network video shows .

"This is the image that struck me more than any other watching the completed ""World Sport Presents: An Uneven Playing Field"" documentary for the first time. A group of women in Saudi Arabia huddled around a television screen watching and recording the moment that history was made -- and barriers were broken -- blazing a trail for future generations of women in their country. Sarah Attar becoming the first Saudi Arabian woman to represent their flag on the track at the Olympics. Never before had these women been able to watch one of their own running and representing like that on an international stage. It was unique, and unprecedented. And for me, it sums up London 2012 and women's sport. Those three weeks of the Olympics were undoubtedly like no other in my career as a sports journalist. Never before had we seen so much coverage of women's sports. It wasn't just the number of women we were talking about, but also the way in which we were talking about them. From Attar to her fellow Saudi Arabian trailblazer Wodjan Shahrkhani, to Jessica Ennis, Nicola Adams, Kayla Harrison, Gabby Douglas, Ye Shiwen and Ruta Meilutyte, there were women making the headlines everywhere you looked. We were discussing the battles, their performance, power and skills -- not just their hairstyles and love of shoes. It made it virtually impossible to rationalize the now infamous words of the founder of the modern Olympic movement -- Pierre de Coubertin -- from 1896: ""Olympics with women would be incorrect, unpractical, uninteresting, and unaesthetic."" I'm pleased to say we really do seem to have moved on from the view of women's sport as incorrect, unpractical and unaesthetic. Saudi Arabia was the last stronghold of that. But worryingly, now the excitement of the Olympics has died down, ""uninteresting"" seems to have returned to the psyche. Twelve months on from ""the Women's Games"" where has all the coverage gone? I carried out a quick survey on Friday August 2: admittedly it was pretty unscientific, but of 56 pages of sports coverage in six daily national newspapers from the UK and U.S. there were only five -- yes, five -- stories about women's sport. That's five out of 122 stories, and that would be classed as a good day. The ones there were covered South Korean golfer Inbee Park going for her fourth straight professional major in a calendar year, a feat that's never been accomplished in the women's game. It would have been a quite incredible achievement. Can you imagine the excitement if it had been Tiger Woods or Rory McIlroy on the verge of such an incredible quadruple? The other stories were about Ennis pulling out of the World Athletics Championships. Or in other words, the reigning Olympic heptathlon champion pulling out of her sport's second biggest event. Compare that to the coverage Bradley Wiggins got when it was announced he wouldn't be defending his Tour de France crown in 2013. Hands up (honestly) if you knew it wasn't in fact Inbee Park that won the women's British Open but America's Stacy Lewis. How much coverage in newspapers, or in TV news bulletins, was given to the phenomenal achievement of Germany's women's football team winning its sixth straight European Championship? Or Missy Franklin winning a record sixth gold medal at the world swimming championships? These women at the top of their game are done a disservice by the media. Why should men's sport be seen as more worthy of coverage than women's events? Why should we have to search these stories out online? There's no less competition, skill or sacrifice in what they achieve. Just like the International Olympic Committee's fight to get Saudi Arabia to send female athletes to the Olympics, it wasn't easy for those women to watch Attar's historic moment. Such was the opposition to allowing women to compete, domestic television stations and newspapers chose to ignore it altogether and instead focused their attention on the bronze medal-winning men's equestrian team. But the race was shown on a number of satellite channels and word did get out there. The Olympics has begun a process in Saudi Arabia that looks set to dramatically change the lives of women in the country. Having previously been banned, sports classes are now allowed in girls' schools -- and the country's first sports club for women opened in June, with training programs including physical fitness, karate and yoga. Whether we like it or not, the way media covers -- or doesn't cover -- people and events goes a long way to shaping attitudes.  Look at what's trendy or in fashion  or who's beautiful. If the media tell us it often enough, then people start to believe it. Sport is no different. Sarah Attar is being held up by many as an example to young girls in Saudi Arabia. A trailblazer to inspire not just a generation but a whole shift in society. Maybe a few more of us need to take note.","CNN's Amanda Davies heralds impact London Olympics had on women's sport .

"(CNN) -- The word ""epic"" gets thrown around a lot these days, but there's no other way to describe what we saw Tuesday. It was an epic battle. Team USA goalie Tim Howard on one hand. The entire Belgian team on the other. Facing the relentless onslaught of Belgium's offense, Howard made 16 saves -- setting a World Cup record. The United States lost the match 2-1 and is out of the tourney, but the nation gained a soccer hero. Here's what you need to know about the 35-year-old Howard: . He's a devout Christian . Faith is a key part of Howard's life and shapes who he is. ""The most important thing in my life is Christ,"" Howard said in a 2006 interview with Campus Crusade for Christ. ""He's more important to me than winning or losing or whether I'm playing or not. Everything else is just a bonus."" He was born in North Brunswick, New Jersey, to an African-American father and a Hungarian mother. He is all tatted up . Howard loves his body art. You want ink, you got it -- chest, abs, biceps, back. His kids are there on his left pec. Jesus is on the left biceps. You'll find his home state of New Jersey on his belly. There's a dove, too. A star. Some Roman numerals. The more you look, the more you find. He is anti-fur . Howard bared his well-sculpted upper body for PETA's ""Ink, not mink"" campaign. The pitch? ""Fur only looks good on its original owner. Be comfortable in your own skin, and let animals keep theirs."" He lives with Tourette's syndrome . For Howard, it's not a big deal -- just part of his life. But it does come with some misconceptions. ""It's something that I live with every day. For me now in my life, it's like breathing for me. If I woke up and didn't have Tourette's syndrome, it would feel weird -- not better or worse, just different. So I'm very happy and comfortable with it,"" he said. Many know it only as the ""swearing disease,"" but only about 10% of people with Tourette's syndrome swear uncontrollably. ""You know, we don't all curse,"" Howard told Yahoo Sports a couple of weeks ago. ""I do on the field, unfortunately, to get my point across, but it's not because of my condition."" People with Tourette's syndrome suffer from involuntary tics, which can be either verbal or physical. Physical tics may include jumping or twitching. People with the syndrome describe a tic as being like a sneeze, impossible to hold in without extreme discomfort. Twitter surrenders to Tourette's syndrome . He once scored a goal . How many goalkeepers can claim this feat? While playing for Everton, his English Premier League team, Howard booted a ball the length of the pitch, catching the Bolton goalie by surprise. The crowd and his teammates went nuts, but Howard told The Guardian he felt bad for the opposing keeper. ""You never want to see that happen,"" he said. ""It's not nice, it's embarrassing."" He wasn't really that good when he started out . When Howard began his pro career as a 22-year-old goalkeeper for the New York/New Jersey MetroStars of MLS, he was known as a great athlete who could make great saves. Some reports have even said he could have played basketball in college. But the 6-foot-3 Howard wasn't particularly good at other things, like distributing the ball after he made a nice stop. It's something he is much, much better at today. In 2001 he was MLS goalkeeper of the year. And Manchester United, one of the most successful European clubs in history, worked out a transfer deal for him. Howard spent four years with Manchester United before transferring to Everton. He is the 'modern Jesus' Even before the game ended Tuesday, Howard's incredible saves got Twitter in a tizzy. Comparisons to Jesus abounded. Sample tweet: ""Jesus saves, and so does Tim Howard."" Then came the memes of all the things #TimHowardCouldSave: Dinosaurs, the Titanic, Blockbuster from closing. He is the 'U.S. secretary of defense' Well, at least he was for a little while on Tuesday, according to Wikipedia. So impressive was his performance against the Belgians that someone edited the free on-line encyclopedia, pulling Chuck Hagel from the page and inserting Howard. The folks at Wikipedia caught the vandalism and restored the real secretary of defense to his rightful position. Someone thinks with a little mentoring Howard might be able to make that Wikipedia change again one day down the road. At least that's what the Pentagon says Hagel told Howard when he called him on Wednesday. Hagel phoned the goalkeeper to ""thank him for defending the United States of America at the World Cup,"" Pentagon press secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby said. Hagel also invited the team to drop by the Pentagon next time they are in town. ""He told Howard that with some training, he could someday become the real secretary of defense,"" Kirby said. He is one of the best goalies in the world . Don't believe us? Just ask his coaches. His club coach has said there is no better goalkeeper in the Premier League. ""His belief and understanding of the game and his desire to achieve more is contagious,"" Roberto Martinez told FIFA.com. National team coach Jurgen Klinsmann said in May that Howard is one of the top five goalies in the world. And, if there were any doubters, he silenced them all on Tuesday. He is coming back in 2018 (or is he?) This may not be Howard's final World Cup. Plenty of goalies have played in their late 30s and early 40s. But backup Brad Guzan, who plays at Aston Villa in England, is five years younger. Howard has yet to say whether he wants to be in the net when the team tries to qualify for Russia, host of the 2018 World Cup. And he wasn't giving any clues on Wednesday when he talked with CNN's Chris Cuomo. ""Right now, emotions are high and that's never a time to make an important decision,"" Howard said. ""I'll speak to the important people who matter in this process and take my time and figure it out. ""It's a long four years, but also this team is very talented and very young -- and so it's exciting."" Off the field: The men of the U.S. team .","The 35-year-old goalie made a World Cup-record 16 saves against Belgium .

"A Chinese ship arrived to escort ships picking up chemical weapons materials from Syria on Tuesday, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday. The frigate Yancheng is working closely with other ships from Russia and Europe, the agency reported, citing a Beijing Foreign Ministry statement. The international effort to dismantle Syria's chemical weapons program reached a milestone Tuesday when a Danish commercial ship picked up the first batch of important chemical materials, the group overseeing the work said. The ""priority chemical materials"" loaded at the Syrian port of Latakia, and the ship -- escorted by Danish and Norwegian warships -- left for international waters, the Joint Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations said Tuesday. The ship will remain at sea until more chemical materials are made available at the Latakia port for pickup. The chemicals eventually will be taken to locations outside Syria for destruction, the group said. Tuesday's move comes a week after a deadline for the first chemical materials to leave Syria. The mission blamed the delay on ""the continuing volatility in overall security conditions"" and on ""logistical challenges coupled with inclement weather."" Syria's chemical weapons are targeted for removal and elimination by the end of June. Syria agreed to have its program dismantled under international pressure last year over allegations the Syrian government used sarin nerve gas in an August 21 attack on a Damascus suburb. U.S. officials said at least 1,400 people died in the attack. Syria denied responsibility, blaming rebel forces.

"The legal fight over head injuries in football has made its way to the high school arena -- and is heading to court. A former Illinois high school football player has filed a class-action lawsuit against the Illinois High School Association over concussions protocols and management. ""It's the first-ever class action filed against a state high school association,"" said attorney Joseph Siprut, who filed on behalf of 29-year-old Daniel Bukal. Siprut also is the attorney who filed the class action against the NCAA over concussions -- the one that has reached a preliminary settlement with the NCAA that could change the rules of the college game if it's approved by a judge. ""Our goal is to bring the fight to the high school level,"" Siprut said. Lawsuits already exist that seek damages from the NCAA and NFL over how concussions are handled in college and pro ball. But neurosurgeons say that adolescent head injuries can be the most damaging, since they happen during a crucial developmental period. While the high school suit is, right now, only filed in Illinois, Siprut said the goal is to sue every state high school athletic association in the country, changing the rules in each state to make the game safer. Bukal, who attended Notre Dame College Prep in Illinois from 1999 to 2003, had many concussions during his high school career, the lawsuit said, but was never educated on the effects or the risks. More than 10 years later, he still suffers from migraines and memory loss, his lawsuit says. The suit alleges that the IHSA has failed young athletes because it ""does not mandate specific guidelines or rules on managing student-athlete concussions and head injuries,"" and ""fails to mandate the removal of athletes who have appeared to suffer in practice (as opposed to games)."" It also does not have baseline testing, and does have medical staff with concussion training present at games, the suit says. A spokesman for IHSA, which is a not-for-profit that regulates high school sports in the state, told CNN Monday that the suit was filed Saturday as the state's championship games were being played. The spokesman, Matt Troha, assistant executive director, provided CNN with a statement released on Saturday by IHSA Executive Director Marty Hickman. ""We will review the contents of the lawsuit in the coming days and comment if and when it is appropriate,"" Hickman said in the statement. ""Student-athlete risk minimization, especially as it relates to concussion management in high school football, is and remains a top priority of the IHSA. We believe that the IHSA, in working with national partners like the NFHS (National Federation of State High School Associations), has and will continue to be a leader in this area."" Bringing the legal fight to the high school level was almost inevitable. Similar lawsuits have been filed at the college and pro sport level, but both have met controversy. The NCAA suit, which is awaiting a judge's ruling on a $75 million settlement, is opposed by many NCAA critics who say it doesn't go far enough and doesn't directly benefit any of the players who have been injured. The $75 million would go to screening and research and lawyer fees, but not the players. ""The players are being sold out for $15 million in legal fees and the NCAA couldn't be happier,"" said Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association. He says the NCAA settlement didn't address enough key issues that lead to head trauma, like the number of contact practices each season. In pro football, an initial $765 million settlement was rejected by a federal judge, and then accepted later when the NFL agreed to put no cap on the monetary awards for thousands of former NFL players who have sued the league over injuries.","Daniel Bukal had many concussions as a high school football player, a lawsuit says .

"(CNN) -- From superstorms to floods, to historic heat waves and droughts, not a week goes by without a major disruption somewhere in our communities. Between 2011 and 2013, 48 states and two-thirds of American counties endured crises severe enough to be declared major disasters. Of course, these events aren't preventable, but there are often steps we can take to change how we prepare and respond. Indeed, with the right preparation, not every extreme weather disruption has to become a disaster. Hurricane Sandy underscores what can be done. The deadly 2012 storm was devastating for communities along the Eastern Seaboard. But the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Rockefeller Foundation asked the question: What if we focused on planning and preparing as much as we do on disaster reaction and response? So we partnered to create Rebuild by Design, a competition that brings together engineering and design experts with public, philanthropic and community organizations to try to find ways of rebuilding that make communities like those affected in New York and New Jersey more environmentally and economically resilient. And now the competition is hitting the national stage, with the HUD-led $1 billion National Disaster Resilience Competition, which is aimed at encouraging local businesses, community development organizations, nonprofits, and local and state governments to rethink how cities plan in the face of a growing number of natural disasters. In November, we convened a summit of leaders from 67 competing states, cities, counties and parishes. Now, government officials and civic leaders as well as engineers, architects and urban planners will participate in boot camp-like resilience academies to understand best practices before they submit their proposals. The first one, designed for the challenges facing the Southeast in particular, is being held this week in Atlanta, followed by other dedicated regional academies across the country in the new year. This billion-dollar investment turns the traditional idea of disaster relief on its head. For years, communities have received federal recovery funds after the fact -- when they were knocked on their heels by a disaster. Unsurprisingly, this is also a particularly expensive way of doing business. This new approach, in contrast, will ultimately save communities millions in long-term costs. The Federal Emergency Management Agency suggests that every dollar we invest in resilience before a disaster saves $4 after the fact. So, in a way, this was an idea that we couldn't afford not to do. We call the philosophy behind this competition the ""resilience dividend,"" and it pays off by improving our everyday lives in the good times, too. Take Tulsa, Oklahoma, which over the last century has often experienced flooding. Since the city began planting parks in floodplains and changing the way it designs its buildings, Tulsa's residents have been paying some of the lowest insurance rates in the country and worrying less about losing their homes and property. The quality of their lives and their sense of economic security has grown. Or consider Boulder, Colorado. After a bout of historic rainstorms there, a public-private partnership designed storm drains that double as bicycle trails, floodgates doubling as transportation routes, and recreation areas that protect water quality. And New Orleans, which was devastated by flooding from Hurricane Katrina 10 years ago next year, reimagined its economic base in rebuilding itself, encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship and creative and sustainable development. A decade after large areas were submerged, New Orleans is recognized as a hotbed for startups and one of America's most resilient cities. Rebuild by Design is succeeding not only because of the creativity of the projects, but also due to the collaboration of multidisciplinary teams of engineers, architects, planners and, importantly, local communities -- all of which partnered in unprecedented ways. Of crucial value, the teams spent considerable time on the ground in these communities, building critical trust and listening to citizens about their needs. For example, one of the winning groups in the competition proposed a 10-mile flood barrier to protect Lower Manhattan -- called the ""Big U"" -- that would not only be functional and effective, but also aesthetically appealing. Drawing on local input, the design incorporated green space, bike paths, art and community markets that create economic opportunity in underdeveloped areas, all while protecting against future flooding. Building resilience is a process with no ideology: Natural disasters in our country are destroying Republican and Democratic communities alike. But the National Disaster Resilience Competition is providing common-sense solutions that create common ground on which to work together. The time to embrace resilience is now.","JuliÃ¡n Castro and Judith Rodin: Disasters hurt Republican, Democratic communities alike .

"The similarities are plentiful. Both congressmen are Republican. Both represent central California -- their districts share a border. Both are recently elected to Congress. Both have outspoken positions on immigration reform. And that's where the similarities end. Republican v. Republican . Rep. Jeff Denham, who represents California's 10th Congressional District, is actively lobbying his Republican colleagues to get on board behind immigration legislation that includes a path to legalization. ""The entire system is broken,"" Denham said in a recent interview with CNN. ""It's a big issue for our nation. It is a big issue for California and for my home district."" But Denham's views don't cross district lines. His congressional neighbor and fellow Republican, Rep. Tom McClintock, couldn't disagree more. While his 4th District is next to Denham's, a wide gap exists between the two on this issue. ""We have a path to citizenship and it's a path that has been followed by millions of legal immigrants who have obeyed all of our laws,"" McClintock said. ""It's unfair to have 11 to 20 million illegal immigrants cut in line ahead of them."" Denham was the first Republican to come out in favor of comprehensive legislation. He signed on to the Democrats' proposal, which includes a path to legalization for the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the country. It's a controversial position within Republican circles. In his first week back in Washington after the holiday break, Denham got right to work. He met with 20 Republican members to hash out their differences on immigration. But McClintock is working on his own immigration campaign. He vowed to ""speak out at every opportunity"" in opposition to a path to legalization. John King: Obama at odds with himself on immigration . Boehner's haul . Denham and McClintock epitomize the challenge that lies before House Speaker John Boehner regarding immigration reform -- a divided party with divergent views on immigration. The establishment and moderate components of the party want to overhaul the immigration system because it's broken and because it would help a party unpopular with the fastest-growing segment of the population. Meanwhile, conservatives know what's popular with the base -- and in their district. The principles Boehner unveiled at last week's Republican retreat sought a middle ground -- a path to legalization but not citizenship, and only after those already in the country get in the back of the line and the federal government provides proof that work is continuing to secure the border. So close yet so far . About 2½ million of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country are in California. So how did two vocal Republicans, both from central California, emerge with such different positions? Their districts help tell the story. McClintock represents a predominately Republican district, which overwhelmingly voted for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. His district is 78% white and wealthy, with residents earning a median income of more than $61,000 per year. James Lai, Santa Clara University associate professor of ethnic studies, describes McClintock's district as the ""white flight""  district, meaning that wealthier, older, white residents move to the Sacramento suburbs or Lake Tahoe to retire or get away from congested urban areas. ""There aren't that many districts like that in California,"" Lai said of the profile of McClintock's district, which allows him to have a conservative, anti-immigration position. Denham's district, which is adjacent to McClintock's, is so close in proximity yet so far in ideology. Denham represents ""the nation's salad bowl,"" an agriculture mecca that supplies much of the country's produce. Forty percent of the residents are Latino and only 47% voted for Romney. McClintock and Denham ""reflect the complex topography of California, but at the same time, their positions are reflected in their constituents,"" Lai said. Re-election at stake . While McClintock coasted to victory, Denham had a tough re-election bid 2012 and could have another tough race against a Democrat in 2014, a threat that could be compounded if Republicans fail to act. Denham's constituents are very aware. Many of them are agriculture workers, and they and their families are directly impacted by any action -- or inaction -- on immigration. ""I've seen it in my own home district where families have been torn apart,"" Denham said, describing the current maze of immigration laws and enforcement. Once fearing deportation, immigrant among first lady's guests . Republican Party leaders are acutely aware, acknowledging that the party must address the issue to prevent becoming irrelevant as Latinos and Asians grow to a larger percentage of the electorate. But in a deeply divided Congress, with more than 200 safe Republicans, immigration is hardly worth upsetting the base. McClintock says his view is in line with his constituents'. ""I can tell you the sentiment in my district is very strongly for the rule of law and assuring that those who come to our country come with the intention of becoming Americans,"" he said. A difficult race for McClintock is much more likely from a primary challenger than from a Democrat. Rosemary Jenks, executive director of Numbers USA, a group that favors a reduction of immigration, said McClintock is more in line with Republican voters' views. ""I think the majority of Republicans understand that their constituents do not want this and can't afford this,"" she added. Special interest support . Jenks said Republican leaders are being pushed by business groups who want institutionalized cheap labor. The California Chamber of Commerce has been active, pushing Republicans to get on board with immigration reform. Like the national Chamber of Commerce, the California outpost has sent letters to the California delegation, held news conferences and lobbied Congress. ""This is so important to California's economy. This is more important here than anywhere else,"" CalChamber President and CEO Allan Zaremberg said in July. ""(California's representatives) can't let somebody else, who doesn't have a stake in this, determine the outcome."" But giving McClintock cover, however, is the local chapter of the Chamber.  Michael Ayala, CEO of the Tuolomne County Chamber, located in California's 4th District, says immigration isn't a priority for county residents. ""If the federal government would enforce existing law, we wouldn't have the problems we currently have,"" Ayala said, a position that McClintock echoes. Work in Washington . While Denham might be a minority in his caucus, that minority might have the momentum. States take the lead in immigration game . House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has been advocating his KIDS Act proposal to address the status of children of parents who came to the country illegally. And Boehner unveiled Republican principles last week, an indication that he is testing the waters on possibly moving an immigration bill this year. Denham called discussions at the Republican retreat productive and said he's pleased that Boehner floated a starting point. He's trying to convince McClintock and like-minded Republicans that the United States has ""de facto amnesty"" and that the Republican Party should ""fix the system."" McClintock doesn't seem likely to buy it. ""The Republican Party has always stood for the rule of law and it has welcomed legal immigrants to the country with the desire to come and be Americans and I believe we should continue to do so,"" he said. The tale of two Republicans will have an ending. It's just unclear what it will be.","Two neighboring California Republicans represent the GOP's challenge on immigration .

"(CNN) -- South Korea's final report on the March sinking of the warship Cheonan reaffirms that a North Korean torpedo sent the ship to the bottom of the Yellow Sea, killing 46 sailors. The full report, released Monday and based on an investigation conducted by South Korean, U.S., Swedish, British and Australian officials, offers new details to back up May's preliminary report on the incident. ""The ROK Navy ship Cheonan was sunk by a North Korean torpedo attack while conducting a normal mission in the vicinity of Baengnyeong Island at 09:22 p.m. on March 26, 2010,"" the English-version of the report says in its conclusion, according to a Korea Times report. The report says the torpedo did not strike the ship, but the shock wave generated when it exploded nearby split the Cheonan in two. Why are the two Koreas so hostile? ""The detonation location was 3 meters to the port from the center of the gas turbine room and at a depth of 6 to 9 meters. The weapon system used was a CHT-02D torpedo with approximately 250 kilograms of explosives manufactured by North Korea."" South Korea's Yonhap news agency quotes the report as saying. The shock-wave effect is substantiated by survivors' accounts, according to the Yonhap report. ""Forty-one survivors said that they smelled oil, but there were no witnesses of flames, fire or a water column, nor were there any injuries from these factors,"" Yonhap quotes the full report as saying. Critics say the final report still leaves questions. For instance, while investigators found traces of explosives on the hull of the Cheonan, no trace of explosives was found on torpedo parts recovered from the scene. Investigators said that could be because the torpedo parts were too small to hold trace explosives, according to a Korea Herald report. The final report also includes communication between the captain of the Cheonan, Cmdr. Choi Won-il, and his boss, squadron commander Capt. Lee Won-bo, according to Yonhap. ""I think we've been hit by something,"" Choi told Lee. ""What do you think it is?"" Lee asked. ""I think it's a torpedo,"" Choi said. North Korea has denied any involvement in the sinking of the Cheonan, calling the results of the preliminary report ""sheer fabrication,"" according to its official Korea Central News Agency. KCNA had not yet posted any reaction to the full report. U.S. forces during the summer conducted anti-submarine exercises with South Korea. Further exercises are planned, U.S. officials say.","The full report retains the conclusion found in the preliminary report .
The torpedo did not strike the ship, but its shock wave split the Cheonan in two, it says .

"(CNN)He's been dubbed the ""Secretary of Defense,"" but don't expect Tim Howard to be repelling Major League Soccer forwards any time soon. The 35-year-old says he intends to end his club career at Everton, the club he first joined on loan in 2006. Howard has been a mainstay in goal for the English Premier League team and if not for a back injury two years ago, likely would have matched -- and exceeded -- Neville Southall's Everton record of consecutive league appearances. He signed a contract extension until 2018 with the club last April. ""It's the club that I love,"" the ex MetroStars standout told CNN. ""It's been a brilliant relationship with myself and the chairman and both managers -- and with the fans. ""It's a place where I can achieve the things I want to achieve and push myself every day and I am still hungry for the game. ""All of the questions I have been looking for in my career have been answered here. So I think I would like to finish here and then be done. ""I'm living the good life here at Everton and I don't think I really need to change the scenery."" But that doesn't mean Howard plans on missing out on the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Howard is taking a break from the national team this season to spend more time with his two U.S.-based children though is hoping to return to Jurgen Klinsmann's side and reclaim the starting position from Aston Villa's Brad Guzan. Howard sparkled for the U.S. at the most recent World Cup in Brazil last year, especially against Belgium in the round of 16 when he made a tournament record 15 saves. He was even congratulated by U.S. President Barack Obama and earned the nickname, ""Secretary of Defense."" ""I was physically strong and mentally I felt motivated to continue and so to be quite honest -- I miss it,"" he said of his international sabbatical. ""I don't know how it's going to end but my plan is to certainly be part of a U.S. team that qualifies for Russia and to be in Russia and be part of that team. ""How it works with selection and my standing within the team, it's hard to say this far out. But my passion, my drive is to be there, then fly home and finish -- go to the beach."" A calf injury ruled Howard out of the Everton lineup for nearly two months before he returned last week in a 1-0 loss at Chelsea. He insisted that talk of relegation -- Everton stands 12th, five points above the drop zone -- was ""nonsense."" Everton, some would say, overachieved under Roberto Martinez last season in finishing fifth. Talking of managers, Howard hasn't forgotten the man who signed him, David Moyes. The Scot didn't last a season when he replaced Manchester United legend Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford but is now having success in Spain with Real Sociedad. ""When Alex Ferguson left I think there was a lot of people probably in the media (licking their) chops, excited for and looking for the slaughter that was about to come -- that was impending because unless the next manager came in and was absolutely perfect that was what was going to happen,"" said Howard, who moved to Everton from United. ""David Moyes is one hell of a tough character. If anyone can withstand that and brush it off and move on it's him. ""He has the ability to motivate men like nothing I have ever seen. I have spoken with him since he's been in Spain. He's an incredible human being. The way he treats his players is fantastic.""","Tim Howard intends on ending his club career at Everton .

"Washington (CNN) -- The announcement by the U.S. Census Bureau that the population stood at 308,745,538 on April 1 is a number for which many people have been waiting. Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Idaho had the fastest growth this decade while slow growth was seen in Rhode Island, Louisiana, Ohio and New York. Michigan was the only state to see a decline. Most people poring over the 2010 state counts are doing so with an eye to future elections, but it makes sense to proceed cautiously before drawing any hard conclusions about what that data mean in the political context. Attention is focused on 12 seats in the House of Representatives that will be leaving slow-growth states in the Northeast and Midwest and moving to the South and Southwest as populations there continued to grow quickly. Census 2010: America grew at slowest rate since the Depression . Texas is the big winner, with four new House seats. Since the states losing seats are usually regarded as blue, tending to elect Democrats, and those gaining seats are normally considered red, tending to elect Republicans, it would be easy to assume Tuesday's census release is good news for that party and alarming news for Democrats. It's not that simple. If we regard simple population change as an indicator of political power, the buildup in red states is indeed significant. However, early next year, the Census Bureau will release counts of the population by race and ethnicity. That number will show shifts of the population that official estimates have pointed to all along: The diversifying of the population is more extensive in areas of fast population growth. Many of the states that have gained in their head count have gained non-white minorities, especially Hispanics. Estimates already show that four states that gained seats -- Texas, Florida, Arizona and Georgia -- are highly ranked in the Top 10 states for growth in the Hispanic population during this decade. Moreover, more than half the population growth in those states alone came from increases in the Latino population. These additions were a result of net immigration and births in those states. While the large increase in Hispanics in these high-growth states includes some immigrant newcomers ineligible to vote, eligible Latinos tend to vote Democratic in most of the states that gained seats. That may change by 2012, but much will happen between now and then. Putting this into further perspective, the U.S. population grew by 9.7% between 2000 and 2010, slower than any decade since the Great Depression in the 1930s. With the Great Recession taking hold at the end of the 2000s, slowing immigration and birth rates, it is possible that slower growth will continue, at least for the short term. Thus, the sizeable increase in minority populations comes at a time when the overall population is growing more slowly. Thus the sweeping demographic changes going on in our nation are much more significant than just shifts in where people live. We are becoming more diverse, and, as many analysts have noted, we will be a white-minority nation in about 30 years. So simply looking at geography may not yield correct results when we're talking about how new populations may behave and particularly how they may vote. The excitement that demographers feel about this once-a-decade population snapshot is likely overwhelmed by the enthusiasm of political analysts, who are busy discovering what state-level population shifts mean for state reapportionment and redistricting within states. But as we can see by looking more carefully at the data, there is more to population shifts than a simple rearranging of the map based on total counts. We're in for a much more interesting and challenging  time than many people may believe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Audrey Singer.","Census puts U.S. population at 308.7 million, with red states generally posting fastest growth .

"(CNN) -- Just out of high school, my young developing mind couldn't resist the temptation of the Marine recruiters: They promised challenge and hardship, in comparison to the other armed services, which promised money and travel as their main recruiting incentives. So, on September 24, 2003 -- my 18th birthday -- I enlisted in the Marine Corps while my parents were away on vacation, a trip they promptly returned from upon hearing the news. My time in the Marine Corps offered an escape from the isolated Midwest upbringing that I'd experienced. Once my training was completed, I found myself stationed in Okinawa, Japan's sacrificial prefecture to the American Empire. My initial two-year tour of duty in Okinawa was regularly marked with frequent physical and mental abuse at the hands of noncommissioned officers within my unit, several of whom exhibited signs of post-traumatic stress. On a regular basis I found myself the target of homophobic and racist comments from those entrusted with my well-being and training, often times in front of those I was in charge of leading. My time on Okinawa came to an end when I received orders to Iraq. I happily reported to my new unit, hoping deployment would offer a welcome escape from the physical and verbal harassment, degradation and humiliation that had become daily life. The harassment I'd experienced in my previous unit gave way to trust and camaraderie, though this, too, would soon fade. The enemy within . Weeks before leaving Okinawa for the sands of Iraq, I found myself pinned down, fighting off a sexual assault by a fellow Marine: a noncommissioned officer I was about to deploy with, who I was supposed to trust my life to. I still remember the laughter as I fought back. This would occur twice, both times by the same Marine. The feelings of helplessness, powerlessness, guilt and shame would grow over the years. I felt weak, unable to protect myself. Like thousands of sexual assault survivors in the military, fear of victim blaming and feelings of shame and guilt prevented me from reporting what happened. After my first deployment I was experiencing emotional detachment. The world felt mundane. I was emotionally numb. Empathy escaped my being. I felt myself not participating in the world around me, observing from a distance. I found no place in the society I had returned to. I became violent at the slightest cue, and began drinking heavily. Depression and anxiety swept through me. Though I can now articulate the emotional context of my experience, at the time every emotion, fear, hurt, shame, guilt, was externalized through anger, rage and violence. I was blinded to the reality of what I was experiencing. My anger was simply the intensity that a Marine required. Emotional detachment and numbness cultivated the objectivity needed to evaluate and execute the mission. My drinking seamlessly blended with the would-be frat-house Marine barracks culture. I reported symptoms of PTSD to my command via a pencil and paper questionnaire known as a Post Deployment Health Assessment, at the discouragement and warning of a Corpsman, yet no offer of treatment was extended. My subsequent deployments would only serve to compound the trauma I had experienced, as I was on guard not only for the so-called enemy, but like so many of my sisters-in-arms, for my fellow Marines as well. After completing my second deployment to Iraq, I separated from the Marines to attend Auburn University. I believed at the time I was leaving an old life behind me to begin a new life as a college freshman, but I soon discovered that stepping back out into the world would not be the seamless transition I had come to envision. My struggles in the Marines had come to a close. Little did I know that my battle with Veterans Affairs was on the horizon. From suicidal thoughts to long waits and lots of pills . As self-isolation became my preferred method of treating my anxiety, my relationships with my parents and my partner deteriorated. I felt distanced from those around me and those I cared about, which fed my anger. My anger fed into guilt, then isolation and then anger. This became my every day. After nearly three years, my anger and depression drove my partner to leave. Losing the only relationship I'd managed to maintain deepened my depression. Life felt superficial. I began imagining how I would take my life. The Uncounted: War's impact on military families . With the barrel to my temple and my finger on the trigger, I began to wonder what the moments between the gun firing and my death would be like. In my questioning I realized that what I wanted was not to die, but to reclaim agency of my life and live it instead of simply survive through it. While I had no desire to harm myself, more than anything, I desired relief. On the verge of suicide and struggling to stay in school, I began to seek treatment at the VA Clinic. This task was, in the truest sense, easier said than done. Wait times for appointments ranged from three to six months. Spending an hour on hold was the norm, and being hung up on was common practice. My first appointment requesting mental health treatment was December 2011. My first appointment with a therapist was October 2012, a 10-month gap. In those 10 months, according to the VA estimates, more than 6,000 veterans took their own lives. Long before I would ever see a therapist, the VA would cycle me through half a dozen medicines in less than three months, though this was far less than the buffet of lithium and opiates many other veterans are prescribed. Upon graduation, I relocated to Denver and immediately enrolled in the local VA system, looking to continue the treatment I had fought so hard to receive before. After my initial intake, every mental health appointment I scheduled would be involuntarily canceled and pushed to a later date, only to have them, too, be canceled. During this time, news broke that delays in care had been a problem at VA clinics nationwide. I eventually gave up on the VA and began managing symptoms of my PTSD using medicinal cannabis and Vipassana meditation. It was clear to me that the VA was there to placate, not to heal veterans. Gingrich: We owe vets real change . Amazonian discovery . It was my search for true healing that led me to Peru. I traveled there as part of a study conducted by Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. I had been following the association's MDMA PTSD treatment research for years, and regularly advocated for MAPS in my daily discussions with fellow veterans. In Peru, I met other veterans who had also become disillusioned with the cold, sterile, institutionalized treatment they had received when they returned home from combat. When we arrived at the Phoenix Ayahuasca Center in Iquitos, Peru, I was unsure what to expect. I had read about ayahuasca, and listened to firsthand accounts from other veterans of its healing effects, but never imagined I myself would have the opportunity to experience it firsthand. I participated in three ayahuasca ceremonies, all conducted alongside other veterans. Each ceremony lasted approximately four hours. Before each ceremony we would come together and discuss our intention or focus would be for the ceremony that evening. We sat by candlelight, as one by one we drank our cup of medicine, then in darkness as we waited for the medicine to come up through us. Ayahuasca allowed me to examine myself from a new perspective, progressively deeper with each ceremony. I was able to recall trauma and remember parts of my experiences that had previously been blocked out. I was able to process not only experiences from the military, but also from throughout my entire life and see how they synthesized into the person I had become. I felt a love and acceptance like never before. Negativity and pain lifted from my shoulders and released from my body in what felt like what I can only describe as a psychedelic baptism. Since returning home to Colorado, I've become an even more vocal advocate for psychedelic treatment. With the advent of the legalization of medicinal and recreational cannabis, I believe it is important that we continue on in the fight against the drug war. Psychedelics including MDMA, LSD and psilocybin should be rescheduled to allow research into their medicinal benefits and let the facts speak for themselves. America's veterans are returning from over a decade of perpetual war, only to find themselves on the front lines, this time battling the government that sent them to fight, for their right to heal. Enlightenment is on the horizon, and as with all America's battles, its veterans will lead the way.","Richard Stroder joined the Marines at age 18 .

"Athens, Greece (CNN)  -- A bomb exploded outside Greece's parliament building in central Athens on Saturday evening, a blast near a national landmark that unnerved the country. There were no casualties in the blast, and Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou told reporters that Greeks would not be intimidated by such acts. ""My message is simple: democracy cannot be terrorized,"" he said when he arrived at his parliament office. Police were alerted immediately after the Eleftherotypia newspaper received a call saying a bomb was placed in an open area outside of parliament. Authorities closed off part of the boulevards in front of parliament and on the eastern side of the building before an explosive device detonated inside an installation for garbage disposal. Later, a caller phoned a police emergency line and said one bomb was placed outside of parliament and another inside the Hotel Grande Bretagne near parliament. The hotel entrance faces one of the closed boulevards. Melios Dimitris, Hotel Grande Bretagne manager, told CNN he had not heard of an immediate threat to the hotel and that the business is operating as usual. Law enforcement officers were carefully combing the area, local media reported, but police don't think those threats are credible.

"Honolulu (CNN)His weeks-long stay in Hawaii largely uninterrupted by major news, President Barack Obama flies back to a redrawn Washington late Saturday prepared for a renewed economic push he hopes will set up a productive final presidential quarter. He faces an uphill battle: Newly powerful Republicans take control of both chambers of Congress next week, and the nation's political attention will quickly turn to the next presidential contest as candidates declare their intentions in the next few months. Expecting to receive GOP-passed measures gutting his health care law, approving the Keystone XL pipeline, and undoing his executive actions, Obama has said he's ready to wield veto power that's largely been unused during his presidency. But his aides say Obama is hoping to avoid a year of reaction focused solely on rebutting the GOP. Instead, the White House says, he'll look to present an affirmative agenda that builds upon the nation's economic gains. On areas like tax reform and trade, Obama has said he's open to working with Republicans, who made major gains in November's elections and now control the Senate. But administration officials say they're not under any illusions that Republicans in the next Congress will be more willing to work with Obama than those in the last. That means the go-it-alone strategy of last year, which relied on unilateral action to exact change, hasn't been completely retired, officials say. In a bid to jump start the year's governing — and exploit momentum following the raft of late-2014 executive actions — Obama next week will start a three-week preview period for his late-January State of the Union address. Obama's chief speechwriter, Cody Keenan, was kept busy drafting the annual speech while along with Obama for his Hawaii vacation. The President will make targeted stops in Detroit, Phoenix and Tennessee next week to promote, respectively, advances in the American auto industry, housing gains, and his education platform. The White House said during Obama's tour he would promote both executive actions and proposals for legislation. ""The President is eager to get to work, and looks forward to working with the new Congress on policies that will make sure middle class Americans are sharing in the economic recovery,"" said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. ""There are a number of issues we could make progress on, but the President is clear that he will not let this Congress undo important protections gained - particularly in areas of health care, Wall Street reform and the environment,"" Schultz said. Obama has only vetoed two measures in his six years in office, though White House officials expect that to change quickly as Republicans assume power on Capitol Hill. One of the first measures lawmakers will debate is a bill approving the controversial Keystone pipeline, which environmentalists oppose. The White House has suggested it would reject any measure from Congress approving the pipeline, since the review process in place at the State Department is still underway. Areas of compromise exist: both Republicans and Obama say they're interested in overhauling the corporate tax structure and pushing through major trade deals with Europe and Asia. But those projects face opposition from Democrats, who worry they could favor large companies over working class Americans. ""We certainly hope they work with Congress instead of continuing to campaign against it,"" said Don Stewart, a spokesman for the incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""But remember, the biggest hangup on things like trade has been the President's own party. They oppose entitlement reform, trade, revenue neutral tax reform."" Stewart said that could mean Obama is forced to spend negotiating time with both Republicans and Democrats — ""something he's been reluctant to do.""","President Barack Obama arrives back in Washington with the Hill under Republican control .

"Islamabad, Pakistan -- A Pakistani government minister who had said he was getting death threats because of his opposition to a controversial blasphemy law was shot to death Wednesday. Shahbaz Bhatti was the only Christian member of the Cabinet in Pakistan, where 95 percent of people are Muslim. He served as the government's minister of minority affairs. He was shot and killed in Islamabad on Wednesday morning, Pakistani police said. The Taliban claimed responsibility. ""(The) assassination of Bhatti is a message to all of those who are against Pakistan's blasphemy laws,"" said Ihsanullah Ihsan, a Taliban spokesman. Bhatti had been critical of the law, saying at one point, ""I am ready to sacrifice my life for the principled stand I have taken because the people of Pakistan are being victimized under the pretense of blasphemy law."" Other officials have also been targeted for opposing the blasphemy law, which makes it a crime punishable by death to insult Islam, the Quran or the Prophet Mohammed. In January, the governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was assassinated by his security guard because he spoke out against the law. After Taseer's death, Bhatti pledged to continue pushing for amendments in the law. ""I will campaign for this ... these fanatics cannot stop me from moving any further steps against the misuse of (the) blasphemy law,"" he said at the time. Bhatti said he was facing threats on his life, but was not afraid. ""I was told by the religious extremists that if you will make any amendments in this law, you will be killed,"" he said. Bhatti was leaving his home Wednesday when gunmen sprayed his vehicle with bullets, said Jameel Hashmi, a senior Islamabad police official. He was dead when he arrived at Shifa Hospital in Islamabad, said Azmat Ullah Qureshi, a hospital spokesman. The minister is usually accompanied by security guards because of the death threats, but had instructed his security officers not to travel with him Wednesday, said Wajid Durrani, Islamabad's police chief. Cameron Munter, the U.S. ambassador in Pakistan, condemned the killing in a statement. ""His death is a loss for all who believe in the values for which he gave his last full measure of devotion,"" he said. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom also condemned the killing. ""The assassination today of Shahbaz Bhatti in Pakistan -- a true hero for human rights and religious freedom for all -- illustrates how barbaric that country's system of blasphemy laws really is. Blasphemy laws don't keep the peace, but embolden extremists,"" said Leonard Leo, the commission's chair.","U.S. envoy condemns the killing .

"The insurance industry is launching a seven-figure advertising, grassroots and lobbying campaign to persuade Washington officials not to cut Medicare Advantage funding next year. A key piece of that campaign is a new television ad, obtained first by CNN. The ad, which will begin airing Thursday, comes as policy makers begin to set payment rates for next year. The preliminary rates for Medicare Advantage program, which covers seniors through private insurance, will be announced next month, and final rates will be set in April. The ad campaign is part of a lobbying and media blitz by the insurance industry to avoid cuts to their Medicare Advantage payments. The Affordable Care Act cut the Medicare Advantage program by $200 billion. The law and other policy changes cut the program by 6.5% this year. Insurance officials say the cuts are already forcing insurers to cut their doctor networks, and they warn that further cuts will increase cost and limit access to seniors . ""If the Medicare Advantage plan is cut once again, seniors are going to find out in October that their costs are going up, their benefits are being reduced and they have fewer choices of providers and fewer coverage options,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for the insurance industry trade group America's Health Insurance Plans. In the TV ad, seniors tell Washington that they depend on their Medicare Advantage coverage and will spread the word. ""No more cuts to Medicare Advantage,"" Evelyn Harrell said. Added Mary Kay Boerner, ""You know, we vote."" Insurers believe that timing will help their cause. Most seniors will find out about the new rates during open enrollment in October -- only weeks before congressional elections. And insurers are betting that lawmakers won't want to be explaining to 14 million seniors why their health care costs more or their benefits have decreased.","Insurers aim to prevent Medicare Advantage cuts with TV, lobbying campaign .

"The Supreme Court on Tuesday will confront its biggest case of the term so far, another high-profile challenge to affirmative action in college admissions. The planned hour of oral arguments raises anew thorny, unresolved questions over race and remedies. The justices are being asked to decide the constitutionality of a voter referendum in Michigan banning race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public university admission decisions. The high court just 16 weeks ago affirmed the use of race at the University of Texas, but made it harder for institutions to justify such policies to achieve diversity. In that dispute, a white student said the college's existing affirmative action policy violated her ""equal protection"" rights, while civil rights supporters of such programs claim Michigan's ban also has the same effect. A federal appeals court last year concluded the affirmative action ban, which Michigan voters passed in a 2006 referendum, violated the U.S. Constitution's equal protection guarantees. It was the latest step in a legal and political battle over whether state colleges can use race and gender as a factor in choosing which students to admit. ""The question before the Supreme Court is whether you can have a constitutional amendment enacted by the people of a state that prevents the legislature from adopting affirmative action,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com and a prominent Washington attorney. ""Is that a form of discrimination against minorities, or is it actually an implementation of a colorblind Constitution that itself ends discrimination?"" The law was passed seven years ago with support of 58 percent of voters. It was added to the state's constitution, and bars publicly funded colleges from granting ""preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin."" That prompted a series of lawsuits and appeals from a coalition of civil rights groups and University of Michigan faculty and students, who counter the law actually burdens state residents, denying them the opportunity to persuade state and college officials to apply affirmative action. ""Proposition 2 unconstitutionally gerrymanders Michigan's political process,"" said Sherrilyn Ifill, president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, ""and relegates the critical topics of racial diversity and access to educational opportunity to a separate, distant, and far more cumbersome playing field-- one that is unplayable for all practical purposes."" Many of the prestigious institution's faculty and student body say classroom diversity remains a necessary government role. Michigan voters approved the ban after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that while state universities could use race as a factor in choosing which students to admit, they could not make race the determining factor in deciding whether applicants are accepted. The current ban ""embodies the fundamental premise of what America is all about: equal opportunity under the law,"" said Bill Schuette, Michigan's attorney general. ""Entrance to our great universities must be based upon merit."" The referendum effort was led by Jennifer Gratz, who was at the center of the decade-old high court case. As a white student, she was put on the waiting list for undergraduate admission to the state's largest university. She eventually attended another school, and became the lead plaintiff in a subsequent discrimination lawsuit. After the Supreme Court's 2003 decision, she began a public campaign to end racial preferences in admissions. ""This will be an important day in the fight for true equality,"" said Gratz, who is now CEO of the XIV Foundation, which advocates for ""equal treatment."" ""How the court rules in this case will have national importance, determining whether or not citizens have the right to choose equality over discrimination."" The Michigan ban also prohibits the state from considering race and gender in public hiring and public contracting decisions. But the current high court case deals only with the college admissions portion. Efforts over decades to create a diverse classroom have been controversial. The Brown v. Board of Education high court ruling in 1954 ended segregation of public schools, but sparked nationwide protests and disobedience by states that initially refused to integrate. In the 1978 Bakke case, the justices ruled universities have a compelling state interest in promoting diversity, and that allows for the use of affirmative action. That issue involved a discrimination claim by a white man denied admission to law school. The referendum issue has been around at least since 1996, when California voters endorsed Proposition 209, which bans use of race, sex, or ethnic background by state agencies in areas of education, and government hiring and contracts. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1997 refused to consider lawsuits challenging the law, also known as the California Civil Rights Initiative. But the high court under Chief Justice John Roberts has made the issue a key part of its docket in recent years, and it could serve as a major legacy of the current conservative majority. A ruling in the Michigan appeal however may be limited in scope. ""The Michigan case isn't an opportunity for the conservatives on the court, for example, to say that affirmative action's unconstitutional,"" said Goldstein. ""But the justices can send signals to state legislatures, and to the public more generally, that either affirmation action is something they think should be encouraged, or something for which they're very suspicious."" Two years into Roberts' tenure, the conservative majority in 2007 struck down public school choice plans in Seattle and Louisville, concluding race could not be a factor in the assignment of children to schools. Those school districts had sought to use raced-based criteria to achieve diversity. The debate in recent years is whether and when affirmative action programs -- while constitutionally permissible now -- would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met. Now-retired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor -- who wrote the key ruling a decade ago in the initial Michigan cases -- said, ""The court expects that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today."" The justices are now being asked once again to decide whether Michigan's current policy in this case meets that legal and social test. Justice Elena Kagan will not hear this petition, leaving the possibility of a 4-4 high court tie and no important precedent being established. The case is Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality by Any Means Necessary (12-682). A written ruling could come as late as June.","Court will hear oral arguments on Tuesday in Michigan case .

"Saudi Arabia may block access to popular Internet messaging applications like Skype, Viber and WhatsApp if telecommunication providers there don't comply with rules and regulatory conditions, according to the country's official news agency, SPA. A statement from Saudi Arabia's Communications and Information Technology Commission released via SPA read, ""The Commission emphasizes that it will take appropriate action regarding these applications and services in the event of failure to meet those conditions."" The statement did not address how the applications in question -- which allow Internet users to communicate with each other via text messages and voice calls -- were violating any rules, but it did highlight the need for service providers in the country to quickly ""work with the developers of these applications to meet regulatory requirements."" Sunday's announcement came in response to local media reports last week claiming the CITC, the country's telecommunications regulator, had asked Saudi telecom companies to allow the government to monitor those applications and had given them until Saturday to respond. Despite repeated attempts, CNN was unable to reach the CITC or any of Saudi Arabia's three mobile providers (Saudi Telecom Co., Zain Group and Mobily) for comment. Sunday's move was met with derision by many Saudi social media users. ""The sense that I get is weariness,"" said Eman Al-Nafjan, one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent bloggers, while describing the online reaction she's encountered so far. ""A shrugging shoulders -- as if it's typical."" ""I'm not angry, just a little surprised that the Saudi government hasn't advanced beyond this type of tactic,"" added Al-Nafjan, who tweets as Saudiwoman. ""I thought that they were better able to do this without resorting to have to threaten banning applications."" Still, Al-Nafjan told CNN she's not surprised by the timing of the announcement. ""I believe a big part of the reason why this is happening ... is because lots of demonstrations that were organized in Saudi Arabia were done through the use of WhatsApp,"" explained Al-Nafjan, citing recent small-scale demonstrations calling for the release of political prisoners. In Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy, protests are prohibited. Sixty percent of the country's population is under the age of 30 and Internet usage there is soaring. ""A lot of human rights activists that communicate in Saudi Arabia do so using WhatsApp,"" added Al-Nafjan. ""And women's rights movement members are communicating using WhatsApp."" Al-Nafjan said Saudi activists felt safer communicating using applications like WhatsApp and Skype, as they are encrypted. According to Christopher Davidson, author of the book ""After the Sheikhs: The Coming Collapse of the Gulf Monarchies,"" the Saudi government has grown increasingly concerned about the rising tide of dissent being expressed by Saudi online activists of late. Davidson explained Saudi authorities would be looking for a way to monitor these applications because they are ""prime examples of modernizing technologies which cannot be co-opted and controlled by national governments and their security apparatus."" ""In the past we've had these voice-to-voice networks being blocked,"" said Davidson. ""Sometimes for economic reasons, trying to protect state telecommunications monopolies. And that's certainly been an issue in the past -- the blocking of Skype in some of the Gulf monarchies. But now I think it's quite clear ... that it's the social and political use of this media that's most alarming."" For Al-Nafjan, the move is a ""waste of time."" ""People will know it's not safe and move to another application,"" said Al-Nafjan. ""The same thing happened with BlackBerry."" Saudi authorities threatened to ban BlackBerry service in the kingdom in 2010, accusing the company of not complying with regulations. The CITC demanded the company install local servers so the service could be censored. An agreement was eventually reached but it is not known what steps were taken by the manufacturer of the Canadian smartphone in order to do so. ""People who are aware know that it's not that big of a deal even if these applications are blocked,"" explained Al-Nafjan. ""The issue is if they ban the Internet or if they don't provide Internet sevices. As long as the Internet is available, there's no way that they can end freedom of speech -- it's gone beyond the point of no return.""","Saudi communications regulation agency threatens to block apps like Skype, WhatsApp .

"Elephants are being killed in Africa at an alarming rate by increasingly efficient and well-armed poachers as international demand soars for the ivory from their tusks, wildlife conservation groups say. The slaughter, described by some activists as unprecedented, is enabled by ineffective law enforcement, official corruption, porous borders and a rapidly expanding population seeking sustenance, the groups say. And it is being driven by a growing appetite for ivory products in increasingly affluent Asian countries, particularly China and Thailand. ""China has taken over Japan as the world's largest ivory consumer. And from 2006 to last year, the ivory price in China has tripled. So that's why some Chinese buy ivory products in Africa with dollars and smuggle them back to China to sell for a better price,"" said Grace Gabriel, Asia regional director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. But Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said his government has taken a firm stance on ivory trafficking. ""We have enacted corresponding laws and regulations, and made significant efforts in enforcing them,"" he said. ""We have made positive contributions to tackling ivory trafficking activities worldwide. We will keep this momentum going in our future work."" African elephant slaughter highest in more than two decades . Gabriel said the Chinese government has done a ""great job"" in banning online trade of ivory products, ordering online shopping sites to remove such items and closing ivory trade websites. But she said that while 136 Chinese retailers are authorized to sell ivory products, many more illegal stores have set up shop, according to International Fund for Animal Welfare investigations. The numbers available are stark: The poaching of elephants is the most intense it has been in a decade, and the number of documented ivory seizures has reached its highest level since 1989, a group of agencies that monitor elephant populations and the ivory trade said in June. The elephant population in central Africa, where the worst of the killing is believed to be taking place, has dropped significantly over the past 10 years, according to estimates cited by Bas Huijbregts, head of field programs for the conservation organization WWF in the Congo Basin region. The level of butchery is a throwback to the 1980s, when an estimated 100,000 elephants were being killed every year, according to WWF. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in 1989 outlawed the international ivory trade and sharply reduced illegal killing in some countries. The chief reason for the deteriorating situation today is the rising demand in Asia and the weak law enforcement against poachers and illegal ivory traders in central African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic, Huijbregts said. Little is being done to prosecute the people in those countries who run the ivory trade, he said, largely because they are often local government officials who use their authority to sidestep inspections and intimidate law enforcement agents. Cathay Pacific bans shipping of shark products . ""They don't hunt themselves, but they use their government status, and indeed their government vehicles, to organize the crime behind the scenes,"" said Huijbregts, who has spent 16 years working in the region. Wildlife wardens in rural areas can have little incentive to risk their publicly funded jobs by pursuing and prosecuting powerful local officials, he said. The money to be made from killing elephants for a living is also tempting for many people in the region, where population growth is rapid and poverty rates are high. ""With the price of ivory skyrocketing over the past few years, it becomes a very lucrative business for local people,"" Huijbregts said. The wildlife wardens are often outgunned by the poachers, whose growing use of automatic firearms and other weapons has been documented by conservation groups. They are also now confronting not just local poachers, but also seasoned fighters from war-torn areas of the continent like Sudan, conservationists say. Once the ivory has been harvested from the slaughtered elephants, it is transported across thinly and badly policed borders to ports in countries like Kenya and Nigeria. From the trading hubs, it is shipped abroad, mainly to Asia. ""Most illegal shipments of African elephant ivory end up in either China or Thailand,"" according to TRAFFIC, an organization that monitors the wildlife trade. The biggest demand is from China, Huijbregts said, where ivory household items, like chopsticks, are increasingly sought after by tens of millions of people newly enriched by the country's past decade of meteoric economic growth. Ivory is also purchased as a collector's item or for investment, Gabriel said. Thailand is also a good market for the criminal gangs that traffic the ivory because it is a popular tourist destination with weak laws governing the sale of ivory products and lax policing, according to Huijbregts. Despite the bleak situation, efforts are under way to clamp down on the illegal trade, as the increase in elephant killing damages governments' credibility and, in the case of incursions by foreign poachers, presents possible security threats. Some African countries are starting to share information about poaching between them, Huijbregts said. And Interpol has joined efforts to investigate those involved in the trade of ivory and other illicit wildlife products. The U.S. government has also been ""extremely active in the Congo Basin region in putting pressure on governments to take this issue seriously,"" according to Huijbregts. ""There is light as well as darkness,"" he said. Will elephants still roam earth in 20 years?","China says it has enacted laws and regulations on ivory trafficking .

"Editor's note: This is part of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming, six-hour television event, ""God's Warriors,"" hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Sondra Oster Baras: ""Israel has many enemies. We have to take advantage of every single one of our friends."" MELBOURNE, Florida (CNN) -- Sondra Oster Baras is an Orthodox Jew doing an unorthodox job. ""If you had asked me 10 years ago what I would be doing with my life, I don't think I would have told you I'd be in church,"" she said. Baras stumps for money from evangelical Christians to support Jewish settlements in the occupied territories -- land she calls biblical Israel. A recent stop finds her in Melbourne, Florida, visiting Pastor Gary Christofaro at his First Assembly Church of God. Christofaro and his flock take their Jewish roots so seriously that on Friday nights they observe the Jewish Sabbath with Hebrew prayers. This is not just religious ritual. They support Israel -- which to them includes Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank. Church members tour settlements with Baras and have donated more than a $100,000 to support them. ""If it wasn't for what the Jews brought to Christianity, there would be no Christianity,"" Christofaro said. ""There is a promise to those who bless Israel to be blessed. Those who curse it will be cursed."" Christofaro and Baras are part of a growing alliance between evangelical Christians and Israelis.  Watch the bond between observant Jews and evangelical Christians » . A recent poll found that 59 percent of American evangelicals believe Israel is the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs estimates 85 million evangelicals believe God tells them to support Israel -- more than six times the world's Jewish population. One of the most successful Jewish fundraisers, Rabbi Yechiel Eckstein, raised $39 million last year from Christian Zionists to fund human services and humanitarian work in Israel and the settlements. Christian Zionists often converge on Washington by the thousands to lobby members of Congress in support of Israel. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, I-Connecticut, was among the speakers at last month's convention of Christians United for Israel. ""There are a lot more Christian Zionists in America than Jewish Zionists,"" the former Democratic vice presidential candidate told the group. ""The support of Christian Zionists today is critical to Israel's security and strength and to America's security and strength."" Watch behind-the-scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour for the making of the TV special ""God's Warriors"" Back in church, Baras told the congregation: ""We need to stand together so that our governments will believe that the land of Israel, the entire land of Israel, belongs to the Jewish people."" Baras said God called her to this work. She left her high-powered, high-paid job as a Wall Street lawyer and moved to Israel in 1984. ""I was never fully American,"" she explained. ""I was Jewish."" Judaism was not only her religion but also her nationality. ""We learned how to read Hebrew before we learned how to read English,"" she said. Her parents, who narrowly escaped the Holocaust, sent her to Zionist summer camps that championed the Jewish homeland. ""My parents felt very safe in America ... but there was always a part of them that said there needs to be an Israel in the event that we have another Hitler. Put it all together and I couldn't help but be a Zionist."" Baras moved her family to Karnei Shomron, a settlement deep inside the West Bank. ""Just by building my house ... I was strengthening the Jewish presence here in Samaria,"" she said, referring to a biblical name for the northern part of the West Bank. In 2002, a Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up inside a pizza parlor in her neighborhood, killing three children. She said she fought back by encouraging support from evangelical Christians in America. ""If we give any part of that land to the Arabs, we are looking at terrorism,"" she told a church audience. Christofaro's Florida congregation responded with money -- all while singing a prayer for peace in perfect Hebrew. Their money builds parks, child care centers and music therapy programs -- projects that make Jewish life in the settlements more comfortable. And more permanent. ""If you don't live somewhere, if you don't take possession of it, it is not yours,"" Baras said. Some people say Jews and evangelical Christians make strange bedfellows, given historical anti-Semitism. ""Because of this doctrine of a Jew being a Christ-killer ... so much hatred and anti-Semitism has been propagated throughout the Earth,"" Christofaro said. Now such historic anti-Semitism has given way to an urgent support of Israel among some evangelicals, many of whom believe that when Jews live in all of the Holy Land -- what they call Greater Israel -- only then will Christ return and true believers be raptured up to heaven. ""It is a controversial issue here in Israel as to whether we should be partnering with the Christians in any way,"" Baras said. It's controversial in part because in the judgment day scenario embraced by some evangelicals, Jews who don't convert to Christianity burn in hell. But Baras said she isn't worried. ""I know that I'm not going to burn in hell because I didn't accept Jesus, because I don't believe Jesus is the Messiah,"" she said. ""So how could I possibly be threatened?"" Baras concedes the alliance between God's Jewish and Christian warriors may seem odd to some people. But if Baras is anything, she's practical. ""Israel has many enemies,"" she said. ""We have to take advantage of every single one of our friends."" E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Darren Manzella saw two tours of duty in Iraq, first as a combat medic and later as a liaison officer. He earned three promotions in his six years as a U.S. Army sergeant. Despite his professional success, Manzella says he began to question his personal life. ""After returning from my first deployment in Iraq, after seeing death and violence, losing friends and comrades, it really made me look over my life,"" he said. ""I looked at some issues I had always had trouble with. I had debated, 'Am I gay?' "" As he struggled with his sexual identity, Manzella began a relationship with a man. Soon after, while in Texas between tours, Manzella said he began receiving anonymous, harassing e-mails and telephone calls. ""They told me, 'You are stupid, the Army is going to kick you out, but before they do, they are going to take your rank away and all your money away.' "" Manzella describes this time as one of fear and deep insecurity. ""I didn't know if the military police would be coming through the door to take me away because someone had reported me,"" he said. ""This was some of the paranoia I was living with every day."" Manzella says that the e-mails and calls went on for months and that after many sleepless nights, he decided to ask his supervisor for help. ""He listened and was somewhat sympathetic,"" Manzella said. ""He told me not to worry, to try and get some rest, to go home early and see him in the morning."" By the next morning, Manzella's supervisor had reported him as having broken the law under ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the 1993 policy that prohibits anyone who ""demonstrate(s) a propensity or intent to engage in homosexual acts"" from serving in the U.S. military. Manzella said he was read his rights and told that he would be investigated, but that he could continue working. As the investigation proceeded, word spread that Manzella was gay. ""Ironically, it pulled the unit together. A lot of them started to invite me out,"" Manzella said. ""My co-worker was getting married; she told me that my boyfriend and I were invited to the wedding. It made me feel like I was more a part of the family."" After a month, Manzella said he was told that no proof of homosexuality had been found and that the investigation was being closed, even though he told his supervisor about his lifestyle. Manzella was hopeful. ""I thought it was a big step when they told me that they were going to retain me,"" he said. In 2006, Manzella's unit was sent back to Iraq, and he served his 15-month deployment with his unit knowing he was gay. ""I could have pictures of my boyfriend out, I could talk freely on the phone without having to worry about someone overhearing me and reporting me,"" he said. During his tour, Manzella was contacted by the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, a national nonprofit offering legal assistance to those affected by don't ask, don't tell. SLDN told him that a television network was looking for a gay serviceman in a combat zone to tell his story. After weighing the risk of being discharged for speaking out publicly, Manzella agreed to the interview. He said he was motivated by the knowledge that he could give a voice to the gays, lesbians and bisexuals serving in the military -- a number estimated at 65,000 by the Palm Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, which researches sexual minorities in the military. The network television segment aired a few days before Manzella returned from Iraq, and it seemed at first that his interview would not have consequences. He returned to the States, spent time with his family and even went to Capitol Hill to lobby against don't ask, don't tell. Manzella returned to duty at Fort Hood, Texas, in December 2007 and continued to serve for almost seven months. In the first week of March 2008, he was given orders to report to Fort Drum, New York, to work at the military hospital there. A week later, he said, his company commander called him in. ""I was told I was going to be discharged under don't ask, don't tell,"" he said. ""Up until that point, I hadn't heard anything. I had lived openly for nearly two years. I thought that was a huge step forward, that finally people were being recognized on their performance and how well they served their country and their comrades and peers."" In June 2008, Manzella received an honorable discharge. His discharge papers read ""homosexual conduct admission."" CNN contacted the Army for more details on the nature of Manzella's discharge. Army spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Garver of the Office of the Chief of Public Affairs said that under law, the military could not comment on or release details about Manzella's discharge. Since don't ask, don't tell was introduced, the military has discharged more than 13,000 lesbians, gays and bisexuals, according to the Servicemembers Legal Defense Network. A 2005 government report found that about 800 of them had skills deemed ""critical,"" such as engineering and linguistics, and that it cost the military about $200 million to recruit and train their replacements. Garver said the continued enforcement of don't ask, don't tell is simply a case of the Army enforcing the law. ""The Army enforces the homosexual conduct policy because it is the law,"" he said. ""The policy is not a military policy, and the Army has a policy because it is bound by current statute. If the law were potentially to change, the Army would change to enforce whatever the law may be.""","Iraq vet Darren Manzella was discharged under ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy .

"(CNN) -- The deadly Ebola virus which has ripped through three West African countries has had the biggest impact in Liberia. As of last week, the country has had over 7,000 cases of the disease and nearly 3,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Earlier this month, a World Bank report said that ""nearly half of the working population of Liberia is no longer working since the crisis began."" The World Bank, which conducted two rounds of mobile-phone surveys, also said that over 30% of working households were self-employed before the crisis -- but this is now down to just above 10%. Such a reduction in employment is being coupled with what the World Food Programme calls ""abnormally high"" rice prices in certain places due to quarantine measures. As the economic impact of the virus deepens, CNN's African Start-Up reached out to workers, entrepreneurs and business people in Liberia to find out how they're dealing with the crisis. Here's what they had to say. Harris Kollie - ""Pen-pen"" motobike-taxi driver . ""People don't want to ride with us ... because they are afraid of the transmission of the disease. Many customers are students, but now the schools are closed already. There's no jobs, so as a result there is a reduction in customers. ""Before the outbreak we used to transport 30-40 people a day. Now, because of the closure of schools and businesses, we might transport 20 people in a day. ""Feeding the family now is quite challenging of course. The price of rice goes up, it's not easy to find it -- 25kg of rice is $20 now, but before rice was $14."" Peter Swen Jr - Surfing teacher . ""People used to come hang out on the beach and rent surf boards from me and have surf lesson[s], but not any more. ""On the weekend [it] used to be about 15 to 20 people. I pray Ebola be eradicate[d] soon."" Fomba Trawally - owner of National Toiletries Incorporated . ""[The Ebola outbreak] forced us to reduce our workforce and subsequently our production. Our local sales dropped considerably because movement was restricted as a measure to prevent the spread of the Ebola virus ... Border closure with neighboring countries also affected our business as some of our raw materials and finished products were imported from these neighboring countries like Cote D'Ivoire and Guinea. ""As an individual, it placed me in a state of confusion. I did not know how and who to downsize among my small staff. It made me reduce the time I spent with my family and spent more time thinking about how to keep my business running and operational ... It will go a long way to restore normality for me and my family."" George Watkins - Taxi driver . ""Now there is no business at all. Before the crisis I used to do four trips from the airport to Monrovia town each day. Now it's one or two flights per day, sometimes nothing. People don't want to be in the same space as other people. Everybody is staying at home. It's very difficult these days."" Amin Modad - CEO of Bella Casa Hotel . ""When the Ebola epidemic hit, all hotels experienced an unprecedented sharp decline of occupancy from an average of 50% to about 5%. In fact, as early as May, we began experiencing cancellations as far out as December. For a Liberian entrepreneur paying about $22K monthly towards bank loans, this meant getting into immediate defaults with the banks for non-performance. ""I had to take a couple of actions for both health safety and the financial situation: Temporarily put down about 40% of my staff (especially those who lived furthest from the hotel in communities that were more susceptible to the virus)... We had to downgrade to much much smaller generators as the larger ones were consuming incomparably to our occupancy hence the revenue we were generating... We also had to slash prices."" Chid Liberty - CEO of clothes manufacturing company Liberty & Justice . ""Going into July we had almost half a million dollars in open postal orders (PO) from a client who worked with us for three years to launch our factory. Unfortunately in August, we had to stop production and keep our workers safe by keeping them home. Since that time our POs have expired. ""I am absolutely optimistic about the future. Liberia had some issues in the beginning and the global response left a lot to be desired. But things are moving in the right direction... We have a multi-million dollar asset in the epicenter of the outbreak, so we want to use it for good. We've started a campaign to assemble and distribute medical supplies from our factory. We want to be among the first major employers to get going after the outbreak and hope our success can draw others in."" Taa Wongbe - Managing partner of The Khana Group . ""Hotel occupancy rates are down 85%...Everyone selling to hotels (the entire value/supply chain) has been impacted. Vehicle rentals are down, projects that should have started have shut down or stopped. While this is a tough time for us, we have maintained 100% of our staff and their salaries because we know it's even tougher times for them. I am Liberian... I am always confident about the future. In the midst of the war, with dead bodies around me, I was confident about the future."" Bedell W. Sandi - CEO/President of Efficient Logistic Services . ""There has been an unprecedented increase in demand in the areas of transportation, warehousing, and clearing and forwarding due to the Ebola outbreak and the international response to it. ""We are working with WFP, WHO, UNICEF and other international groups to move medical supplies, construction material and food items around Liberia. ""This will help the bottom line of businesses in these sectors including ours. We hope to leverage this opportunity to grow our business as we can already see that the increased response is definitely going to result in the eradication of Ebola from Liberia in the short run. We think the prospect for our business is good."" Daniel Hopkins - Co-founder of Kwepunha Retreat . ""The outbreak has affected me by causing me to leave Liberia and return to San Diego to look for work and find a means to stay afloat while our business is closed. The surf retreat has been forced to close its doors due to a complete stop in tourism and the evacuation of many long term expats that provided us with regular business."" Manfred Zbrzezny - Manager of Fyrkuna Metalworks . ""I had just built a new workshop when Ebola started...I was working on a major sculpture which is suspended for time being until Ebola is over. To make it over the last months friends and family have helped financially, so the three workers and my family could manage. The great international help that comes now is too much and too late. Besides there is a lot of money wasted. Still I do not know when and how the activity will go back to normal."" Teemu Ropponen - Country director of tech hub iLab Liberia . ""We've had to cancel many of our ICT-related trainings and events. We organize public gatherings most days in a week, so the crisis has pretty much put a halt on this! Many of our existing and new projects have been put on hold or postponed. Luckily, all our staff and families have remained directly unaffected, though the crisis affects all of us in many ways... It will take a long long time before all becomes normal...The first things that need to happen is that the epidemic gets into such control that it is safe to organize public gatherings and trainings again.""

"A coroner ruled Tuesday that a dingo, a wild dog native to Australia, caused the death of a baby more than 30 years ago. Azaria Chamberlain was just 2 months old when she disappeared from a tent during a family holiday to Uluru, also known as Ayers Rock, sparking one of the country's most sensational and enduring murder mysteries. ""The cause of her death was as the result of being attacked and taken by a dingo,"" Elizabeth Morris, coroner for Northern Territory, announced to Darwin Magistrates court early Tuesday. ""Dingos can and do cause harm to humans."" The girl's mother, Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton, long maintained that a dingo took her baby, even as she was sentenced to life in jail for her daughter's murder, a conviction that was later quashed. During the trial, a witness recounted the then 32-year-old mother's cries of a ""dingo's got my baby,"" which was immortalized in the 1988 film ""A Cry in the Dark"" starring Meryl Streep, who earned an Oscar nomination for the role. Outside the court Tuesday, Chamberlain-Creighton said she and her family were ""relieved and delighted to come to the end of this saga."" 2004 on CNN.com: Child staves off stalking dingo . ""No longer will Australia be able to say that dingoes are not dangerous and will only attack if provoked,"" she said. Evidence produced at the fourth inquest into Azaria's death in February included reports of attacks by dingoes and dogs assumed to be part-dingo or crossbreeds. The coroner heard that in 2001 a 9-year-old boy died as a result of a dingo attack on Fraser Island in the Australian state of Queensland. Years later, two girls, each around two-years-old, died in separate attacks by dogs believed to be part-dingo in the states of New South Wales and Victoria. In her findings, Morris said no other disappearance exactly like that of Azaria had been recorded. However, she said, ""it is clear that there is evidence that in particular circumstances, a dingo is capable of attacking, taking and causing the death of young children."" It is a scenario that was unthinkable in 1980 when mother-of-three Lindy Chamberlain, then married to Michael Chamberlain, sparked a frantic search of a remote campsite in central Australia after claiming that a dingo took her baby. So unbelievable was the idea that dingo would enter a tent to snatch a two-month-old that suspicion soon turned to the couple. The mystery was compounded by the lack of a body.  Azaria's was never found, although her heavily blood-stained singlet, jumpsuit and nappy were discovered near the campsite one week after she disappeared. Overheard on CNN.com: 'Shame it took so long' for dingo ruling to be reached . The first inquest into Azaria's death in 1981 found that the baby died as a result of being taken by a dingo. However, the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory quashed the finding later that year and ordered a second inquest into Azaria's death. At the second inquest Lindy Chamberlain was committed to trial for murder. Her husband Michael was charged with being an accessory after the fact. The prosecution alleged that Chamberlain slit her daughter's throat with a pair of scissors before hiding her body, possibly in a camera bag, before she and her husband  Michael buried her somewhere in the vicinity of the campsite. The 35-day trial created a media frenzy in Australia as commentators picked apart the intricacies of the case, while a fascinated public speculated wildly as to how and why Azaria had died. The jury returned its verdict in 1982; Lindy Chamberlain was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life in jail. Her husband Michael was given a suspended sentence. Chamberlain served four years of her sentence before the Northern Territory government ordered her release in 1986 after the discovery of new evidence; a baby's jacket, believed to be Azaria's, found half-buried near a dingo lair at Uluru. In 1988, a Royal Commission set up to review the evidence formally quashed convictions for both husband and wife. Despite the finding that the couple was not to blame, a third inquest into their daughter's death returned an open verdict in 1995. It was that verdict that the couple sought to overturn with a fourth inquest this year.","Azaria Chamberlain disappeared from a tent more than 30 years ago .

"Activists presented a petition Tuesday to the United Nations Human Rights Council calling on Pakistan to free a Christian mother of five from being put to death on the charge of blasphemy. A Pakistani court Asia Bibi guilty of defiling the name of the Prophet Mohammed during a 2009 argument with Muslim fellow field workers. The offense is punishable by death or life imprisonment, according to Pakistan's penal code, and Bibi was sentenced to hang. But an investigation by a Pakistani government ministry found the charges stemmed from religious and personal enmity and recommended Bibi's release. The petition was signed by 50 activists including a former Czech foreign minister, the president of the U.N. General Assembly, a survivor of Tiananmen Square and a women's rights advocate from Mali. ""With Pakistan now running for a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council, the government should make an important gesture by releasing Asia Bibi, and repealing its blasphemy law, which is inconsistent with basic human rights,"" said Hillel Neuer, director of U.N. Watch, a Geneva-based human rights group that organized the petition. However, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has said that the government will not change the country's controversial blasphemy laws. Liberal politician Salman Taseer, then governor of Punjab, who led a campaign to end the law, was assassinated in January 2011. Taseer said the blasphemy laws were being misused to persecute religious minorities and had called for Bibi's release. Bibi writes about her ordeal in a recently published book called ""Get Me Out of Here."" It  includes a letter she wrote to her family urging them to have faith in God. ""My children,"" she wrote, ""don't lose courage or faith in Jesus Christ.""","The petition calling for the release of Asia Bibi was signed by 50 activists .

"One year ago, Howard Dean, the former Democratic presidential contender and avatar of progressive sentiment, sat in a hotel lobby at the annual Netroots Nation conference in San Jose and held forth on Hillary Clinton's White House chances in 2016. Dean made news. Clinton ""will not get a pass"" in the 2016 Democratic primaries if she decides to run again, Dean said, an early warning shot from the left against the party establishment's anointed front-runner. Dean said he might make a repeat White House bid of his own, promising to agitate ""other politicians"" in the race on issues precious to liberals. Stepping up her game, Clinton agrees to help in midterms . How things have changed. Today, Dean still thinks Clinton will have a challenger in the Democratic field -- maybe several. But he won't be one of them. And if Clinton does run, Dean sounds like he's ready to join the team. ""I am a huge Hillary Clinton fan,"" Dean told CNN in an interview. ""I just am. Not because I hope to get a job. I know her; I've known her for a long time. I think she has an enormous mental capacity to do analysis and let the chips fall where they may."" ""If she is president, which I hope she is, I think she is going to be a terrific president,"" added Dean, who stopped into Clinton's book signing event in the Hamptons last weekend and posed for a picture with the former secretary of state. The kind words from Dean aren't quite an endorsement in the traditional campaign sense, but praise from one of the left's most recognizable figures is sure to please Clinton allies who are working to build up an aura of inevitability around her and blunt a serious primary challenge. The Ready for Hillary super PAC has already secured pseudo-endorsements from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and Virginia's two senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine. Opinion: Can Hillary Clinton win over the left? Clinton's incremental politics don't quite square with those of Dean, who rose to national prominence in 2004 as a fierce and noisy critic of the war in Iraq, a military action supported by Clinton. While Clinton is not the cold-blooded foreign policy hawk she's often caricatured as -- she's a devotee of so-called ""smart power"" and institution-building -- her Iraq war vote in 2002 and her occasional splits with President Barack Obama on Syria and Afghanistan have not endeared her to her party's anti-interventionist wing. Her differences with Obama resurfaced last week in an interview with The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg. Clinton drew a line between her own views and the President's cautious foreign policy realism, expressing concern over the administration's handling of the civil war in Syria. She said, ""Great nations need organizing principles -- and 'don't do stupid stuff' is not an organizing principle."" The remark ricocheted around the Internet, and Clinton called the President to make amends. Dean, though, aggressively took Clinton's side. ""How can she not triangulate? She is running for President of the United States,"" the former Vermont governor said. ""You think if she comes out as a clone of anybody she has any chance at winning? People don't want clones as president. So of course she is going to say stuff that's different. So what? This is news?"" His aggressive defense of Clinton bloomed into a lengthy rant against the state of the political news media and the ""amplification chamber"" that Clinton will have to navigate if she decides to run. Clinton dances between loyalty and self-interest . ""I find all that to be worthless,"" Dean said. ""I don't pay any attention to that crap. I was at a meeting in Washington the other day with two very high-ranking people who I won't mention, and one turned to the other and said, 'Did you see that editorial in The Washington Post?' And without being cranky, and without saying anything, I said to myself, 'You're a free man.' Because why would anyone read The Washington Post, or certainly the editorial page of The Washington Post? ""I just don't have any patience for this sturm und drang that goes on in what passes for media these days.  I really don't read most of the stuff that's written about inside the Beltway kerfuffles like that because I think it's silly."" Clinton's biggest challenge will be generational, Dean said, echoing a previous observation he's made about the putative Democratic front-runner. Clinton is 14 years older than Obama and would be 69 on Inauguration Day 2017. ""Hillary, she has been on the scene since, what, 1992?"" he said. ""To elect Hillary, the country would have to do something we've only done once in my lifetime, with Reagan over Carter, which is the country would have to go back a generation. Usually, you don't go back."" Still, he said Clinton ""might be a great candidate because of that."" ""It's fairly likely the Republicans are going to nominate somebody who is going to be considered pretty flawed,"" he said, handicapping the GOP field. Gap shrinks between Hillary Clinton and Republicans . Dean called Ted Cruz and Rand Paul ""the wing-nut brothers."" Clinton, he said, would be a ""perfect foil"" for Paul, who is, in his words, ""a guy who wants to turn back the clock to the 1840s and all this other crap and pretend he is a libertarian but doesn't want women to exercise any rights over their own lives. She is going to mop the floor with him."" ""If it's Christie, people are going to look at Bridge-gate and Hoboken-gate and all that stuff and go, 'Why not join with a safe person who is a proven commodity?' 'Fuggedaboutit' is not a proven commodity. The only candidate that I would be concerned about is Jeb Bush, but then you get more of the same, and how is he going to denounce his brother's presidency?"" he said. As for the potential Democratic field, Dean said Clinton will not be ""an acclamation candidate"" and predicted that ""there's going to be opposition, and it's not going to be lightweight opposition."" He gushed over Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who professes to have no interest in running, and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who increasingly seems likely to jump in the race. Warren, he said, is ""new and refreshing"" and ""incredibly straightforward."" Dean said he is ""a big fan"" of O'Malley and said he would make a name for himself if he runs. ""I have spoken to him about this,"" Dean said. ""He came to see me about it a year ago. He is a very solid guy who has done a terrific job as governor. I like the way he thinks, and I like the way he approaches problems and gets things done. But Hillary Clinton has 100% name recognition and huge favorability numbers. It's a very uphill climb for somebody who wants to run against her."" Clinton, he said, ""is best prepared"" though he wants to ""see who her campaign team is"" before deciding if he will formally endorse her. ""I have not seen anything that alarms me about Hillary Clinton at all,"" he said. ""I actually thought the Diane Sawyer interview, minus the remark about 'We were broke when we left the White House,' was a great intro for her, because it showed her as her own person with the positives and the negatives. ""She could get elected without being her own person, but if she wants to get elected with real mandate, she has to be herself.""","""I am a huge Hillary Clinton fan,"" former Vermont governor and DNC chairman says .

London (VBS.TV) -- The North West seaside town of Blackpool was once the No.1 holiday destination for working-class British families. In the 1960s it would attract 17 million of them a year, until cheap, all-inclusive holidays to Spain cut their business in half. They called it ""The Las Vegas Of The North"" because of its bright lights and reputation for bawdy thrills. These days the town makes most of its money from old people and ""stag and hen"" nights -- drunken pre-nuptial parties with half-naked gangs of drunken lads and lasses falling in and out of strip clubs, sex shops, bars and brothels. They stumble past gift shops selling novelties concerned with sexual organs, like pens shaped like penises and coffee mugs with breasts on them. The town's like a British version of New York's Coney Island, with miles of rundown old buildings, tattered and torn and closed-down shops. The unpredictability of the British summer is never kind to Blackpool, and during winter months the place is a ghost town. The wind that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean is perishingly cold. The large amount of cheap bed-and-breakfast hotels in the town attracts a very transient population, a noticeable portion of whom are young men and women in the grips of addictions to heroin. Other residents of Blackpool town center include students who work in the amusement arcades and bars, and there's a sizeable proportion of aged pensioners who've retired there. In January 2009, I went up there with Leo Leigh, with whom I made ""Swansea Love Story,"" and we spent a week with Leo's aunt and uncle in their B&B, getting to know the residents of Blackpool as much as we could. We met old ladies, adult entertainers, clowns, drug addicts, donkey ride operators, criminals and some of the people who run the town's burgeoning sex shop trade. The other businesses that are doing well are the shops who sell the cut-price alcohol, which are putting Blackpool's pubs out of business. You could be forgiven for thinking this documentary -- set in January 2009 against the spectre of the bleakest economic climate the Western world has had in living memory -- is one of the most depressing you could ever watch, but there's a magic about Blackpool that lies in the resilience of its inhabitants and how they're clinging onto the traditional seaside values that once made them the ""Jewel In The Crown"" of British holiday-making.

"Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn in as Mexico's new president Saturday, returning his party to power and promising to change the country's fight against organized crime. Pena Nieto belongs to the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which ruled Mexico for more than 70 years before losing the presidency in 2000. ""We are a nation that is going at two different speeds. There's a Mexico of progress and development. But there's another, too, that lives in the past and in poverty,"" he said during his inaugural address at the National Palace in Mexico City. ""Mexico has not achieved the advances its people demand and deserve,"" he said. Pena Nieto, 46, promised to create economic opportunities and reduce violence. Peace, he said, would be his government's first goal. More than 60,000 people lost their lives in drug-related violence during the six-year term of his predecessor, Felipe Calderon. Without jobs and social programs, Pena Nieto has said, millions of people will turn to crime. Pena Nieto said earlier this week that his security strategy will focus on reducing the drug-related violence, though he provided few specifics about how he would stem the violence or what aspects of Calderon's strategy he will change. The two men took part in handover ceremonies. Exactly as scheduled, at 12:01 a.m. local time, Calderon and Pena Nieto walked down the escalators to a patio in the National Palace. In a ceremony lasting about five minutes, Calderon received the national flag from a military school cadet and immediately handed it to Pena Nieto. The act symbolized the transfer of command of the security forces. Afterward, both men greeted members of the new Cabinet, then the outgoing Cabinet members. Minutes later, in a separate ceremony, Pena Nieto conducted the oath of office of the new Security Cabinet, comprised of Miguel Angel Osorio Chong as the head of the Ministry of the Interior, Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda as head of the Ministry of National Defense and Vidal Soberon Sanz as Secretary of the Navy. Pena Nieto said the new government had taken office ""from the first minute of this day."" ""A governmental transition has been completed in an orderly, legal and transparent fashion,"" he said. ""This process has helped to preserve the political stability, economic and social development of the nation. Mexico has shown democratic maturity and institutional strength,"" he said. ""In accordance with Article 83 of the constitution, today I begin to exercise the honorable position of president of the United States of Mexico."" As Pena Nieto was being sworn in, his opponents clashed with police outside Congress. Video showed protesters hurling rocks at metal barriers, as police fired back with tear gas. Pena Nieto won 38% of the vote in July, besting his closest competitor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who garnered some 32% of the vote and refused to accept the result. Pena Nieto and Calderon took to social media to commemorate the transition. ""My term ends, but not my commitment to Mexico, which I will continue fighting until the last of my days,"" Calderon tweeted. Another of his tweets read: ""The handover of the national flag for the change of guard from the president to the president-elect symbolizes the transfer of command."" Calderon is headed next to Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The school announced this week that Calderon will spend the next year as a global public leaders fellow at the school. Pena Nieto tweeted: ""Starting today, I begin to occupy the post of Constitutional President of the United Mexican States. I am confident in my team and I recognize their track record, which supports its commitment to Mexico.""","Protesters, police clash outside Congress .

"Washington (CNN) -- When it comes to the trust Americans put in government, a new national poll indicates it's a matter of location, location, location. According to a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation survey released Tuesday, only 26 percent of the public trusts the federal government most of the time or always. A third of the people questioned in the poll say they trust their state government most or all of the time. But that number surges to 52 percent for those who say they trust local government most or all of the time. ""How broken is government in the mind of most Americans? It depends on how close that government is to them,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Suburbanites are happiest with their local government, with 55 percent of them saying they trust their local government all or most of the time. That same figure for city folk is 50 percent, and for rural Americans, it is 47 percent."" Democrats may want to take pause over the 26-percent trust figure. The number is as low as it was in 1994 when the GOP swept the midterm elections and won control of Congress. According to CNN poll numbers released Sunday, Americans overwhelmingly think that the government in this country is broken, but the public overwhelmingly holds out hope that what's broken can be fixed. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted February 12-15, with 1,023 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the overall survey. CNN Deputy Political Director Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.","CNN asks 1,023 adult Americans about their trust in government .

"The South Sudanese government and rebels signed a cease-fire deal on Thursday after more than a month of fighting, according to the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, an East African trade bloc that has been helping to mediate between the parties. The government and the rebels reached the agreement in Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. It calls for an immediate end to all military operations and a freeze of forces at the ""place they are in."" The parties also agreed not to attack civilians and to refrain from rape, sexual abuse and torture. Supply routes for humanitarian aid are to be opened to reach displaced populations. The agreement also sets up an unarmed group of monitors that includes members from surrounding East African nations and representatives from both the rebels and the government. Their job will be to ensure that the cease-fire agreement is effective. According to the official document, the cease-fire begins Friday, 24 hours after its signing. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed hope that a peace deal will ""provide good opportunities for South Sudanese, and the people around this country who have been suffering."" Support for peace talks also came from U.S. President Barack Obama who called on both parties to adhere to a separate detainee agreement, which was also signed as part of the cease-fire deal. ""The full participation of political detainees currently being held by the Government of South Sudan will be critical to those discussions, and we will continue to work to expedite their release,"" the White House statement said. South Sudan erupted in violence on December 15 when rebels loyal to ousted Vice President Riek Machar tried to stage a coup. Violence quickly spread, with reports of mass killings emerging nationwide. Some of the heaviest fighting was over control of Bor, the strategically located capital of Jonglei state. It was recaptured by government forces last week. The mayor said between 1,200 and 1,400 civilians were killed when rebels held Bor between December 17 and 24. In a statement, the trade bloc said the cease-fire is an important milestone, but more shuttle diplomacy is needed before the next phase of peace talks can begin. South Sudan seceded from Sudan in 2011 after decades of war, making it the world's youngest nation.","South Sudan's government and rebels agree on a cease-fire brokered by East African mediation group .

"(CNN) -- The World Health Organization on Monday raised its pandemic alert level in response to the outbreak of swine flu that originated in Mexico. A man wearing a protective mask reads a newspaper Sunday outside a hospital in Mexico City. The move from level three to level four on the WHO's six-level threat scale means the world body has determined the virus is capable of significant human-to-human transmission -- a major step toward a flu pandemic, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the agency's assistant director-general. A pandemic is not considered ""inevitable,"" Fukuda said. But U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the move ""does indicate that we have a serious outbreak of swine flu on our hands."" The World Health Organization confirmed 73 cases of swine flu Monday, but health officials in Scotland, California and Texas confirmed nine more, bringing the worldwide total to 82. The total includes 40 cases in the United States, confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control. Health officials in California confirmed four additional cases and three more in Texas, but those were not immediately added to the CDC's total. Including the new cases in California and Texas, officials have confirmed 11 cases in California, five in Texas, two in Kansas, one in Ohio and 28 in New York. The WHO confirmed 26 cases in Mexico, six in Canada, and one in Spain. Scottish Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said two cases of swine flu have been confirmed in that country. Both patients are ""recovering well,"" she said at a news conference in Edinburgh. The total was expected to rise as more cases are confirmed, especially in Mexico, where as many as 149 deaths are thought to have been caused by the virus, the country's health secretary said. ""Sadly, 149 people have died, of which we are working to confirm if they are linked to the swine flu,"" Mexico Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova Villalobos said. The U.S. government is urging travelers to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico because of the swine flu outbreak, and it has started distributing antiviral medications from its strategic stockpile in response to the outbreak, Napolitano said. The confirmed cases in the United States have been mild so far but, ""Scientists can't tell us right now why this is presenting so severely in Mexico City and not as severely up here,"" she said. Dr. Richard Besser, acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said of the 40 U.S. cases, only one has been hospitalized, and all have recovered. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Monday 28 cases have been confirmed at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens. More than 100 students at the school were out with flu-like symptoms last week. Bloomberg and New York City Health Commissioner Tom Frieden said all of the students who were ill had mild symptoms and none had been hospitalized. The school is remaining closed through Tuesday. ""This remains an isolated incident,"" Bloomberg said at a news conference. ""There is no reason for anyone outside of the St. Francis community to stay home or alter their routine."" ""The city is safe and open for business,"" he said, adding that ""for the general public, masks are simply not needed."" The outbreak is a particular concern because of who it is hitting hard, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Monday. ""We are concerned that in Mexico, most of those who died were young and healthy adults,"" he said.  Watch Mexican officials discuss flu plan » . The median age of all the U.S. cases is 16 years, Besser said. Officials in North Carolina and South Carolina are also testing suspected cases, including 22 suspected cases from a South Carolina school's spring break trip to Cancun, Mexico. Officials said results from those tests are expected Tuesday. President Obama said Monday that the swine flu outbreak is a ""cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert,"" but is not a ""cause for alarm."" He added that the federal government is closely monitoring emerging cases and had declared a public health emergency as a ""precautionary tool to ensure that we have the resources we need at our disposal to respond quickly and effectively.""  Watch bloggers discuss U.S. response » . Meanwhile, Andorra Vassiliou, the European Union's health commissioner, on Monday urged people ""to avoid nonessential travel to the areas which are reported to be in the center of the clusters"" of a swine flu outbreak. The EU later said that Vassiliou's remarks were her personal comments and that travel advisories can be issued only by member states and not by the EU itself. Swine influenza, or flu, is a contagious respiratory disease that affects pigs. It is caused by a type-A influenza virus. Outbreaks in pigs occur year-round. The current strain is a new variation of an H1N1 virus, which is a mix of human and animal versions. When the flu spreads person-to-person, instead of from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it harder to treat or fight, because people have no natural immunity. The symptoms are similar to the common flu. They include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Learn more about swine flu and how to treat it » . The virus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes around another person. People can become infected by touching something with the flu virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. The WHO has called the outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern."" Researchers are trying to determine how easily it can jump from person to person. Fukuda, the WHO's assistant director-general, said it was too early to predict whether there will be a mild or serious pandemic. In Mexico, authorities closed all schools until at least May 6. Officials are considering whether to suspend other public activities but are analyzing what economic effects could result, Health Secretary Cordova said. Military troops distributed 4 million filter masks in Mexico City, which has 20 million residents.  Watch CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta on the outbreak in Mexico » . In Washington, the government Sunday declared a public health emergency -- a step Napolitano said, ""sounds more severe that really it is."" ""This is standard operating procedure and allows us to free up federal state and local agencies and their resources for prevention and mitigation,"" she said. Meanwhile, Israel and New Zealand were investigating unconfirmed cases of swine flu. Concerns about the virus prompted Canada to issue a travel health notice, and South Korea to say it will test airline passengers arriving from the United States. In New Zealand, officials said 22 students and three teachers, who returned from a three-week language trip to Mexico, might have been infected. The group remains quarantined at home, and Health Minister Tony Ryall said 10 students tested positive for influenza A -- the general category of strains that includes the H1N1 swine flu. In Spain, six people -- all recently returned from Mexico -- were being isolated in hospitals, the country's Health Ministry said. Lab tests confirmed that one of the people had tested positive. In Israel, doctors are running tests on a man who recently returned from Mexico with light flu symptoms. iReport.com: Do you think we should be worried about swine flu?

"While Attorney General Eric Holder had made clear that he wanted to leave the post before the end of Obama's second term, the announcement of his departure just before midterm elections took many by surprise and the timing could complicate the effort to replace him. Choosing a new attorney general and getting approval in a Senate confirmation hearing will be difficult for the White House. While the list of strong candidates who could assume the role is long, congressional politics will make it difficult to get Senate approval for just about anyone. Plus, while he has endured his share of controversies, Holder is also President Barack Obama's very close friend and confidant, someone for whom the President consistently communicated his full support. ""We have been great colleagues, but the bonds between us are much deeper than that,"" Holder said Thursday in a joint statement with Obama, announcing his departure. ""I'm proud to call you my friend."" When a replacement might be announced is unknown. Obama thanked Holder for his service Thursday but offered no timeline for announcing a nominee to replace him. Holder pledged to stay on the job until a nominee is selected and confirmed by the Senate, and in doing that, he might have agreed to stay on for a while longer. Who could replace Holder as attorney general? The Senate is the biggest obstacle. Holder's announcement comes just weeks before the midterm elections, in which Republicans have a solid chance of reclaiming the majority. Congress, currently on recess while members campaign for re-election, will have a lame duck session in November and December in which a confirmation hearing could be pushed through. But Congress will have a lot on its plate during that session, most notably a possible vote to expand Obama's authority to execute his military offensive against ISIS. It's possible that a confirmation hearing will take place in the next Congress, in 2015, when Republicans could be in control. White House officials insisted they weren't concerned about this possibility. ""I do anticipate that Democrats will hold the Senate,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday. ""That said, I also anticipate that whoever the nominee is will earn and ultimately receive bipartisan support."" But in the current political climate, bipartisan support is far from certain for any administration appointee, particularly one as high profile as Holder's replacement. The other issue is less tactical -- it's the personal factor. Obama and Holder are good friends, and Holder is a part of the Obama inner circle that includes key adviser Valerie Jarrett, whom Holder thanked Thursday as someone who he had ""been fortunate to work with since the beginning of what started as an improbable, idealistic effort by a young senator from Illinois."" Furthermore, the issues that Holder has championed -- voting rights, LGBT rights and reducing prison sentences for low-level drug offenders -- are important aspects of Obama's legacy, so this pick will, in all likelihood, be an incredibly important one for him. Obama gave no hints about possible replacements in his goodbye remarks to Holder, offering only a tidbit of what he's looking for in an attorney general: ""I chose him to serve as attorney general because he believes, as I do, that justice is not just an abstract theory -- it's a living and breathing principle.""","Attorney General Eric Holder announced his resignation Thursday .

"A mass evacuation of Yazidis hiding from extremist fighters on Iraq's Sinjar Mountains is unlikely following an assessment by the U.S. State Department and military that found far fewer people trapped than previously feared. Once believed to be in the tens of thousands, the number of Yazidis in the mountains is ""now in the low thousands,"" Brett McGurk, a deputy assistant secretary of state, told CNN on Wednesday. The news broke the same day a senior commander with the Islamic State, formerly known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, claimed ISIS fighters abducted more than 100 Yazidi women and children from Sinjar. The ISIS commander, who has knowledge of the events that unfolded, said the fighters killed a large number of men when they took over the town more than a week ago. ""At that time, they took Yazidi women and children, and I can confirm those women and children have entered Mosul,"" the commander said by telephone. ""...The Islamic State is taking this opportunity to call them to Islam."" Map: Where is ISIS? While CNN cannot independently confirm the claim, it follows reports by survivors who describe ISIS fighters grabbing families and separating the men from the women and children. The plight of the Yazidis, coupled with the ISIS assault against Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdish region, prompted the United States to begin targeted airstrikes over the past several days. The aim, according to President Barack Obama, is to help protect U.S. personnel in the area and to destroy ISIS positions around the mountains to ease the threat to minority groups. The United States deployed 129 military advisers to get a firsthand look at the humanitarian crisis unfolding as ISIS fighters threaten Iraq's ethnic and religious minorities: Yazidis, Christians and Kurds. As part of that effort, a group of about 20 U.S. State Department and military personnel spent 24 hours in the mountains to assess the numbers and conditions, Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said. ""The Yazidis who remain are in better condition than previously believed and continue to have access to the food and water that we have dropped,"" he said, citing the success of humanitarian airdrops and airstrikes against ISIS. Who are the religious and ethnic groups under threat from ISIS? The problem, though, is far from over. The United Nations on Wednesday announced its highest level of emergency for a humanitarian crisis, saying the number of people on the run from ISIS is of grave concern. It estimates more than 400,000 people have been driven from their homes since June, when ISIS swept across the border from Syria into Iraq. The group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large swaths of northern and western Iraq, aiming to establish a caliphate -- an Islamic state -- that stretches from Syria to Iraq. Of those displaced, more than 200,000 have poured into Dohuk province in recent weeks, where refugee camps have swelled since ISIS began its assault against Yazidis, Christians and Kurds. By declaring what it calls a ""Level 3 Emergency,"" the United Nations says it will trigger more resources to help. What to know about ISIS? Obama this week ordered the military advisers to the Kurdish capital of Irbil to assess the humanitarian crisis. The advisers, made up of Marines and special operations forces, join hundreds of other American advisers already in the country advising Iraqi troops in their fight against ISIS, an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq. The group has waged a brutal campaign while seizing large areas of territory this year in Iraq, aiming to establish a caliphate. Adding to the crisis is Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's refusal to step down after Haider al-Abadi was nominated to replace him. In a televised address on Wednesday, he called the move to appoint al-Abadi as prime minister a constitutional violation. Al-Maliki's political party won a majority during parliamentary elections in April, but not a super majority. Even so, al-Maliki has maintained that because his party won a majority, the next Prime Minister should come from his party. He has filed a lawsuit in federal court to stop the formation of a new government, and he has said he wouldn't step down until the court has ruled. ""We need to protect the federal court and its decisions; no one has any ground to go against this court,"" al-Maliki said, while not specifically mentioning the name of Prime Minister-designate al-Abadi or any other leaders.

"(CNN)Ask a New Zealander what happened on June 10, 1886, and they'll tell you the planet lost its ""eighth wonder."" The Pink and White Terraces of Lake Rotomahana were the world's largest silica towers and the South Pacific's biggest 19th-century attraction until a massive eruption at Mount Tarawera that momentous day blasted these natural wonders into oblivion. Out of that same eruption, however, a new wonder of the world was born. Waimangu Geyser roared into existence hurling black mud and sand some 1,500 feet (460 meters) into the sky, making it the most powerful geyser the world has ever seen. This new attraction ignited a whirlwind of global interest in New Zealand's volcanic North Island until it, too, vanished off the face of the earth in 1904 after a landslide changed the water table. The Pink and White Terraces and Waimangu Geyser may be lost forever, but their impression on tourists of the time is well documented. They are but two of many attractions of yesteryear that can now only be appreciated in the pages of a history book. Here's a look at 10 others. The current Penn Station may be a charmless catacomb of labyrinthine low-ceiling hallways, but New York's first Penn Station was a lavish masterpiece of the Beaux Arts style. The original facility's domed ceilings, soaring archways and handsome columns welcomed more than 100 million passengers each year during the station's golden era in the mid-1940s. But by the end of the 1950s, the dawn of the Jet Age and the birth of the Interstate Highway System took a heavy toll on visitor numbers. Plans for the new Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden were announced in 1962, and a year later, the original Penn Station was knocked to the ground to make room for a smaller facility underground. The demolition of Penn Station in 1963 was not without controversy. The New York Times questioned at the time how the city would ""permit this monumental act of vandalism against one of the largest and finest landmarks of its age of Roman elegance."" The whole affair is regularly cited as the catalyst for the modern historical preservation movement in the United States. Within a decade of Penn Station's demolition, Grand Central Terminal was protected under New York City's new Landmarks Preservation Act. Guaira Falls was easily the most powerful cataract in the world in terms of total volume with 1,750,000 cubic feet of water passing through each second. That's more than double the flow of Niagara Falls and more than 12 times that of Victoria Falls. But good luck finding any trace of Guaira underneath the Itaipu Dam. More than three decades have now passed since one of the world's greatest waterfalls was drowned to pave the way for a massive hydroelectric project. This natural wonder, lost to the world in 1982, once lured hordes of local and international tourists to the Upper Parana River at the Brazil-Paraguay border. It contained 18 falls in total with a drop of about 375 feet, and its deafening roar could be heard from up to 20 miles away. At least three Globe theaters have graced the shores of the River Thames over the past five centuries. First there was the original Globe, built in 1599 by William Shakespeare's playing company, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. A fire destroyed it during a performance of Henry VIII on June 29, 1613, but a second Globe Theatre opened on the same site exactly one year later. It, too, closed in 1642 amid an outcry by Puritans who were opposed to theatrical performances. The legacy of the first Globe Theatre and the iconic plays it debuted to the world lives on at the modern reconstruction, known as Shakespeare's Globe, which opened its doors in 1997 approximately 750 feet from the original theater. When Sutro Baths first opened to the public in 1894, the three-acre complex housed a staggering seven pools (at varying temperatures) under a massive glass enclosure with springboards, high dives, slides and trapezes. The facility could hold as many as 10,000 people at one time and also had several non-aquatic attractions such as a natural history museum with Egyptian mummies and a sculpture gallery with artifacts from Mexico and China. The oceanfront property ensconced in the rocky San Francisco coast was considered a playground unlike any other the world had ever seen. Its Achilles' heel, however, was an outsized price tag to match its ostentatious offerings. With exceedingly high operational costs, the Baths were never a commercially successful business -- even after owners turned the pools into ice skating rinks during the Great Depression. The facility shut down for good in 1964 and was destroyed in a fire two years later. Its remains are now protected as part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In an 1839 fairy tale called ""The Garden of Paradise,"" Hans Christian Andersen describes a teenager named East Wind who flies home from the East and tells his mother, ""I came back from China, where I danced for a while around a tower of porcelain and rang all the bells."" The Danish author's fable may be a fantasy, but the tower of porcelain bricks was no figment of his vivid imagination. Considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, the Porcelain Tower of Nanjing was built by the third emperor of the Ming Dynasty in the early 15th century and rose from a 97-foot octagonal base to a height of 260 feet. This glossy nine-story pagoda soared above the south bank of the Yangtze River in Nanjing for more than four centuries before it was destroyed under the Taiping Rebellion of the 1850s. Its rubble remained relatively untouched until 2010 when a businessman donated $156 million (the largest single donation in Chinese history) to rebuild the medieval icon. The New York Hippodrome was billed as the largest theater in the world when it opened to the public in midtown Manhattan in 1905, featuring a 100-foot-by-200-foot stage and the capacity to seat up to 5,300 spectators. This mammoth attraction lured the biggest acts of the day such as Harry Houdini and the ""Jumbo"" musical, but, like San Francisco's Sutro Baths, it racked up a hefty upkeep bill. Just 17 years after the Hippodrome opened, its owners refashioned the Moorish-style building into a vaudeville theater. Five years later it became a movie theater, then an opera house and finally a sports arena. The doldrums of the Great Depression dealt one final blow to the facility and it was torn down in 1939 to make way for an office building and parking garage. The Chacaltaya Glacier lies 17,400 feet up in the Andes and was once one of Bolivia's top tourist attractions, luring skiers the world over with the promise of tackling earth's highest ski run. Thanks to global warming, however, the 18,000-year-old wonder has been reduced to a few lumps of unskiable ice that no visitor would go out of their way to see. In its prime it had the first rope tow in South America (built in 1939) and the highest ski lodge in the world, at an elevation greater than Everest Base Camp. Chacaltaya was the closest ski area to the equator before it indefinitely closed in 2012. Known as the ""bridge of ice"" in the local Aymara language, Chacaltaya is but one of many glaciers currently retreating toward almost certain oblivion. Walt Disney World's very first water park, River Country, is looking anything but jolly these days after lying abandoned on the shores of Bay Lake, Florida, for more than a decade. The ""old-fashioned swimming hole,"" replete with swings, slides and whitewater rafting, closed for annual maintenance in 2001 never to open again. Park officials cited declining business after 9/11 and the success of Walt Disney World's two newer water parks, Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach, as reasons for their decision. Bay Lake is also home to the only other Disney park to close permanently: Discovery Island. This abandoned (but not demolished) zoological park was yet another 1970s-era attraction that lost favor with visitors and eventually closed to the public in 1999. All animals were relocated to new homes at Disney's Animal Kingdom, a much larger zoo that opened in 1998. A warning to any urban explorers out there: Disney employees still monitor both River Country and Discovery Island for trespassers. Like the operas that brought its audiences to tears, the story of the Royal Opera House of Valletta is fittingly tragic. Designed by Edward Middleton Barry in the 1860s, architect of the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden, it was the crowning jewel of Malta's capital city for just six years before a fire gutted the interior. It was resurrected from the flames four years later, but tragedy struck again during World War II when the Royal Opera House received a direct hit from an aerial bomb. A few columns remain in place on the corner of Strada Reale, forming a backdrop for the open-air Royal Piazza Theatre, launched within the ruins of the Royal Opera House in 2013. Jonah's Tomb in Mosul, Iraq, is the newest addition to this list and one of a series of attractions lost to war. Militants with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, planted explosives in July 2014 around Mosul's oldest mosque, which is traditionally held to be the burial place of Jonah the Prophet. Jonah is a key figure in both Christianity and Islam who, according to Islamic and Judeo-Christian traditions, was swallowed by a whale. His tomb was a popular place of pilgrimage and joins a growing list of holy sites deemed idolatrous under the puritanical strain of Islam practiced by ISIS.

"Harper Lee's ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" celebrates its 54th birthday today, and for the first time, it's available as an e-book. Since it was published July 11, 1960, the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide and been translated into 50 languages. In 1999, it was voted best novel of the 20th century by Library Journal. Until this week, though, it had never been available as an e-book. The story . ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is a coming-of-age story about two children in the South, Scout and Jem Finch. While their lawyer father, Atticus, defends Tom Robinson, a black man wrongly accused of rape, the children are fascinated by a mysterious neighbor, Boo Radley. Through the trial and their experiences in their hometown of Maycomb, Alabama, Scout and Jem learn about racism and acceptance in the 1930s Deep South. The author . Born in 1926, Lee spent her childhood in Alabama before moving to New York when she was 23. She struggled with odd jobs over the years and, in 1956, decided to write full-time. She found a publisher interested in her novel and completed it three years later. In ""Mockingbird,"" a 2006 biography about Lee, author Charles J. Shields, wrote that the novel is partially autobiographical, based on Lee's childhood in Monroeville, Alabama.  Similar to the young protagonist in ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" Lee was a tomboy whose father was a lawyer. Amazon's 100 books to read in a lifetime . The town where the novel takes place is based on her hometown, and the fictional trial in ""Mockingbird"" closely parallels the 1931 Alabama ""Scottsboro Boys"" trial. Lee has said that although she didn't want the trial in her book to be as sensational, her intent was to expose the longstanding racial disparities in the South. It's also believed that she based the character of Scout's playmate, Dill, on her childhood friend, Truman Capote. The two remained close as adults, and after the release of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" Lee traveled to Kansas with Capote to research an article he was writing for the New Yorker. That article would later become his famous true-crime story, ""In Cold Blood."" The book . The book was released in July 1960 and flew off the shelves, but critics had mixed reviews. Some praised it for pushing the envelope with its social commentary, while others found its characters, both black and white, to be poor representations people of the South and their lives. Although it's considered a classic, the book is still among those challenged and banned in schools and libraries, often because of language or its themes around race. 5 best-selling authors' favorite beach reads . Although Lee humbly accepted the success and praise around ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" she's always been reclusive, avoiding the spotlight and media attention. She began work on another novel in the early 1960s, but ""Mockingbird"" was her only published work. Fiercely protective of the novel, she's been involved in several lawsuits regarding copyright issues and unauthorized merchandise being sold in her hometown. The film and the future . In 1962, the novel was made into an Oscar-winning film starring Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch. Lee was pleased with the film adaptation, praising Peck's portrayal of the small-town lawyer, and called the film a work of art. This year, Lee finally gave permission for the novel to be published as an e-book and digital audio edition e-book, saying, ""I am amazed and humbled that 'Mockingbird' has survived this long. This is 'Mockingbird' for a new generation."" Rosemary Murphy dies; played Miss Maudie Atkinson in 'Mockingbird' When did you first read ""The Kill A Mockingbird""?
