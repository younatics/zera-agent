"By . Damien Gayle . Curiosity has sent back the first pictures of the Martian rock dust it collected after successfully drilling down into the surface of the Red Planet. Images released today by Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, show for the first time that powdered rock sample has been transferred to an open scoop. Nasa says it is the very first time anyone has drilled into a rock beyond our home planet and collected a sample from its interior. Scroll down for video . Success! The sample of powdered rock extracted by Curiosity, shown after the sample was transferred from the drill to the rover's scoop. The image was taken on Curiosity's 193rd Martian day of operations . The U.S. space agency's Mars Science Laboratory Project is using the Curiosity rover to investigate whether an area within Mars' Gale Crater was ever hospitable to microbial life. They hope to now use Curiosity's on-board scientific instruments to analyse the pulverised rock sample in an effort to learn more about the site's environmental history. Curiosity drilling engineer Scott McCloskey said: 'Seeing the powder from the drill in the scoop allows us to verify for the first time the drill collected a sample as it bore into the rock. 'Many of us have been working toward this day for years. Getting final confirmation of successful drilling is incredibly gratifying. 'For the sampling team, this is the equivalent of the landing team going crazy after the successful touchdown.' Sample preparation: The 150-micrometer sieve which will be used to remove larger particles from samples before delivery to science instruments . How it works: These schematic drawings show a top view and a cutaway view of a section of the drill on NASA's Curiosity rover on Mars, showing how dust is drawn up through the instrument for collection . The drill on Curiosity's robotic arm collected the powder as it bored a 2.5in hole into flat Martian bedrock on February 8. Researcher will now instruct Curiosity to sieve the sample and deliver portions to its analytical instruments. The scoop holding the precious sample is part of Curiosity's Collection and Handling for In-Situ Martian Rock Analysis (CHIMRA) device. The next step is to enclose the power inside CHIMRA and shake it over a sieve to screen out any particles which are larger than 0.006in (150 microns) across. Holy holes on Mars! Nasa's rover Curiosity drilled a 2.5in-hole hole on February 8 to take its Martian planet sample - next to it is a shallower hole where the rover conducted its test drilling . Small portions of the sieved sample later will then be delivered through inlet ports on top of the rover deck into the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument and Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument. The sample comes from a fine-grained, veiny sedimentary rock called ""John Klein,"" named in memory of a Mars Science Laboratory deputy project manager who died in 2011. The rock was selected for the first sample drilling because it may hold evidence of wet environmental conditions long ago.","New images show the sample inside an open scoop in the Mars rover .

"By . Jack Doyle . The Centre for Social Justice has called for US-style jail terms for criminals who break the terms of their court order . More than 27,000 criminals were given a community sentence last year despite having at least 15 crimes to their name. The use of such punishments - which criminals regard as a ‘laughing stock’ because they are so soft - has shot up by 75 per cent in a decade, a report reveals today. The damning report by the Centre for Social Justice published today finds community sentences ‘lack credibility’ and are held in utter contempt by the criminal class. It calls for US-style instant punishment of up to a week behind bars for anyone who breaks the terms of their court order. The ‘short sharp shock’ of up to seven days in jail would act as a major deterrent and restore faith in community sentences, it says. In US states which have introduced swift jail sentences, the level of reoffending by those on community sentences has plummeted. The idea is likely to be given serious consideration by senior Conservatives as they draw up plans for the next Tory manifesto. The report lays bare the staggering failure of community sentences to turn offenders away from crime. And it shows how repeat criminals who have offended time and time again are nevertheless allowed to walk free from court with a non-custodial sentence. The report, based on official Ministry of Justice figures, shows the startling rise in community sentences given out to repeat criminals. Despite having at least 15 previous crimes under their belts, some 27,632 criminals were given a community sentence in 2012/13. That represents a rise of 76 per cent from the level in 2003/4 of 15,709. Every year, criminals on community sentences commit more than 160,000 offences - or more than 435 every single day. The researchers found among the criminals most likely to breach their community orders were those required to undergo drug rehabilitation. Lax rules allow them to ‘game’ the system because drug test appointments are scheduled, rather than random. No punishment: The report shows how repeat criminals who have offended time and time again are nevertheless allowed to walk free from court with a non-custodial sentence . This allows heroin users to stop taking drugs for a few days beforehand, knowing they will be out of their system by the time of the test. Even those who fail drug tests are rarely hauled back to court. The researchers found one criminal who failed half his tests over a six month period and faced no further sanction because he was not reported by his probation officer. Edward Boyd, editor of the ‘Sentences in the Community’ report said: ‘Many prolific offenders are refusing to take their punishment and rehabilitation seriously and are getting away with it.’ ‘What we have found in the US is that the consequences of a day or two in prison shows offenders that they have to comply and means they take more responsibility.’ ‘This approach is slashing reoffending rates as offenders realise they can’t get away with breaking the rules. This new idea offers the government an opportunity to restore faith in community punishments’. Heroin users stop taking drugs for a few days so they are clear for tests - but few who fail get hauled into court . The report also revealed that it can take up to five months for an offender to start their community sentence from when they walk out of court. Such ‘punishments’ can include clearing litter, painting walls or doing other unpaid work in the community. A programme of immediate prison sentences of a few days is in use in around 20 states across the US. In Texas, a programme of short prison terms for criminals found more than nine in ten finished their community sentences, and only a handful broke the rules. Currently, in the UK, around a third of offenders given community sentences reoffend within a year of being sentenced. And thousands more may commit crimes which they are never caught for. Community sentences are also used repeatedly, despite criminals’ flagrant reoffending. In 2012, 25 per cent of those given a custodial sentence already had at least five previous community terms - or 37,019 individuals. Justice minister Jeremy Wright said ministers were . 'determined' to tackle high reoffending rates. 'This report raises some important issues and highlights the . very clear fact that offending rates are unacceptably high,' he said. 'Tough conditions are available to the judiciary when they . impose community sentences. To further toughen community sentences, we are . making changes that will mean they will have to contain an element of . punishment, such as a curfew or community service, when imposed on adult . offenders. 'Anyone who refuses to complete their community sentence can . expect to be hauled back in front of a judge and face further punishment.'","Centre for Social Justice report finds community sentences 'lack credibilty'

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . and Jack Doyle . Sebastian Coe is today being urged to step down from some of his current work commitments if he wants the role of BBC Trust chairman. The former track star and London 2012 chief is the frontrunner to replace Lord Patten, who stood down three weeks ago after heart surgery. However, MPs are today urging Lord Coe to step down from some of his 20 other jobs to dedicate his time to the demanding role. Whitehall sources claim that Lord Coe, pictured, is the leading contender to replace Chris Patten as chairman of the BBC Trust . Lord Coe is believed to earn around £1.5million a year. He is thought to earn about £500,000 as executive chairman at CSM Sport and Entertainment. The Olympic hero, who charges around £25,000 to £50,000 for after dinner speeches, is also believed to earn £450,000 annually as a consultant to Chelsea FC and PruHealth. He also has several unpaid jobs - including chairman of the British Olympic Association and trustee of the Sebastian Coe Foundation. Concerns have been raised that Lord Coe will not be able to dedicate enough time to the role. Labour's Gerry Sutcliffe told The Sun: 'It's be very difficult to give his full attention and do all the other things as well.' Lord Coe's representatives have been approached for comment by MailOnline. Downing Street is yet to comment on the rumors - which were first made by ITV News earlier this week. However, Whitehall sources have confirmed . Lord Coe is the leading candidate. London Mayor Boris Johnson appeared to inadvertently confirm the story  when he said that Lord Coe was a ‘first-rate choice’. Tory peer Lord Patten stood down as BBC Trust chairman after three turbulent years in charge. He said he could no longer do the job because of ill health . Mr Johnson said: ‘I think it’s fantastic news for the BBC and British broadcasting. Seb Coe is a great leader, I’ve worked with him a lot over the last few years and I think he’ll demand very high standards of the BBC. ‘I think he’ll be exactly in the right  tradition of British broadcasting.’ Yesterday Lord Coe, 57, did not deny he was linked to the role, saying only that he was ‘very flattered’ to be considered  a contender. He said: ‘I think you will find that whenever any job at the moment comes up I seem to be slated in for it. ‘Either the Mayor of London, Fifa, International Olympic Committee. I’m very flattered, thank you,  but I’ve actually just got off a plane. I have absolutely nothing more  to say.’ After Lord Patten stood down, it was suggested that David Cameron wanted a woman to fill the role, with Dame Marjorie Scardino, the former chief executive of FTSE100 company Pearson, heavily tipped. Lord Coe’s appointment would be popular among Tory MPs who remain concerned about left-wing bias within the corporation. Seb Coe, who is rooted in the real world and renowned for his common sense would be an 'inspirational choice' Unlike Lord Patten, he is seen as a ‘true Tory’ in his beliefs. Coe was a Conservative MP for five years before losing his seat in the 1997 general election, returning to politics for a short time as  William Hague’s chief of staff after receiving a life peerage in 2000. A double Olympic gold medallist in the Eighties, he has also already had a working relationship with BBC director-general Tony Hall. In 2009, Hall, then chief executive of the Royal Opera House, was asked to chair a board to direct the Cultural Olympiad. This gave Hall a seat on the board of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, which Coe chaired. Lord Coe would move into the job following a string of highly damaging scandals at the corporation. The BBC was lambasted for its handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal that broke after the presenter’s death in 2011. In November 2012 George Entwistle quit as director-general after a disastrous Newsnight programme wrongly implicated Lord McAlpine in a child sex abuse scandal. The BBC has also been criticised after details emerged of shocking payoffs worth tens of millions of pounds to senior BBC managers. Technological changes have also led to question marks about the future of the licence fee. The BBC’s royal charter, which secures its funding from the  compulsory licence fee, which  currently costs £145.50, is up for renewal at the end of 2016. As Sebastian Coe, he became a household name in 1980 when  he won the 1500 metres Olympic gold medal – a feat he repeated at the Los Angeles Games in 1984. His victory over his great rival Steve Ovett in Moscow in 1980 is still seen as one of the great  Olympic stories. He . claimed the gold, crossing the line, arms aloft, only days after . losing to Ovett over 800 metres, which was seen as Coe’s specialism. After . retiring from athletics, he was elected in 1992 as a Tory MP for the . Cornwall constituency of Falmouth and Camborne until his defeat in the . 1997 election. He was . chairman of Britain’s triumphant bid to host the 2012 Olympics, and took . the same role in the committee organising the Games, which were widely . seen as one of the most successful in recent years. The . formal selection process for the chair of the BBC – for which Lord . Patten was paid £110,000 a year for a three-day week – will be overseen . by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid. The appointment would be  formally approved by the Prime Minister and rubber-stamped by the Queen.","Tory peer refuses to deny reports he has been chosen to head BBC Trust .

"By . Daniel Miller . It is known as the world's toughest team sport, where the players seem to spend more time embroiled in mass brawls and punch-ups than they do scoring goals. But as these adorable pictures show, even the brutal world of professional ice hockey can have its tender moments. When children of the Stanley Cup-winning Chicago Blackhawks players ventured onto the ice to celebrate their team's win, a fan of the losing Boston Bruins put rivalry aside to take their picture. Good sport: A Boston Bruins fan takes a photo of the children of the Stanley Cup-winning Chicago Blackhawks . The youngsters couldn't hide their delight after the Blackhawks snatched a dramatic 3-2 victory to seal their second Stanley Cup in just four seasons. But in a heartwarming display of sportsmanship, the Bruins' fan joined in with their celebrations and even took several victory snaps. Let's hope he sends them a copy. The children were later pictured parading around the ice waving Blackhawks flags. The Blackhawks were just seventy-six seconds away from defeat and a trip home for a decisive seventh game, when Bryan Bickell tied it.

Then, while the Bruins were settling in for another overtime in a series that has already had its share, Dave Bolland scored to give Chicago victory. The back-to-back scores in the time it takes for one good rush down the ice turned a near-certain defeat into a championship clincher, stunning the Boston players and their fans and starting the celebrations on the Blackhawks' bench with 59 seconds to play. 'We thought we were going home for Game 7. You still think you're going to overtime and you're going to try to win it there. 'Then Bolly scores a huge goal 17 seconds later,' said Chicago forward Patrick Kane, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the postseason's most valuable player. 'It feels like the last 58 seconds were an eternity.'

Chicago Blackhawks defenseman Michal Rozsival, of the Czech Republic, hoists the Stanley Cup after his team's dramatic win . The sold-out TD Garden had begun chanting 'We want the cup!' after Milan Lucic's goal put the Bruins up 2-1 with eight minutes left, but it fell silent after its team coughed up the lead. The team came out to salute its fans as they streamed out of the building for the last time, from the air conditioning into the summer air. The arena was almost empty - except for a few hundred fans in red Blackhawks sweaters who filtered down to the front rows - when NHL commissioner Gary Bettman handed the 35-pound Cup to Toews, who left Game 5 with an undisclosed injury and wasn't confirmed for the lineup until the morning skate. The Chicago captain skated the cup right over the crease in which the Blackhawks mounted the comeback and in front of the fans in Blackhawks sweaters who lined the front row behind the net. Toews banged on the glass while the remaining Bruins fans headed up the runways.

Just like in 2010, they won it in a Game 6 on the road. 'In 2010, we didn't really know what we were doing. We just, we played great hockey and we were kind of oblivious to how good we were playing,' said Toews, who scored his third goal of the playoffs to tie it 1-1 in the second period, then fed Bickell for the score that tied it with 76 seconds to play. 'This time around, we know definitely how much work it takes and how much sacrifice it takes to get back here and this is an unbelievable group,' Toews said. 'We've been through a lot together this year and this is a sweet way to finish it off.' The Blackhawks opened the season on a 21-0-3 streak and coasted to the Presidents' Trophy that goes to the team with the best regular-season record. But regular-season excellence has not translated into playoff success: Chicago is the first team with the best record to win the cup since the 2008 Detroit Red Wings.

"By . Jack Doyle . Tony Blair is a narcissist with a messiah complex who is passionate about making money and lives a ‘strange life’ among the super-rich, according to a former close friend. Best-selling author Robert Harris, once a confidant of the former prime minister, said Mr Blair now cuts a ‘tragic figure’. In a savage attack, Mr Harris said Mr Blair was ‘quite disconnected from reality’ and hinted that his time in office had made him ‘mad’. He also claimed that Mr Blair, 61, had delivered a ‘slap in the face’ to the British people by walking away from Parliament. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair intervened in the growing debate over Europe this week, with a speech to the CBI business conference attacking UKIP for blaming foreigners for Britain's problems . Robert Harris (left) with the then Labour Party leader Tony Blair pictured together in 1997. Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair's then spin chief, can be seen in the background . Robert Harris fell out with Tony Blair after the former Prime Minister sacked Peter Mandelson for the second time in 2001. The novelist had been a close confident of the Labour leader and was even with him on the night of Mr Blair's 1997 landslide election victory. But he was furious with the way Mr Blair had treated his close friend Lord Mandelson - the godfather to one of Mr Harris's children. Mr Blair sacked Lord Mandelson - then Northern Ireland Secretary - in 2001 over the Hinduja affair in which he was accused of using his position to influence a passport application. Mandelson insisted he had done nothing wrong and was later exonerated. The former premier would never be  forgiven for leaving British politics to go and ‘hang out with a lot of rich people in America’, the writer added. The two men met in the early 1990s and Mr Harris became a close friend of the Blair family, remaining a supporter of the rising Labour star as he became party leader in 1994 and then Prime Minister. He was by Mr Blair’s side when the 1997 election results came in. But the pair fell out over Mr Blair’s sacking of Peter Mandelson, who is godfather to one of Mr  Harris’s children. A former political journalist, he wrote a novel, The Ghost, clearly based on Mr Blair – in which a  fictional ex-premier faces being hauled to court for alleged war crimes. Mr Harris described the book as being somewhere ‘between reality and fiction’. But his latest comments, in an interview with Total Politics, are the most devastating character assassination of the New Labour leader by a former member of his inner circle. He said: ‘I find with Tony Blair it’s impossible to see the man he is now in the man that I knew. I met him first in 1992 I think. ‘Who knew that he would become a great friend of George Bush and would want to keep bombing  people and would be so passionately interested in making money and live this strange life with the billionaire super-rich on yachts and private jets? ‘I mean, maybe someone more perceptive than I would have seen it, but I never saw that at the time, nor – knowing a lot of the people who know him very well – did they. ‘It’s a cliche to say that most  politicians go mad if they are in office for more than about six or seven years and they become a member of a club and you become quite disconnected from reality, and I think there were in Tony things we perhaps didn’t realise  at the time – of narcissism, a  messiah complex, that had merely accelerated this impulse in him.’ Robert Harris (left) and Lord Mandelson attended the VIP screening of 'The Ghost' in 2010. The novel centres around a former British Prime Minister who is wanted by the International Criminal Court . He said Lord Mandelson – who has been criticised for mixing with some of the world’s super-rich – is ‘the soul of plain living’ compared with the former PM. Mr Harris, 57, pointed to the way Mr Blair walked away from parliament after resigning as prime minister and as an MP in the summer of 2007. He said: ‘I can’t believe there isn’t an element of tragedy that he himself feels, that a relatively young man in political terms should cut himself off from British democracy in the way that he has. ‘Because he could have had one of those 19th century careers and come back, as foreign secretary or maybe even as party leader, but he turned his back on it and walked out of the place. ‘I think it’s clear he felt that he had outgrown Westminster and the British, and you will never be  forgiven for that.’ Robert Harris is a former friend of Tony Blair and remains close to the Labour peer Lord Mandelson. He said he could never have guessed how Mr Blair would change and attacked his close relationship to George Bush . Mr Harris referred to Sir Winston Churchill whose last spell as prime minister ended in 1955, but was still attending Prime Minister’s Questions as an MP in 1964. He added: ‘Politicians love the House of Commons, they never wanted to leave it. ‘Blair seemed to have suited his purposes and then he walked out and that was a slap in the face, I think, for parliament and the British people. ‘I think people would have been perfectly prepared to accept the mistakes he made over Iraq or whatever if he’d hung around and fought his corner but to just simply remove yourself and hang out with a lot of rich people in America, that will never be forgiven.’ A spokesman for the office of Tony Blair did not respond to requests for a comment.","Novelist accuses former PM of abandoned Labour and Parliament for money .

"By . Stian Alexander . and Jack Doyle, Home Affairs Correspondent . Rastafarian inmates are being handed Bob Marley CDs, drums and shakers after their religion was officially recognised by prison chiefs. New rules mean Rastafarianism is an approved religion alongside Christianity, Islam and other major faiths. The pack has been created to ensure Rastafarian prisoners can pray together in a ‘fulsome and harmonious way’, a faith advisor said. However, the religion’s followers have been told that one common element of their religious practice is barred: they cannot smoke cannabis in jail. The Rastafarian faith was brought wider attention by the music of Bob Marley, left. Adherents of the religion see Haile Selassie, right, who was Emperor of Ethiopia between 1930 and 1974, as a divine being and worship him . The change in policy came after an unnamed inmate appealed to Nigel Newcomen, the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman. He ruled that the Prison Service was in breach of the Equality Act 2010, and said Rastafarianism, whose followers worship Haile Selassie, the former King of Ethiopia, as God and smoke cannabis as a ‘sacrament’,  should be recognised. Rastafarians are permitted four days ‘holiday’ off work in prison each year to celebrate festivals, and are given access to a ‘Rastafari Heritage Resource Pack’. The new rules were put in place in November 2013 and make Rastafarianism one of the 18 religions officially recognised within the prison service . It includes a list of ‘allowed items’ provided by the National Rastafari Chaplaincy for weekly ‘Groundation’ (Holy Day) ceremonies. Among them are a CD or DVD of Rastafari drumming, music and chanting, including reggae tracks by Bob Marley, and percussion instruments. In addition prisoners are given a small Rastafarian flag, a picture of Haile Selassie, a selection of his speeches and a copy of the King James Bible. However,  cannabis remains banned. A spokesman for The Rastafari Faith Advisors to the Prison Chaplaincy Service said: ‘This pack provides information, texts from His Majesty’s speeches... some of the best-loved reggae tracks, as well as information that sets Rastafari in the  context of black history. ‘Every detail in the pack has been double-checked to ensure that no further blocks or barriers are placed to prevent Rastafarians from meeting and giving Ises [praise] together in a fulsome and harmonious way.’ The National Offender Management Service, which runs prisons in England and Wales, recognises 18 religions. They include Paganism and Zoroastrianism, an ancient Iranian religion. At the time of the 2011 census, there were 7,906 Rastafarians in England and Wales - up from 5,000 in 2001 - making it the 14th largest recognised religion recorded by the survey. Baha'i - A religion emphasizing the spiritual unity of all humankind . Buddhism - Based on teachings attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, who is commonly known as the Buddha, meaning ""the awakened one"". Christianity - religion based on the life and oral teachings of Jesus as presented in the New Testament. Christian Science - Which states that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer . Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints - The Mormon church which considers itself as the restoration of the church founded by Jesus Christ . Hinduism - The dominant religion in the Indian subcontinent based on karma . Humanism - A religion which focuses on the value of human beings, based on rationalism . Islam - Followers of the Qur'an and teachings of Muhammad . Jainism - Indian religion which prescribes a path of non-violence . Jehovah's Witnesses - A belief based on The Bible which thinks Armageddon is imminent and the only solution is to establish God's Kingdom on earth . Judaism - The way of life of Jewish people, which follows the Torah. Paganism - . A varied strand of religious beliefs from the 'classical world', . including Shamanism and many which focus on the natural world as . 'creator'. Quakerism - The Religious Society of Friends, who believe in the New Testament . Rastafari - African-based religion worshipping Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Ethopia between 1930 and 1974 . Seventh Day Adventist Church . - Protestant Christian religion which believes in the sanctity of . Saturday, the original Sabbath of the Judeo-Christian calendar. Sikhism - A 15th century religion following Guru Granth Sahib . Spiritualism - A belief that the spirits of the dead can communicate with the living . Zoroastrianism - An ancient Iranian religion . Rastafarianism is a religion that developed in Jamaica after the coronation of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930. Followers of the religion believe Emperor Selassie is God and will lead back to Africa members of the black community who were taken away by slavery and colonialism. Emperor Salassie never saw himself as God and was not himself as Rastafarian. The belief in him as a divine being stemmed from a prophecy from Jamaican-born philosopher Marcus Garvey. He said, shortly before Selassie's coronation: 'Look to Africa where a black king shall be crowned. He shall be the Redeemer.' Rastafarians trace Selassie's lineage back to King Solomon and the Queen of Sheeba. The Book of Kings describes a visit to Solomon by the Queen and adherents of Rastafarianism believe that a child was conceived on this visit and that this child is a direct ancestor of Haile Selassie, making the Ethiopian Emperor a relation to King David and therefore Jesus. For the coronation itself, King George V was unable to attend so instead sent the Duke of Gloucester as his emissary. At the time, due to the size of the British Empire, King George was seen as the most powerful man in the world. So, when the Duke bowed to Selassie, Rastafarians took the act of deference as an indication that the new Emperor was more important than the King of England - who the Duke was representing - and therefore the most powerful man on the planet. There are more than one million Rastafarians worldwide. They see Ethiopia as their spiritual homeland and believe they are destined to return - led by Haile Selassie. Although Haile Salassie was reported to have died in 1975, some Rastafarians refused to believe this and there is still some debate within the religion as to whether he is, in fact, dead. Adherents of the faith are forbidden to cut their hair, which is why they grow dreadlocks, refrain from eating meat (especially pork), are opposed to contraception and abortion, do not drink, believe in reincarnation and smoke marijuana to increase their spiritual awareness.","Rastafarianism is now one of 18 religions recognised in prison .

"By . Jack Doyle . The killer of headmaster Philip Lawrence will be back on the streets within days after the Parole Board signed off his release from prison, the Daily Mail can reveal. The decision to release Learco Chindamo will provoke horror and come only days after the murderous attack on teacher Ann Maguire in front of her pupils on Monday. Chindamo was jailed indefinitely for knifing to death Mr Lawrence, a father of four, 18 years ago outside St George's Roman Catholic School in north west London in 1995. The teacher went to help a 13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted. Scroll down for video . Murder: Learco Chindamo (left) was jailed 18 years ago for knifing headmaster Philip Lawrence (right), 48, outside St George's Roman Catholic School north west London in 1995 . The former gang member was ordered to serve at least 12 years, but released in July 2010 after claiming he was a reformed character. He was returned to jail only months later for breaching the terms of his Parole. He has remained in prison since but today the Parole Board approved his release once again. The murder of Mr Lawrence, a 48-year-old father of four, shocked the nation in the same way as Mrs Maguire's stabbing on Monday. He was knifed to death outside St George's Roman Catholic School in north-west London in 1995 when he went to help a 13-year-old pupil who was being assaulted. A spokesman for the Parole Board said: ‘We can confirm that a three member panel of the Board has directed the release of Learco Chindamo. Stabbed: Ann Maguire, 61, was pronounced dead in hospital on Monday after she was attacked in class . ‘The decision to release is a matter for the Board, which is independent - practical arrangements for the release are a matter for the Secretary of State. We are unable to comment further on the details of this case.’ There is no right of appeal for victims against the release and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has no role in the decision. To approve the release the panel must be convinced that his being behind bars is no longer necessary to protect the public. The decision will be a blow to Mr . Lawrence’s widow Frances who spoke only yesterday about the murder of . Mrs Maguire, warning her family they face a 'cruel journey'. Only yesterday Philip Lawrence's widow, Frances Lawrence, spoke about the murder of Mrs Maguire, warning her family they face a 'cruel journey' Telling how she was still suffering from his loss, Mrs Lawrence said there were 'no words of comfort' she could give to Mrs Maguire's husband and two daughters. Yesterday Mrs Lawrence wrote on an online tribute site: 'By now perhaps I should have learned words of comfort for you, the family and community of beloved teacher, Ann Maguire. 'But I have learned only that there are no words. Instead I send all my love and prayers and my ongoing thoughts along the cruel journey which you are now forced to begin.' Today a 15-year-old boy appeared in court accused of the murder while Mrs Maguire’s widower and two daughters looked on.

"By . Lydia Warren . A mother has drowned trying to save her nine-year-old son and his friend after their inner tube was swept away by strong currents on Lake Erie. Kristen Stefan, a married stay-at-home mother who was described by friends as devoted to her son Tyler, was on vacation with the boy in Westfield, New York on Wednesday when tragedy unfolded. Her son and his eight-year-old friend Benjamin were on an inner tube in the lake around 2.30pm when high winds drew them away from the shore, police and fire officials said. Stefan, 37, swam out to help the boys, but all three were forced into a cove with cliffs. Loss: Kristen Stefan, left, has drowned trying to save her son Stefan from the water in Lake Erie while they were on vacation this week. They are pictured with her husband Todd . Her son's friend managed to climb out on to the rocks, but as Tyler tried to get out, he fell back in, CBS Pittsburgh reported. As Stefan tried to save him, she went under the water and did not resurface. 'My son said he just saw her hair disappear under the water,' Benjamin's mother, Erin Bignell, 35, told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Tyler continued to drift and was eventually spotted by Matt Ward, 22, at a nearby beach. Mr Ward, a lifeguard and experienced swimmer, saw the boy struggling and swam out 100 ft to rescue him. Ripped apart: Friends said they were not surprised she had given up her life trying to save her son Tyler . Tragic: Mrs Stefan was pronounced dead in hospital while her son was treated for hypothermia . 'I was just worried that I wasn't getting to him soon enough,' he said. 'That's all that was in my mind.' But he did reach the boy as emergency crews mobilized to help. Tyler was treated for hypothermia at a local hospital, before he was flown by helicopter to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC. He is expected to be fine, but doctors are watching him for signs of pneumonia and infection, Bignell said. Her son was not hurt. Mrs Stefan was pulled from the water but she was pronounced dead in hospital. Neighbors back home in Bethel Park, Pennsylvania said that the stay-at-home mother and devout churchgoer had been 'joined at the hip' with her son. Danger: The young friends were swept away from the shore in Lake Erie, pictured, and Mrs Stefan slipped beneath the surface when they reached a rocky alcove . 'She was just nothing but wonderful to Tyler,' neighbor Kathy Narr told CBS. Her husband Todd said on Facebook that he could not comprehend the tragedy. 'I love you all… But feel so alone, betrayed, angered, heartbroken,' he wrote, CBS reported. 'I have no words. I can't sleep and have not eaten anything since I ate the lunch Kristen made me before she took the boys swimming.' Funeral arrangements have not yet been made.","Kristen Stefan jumped into the water at Lake Erie on Wednesday after her son Tyler and his friend started slipping away from the shore .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Brussels was the butt of further mockery today after unveiling an 'official sash' for the European Parliament. The golden-tasselled cloth ribbon, emblazoned with the EU flag, was announced via an email sent to MEPs yesterday. Europhile members of the public can also buy the azure sash for an eye-watering £107. The new European sash  can be bought by members of the public for £107, but has been ridiculed by UKIP MEPs . The revelation that the EU is developing its own Parliamentary uniform, comes after UKIP MEPs turned their backs on the European anthem at the opening of the new EU Parliament. When the new parliament met in Strasbourg last week, it was officially opened with a military ceremony conducted by the Franco-German Eurocorps battle group. To Nigel Farage's fury, the battle group raised the European flag to Beethoven's Ode To Joy - the EU's official anthem. Paul Nuttall, Ukip's deputy leader, ridiculed the development. He said: 'These people are so pompous they are beyond parody. Just how silly would you feel walking about town in an official European Parliament Sash? 'I can safely say they will not become the must-have fashion item this season.' But the new European sash was defended by European officials - many of whom want to see more pomp and ceremony in Brussels. 'Why shouldn't our MEPs dress up too? This is the world's first transnational parliament and it is special,' an official told the Telegraph. An email obtained by the newspaper read: 'Please note that the design of the sash was made in agreement with the Protocol Service of the EP. In this regard, this is considered to be the official EP sash.' The official piece of clothing, made by the Mauquoy Medal Company, is available at www.epsash.eu. Nigel Farage and other UKIP MEPs turned their back as an orchestra performed the official European national anthem in the EU parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday July 1 . The development comes after Mr Farage accused MEPs of descending into 'naked militarism' by 'goosestepping' the EU flag around Brussels at the opening of the Parliament earlier this week. The UKIP leader said European leaders were ignoring growing euroscepticism across the continent by pushing ahead with 'ever closer union'. In his speech Mr Farage said the Prime Minister's humilating defeat trying to block Jean-Claude Juncker from becoming Commission President proved that Britain would not be able to renegotiate its position in the EU. He said Mr Cameron was 'whistling in the wind' because the master of Europe was Germany's Angela Merkel who was not going to give way. Mr Farage said: 'He ran into the new golden rule of EU politics which is when Mrs Merkel speaks the other member states obey.' He added: 'What have we seen in the last 24 hours? We've seen naked militarism, with the EU flag being virtually goosestepped around the yard, we've seen the European anthem.' Mr Farage's controversial speech today came after he was accused of 'shocking disrespect' for turning his back on the EU's national anthem as the European Parliament was opened in France. Mr Farage met the new Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels this week. The former Luxembourg PM said freedom of movement within the EU was not up for negotiation . But Mr Nuttall said: 'We don't recognise or respect the EU flag or anthem. They are both symbols of our servitude inside a political union which the British people reject. 'We will do everything we can in European Parliament to oppose the Federalist system which ignores our national democracy and pushes millions of people across Europe into poverty and unemployment. We stand up for our people, not the EU flag and anthem.' But Liberal Democrat MEP Catherine Bearder criticised the UKIP MEPs for their 'shocking disrespect' during the opening ceremony, describing their actions as ""rude'.","Gold tasselled cloth ribbon emblazoned with the EU flag to be worn by MEPs .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Underground heat from a supervolcano combined with high summer temperatures have melted a section of asphalt road in Yellowstone National Park, forcing the closure of some areas. The 3.3-mile-long Firehole Lake Drive was closed on Monday after the park's ever-changing thermal geology created a 'hot spot' which turned the road into 'oatmeal'. As they examined possible fixes, park . officials warned hikers to avoid the area as the . danger of stepping through solid-looking soil into boiling-hot water was . high. Thermal changes: Officials have closed Firehole Lake Drive and access to some geysers and thermal features in Yellowstone National Park after extreme heat caused the road to melt (pictured) Damage: Yellowstone National Park officials examining the melted asphalt along Firehole Lake Drive (pictured) warn visitors to take care, as the likelihood of stepping through solid-looking soil into boiling-hot water was high . 'There . are plenty of other great places to see thermal features in the park,' Yellowstone spokesman Al Nash said. 'I wouldn't risk personal injury to . see these during this temporary closure.' Yellowstone spans portions of Idaho, Montana and . Wyoming in America's north-west. The melted road is off Grand Loop Road between Old Faithful and Madison Junction in the park's Lower Geyser Basin, which takes visitors past Great Fountain Geyser, White Dome Geyser and Firehole Lake. Access to these areas has been closed. The same heat that feeds the geysers softened the pavement too much to drive on.

"Modeling agency founder Eileen Ford, who shaped a generation's standards of beauty as she built an empire and launched the careers of Candice Bergen, Lauren Hutton, Jane Fonda and countless others, has died. She was 92 and died Wednesday, according to Arielle Baran, a spokeswoman for Derris & Co., which handles public relations for Ford. Mrs Ford was known for her steely manner and great eye for talent. She demanded the highest level of professionalism from her models, putting them on strict diets and firing those with a taste for late-night revelry. Her discipline pushed Ford Model Agency to the top of its field, making multimillionaires of both Mrs Ford and her late husband, Jerry, who handled the company's business affairs. A beautiful life: Eileen Ford, seen here in 1992, died Wednesday at the age of 92 . 'I think our success came from Eileen's energy and her bluntness and, to some extent, her comfort with confrontation,' Jerry Ford told USA Today in 1997. 'A fortune teller once told her if she wasn't an agent, she should be, because all the stars pointed that way. She's always loved to tell people what to do. The typical Ford woman was tall, thin, often blond, with wide-set eyes and a long neck. Eileen Ford was known to tell hopefuls shorter than 5 foot 7 to give up their dreams. The Ford look changed remarkably little over the years, and set a standard for the industry. Today, height and a willowy build remain paramount, though Ford was disdainful of the 'waif' look - typified by British model Kate Moss - that swept the industry in the early 1990s. Model Behavior: Mrs Ford, seen here in 1977, built an empire and launched the careers of Candice Bergen, Lauren Hutton and Jane Fonda . Strictly business: Mrs Ford, seen here in 1977, pushed Ford Model Agency to the top of its field . Mrs Ford maintained that a model's . charisma was as important as her looks, and she prided herself on being . able to detect successful personalities. ''There's . a cockiness to them ... They're just going to be good and you can just . tell it,"" she told Life magazine in 1970. ""I see girls that I know - I . absolutely know - will be star models within just a matter of weeks, and . they always are.' For . high-fashion photography, she said, an ample bust was a disqualifier . because the camera adds pounds and the curves distract from the picture. 'A bosom is terribly detrimental because it cuts you all up in pieces,' she told The New York Times in 1967. 'Models are a business, and they have to treat themselves as a business,' Ford said in 1988 . Mrs Ford . often said she felt a motherly responsibility toward her models, and . often invited her youngest hires to live at her Upper East Side . apartment until they established themselves. She prohibited the young . Kim Basinger from going out before finishing her French homework. And . supermodel-to-be Christy Turlington once recalled pretending to do . laundry at night so she could sneak out while the family slept. 'Models . are a business, and they have to treat themselves as a business,' Ford . told The Toronto Star in 1988. ""Which means they have to take care of . themselves and give up all the young joys.' The . Ford agency continued to grow in the 1970s, when it began representing . children, including a young Brooke Shields, and men. By then, Christie . Brinkley, Jane Fonda, Ali MacGraw, Candice Bergen, Beverly Johnson and . Suzy Parker had all been on the Ford roster. John . Casablancas provided stiff competition for the Ford agency when he . founded rival Elite in the 1970s. He became known for wooing talent from . other agencies - resulting in lawsuits - and stressing a more sensual, . European look. Blond ambition: Ford Model Agency represented Candice Bergen, pictured in 1969 . Eileen Ford . was born Eileen Otte in New York City in 1922 and grew up in the leafy . Long Island suburb of Great Neck, N.Y. She had a psychology degree from . Barnard College and modeled occasionally as a student. After graduating, . she helped several friends book modeling jobs, and founded the agency . in 1946 with her husband. As . the agency's success grew, Mrs Ford established herself as something of a . brand. She began publishing books about beauty and fashion, including Eileen Ford's A More Beautiful You in 21 Days (1972) and Eileen . Ford's Beauty Now and Forever: Secrets of Beauty After 35 (1977). Strike a pose: Mrs Ford also launched the modeling career of Jane Fonda, seen here in 1959 . About face: Lauren Hutton, seen here in 1973, was another Ford model . She . also wrote a syndicated newspaper column, Eileen Ford's Model Beauty, . in the 1970s. The agency began a competition, eventually called the . Supermodel of the World contest, in 1980. Some . 60,000 people a year turned out for the agency's weekly open houses in . Soho - where the agency is based - and on Mrs Ford's scouting expeditions . around the country. About 100 a year made it to the testing stage; of . those, she estimated about 30 established a foothold in the business. The . agency's revenues topped $40 million a year by the 1990s, as Eileen and . Jerry Ford began to take a less active role.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Most people probably would like to assume that if they were awoken at 6:30 in the morning by a drunk, naked stranger in their bedroom - who'd just smeared his own feces throughout their house and tried to flood their kitchen - that the intoxicated intruder would be arrested when police ultimately show up. That, however, was not the case for a couple in Kuma, Idaho, who say that exact scenario played out in their home earlier this month - in their case, they say responding officers didn't arrest the drunken poop-smearer, they only cited him for a misdemeanor and let him go home. As if that wasn't enough, homeowners Tricia and Jake Gillaspy had just moved into the home a week prior to the alleged fecal-artist's predawn intrusion. Shocked: Tricia and Jake Gillaspy were stunned to find Matthew Coomes naked in their bedroom at 6:30 am . Crappy situation: After chasing Coomes out of the house at gunpoint, the couple found feces ground into their carpet . The incident occurred in the early hours of June 15 - Father's Day - when the Gillaspys awoke to find the drunken man standing in their bedroom at 6:30 a.m. 'My husband's like, ""What the heck is going on?"" And, I'm screaming in utter panic,' Tricia Gillaspy tells KTVB. The intruder, later identified as 25-year-old Matthew Coomes, had clearly been drinking. The couple says that after a naked Coomes had woken them up, he tried to run into another room and put some clothes on. 'My husband grabs the gun because we have no idea who this guy is,' said . Tricia. 'He's like, ""Get out of my house, now!"" But the guy wouldn't . leave. So, he puts the gun to his head, and says, ""I said, get out!' '[Jake Gillaspy called 9-1-1 and] He's like, ""There's a guy in my house. I'm going to shoot him, you better get a cop here now,'"" she said. Art? The Gillaspys say they found feces smeared all over their walls and appliances . Feces: Coomes allegedly took aim at the couple's oven after smearing feces on the walls . Coomes eventually left the house, but remained on the couple's property until police arrived. That's when the couple discovered what Coomes allegedly had been doing prior to his waking them up. 'He took this sink sprayer out and this drawer was in there. He put it . in the drawer, turned it on full blast hot water, it filled that entire . drawer full. It flooded my entire kitchen,' said Tricia. 'He craps on my . floor, and he must have been playing in it because he streaked it down . the side of my walls. The stain is gone finally, thank goodness.' When police arrived, rather than arrest the drunk, naked man who had just terrified an innocent couple, the responding officers cited Coomes for the misdemeanors and took him back to his house. 'I go running out the door, and am like, ""What are you doing!?"" I'm like, 'This guy deserves to go to jail!'"" Gillaspy said. Tricia says she later learned that the damage allegedly caused by Coomes cost more than $5,000 to repair. In the following days, Tricia received a call from a Kuna Police sergeant who told her the officers should have arrested Coomes on the spot. Flood: The couple says Coomes used their sink sprayer to flood the drawers in their kitchen . Gross: Not factoring in grossness, the couple says the damage cost more than $5,000 to repair . The Kuna Police Department says it is conducting an internal investigation into why Coomes was not arrested the morning of the incident. Additionally, prosecutors have since filed felony charges against Coomes for malicious injury to property for the extensive - and expensive - damage he did to the home. Investigators say it appears Coones entered the home through an unlocked backdoor. He later told police that he didn't remember going into the home or using the sprayer in the kitchen. Additionally, he says he also doesn't recall how his feces ended up on the Gillaspys carpet and how his underwear ended up on their floor.","Tricia and Jake Gillaspy say they woke up to find a naked Matthew Coomes standing in their bedroom at 6:30 a.m.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Frustrated residents in a remote village finally have superfast broadband – after they dug trenches and laid new cables themselves. Locals in Dolphinholme, Lancashire, had repeatedly asked internet provider BT to wire them up to the new superfast cable, since it took them several minutes to load a single webpage. But BT refused because of the village’s remoteness and the cost. So volunteers laid new cables themselves to connect the village of around 50 homes to a superfast network, provided by independent firm Broadband 4 Rural North (B4RN). Residents of Dolphinholme, Lancashire (above), repeatedly asked internet provider BT to wire them up to the new superfast cable but took the matter into their own hands when the internet provider refused to help . They now have one of the fastest networks in the UK. Allen Norris, of the Dolphinholme B4RN Action Group, it was 'life changing' to the village. He said: ‘It’s no exaggeration to say that having hyper-speed broadband is a life-changing event. 'Previously, we were getting speeds of . around one megabit meaning it could take six or seven hours to download a . simple smartphone software update and minutes to load a webpage. Now it takes seconds. 'Daily activities that many people take for granted ... are only now a reality for residents in Dolphinholme.’ Volunteer Liz Collinson said it was tough but they managed to have fun while they were digging the trenches. She said: 'It's been very, very hard especially in the winter when it was very muddy and you were up to your knees and trying to dig and you couldn't get the mud off your spade.' Tiny Dolphinholme - two-and-a-half miles . from the M6 motorway - only boasts one pub, a village hall, two . chapels, a garage, a tennis court and a bowling green. B4RN . Action Group was launched in 2011 when villagers realised they would be . unlikely to see superfast broadband from the state-funded network, . managed by Lancashire county council and provided by BT. Residents in Dolphinholme, Lancashire now have one of the fastest networks in the UK . Superfast broadband is defined by the European Union as broadband with speeds of 24Mbps (megabits per second) or above. A survey conducted by insurance firm NFU Mutual in March suggested one in five rural families have poor broadband links and families said it was affecting their children's education. The first homes, in the hamlet of Quernmore, Lancashire, were connected in 2012 and nearby Arkholme-with-Cawood was next. Raising its own funding without government help, B4RN enlisted farmers and other local residents to dig its FTTP (fibre to the premises) network, providing 1Gbps broadband, plus phone and TV, to the most remote locations. By contrast, the BT and council scheme can only deliver up to 76Mbps within a kilometre of its central hub cabinets, and promises only a minimum of 2Mbps in rural areas. A spokesman for B4RN praised the locals for making the superfast broadband dream for their village happen. He added: 'The Dolphinholme B4RN Action Group was dedicated to completing this project, which means bringing the service to all those in Dolphinholme who want it.'","Residents of Dolphinholme, Lancashire laid internet cables themselves .

"By . Ian Drury . Flying remote-controlled model planes might seem a harmless pastime, enjoyed in parks across the country. But police fear some of those practising the hobby could be terrorists training for an attack. An army of model aircraft enthusiasts has been enlisted to help root out anyone using the activity as cover for sinister plots. Cover up? The British Model Flying Association has been asked to look out for members using the hobby as a front for plotting sinister crimes . Counter-terror officers have spoken to the British Model Flying Association to urge its 36,000 members to look out for suspicious behaviour while enjoying their hobby in public spaces. Security chiefs are concerned extremists will use remote-controlled aircraft packed with explosives to attack buildings, causing death and destruction. Model planes can also be fitted with cheap digital cameras to record video footage as they fly past – potentially providing terrorists with invaluable intelligence. The alert follows a meeting between the Special Branch Counter-Terrorism Unit and officials from the British Model Flying Association (BMFA), the national governing body for model aircraft buffs, which dates back to 1922. The organisation agreed to ask its members to ‘increase vigilance for any signs of potential criminal or terrorist activity arising from the use of model aircraft’. An article in the BMFA News, the association’s magazine, said: ‘This is part of regional and national initiatives introduced by the Counter-Terrorism Unit aimed at gaining enhanced vigilance from those involved in all aspects of aviation.’ Dave Phipps, chief executive of the BMFA, which is based in Leicester, said: ‘We want members to come to us if they have any concerns about anyone they see with a model plane who does not seem quite right, if they ring any alarm bells. ‘Some of the people involved in  the September 11 attacks had trained on aircraft simulators which rang some alarm bells, but no one said anything.’ In Germany, police raids have foiled plots to use planes large enough to carry explosive to destroy buildings, while in London model planes were banned from the skies during the Olympics (file picture) Anti-terror officers believe there is a real threat from rogue model aircraft flyers. Last year, police in Germany foiled an Islamist terror plot intending to use remote-controlled model planes filled with explosives flown into targets. In June 2013, armed officers from the specialist G9G units raided homes in Stuttgart, Munich and Dachau after receiving information that at least one assassination attempt was being planned using the model aircraft as guided missiles. Prosecutors said the arrests were linked to a plot centred on Islamist ‘holy war’. It was reported that model aircraft, some of which are powerful and big enough to carry explosives capable of destroying a commercial building, were seized in the swoop. And in 2012, an American man was jailed for 17 years for plotting to fly model planes carrying explosives into the Pentagon and the US Capitol in Washington. Spanish police have also released a video allegedly showing Al Qaeda members training for a bombing raid using a miniature plane. Model aircraft were banned from the skies over London as part of the security crackdown during the Olympics. Counter-terror chiefs feared extremists could use remote-controlled drones to launch attacks on packed sporting venues. Under restrictions aimed at foiling a terror attack, enthusiasts were  not allowed to operate remote-controlled aeroplanes and helicopters weighing more than 7kg over  the capital.","Officers have asked model plane enthusiasts to look out for plotters .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The failure to teach youngsters a trade has led to the end of the artisan class and forced companies to fill jobs with foreign workers, business experts  have said. Nick Hewer and Margaret Mountford – who appeared alongside Lord Sugar on The Apprentice – claim young British adults have a sense of entitlement and are lacking in work ethic, hampering their chances of finding employment. Speaking ahead of a documentary on migrant workers that will be broadcast next week, Miss Mountford, 62, said: ‘There’s nothing unlawful about employing people at £11 an hour rather than £15 if you can get them. Entitled: Nick Hewer and Margaret Mountford - who appeared alongside on The Apprentice - claim young British adults have a sense of entitlement and are lacking in work ethic, hampering their chances of finding a job . ‘But is it wrong to be British and to have a sense of entitlement? We have decided as a nation that 50 per cent should go to university and look down on trade qualifications, and it’s better to go and get a media studies degree that doesn’t get you a job than to go and learn a trade – whereas in Germany, it’s as hard to get into technical colleges as it is to get into the good universities.’ Mr Hewer, who now presents Channel 4’s Countdown, claimed the demise of the artisan class had left Britain ‘teeming with bodgers’. He said: ‘I think the artisan who exists in Europe doesn’t exist in this country. ‘Now anybody who loses their job buys a Mitsubishi Warrior with lots of chrome and is suddenly a plumber. ‘The truth of the matter is that the country is teeming with bodgers because nobody gets trained. ‘The old apprenticeships have gone and people think, “I think I’ll do a bit of plastering and bricklaying”. So nobody is actually trained. Lack of incentive: Mr Hewer said that the old apprenticeships have gone - leaving bricklayers and builders without proper training . ‘The artisan class in Europe still exists. I don’t think that in Germany, Spain or France they have programmes called Rogue Traders and Rogue Builders where you call in plumbers and builders and they just rip you off. ‘It’s a bit of a British tragedy, and I don’t think it exists in other countries where trade is a good thing.’ The comments come days after the Government’s Migration Advisory Committee warned that too many school-leavers lack even the basic abilities to ‘look people in the eye and get out of bed’. The immigration panel claimed British students are given little incentive to work by the benefits system. As a result, businesses have had to turn to workers from overseas who are better qualified, more reliable, confident and – unlike their native competitors – have the good manners needed to deal with customers. Mr Hewer said Polish migrants ‘have the guts, the energy, the initiative and are prepared to slog it out in another country in a different language ... inevitably, they are going to be more driven’. He added: ‘The fact that they slammed their front door in Vilnius and hacked their way across Europe to a foreign country shows that these are people with initiative, drive and ambition.’ He will appear in the BBC show Nick and Margaret: Too Many Immigrants?, which pairs UK-born citizens with five London-based immigrants from all over the world to explore their impact  on Britain.","Failure to teach youngsters a trade forces companies to hire foreign workers .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The manager of a GPs’ practice who stole more than £158,000 from the firm has been jailed for nearly three years. John Pepper, 62, used the money for foreign holidays, a new car and a £5,250 model railway. During an eight-year period, he also amassed £20,000 of savings and investments, Isle of Wight Crown Court heard. Theft: John Pepper, 62, used the money he stole from his Newport, Isle of Wight surgey for foreign holidays, a new car and a £5,250 model railway (file picture) His thefts started in August 2005 – a year after he began work as the £30,000-a-year manager at Dower House Surgery, Newport – and continued using the practice’s bank card to withdraw cash until a colleague noticed last September. During that period, Pepper, with a previously unblemished record, used the practice’s bank card to withdraw cash and he disguised the transactions by falsifying invoices to make the books balance, said Christopher Stopa, prosecuting. In all, he stole £158,340 over the eight months he had been offending, which began with small amounts, but escalated to larger sums year on year thereafter. Pepper told the police he had been heavily in debt, around £50,000, and that he was glad he had been caught. Judge Susan Evans sentenced Pepper to two years and eight months in jail and ordered him to repay the money or face another two years.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who has helped expose claims paedophiles were operating in Westminster in past decades, renewed his call for her to step down as chairman of the new inquiry. Her appointment has already come under fire as she is the brother-in-law of Sir Michael Havers, a former Attorney General in the 1980s – when the abuse is alleged to have taken place. Her comments were reportedly made in 2011 during a meeting at the House of Lords with Phil Johnson, who suffered assaults by a number of clergymen when he was a choirboy in the Church of England Diocese of Chichester. Baroness Butler-Sloss had been put in charge of an investigation into how the Church handled the abuse allegations. She allegedly told Mr Johnson if she included the claims about the bishop in her report they’d ‘take the news’. Mr Danczuk said: ‘She gives the impression that she is putting the reputation of the Church before the interests of victims.’ Baroness Butler-Sloss told The Times: ‘I have always striven to be fair and compassionate, mindful of the very real suffering of those who have been victims of crime or other injustice. 'I have never put the reputation of any institution, including the Church of England, above the pursuit of justice for victims.

"By . Sophie Borland, Health Correspondent . Barbara Young, chief executive of the charity Diabetes UK has criticised plans to offer free weight loss surgery . Plans to offer free weight-loss surgery to almost one million adults are nonsense, experts said last night. In guidelines issued this week, the NHS watchdog NICE said patients who are obese and have type 2 diabetes should be considered for gastric band or bypass operations. Up to 900,000 patients meet the criteria and it would cost £4.5billion if all wanted bariatric surgery, which includes gastric bands  to constrict the stomach and bypasses that reroute the digestive system. NICE claims the surgery helps patients with type 2 diabetes lose weight and control the disease. But experts said the NHS could not afford to pay for all the procedures and patients would do better to diet and get more exercise. There are also concerns that the obese will give up trying to lose weight because they know they can have free surgery instead. Baroness Barbara Young, chief executive of the charity Diabetes UK, said: ‘The idea that we’d all, or a significant proportion of us, go and have an operation as part of a programme seems to me to be a sign of failure. ‘Give me the £5,000 you’d spend on an operation and put it into a weight-reduction program and we could win. The more important thing is that people who head for obesity get effective interventions long before they fall into criteria that would justify surgery.’ James Halstead, a bariatric surgeon at Leeds hospital, said: ‘Expecting the UK to have the provision to operate on nearly a million people is an unrealistic proposition. The majority of people, their degree of obesity will be corrected by exercise alone.’ Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme, he added: ‘The idea that the NHS could deal with 900,000 extra patients with this alone is nonsensical.’ About 2.6million Britons have type 2 diabetes, and up to a third of adults have prediabetes, a precursor to the illness. There are also concerns that the obese will give up trying to lose weight because they know they can have free surgery instead . Diabetes costs the NHS £14billion a year, much of which spent treating debilitating complications such as blindness, strokes, kidney failure and amputations. NICE says evidence shows bariatric surgery helps patients control their diabetes and in some cases effectively cures them. Gastric bands cost at least £5,000 and gastric bypasses cost £9,500 or more. Last year 8,024 operations were carried out. Both reduce the size of the stomach, which causes patients to lose their appetite. At the moment, the NHS only offers them to morbidly obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or more – equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman of 20 stone. BMI is based on height and weight. The obese are those with a score higher than 30. The new guidelines propose offering surgery to anyone with type 2 diabetes and a BMI of at least 30 – equivalent to a 5ft 6in woman weighing 15st 10lb. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘A considerable number of people who have had diabetes for some time and have been receiving medication will see a way out and they’ll say, “That’s for me”. But the Health Service is going to say, “No, we’re out of money, you can’t have it”, and that’s going to create friction.’ Professor Mark Baker, of NICE, said: ‘The mainstay of weight reduction continues to be diet and exercise. But some people, whose lives are threatened by diabetes, can be transformed if they are offered surgery earlier than current guidance would allow.’","Experts say NHS cannot afford to pay for all of the weight-loss procedures .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Former minister Michael Mates has received ‘substantial damages’ from the Crown Prosecution Service after it wrongly accused him of breaking election law. He also received a public apology from the CPS and the police, who confirmed he was cleared of any offence during his bid to become Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. It was claimed the former Tory MP, 80, had broken the rules by using a flat in Winchester as his address so that he could take part in the contest in 2012. Former minister Michael Mates has received 'substantial damages' from the Crown Prosecution Service after it wrongly accused him of breaking election law . He eventually failed to be elected to the £80,000-a-year position by just under 15,000 votes. After a police investigation, the CPS said it would not be in the public interest to launch a prosecution even though a conviction was ‘a realistic possibility’. But it has admitted the comments were wrong and that Mr Mates, who offered to go to court to clear his name, was innocent. Yesterday, it apologised ‘for any distress and embarrassment caused’. In a statement, it said: 'In October 2013, the CPS considered allegations that Michael Mates, a candidate in the election for Police and Crime Commissioner for Hampshire, had committed an offence under section 21 of The Police and Crime Commissioner Elections Order 2012. Yesterday, CPS apologised 'for any distress and embarrassment caused' 'The CPS decided at that time that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction but that no charges should be brought as a prosecution would not be in the public interest. 'The CPS made a statement in October 2013, explaining its decision not to prosecute Mr Mates. 'Following a complaint made by Mr Mates, the CPS carried out a review of this decision and it has concluded that it had been wrong to determine that there was sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction. 'The CPS has apologised to Mr Mates for any distress and embarrassment that its wrong decision and public statement in October 2013 caused. 'The CPS of course accepts that Mr Mates committed no offence.' Mr Mates' lawyers at Carter-Ruck confirmed Mr Mates had also received 'substantial damages' from the CPS. Hampshire Police's chief constable Andy Marsh has also apologised. He said: 'If the investigation has caused Mr Mates professional or personal embarrassment or other personal difficulties then this clearly was not the intention of the police and, for that, I apologise. 'Furthermore, I acknowledge and accept the statement of the CPS that Mr Mates is innocent of any offence.' Mr Mates said several attempts to appeal the allegations were dismissed in what he described as a 'most upsetting experience'. He said: 'What has been a nightmare for my wife and myself for more than 18 months is now over. 'We had to endure the ordeal of interviews under criminal caution because of the allegations. 'We have endured endless delays while the various authorities kept us completely in the dark as to what was going on. 'I have been through six or seven appeal processes, all of which dismissed my assertions that I had done nothing wrong. 'It was only when, at my own expense, I instructed lawyers to challenge the Crown Prosecution Service that they caved in and admitted that they had been wrong all along. 'I have been able finally to achieve a just outcome for myself only because of my knowledge and experience of the system. 'I have grave doubts that an ordinary citizen who has not had such a background would have been able to successfully challenge wrongdoing by the authorities without access to potentially expensive litigation. 'This is not the way our justice system should work.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman will tonight claim Gordon Brown sidelined her because she was a woman. In a speech on sexism in Westminster she will claim that a man would not have 'put up' with not being made deputy prime minister after she won the battle to be Labour's number two in 2007. She will also reveal how Mr Brown relegated her to a dinner for leaders' wives at a major summit. Gordon Brown, pictured at the Labour party conference in 2009, appears to have angered Labour's deputy leader Harriet Harman by not making her Deputy Prime Minister . But the claims were immediately dismissed as 'utter bilge' by Mr Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride, who suggested the Labour deputy leader was 'useless'. Ms Harman was elected as the party's deputy leader in 2007, the same year Mr Brown became prime minister. Although she will not name him directly, Ms Harman is expected to say that 'even getting to the top is no guarantee of equality'. She is expected to say: 'Imagine my surprise when having won a hard-fought election to succeed John Prescott as deputy leader of the Labour Party, I discovered that I was not to succeed him as Deputy Prime Minister. 'If one of the men had won the deputy leadership would that have happened? Would they have put up with it? I doubt it. Mr Brown's former spin doctor Damian McBride dismissed Miss Harman's claims as 'utter bilge' 'And imagine the consternation in my office when we discovered that my involvement in the London G20 summit was inclusion at the No 10 dinner for the G20 leaders' wives. 'We must remember Caroline Flint's denunciation of women being used as ""window dressing"".' Ms Harman is renowned for campaigning on gender equality, work that has seen her labelled Harriet Harperson by some. She is expected to tell how she was told to fit in by being 'clubbable' in the bars of Westminster but her refusal to tow the line led to an 'often nasty' response. Mr McBride was quick to respond to the claims that Ms Harman had missed out because of her gender, insisting Mr Brown only judged his team on whether they were 'useless or not'. He insisted that former business minister Baroness Vadera had been given a 'vital role' at the London G20 summit in 2009. 'As every man and woman who ever worked for him could attest, Gordon judged people on only one thing: were they useless or not,' he said on Twitter. 'Shriti Vadera was given a crucial role to play at the G20 not cos of her position but cos she could make a crucial contribution whereas someone like me had no contribution to make to the summit so I was put in charge of media for the spouses. I am a man. 'It's utter bilge from Harriet, done to make her attack on Dave look non-partisan. And shameful timing given the work GB is doing in Nigeria. 'That dinner was a gathering of Britain's leading women across all walks of life, of which I thought she'd count herself one.'","Labour's deputy leader says a man would not have 'put up' with snub .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . London's commuters are well known to be a hard-nosed bunch. And this video perhaps proves that theory - as even a man dancing wildly to techno doesn't seem to rouse these commuters on the packed Underground. In hilarious footage, the gentleman - thought to be called Nathan - jumps around, throws his arms in the air and even does the robot on a central London platform to the dance track Sandstorm by Darude. Scroll down for video . Surprised - and often bemused - commuters watch on as a man, thought to be called Nathan, dances outrageously to techno on the London Underground . Despite his smooth moves to dance track Sandstorm by Darude, many of those waiting for a train just ignore the man (pictured) - instead looking straight ahead in a bid to avoid him . His moves certainly gain some strange looks - but few even crack a smile let alone join him in his performance. At one point, two alarmed looking women and a man tentatively make their way past the dancer - attempting not to look directly at him as they pass. Another woman then stares at the man as he moves past her before rapidly turning her attention back to her newspaper. One man, wearing a pair of large headphones, completely ignores all the action as it takes place next to him - instead focusing on the tube tracks ahead. The footage later shows the man flailing around outside Oxford Circus tube station. There, commuters made a point of moving out of the man's way - keeping quiet a distance between themselves and the dancer as they trudge past him. At one point, the footage shows three teenagers glaring at the man before making their way in to the station. The man continues to strut his stuff up and down the station, despite many commuters glaring at him . Later, the man can be seen dancing outside Oxford Circus tube station (pictured) - where shoppers look equally unimpressed with the dancer's moves . The dancer later takes to the lift to show off his moves - much to the evident disdain of one main (bottom left) who looks terrified at the man's moves . Later in the video, which has gained over 20,000 views since it was posted online two days ago, the man can be seen dancing in a lift. There, one man looks terrified at the man's impressive moves - scratching his chin and occasionally looking tentatively into the camera lens. The video was filmed and posted by Trollstation Vlogs. Many viewers have reacted to the footage - which was posted on YouTube by the site. Rikkerry25 said: 'All these people are lame as f***. It just goes to show you how so many people get so caught up in the daily grind that they forget to have fun and do something out of the ordinary.﻿' Another, Sebastian Strnad, wrote: 'Would of joined in but that's just me.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A developer has created code that makes it possible for Google Glass wearers to pilot drones using the slightest of head movements. Blaine Bublitz, from coding company, IcedDev developed the app for an annual event called Nodebots Day, which is for fans of robots controlled by a JavaScript program called node.js. He developed the code to work with wheeled robots moving back and forth before adapting it to add right and left movements, as well as up and down, specifically to be used with a NodeCopter. Scroll down for video . Blaine Bublitz, pictured right, is shown flying the NodeCopter, seen in the bottom left-hand corner, using his Google Glass device. Bublitz used JavaScript to create the code that responds to his head movements to make the drone move left or right . Festival-goers in South Africa this summer will be able to order beer from their smartphones and have it delivered by a flying drone dropping a can attached to a parachute. The drone has been developed by Darkwing Aerials and was tested at the Oppikoppi music festival in the Limpopo province of South Africa this August. Customers will be able to place their drink orders through an iOS app that will send their GPS coordinates to the drone operators. On his blog, Bublitz explained that he began by creating code that controlled wheeled robots on a table top, before adding left and right steering using a palm-controlled device. However, he couldn't see what he was looking at as he moved his head so wanted to control a robot that could be steered and seen from at least eye height. During a video demonstration, Bublitz, from Phoenix, explained that he developed the code using the Face app that was unveiled during a talk at the event in Portland. The app can send sensor information -- the data needed to fly the drone that is usually sent to the device using a joystick or remote control - to a web server which then rebroadcasts it. This new broadcast can then be picked up and used by the Google Glass headset. In the video Bublitz adds that he's used pitch and roll movements but could also add a rotation option. Landing and take off was controlled using an A and B button on the Google Glass. He said: 'With JavaScript, we are able to write a . relatively small amount of code that can serve as a basis for swappable . hardware components. 'Turns out that I was driving the drone at full speed in each direction I tilted my head. 'I should have had the speed at about 0.3 instead of 1. Lesson learned. Bublitz developed the app for an annual event called Nodebots Day, which is for fans of robots controlled by a JavaScript program called node.js. He developed the code to work with wheeled robots moving back and forth before adapting it to add right and left movements specifically to be used with a NodeCopter, pictured . 'I would have also liked to add the ability to rotate the drone left and right based on the Glass' azimuth value, but I guess that will have to be in the future.' Bublitz has now put the coding details on his blog to make it possible for other developers to adapt their Google Glass devices to be able to control NodeCopters. In May, a Jetstream aircraft has become the first to fly 'unmanned' across UK shared airspace. The pioneering flight, largely controlled by a pilot on the ground, took off from Warton, near Preston in Lancashire, and landed in Inverness. Described as 'a new chapter in aviation history,' it could pave the way for passenger planes controlled from the ground by 'drone' operators.

"By . John Drayton . Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari should keep his job because of the good work he did during his 19 months in charge, the president-elect of the Brazilian Football Confederation has argued (CBF). The Selecao were humiliated 7-1 in the World Cup semi-final by Germany to be eliminated from a tournament hosted in their own country but Scolari should not be sacked according to Marco Polo Del Nero. 'To me, he stays,' Del Nero told the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper. Right man for the job?

'What happened was a tactical error. That was the problem. But we all make mistakes. It can happen to anyone. 'The important thing is that he did a good job. The campaign and the preparations were good. A base exists.' It was the first time Del Nero or Jose Maria Marin, the man he will replace as head of the CBF next April, have spoken about the historic defeat. Scolari, who led Brazil to their fifth World Cup title in 2002, has not revealed his long term plans. He will lead Brazil in Saturday's third place play-off match against Holland. The former Chelsea and Portugal manager has lost just three times in 28 matches since taking over in November 2012.

"By . Paul Hirst, Press Association . Per Mertesacker thinks Germany will lose the World Cup final if they do not perform to the exact same standard as they did against Brazil. Germany pulled off one of the biggest shocks in the history of football when they hammered Brazil 7-1 in the semi-finals last week. The comprehensive nature of the win means Germany will go into Sunday's final against Argentina as big favourites, but Mertesacker has warned against the idea that Germany should already be regarded as world champions before the first whistle. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Philipp Lahm and Thomas Muller talk ahead of the final . Final chance: Per Mertesacker is aiming to win the World Cup with Germany . Get it right: Mertesacker says Germany have to be at their best . 'We must stay focused and play the same way that we did against Brazil, otherwise we have no chance,' the Germany defender said.

Team-mates: Mertesacker and Arsenal teammate Laurent Koscielny after the semi-final . The streets of Germany were packed with jubilant fans who had stayed up to watch Joachim Low's team rip the hosts apart with a ruthless attacking display on Tuesday. Mertesacker wants the memories of that night in Belo Horizonte to be put to the back of his team-mates' minds by Sunday though. '(Winning 7-1) is dangerous for us,' the Arsenal centre-back said. 'We can't lose our focus now because we scored seven goals. 'We must keep calm and be aware of the situation. Our main target is to win the final. 'We want to finish on a high. 'We want more history. We don't want to just settle for this result before the final.'","Per Mertesacker says Germany will lose if they let their standards slip .

"By . Rex Features . Six years ago Dave Tomkins found himself watching a situation we all dread, as his beloved grandpa who could no longer live alone, moved into a retirement home. While helping to pack up his home, he uncovered a box full of extraordinary photos his grandfather Stephen Clarke had taken throughout his life. Dave, who is originally from Sydney, took the images to show his grandfather, but sadly he could not remember much about them or where they were taken. What made the discovery more interesting was that his grandfather had never mentioned his passion for photography, or many of his trips abroad. 'I was hoping to make him a book or something. Something to give him more to talk about, more to think about in that home other than catheter bags and test results. It worked for a while but he never really believed that the photos were that good. He thought I was just being nice.' From that moment Dave's project began; he knew he had to show his beloved grandpa how good the photos were, and help him remember the stories behind them.  Eager to find out more about the photos and make his grandpa believe in his talent, he decided to reach out to the world for help. The 34-year-old art director, who has worked at Mother advertising agency in New York, used his creative side to put together a website.  While he could recognise some of the locations instantly, including his Grandpa's stunning shot of the New York skyline, a few of the photos were harder to place. He called on the public to help him narrow down and locate the whereabouts of the images, and his idea proved to be an overwhelming success. Thousands of people flocked to help him discover where the photos were taken, helping Dave piece his grandfather's history together. With the help of hundreds of responses on the website, he was able to track down most of the photos locations. The striking photos were taken in Barcelona, Venice, Lisbon, Australia and all over Switzerland. Taken in the San Paulo area, Venice, Italy - the Ristorante Pilsen is now a Hard Rock Cafe . New York's JFK Airport. The Eero Saarinen building. 'Taken from a pedestrian walkway. Many people on Grandpa's Photos helped find this one,' Dave said . Mountain view: Taken outside the train station at Interlaken West in Switzerland . Stephen Clarke looking very dapper in his ala James Bond style suit at his home in Brisbane . The hustle and bustle outside the entrance to the Empire state building on 5th Avenue looking South towards 33rd street in New York . Dave is not too sure where this photo was taken but the best guess on grandpasphotos.com is Piazza Cisterna in San Gimignano, Italy. He's hoping to find this one on his trip . From a rooftop looking down onto a ferris wheel and a roller coaster at an amusement park at Tibadabo, Barcelona, in Spain . Not long after Dave moved to New York after that to chase 'the big job' as an Art Director in Advertising. 'I had been talking about Grandpa's photos for way too long and one of the agencies I worked at even put them into an exhibition. I was able to go home and tell Grandpa he was in an 'Exhibition in New York City'. (That's a really big deal in Australia). 'That blew his mind. Everyone within a 5 mile radius (his scooter range) of the nursing home knew all about it. It was working, he wasn't talking about urinary tract infections and how bleak the home was.' He says some of his favourite photos include one of his grandmother relaxing on the beach in Australia, and another where his grandfather is head of the table enjoying a meal with family. 'Most of the family ones are great to me as I get to see family in scenarios I've never seen them in. Happy smiling shots of youth, bright colours and always happy times. Not one single hospital bed, waiting room or nursing home' Also the one where my Dad is in the photos it's pretty obvious he was around at the Family in-laws for dinner. They got divorced when I was 2 so these are weird and funny and my Dad looks hilarious.' Picture perfect: A photo of Bern in Switzerland which is as idyllic as a postcard . The misty atmosphere at Interlaken West railway train station in Switzerland . 'This was taken in Zurich, Switzerland. Probably taken out of a cab driving over a short bridge called the Landesmuseum. The bridge in the photo is called 'Bahnhofbr¸cke'- I had no idea where this was until putting up the site,' Dave said . 'Not sure where this was taken. Seems to be that Grandpa travelled down overland from Interlaken to northern Italy. It has been suggested that this is possibly The Piemont not far from the alps,' Dave says . Catch of the day: Dave thinks this photograph was probably taken on a fishing trip that his Grandfather was on more than likely off the coast of Brisbane in Australia . Sadly his Grandfather has since passed away, but Dave is determined to keep his memory alive through celebrating his photos. He explains that the striking photographs are not only a way to keep Stephen' memory alive, but also an insight into parts of his life he never knew. The art director who has been living in New York for the last four years, recently decided to pack up his bags and head home to Australia wanting to be closer to family. However he thought of a much more interesting and scenic route home. Instead of paying an extravagant airfare to fly straight to Australia, the creative thinker decided to get a much more reasonably priced flight to Stockholm. After Stockholm Dave is headed to Dublin to see family and not one to miss out on an opportunity, he is going to visit all of the places where his beloved grandfather took his photos. 'I think the next generation will have a different experience because we take photos of everything. Most people in 20 years will be able to see what their parents ate on any given Tuesday, in-between lunch and dinner.' 'I'm not sure how it will be. But it's great to think that photos I take on this trip will be around for my future kids to see and especially for my Mum, Grandpa's Daughter now.' 'The aim is to get as many people as possible to appreciate Grandpa's Photos even if he isn't here anymore. Somehow it almost feels like he is alive for a tiny bit longer. I know that sounds weird but talking about him so much and looking at his photos is somehow like having him around. Maybe just not forgetting him I guess.' The 25 de Abril bridge in Lisbon, Portugal. At the time it may have been called Salazar's Bridge . A canal possibly near Interlaken West train Station in Switzerland and looks as though it has been taken through  the window of a train or bus . 'This is my Grandma, June Clarke on the beach. Probably in Brisbane, Australia. I can't work out what she's reading. Such a great shot, typical of Australian life in Summer,' Dave says . Dave is not 100 per cent sure where this was taken but he guesses it is in Switzerland and it has been suggested on the website that it is somewhere along the Axenstrasse - a river in Switzerland . Taken from the top of The Empire State Building in New York looking out across the Big Apple in a westerly direction . Numerous people from thee website are quite certain this was taken in an alley way in Florence, Italy .

"By . David Kent . Luiz Felipe Scolari has challenged his Brazil players to restore some pride to the nation by ending the World Cup with a victory in the third-place play-off. Brazil take on Holland in Brasilia aware that a second successive defeat would only increase public anger following Tuesday’s humiliating 7-1 semi-final defeat against Germany. Unsurprisingly, Scolari has taken the brunt of the criticism and is desperate to end the tournament — and most  probably his reign as coach — with a consoling victory. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Thiago Silva say Brazil's honour and dignity is at stake . Morale boost: Luiz Felipe Scolari wants Brazil to end their 2014 World Cup campaign with a win against Holland . Tough gig: Scolari faces a hard task lifting his Brazil troops after their 7-1 defeat to Germany . ‘I know it’s a much smaller dream that we all wanted, but we have to honour the shirt of the national team,’ said the 65-year-old. Scolari will meet with officials from the Brazilian Football Confederation following the match in the capital to discuss his future. Brazilian great Zico has called on Scolari to quit following the humiliation in Belo Horizonte and also accused the coach of complacency after their Confederations Cup triumph in 2013. ‘They stayed focused entirely on the success of the Confederations Cup. They kept the same formation and the same team. Everyone had a year to work out exactly how to play against Brazil.’ In the face of this criticism, Brazil’s players have a chance tonight to show that semi-final was an aberration and not reflective of their talents. They will at least be buoyed by the return of captain Thiago Silva, who was suspended in Belo Horizonte. Silva, safe in the knowledge he cannot be blamed for the disastrous defeat issued a rallying cry to Brazilian fans to put aside their anger and support the team. ‘This is a bad time so we need strength from our fans,' said the defender. ‘I guarantee that we will play this game like it was the final.’ Captain's comeback: The return of Thiago Silva to Brazil's defence is likely to give them a lift .

"By . John Drayton . Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic has signed for Atletico Madrid from Bayern Munich. The 28-year-old striker lost his place at Bayern with the arrival of Robert Lewandowski, and Atletico have moved quickly to offer Mandzukic a new start.

'The incorporation of Mario Mandzukic is great news because he has the features we were looking for to cover this position,' Atletico sports director Jose Luis Perez Caminero said on the club website. 'He's a winner, a player used to winning titles. He'll contribute very much.' Mandzukic scored 33 league goals for Bayern in the two seasons that followed his transfer to the Bavarian giants from Wolfsburg in 2012. Although his goals helped the club win an unprecedented European and domestic treble in 2013 and a double last season, the Croatian has been deemed surplus to requirements at Bayern. Bayern vice chairman Jan-Christian Dreesen said: 'We thank Mario Mandzukic for two great years here in Munich. In this time we won seven titles and his goals were often decisive for them. We wish him all the best.' Poland striker Lewandowski, the Bundesliga's top scorer last term, is set to lead the attack next season after joining from Borussia Dortmund. Finisher: The forward scored 48 times in 88 games for the club . Differences: But he felt that manager Pep Guardiola's tactics did not suit his style of play . Mandzukic is Atletico's most expensive signing since Radamel Falcao moved to the club from Porto in 2011 and his task will be filling the void left by Diego Costa - Atletico's top scorer last season - who is joining Chelsea. Atletico are expected to make another move for a striker in the summer to replace New York City FC-bound David Villa, and are believed to be interested in taking Chelsea forward Romelu Lukaku on loan. However, their signing of Mandzukic means that they are expected to end their pursuit of Manchester City forward Alvaro Negredo, who is valued at over £25m.","Mandzukic completes £18million move to Atletico Madrid .

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Alexis Sanchez cannot wait to team up with Mesut Ozil and help fire Arsenal towards Premier League glory. The Chile international on Thursday agreed to sign for the Gunners from Barcelona, in a deal reported to be worth in the region of £30million. Sanchez - who is set for some time on holiday following his World Cup exploits, reaching the last 16 with Chile before being beaten on penalties by Brazil - believes Arsenal now have the needed quality to last the distance in the title race, having fallen away after being top at the turn of the year. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Alexis Sanchez say he joined Arsenal to win titles . Alexis Sanchez signs for Arsenal: Here's how the £30million signing will look in the new kit . Set to shine: Sanchez is looking forward to team up with £42.5m man Mesut Ozil to win titles . 'With Ozil in the squad Arsenal was (close) to winning the league title (last season). I hope I can make a contribution so we can win as many titles as possible,' Sanchez said on the club's official website, www.arsenal.com. 'The team not only plays really good football, but the squad is really good and we can win silverware. 'We have a great squad and we are a big club. We can achieve big things. 'Playing regularly wasn't the only reason why I came here - I came here to win the league title, the Champions League and every title at stake. 'I am here to win titles and to achieve as much as possible.' Closing a deal for Sanchez - who also had interest from Liverpool and Juventus - was down in no small part to the influence of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger. The Gunners boss is understood to have spoken to the player face to face while working for French television at the World Cup in Brazil, convincing him the Emirates Stadium was the right place to further his career. The 25-year-old attacking midfielder, said to have also taken counsel from former Arsenal captain and Barcelona team-mate Cesc Fabregas, who has signed for Chelsea, is in no doubt he will be given the perfect environment in which to flourish. Reason to cheer? Arsene Wenger believes Arsenal can win the league again this season . 'I know this club has a manager that looks after his players and takes care of them as well,' Sanchez continued. 'I was told that he is a manager you can learn a lot with. He wants to achieve great things in football and that helped me make the decision to sign for Arsenal. 'Arsene Wenger's style of play is the sort of style the Chilean national team has, so therefore I am used to it. 'Arsenal plays very well, which fits my style. That is why I moved here. 'The manager has mentioned some certain positions, but I am not worried about it right now. The manager and I will talk about my role as soon as I start training. 'Arsenal is a club that cares about the players and I can learn a lot here.' Born to be here: Sanchez says the style at Arsenal suits his play perfectly . Wenger will return to Arsenal's Hertfordshire base after Sunday's World Cup final, ahead of a trip to New York at the end of the month. Arsenal host the Emirates Cup on August 2/3, which is likely to present a debut for Sanchez, who has no doubts about being able to settle into the English game. He said: 'The most important thing is to be calm and not to rush things. Everything will be fine as long as I take it easy and calm down, But I am also looking forward to showing why I am here.' Arsenal are expected to further bolster their squad ahead of the FA Community Shield against Manchester City on August 10. France defender Mathieu Debuchy is keen to move from Newcastle, who want to secure a replacement before closing out the £10million transfer, while Atletico Madrid right-back Javier Manquillo another reported target. A defensive midfielder is also on Wenger's wanted list. Arsenal have been linked with Germany internationals Lars Bender and Sami Khedira. Soon to be team-mates?

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 07:42 EST, 3 August 2011 . A species of rat coats itself in deadly toxin that it obtains by gnawing on a poisonous tree, scientists have discovered. The Crested Rat - Lophiomys imhausi - from East Africa is the first mammal known to acquire lethal toxin from a plant. To protect itself from predators, the creature chews the roots and bark of Acokanthera 'poison arrow trees' to extract the poison ouabain. Bushmen in Kenya use the same poison to tip arrows which can fell an elephant. Avoid: The Crested Rat has deadly hairs filled with poison obtained from the bark of a toxic tree. It is the first mammal known to acquire lethal toxin from a plant . In the case of the Crested Rat, the poison is absorbed into special lampwick-like hollow hairs on the animal's flanks. When attacked, the rat puts on a dramatic fur-bristling display. Any predator that fails to get the message and takes a bite lives to regret it, or dies from heart failure. Dogs have been known to collapse and die rapidly after biting a Crested Rat. Others that have survived an encounter shy away from the creature, according to local reports. Researcher Dr Jonathan Kingdon, from Oxford University, said: 'At between 40cm and 50cm long, the Crested Rat looks quite innocuous as it clambers about in rocky, wooded valleys in Kenya and the Horn of Africa. 'But once disturbed or attacked the long fur on its flanks parts to expose a vivid black and white pattern around a leaf-shaped tract of peculiarly specialised hair, almost as if it is 'daring' a predator to take a bite of these poisoned hairs.' Many species of tree frog use the same trick of employing plant toxins to make them poisonous to predators, but the trait has never before been documented in a mammal. The scientists observed a wild-caught rat chewing Acokanthera bark and roots, mixing the ouabain poison with its saliva and selectively applying the spittle to the hollow hairs. They were astonished by what they discovered when they examined the animal's poison hairs in the laboratory. Professor Fritz Vollrath, another member of the Oxford University team, said: 'None of us had ever seen complex hair such as these with a latticework for the wall and a bundle of fine fibres for the core. 'It was surprising how effectively the hair was in ""wicking-up"" liquids, and then holding them fast. While the function of a reservoir for the poison was clear, we shied away from testing it by chewing a hair.' The Crested Rat appears to be completely immune to ouabain, which is well known for its heart-arresting properties. For centuries doctors have used tiny doses of the poison to stimulate weak hearts. The scientists hope learning more about the chemistry and genetics of the Crested Rat's immunity could lead to new medicines for humans. The research is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.",The Crested Rat from East Africa is the first mammal known to acquire lethal toxin from a plant .
"By . Ashley Collman . A British woman was shot dead by her future brother-in-law in an apparent murder-suicide in Tennessee after a row over a Christmas present dramatically escalated. Kayleigh Dupont, who was originally from Essex but had moved to the U.S., was found dead on Thursday at an address in Village Lakes Apartments in an upstairs bathroom along with her future brother-in-law Justin Bennett, 32. Her two-year-old son Jacoby was found unharmed walking around in the apartment. Scroll Down for Video . Taken: British-born Kayleigh Dupont, who lived in Tennessee with her fiance Jason Bennett, was shot dead by Jason's brother Justin Thursday. She was mother to 2-year-old son Jacoby . Murder-suicide: Kayleigh's future brother-in-law Justin Bennett was also found shot dead and police believe he committed suicide after killing her. He posted a picture of a recently acquired gun on his Facebook page in October . In America: Kayleigh was from Essex, England but had since moved to Tennessee where she was living with fiance Jason Bennett (right) Authorities believe the death stemmed from a fight between Kayleigh and her fiance Jason Bennett's father Timothy who lived with the couple in the apartment along with 'several others'. According to Timothy Bennett, Dupont became mad when her son's train set broke. 'So what - it's just a toy,' Timothy Bennett told WSMV. The fight reportedly got physical and Kayleigh told police that Timothy choked her, so she took out a restraining order against her future father-in-law on January 14. Family feud: Kayleigh had recently gotten into an argument with her future father-in-law Timothy Bennett (left), who lives with the couple and their child. Apparently he choked her after she complained about a broken Christmas toy - leading her to take out a retraining order against him . Obsessed: Authorities say Justin Bennett became 'consumed' by Kayleigh filling out a restraining order against his father and that's what led him to kill her . Timothy was arrested for domestic assault and he was ordered to stay away from the home he lived in. Authorities believe that Justin became 'consumed' over Kayleigh's retraining order and that's what led him to kick down the door of her apartment Thursday night. Kayleigh's fiance Jason was out of town on business in Kentucky at the time, but has since returned to take care of Jacoby, according to Kayleigh's brother, who lives in England. Double the loss: Jason Bennett was not in the apartment at the time of the attack, as he was out of town on business in Kentucky. He has since returned to take care of Jacoby as he morns the loss of his fiancee and brother . Paying tribute to her daughter Kathleen Donoghue, 48, of Harlow, Essex, said: 'She never had an enemy in her life. 'We told her she should come home. I spoke to her an hour before it happened. I prayed for her that night. 'Kayleigh worked so hard all her life. She didn't want to come back and she was so happy with Jason her fiance. But she had her life cruelly snatched away. 'She was a beautiful soul taken in a senseless act. I am brokenhearted that someone has taken my only daughter away from me. 'She was looking forward to marrying Jason and looking after her son Jacoby. 'Jacoby and her family were her number one priority. I spoke to her everyday. She was a fantastic mum and we miss her so much.' Kayleigh's brother also mourned her loss on . Facebook, writing: 'My sister was a beautiful lady and Jason treated her . really good. He [was] such a good man and proud to say he [is] part of . my family. I will miss my sister so so much. She was my only sister.' Smyrna Police Chief Kevin Arnold was heartbroken to see the toddler taken out of the apartment after losing his mother. 'When they brought that child out last night, and here is this 2-year-old with a pacifier in his mouth, and to think that his life is impacted forever, just over something stupid and silly,' Chief Arnold said.","Kayleigh Dupont was found shot dead in her apartment Thursday night and found next to her fiance's brother Justin Bennett .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ryan Gorman . Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer has accused embattled New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's office of linking Superstorm Sandy aid to development and threatening to deny the link if it was made public. Ms Zimmer told CNN's Anderson Cooper that New Jersey Liutenant Governor Kim Guadagno told her that aid would be withheld if development stalled, that it was a direct message from Christie and that any attempts to make the conversation public would be refuted. 'The lieutenant governor [Kim Guadagno] pulled me aside and said, essentially, 'You've got to move forward with the Rockefeller project. This project is really important to the governor,' Mayor Zimmer recalled during Monday night the interview. Dirty politics: Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer is accusing Gov Christie's office of linking Sandy aid to development and threatening to deny the link if it was made public . 'I know these things should not be connected, but they are, and if you tell anyone I said they are I will deny it,' Ms Zimmer recalled Ms Guadagno saying last May. The lieutenant governor was in Hoboken after a series of letters exchanged between Ms Zimmer and Mr Christie that left her under the impression that failing to move forward with the now-infamous Rockefeller project would result any chances of Sandy aid coming to Hoboken. Ms Guadagno held a press conference Monday to counter the claims. 'I deny any suggestion made by Mayor Zimmer that there was ever any condition on the release of Sandy funds by me,' she said, according to USA Today. Accused of cronyism: Lt. Governor Kim Guadagno (pictured at a 2012 press conference with Governor Chris Christie in the background) has been accused by Ms Zimmer of making threats over Sandy aid and insisting she would deny them if made public . She also accused Sandy aid administrator Marc Ferzan of repeating the threat when she asked him about the aid. 'Mayor, you need to tell us the level of development you’re willing to do,' she recalled him telling her. When asked why she waited until now to make these accusations public, Ms Zimmer said she was afraid it would hurt Hoboken's already dwindling chances of receiving any further aid. The revelation the governor's office said they would deny the . conversation ever took place comes after a weekend in which the letters . were released to multiple media outlets and it became apparent the probe into alleged corruption is rapidly expanding. 'As they pursue this investigation, I . will provide any requested information and testify under oath about the . facts of what happened when the Lieutenant Governor came to Hoboken and . told me that Sandy aid would be contingent on moving forward with a . private development project,' she said in statement released over the weekend. Cut off: Hoboken mayor Dawn Zimmer claims Sandy relief money was withheld to try to force her to approve a lucrative redevelopment deal . She told CNN Sunday that it was . 'stunning' and 'outrageous,' but true, that Lieutenant Governor Kim . Guadagno approached her in a parking lot in May to deliver the threat, . stating that it was 'a direct message from the Governor.' 'I stand by my word,' she told CNN's Candy Crowley. Democratic . New Jersey Assemblyman John Wisniewski says he will expand an existing . investigation into Zimmer's allegations. He's already investigating . traffic jams at the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee, New Jersey, . allegedly orchestrated by Christie aides as political payback. The . damning accusations, which Christie's administration vehemently denies, . came as the Governor left his 'bridge-gate' troubles behind and flew to . Florida to campaign for a fellow Republican. Tough week: Governor Christie gives the state address on January 14, as his administration is hit by accusations over 'bridge-gate' 'The bottom line is, it's not fair for . the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because . he wants me to give back to one private developer,' she told MSNBC. Sandy devastated nearly 80 per cent of Hoboken in 2012, and Christie had immediately promised its residents that he would 'be here to help'. But when Zimmer requested $127million in relief aid, she was given just $142,000 to cover the cost of a back up generator, and $200,000 in recovery grants from a $1.8 million fund, MSNBC reported. In a letter written to Christie about the low funds, Zimmer wrote: 'Please . governor, we need . your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be . treated fairly.' No written response was received to the letter dated May 8, 2013 - the same day the city's planning board rejected a redevelopment recommendation for The Rockefeller Group. But Ms Guadagno supposedly made her remarks to Ms Zimmer on May 10, she told CNN. According to emails, public records and her diary entries, Zimmer claims Christie's aides were willing to cut off constituents and use public funds to finance a study for the governor-backed plans. The project, a mass redevelopment proposed by the Rockefeller Group, was already in the pipeline when Zimmer was elected as mayor. Wrecked: Huge parts of Hoboken were flooded when Sandy hit in October 2012 . Aid: A Hoboken shop tries to run without any power after the storm in 2012 . The lucrative deal in a popular commuter area would have given the developers a free rein to build what they wanted while applying for millions of dollars in subsidies. Zimmer told MSNBC she wasn't against the plan, but she did want an independent study on the projected deal to take place. But when the study and Hoboken board rejected the need for redevelopment, much-needed Sandy relief money was cut off, Zimmer claims. Then, in a diary entry for May 17, Zimmer claimed as she was preparing to appear on a televised panel about the Sandy recovery, Commissioner Constable leaned in and told her 'Everyone in the State House believes you are against [the Rockefeller project].' Zimmer denied she was against it, but Commissioner Constable then allegedly told her: 'If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to . you.' Claims: Chris Christie with Community Affairs Commissioner Richard Constable, who allegedly leaned on Dawn Zimmer to support a project in return for more Sandy aid . 'Pressure': Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno allegedly told Mayor Zimmer if she didn't move forward with the project, the administration would not be able to help her . Spokesmen for Governor Christie and community affairs commissioner Constable have denied the allegations. A spokeswoman for the commissioner said: 'Mayor Zimmer's . allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned . Hoboken's receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development . project is categorically false.' The Governor's spokesman, Michael Drewniak, released a statement that read: 'Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governor's Office and the assistance we've provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid.' 'What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyone's guess.' When asked by Mr Cooper if the Democratic National Committee was involved in her Sandy Aid onslaught against the governor, Ms Zimmer categorically denied having any contact with the organization. 'They haven’t called me at all, I have no connection to them,' she said. A spokesman for the Rockefellar Group said: 'We . have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If . it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.' Despite the 'bridge-gate' scandal, many Republicans have come to Governor Christie's defense and praised him for taking action. Others have said the future of the man who had been tipped to be a presidential contender rests on whether his account of when he learned of the bridge scandal is found to be accurate.","Dawn Zimmer said she met with the U.S. Attorney's Office for several hours Sunday regarding the accusations .

"By . Louise Boyle In Queens, New York . and Ashley Collman . A peace has been negotiated between a Queens, New York McDonald's and the group of local seniors hogging up their tables for hours, sustaining themselves on cheap coffee and packets of small fries. Assemblyman Ron Kim held a press conference across the street from the fast food chain Monday to announce that management would loosen the 20-minute seating rule during off-peak hours after the seniors in turn agreed to give up their seats between10am and 3pm if asked by diners. Additionally, the restaurant will be looking into hiring employees who speak Korean and Mandarin - the primary languages of the neighborhood seniors - and a group will start providing transport to a local senior center to alleviate congestion in the restaurant. 'We had to dig deeper to comprehend the pride of a small business owner as well as the pride of our seniors to seek a place to socialize,' Assemblyman Kim said. The new deal: A McDonald's branch in Flushing, Queens made a deal with the group of elderly locals who caused problems taking up all their seating . The franchise's owner Jack Bert made a statement, saying the deal would create an environment 'where all customers who wish to enjoy this restaurant have the ability to do so'. 'I’ve been proud to serve this community for nearly 20 years and my restaurant has been happy to welcome these customers for years,' Mr Bert added. Kwang Kim, the president of Korean Community Services, will also be providing a bus to a senior center that was previously hard to get to since it is several miles away. His group will be working with the McDonald's to hire Mandarin and Korean speakers for the Flushing regulars. Concessions: According to the new deal, management will loosen the 20-minute seating rule if the seniors agree to give up their tables to diners eating in . Alternatives: A local senior center will also be providing transport to their facility several miles away to alleviate some of traffic in the restaurant . The battle between the pensioners . and McDonald's had escalated over the past few months with the police . receiving four 911 calls since November about the group. Some customers, with nowhere to sit, asked for refunds on their meals. A police source told MailOnline that people usually leave when asked by officers without any problems. However the defiant patrons admit that they just take a walk around the block and come back in again. The elderly patrons return to the McDonald's because they enjoy the long opening hours and find it convenient, patrons said today . The McDonald's in Flushing is the popular hang-out spot for some of the elderly Korean community in the area . Police . could prosecute patrons for trespassing if they refused to leave and . the restaurant requested, but hope the matter could be worked out before . that stage. Sun Kim, 64, who was enjoying a . coffee, fries and reading newspapers with a group of six friends in .

The conflict between management and the seniors may also be cultural, since coffee shops in Korea don't have seating limits and they are considered places to meet with others to socialize.

She says: 'Some people sit there all day long and and there's no room for the wheelchair.' Flushing . resident Miriam said: 'I think that place must do no business. People . go there to read the  newspaper. I go shopping for two, three hours and . it's always the same people sitting in the same places when I return.' The elderly people sometimes alternate with a Burger . King nearby on Northern Boulevard which has more space and community . boards inside for customers in English, Chinese and Korean.

"By . Nina Golgowski . and Rachel Quigley . Police continue to look for a possible motive in the shooting death of Gretchen Crooks, allegedly by her 13-year-old son Noah. Police responding to the Crooks home, in Osage, Iowa, on Saturday night, found the woman shot . multiple times after her teenage son - the alleged shooter - called 911. 'We're at a loss. These are good people,' sheriff Curt Younker said. Scroll down for video . Killer: Noah Crooks, left, allegedly shot his mother Gretchen, right, multiple times in her Iowa home and then called police . There was no history of domestic abuse or criminal records associated with any Crooks family members. The 13-year-old boy who allegedly . shot his 37-year-old mother dead with a hunting rifle is also facing . 'unheard of' charges that he tried to sexually abuse her. Now, authorities are saying Noah . Crooks also tried to sexually abuse his mother, which mental health . professionals say they have never encountered among juveniles. Charges filed today in Mitchell County District Court further accuse . Noah Crooks, an eighth-grader at Osage Middle School, of assault with . attempt to commit sexual abuse against his mother. Shelia Aukes, a licensed social worker . in Des Moines who works with young people on a variety of mental health . issues told the DesMoines Register: 'The victims in most sex offenses . committed by juveniles are siblings, . other juveniles or, more rare, other adults. 'A child or adolescent . sexually abusing a parent is completely out of the norm, totally unheard . of.' Weapon: A motive for the shooting has yet to be reported while the victim's husband, pictured, had a penchant for guns according to his Facebook page . Crooks is believed to have fired a .22 . calibre at his mother on Saturday at their rural home and four days . later a motive has yet to be established. The teen was said to be calm and emotionless when he called 911 reporting the shooting. 'The emotions of the young man, from . what I've been told, is his demeanour was very calm and kind of stoic. Almost like he was in shock also,' Deputy Greg Beaver told KTTC. He is currently being held at the North Iowa Juvenile Detention Center in Waterloo and charges are expected to be filed today. He will be tried as a juvenile. Iowa law allows children ages 14 and older to face crimes in adult court. Mitchell County Sheriff Curt Younker told the DesMoines Register: 'We’re at a loss. These are good people, very responsible. It is the most heartbreaking thing I’ve ever seen.' Home: Police reported the teenager as sounding calm on the phone though perhaps in shock by what had just happened . 'We have lost our daughter. We have lost . our grandson,' Mrs Crooks' mother Beverly Brahm of Mason City told the . Albert Lea Tribune. Mrs Crooks, who was listed with her husband William Crooks as the rural Osage property owners, had worked as a nurse at Mercy Medical Center-North Iowa while also studying toward her master's degree after accepted at the University of Iowa in 2009. On her Facebook page back in 2010, she praised her son, one of two sons according to Mrs Brahm, for his musical talents on the saxophone as well as his accomplishment in being accepted into a University of Iowa camp to learn Chinese. 'So proud of him!' she wrote. She had also recently published an application on her page reading: 'Click ""like"" if you love your son!' Mrs Crooks' death comes as the first reported murder in the city of Osage since 1898, according to KAAL-TV. Praise: The mother had praised her son on her Facebook page for his acceptance into a Chinese language camp at the University of Iowa as well as his playing of the saxophone . Arrest: The 13-year-old was taken into custody without incident and taken to the North Iowa Juvenile Detention Center where charges have not yet been filed . The . Mitchell County Sheriff's Office says their investigation is ongoing . with few further details in the killing reported such as where the . weapon came from. William . Crooks' Facebook page shows his interest in the US Concealed Carry . association as well as the Springfield Armory, a company that sells . pistols and rifles. The . State Medical Examiner’s Office as well as the Iowa Division of . Criminal Investigation are continuing their investigation as well. Her family expressed their great sadness by her death while her 35-year-old brother Jason thanked friends and family for their support. 'I just want to extend my gratitude to family and friends for their support during this time,' he told the WCF Courier. Her co-workers at Mercy Medical also released a statement obtained by the Courier, reading: . Nurse: Mrs Crooks worked as a nurse at Mercy Medical Center-North Iowa while also studying toward her master's degree at the University of Iowa . Grade school: The boy's school of Osage Middle School says they're contacting students' families and offering counseling . 'Gretchen was a great nurse and leader. We, as members of her Mercy . family, continue to mourn for her and will be holding a memorial . service. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family and friends.' Speaking of her daughter with pride, Mrs Brahm, whom she relishes knowing she was able to say 'I love you' to earlier in the day of her passing, described the 37-year-old as studying 'full time, while she was working full time,' according to the Courier. Wanting to make a difference wherever she could, Mrs Crooks previously served among a team of doctors and nurses who travelled to provide medical relief to the Hurricane Katrina and Rita victims in the Gulf in 2005. Serving as a critical care nurse, she cared for patients in a makeshift hospital. Her son, an eighth grader at Osage Middle School, the boy's school's superintendent told ABC 6 that they have since begun reaching out to the other students' homes while also offering counseling. 'It's gut-wrenching, you know?' Osage Superintendent Steve Bass told ABC. 'It's always tough in a small community when anyone dies for any reason but then you hear that a student is involved in any shape or form, it kind of goes to another level.'

"By . Emma Innes . Few people want to dwell on their own death and even fewer want to imagine what they might come to regret when it is too late. Now a former nurse has shared her experiences of what terminally ill people tend to regret the most. Bronnie Ware, a palliative care nurse who looked after people in the last few weeks of their lives, says it is surprising how many dying people have the same regrets. Bronnie Ware, a former palliative care nurse, has revealed the top five things dying people tend to regret. She says the most common regret people have is that they did not live a life true to themselves . Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is the simple things in life, like staying in touch with friends and being true to yourself, that most people wished they had been able to achieve. Ms Ware also found men regretted working too hard, while many people wish they had had the courage to more frequently express their feelings. Inspired by what she discovered, Ms Ware wrote a book - The Top Five Regrets Of The Dying: A Life Transformed By The Dearly Departing - about her experiences. She said: 'My patients were those who had gone home to die and some incredibly special times were shared. 'People grow a lot when they are faced with their own mortality and some changes were phenomenal. 'Each experienced a variety of emotions, as expected - denial, fear, anger, remorse, more denial and eventually acceptance. 'Every single patient found their peace before they departed though. 'When questioned about any regrets they had or anything they would do differently, common themes surfaced again and again.' She says the five most common regrets of the elderly are: . 'I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me' In her book, Ms Ware says many elderly people regret not keeping up with old friends because 'everyone misses their friends when they are dying' 'This was the most common regret of all. When people realise that their life is almost over and look back clearly on it, it is easy to see how many dreams have gone unfulfilled. 'Most people had not honoured even a half of their dreams and had to die knowing that it was due to choices they had made, or not made. Health brings a freedom very few realise, until they no longer have it.' I wish I hadn't worked so hard . 'This came from every male patient that I nursed. They missed their children's youth and their partner's companionship. 'Women also spoke of this regret, but as most were from an older generation, many of the female patients had not been breadwinners. All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence.' I wish I'd had the courage to express my feelings . 'Many people suppressed their feelings in order to keep peace with others. As a result, they settled for a mediocre existence and never became who they were truly capable of becoming. Many developed illnesses relating to the bitterness and resentment they carried as a result.' I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends . 'Often they would not truly realise the full benefits of old friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down. 'Many had become so caught up in their own lives that they had let golden friendships slip by over the years. 'There were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved. Everyone misses their friends when they are dying.' I wish that I had let myself be happier . 'This is a surprisingly common one. Many did not realise until the end that happiness is a choice. 'They . had stayed stuck in old patterns and habits. The so-called ""comfort"" of . familiarity overflowed into their emotions, as well as their physical . lives. 'Fear of change . had them pretending to others, and to their selves, that they were . content, when deep within, they longed to laugh properly and have . silliness in their life again.' Ms Ware also says a lot of dying people wish they had had the courage to express their feelings because many develop illnesses related to the bitterness they carry as a result of not expressing themselves .","Bronnie Ware was a palliative care nurse who looked after the dying .

"Arsenal will intensify their search for a new centre-back as captain Thomas Vermaelen ponders his future this summer. New Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal wants to sign the Belgium international as he looks to put his stamp on the Old Trafford squad.

Partners: He has been left frustrated after being kept out of the team by Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker . Vermaelen grew increasingly frustrated at his role at Arsenal last season as he played second fiddle to first choice central defensive pairing Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny. But Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his skipper leave the club without having a replacement lined up. Having already lost right-back Bacary Sagna, who was the club's fourth choice centre-back, to Manchester City, the Gunners boss does not want to leave himself short of cover in the position. Winners: But Arsene Wenger is unwilling to let his captain leave without a replacement lined up . On tour: Vermaelen is currently away with Belgium at the World Cup . Vermaelen has a year left on his current Arsenal contract, meaning he can leave the club for nothing next summer - a scenario the Gunners are keen to avoid. The Gunners are ready to offer Vermaelen a new contract this summer, but without the guarantee of increased first-team opportunities next season, the Belgian is likely to be reluctant to sign. Cardiff defender Steven Caulker is being considered by Wenger, while Manchester City right-back Micah Richards, who can also play centre-back, could also be an option.

"By . John Drayton . Tiger Woods visited Royal Liverpool on Saturday afternoon in order to step up his preparations for next week's Open Championship. Woods returned to action two weeks ago following back surgery - but failed to make the cut for the Scottish Open. The 38-year-old, who underwent surgery at the end of March, will be hoping he can secure his 15th major title at Hoylake this month. Back in the swing: Tiger Woods practices at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club ahead of Hoylake . Good spirits: Tiger Woods smiles as he walks alongside Chief Executive of the R&A Peter Dawson . Recovery: Woods will be hoping to get back up to speed ahead of next week's Open . Nick Faldo believes Woods will provide compelling viewing at Hoylake next week, whether he produces good, bad or ugly golf. Woods won his third Claret Jug the last time the Open was staged at Royal Liverpool in 2006, but has not tasted victory in a major since the 2008 US Open and only returned to action last month following back surgery on March 31. And even though the former world number . one missed the cut in the Quicken Loans National at Congressional and . has not played competitively since, Faldo will be watching the 14-time . major winner with interest when he is not competing himself. Excited: Nick Faldo, pictured in 2006, cannot wait to watch Woods in action at the Open Championship . Friendly rivalry: Faldo shakes Wood's hand at the Royal Liverpool Golf Club in July 2006 . 'Tiger is the most compelling golfer in the world. You want to watch and study everything, good, bad, ugly and everything in between,' three-time Open champion Faldo said. 'It's amazing that he's played two rounds of golf and he's the favourite. Incredible. If he feels he's come with the right game plan, we shall see. 'It's a tough game to play when you are rusty. You learn from every day, you pick something up. It's not so easy for him, he's nearly 39. But he's Tiger, you never know what he's going to do.' The old days: Woods puts on the green jacket with the help of Faldo in the 1997 Masters tournament . Woods famously only used his driver once in 2006, working out in practice that for all the extra distance it could give him, what mattered on the rock-hard links was position and precision, not power. The same conditions are not expected next week but Faldo believes many players will still adopt similar tactics as Woods did eight years ago. 'I'm sure it will be narrow, I'm sure the rough will be thick and I'm sure there will be a little breeze,' Faldo, who will celebrate his 57th birthday on Friday, told BBC radio. 'There are dozens of bunkers left and right, they put them in so many spots. It takes the driver out of the bag for most of the long hitters.' Faldo spends most of his time as a television commentator these days but returned to the Open after a two-year absence at Muirfield 12 months ago and prepared for Hoylake by playing the Greenbrier Classic on the PGA Tour and this week's Scottish Open. The six-time major winner missed the cut in both events, but was going well in the second round at Royal Aberdeen before a poor back nine saw him miss out by two shots. 'It's good exercise. It's burning good calories and I'm curious to see what I could do,' Faldo said. 'It's a tough game to do a fast-track to become a golfer again. On the downwind holes I was motoring along nicely but I made a couple of bad swings and you lose your trust completely.' Back in action: Faldo prepared for Hoylake by taking part at this week's Scottish Open .","Tiger Woods aiming to win his 15th major title when he takes part in Open .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Connecticut teenager is closer to being returned to her parents after the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families decided she was better off in the care of her family than the state. The final decision now rests with Judge Joseph Johnston who gave the state permanent custody of Justina Pelletier in March. The move came after a highly publicized battle involving differing diagnoses from doctors at Boston Children's Hospital and Tufts Medical Center and allegations of medical child abuse against her parents. Scroll down for video . Please: Justina Pelletier, pictured, recorded a video on Sunday begging authorities to let her go home. She is in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families but DCF has changed it's mind . The . 16-year-old made an impassioned plea to go home earlier this week, and . DCF has removed its longstanding opposition to the idea. DCF now claims . that Lou and Linda Pelletier have met the conditions asked of them in . order to get their child back. They will all now be looking to see if the judge agrees. DCF . filed its request to the judge late Friday and attorneys for the West . Hartford, Connecticut, family were notified about it on Monday, . according to The Boston Globe. Justina, . who has been kept away from her parents for more than a year, recorded a . desperate plea last Sunday asking Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick . and Johnston to let her go home. Mr . and Mrs Pelletier lost custody of their daughter when doctors at Boston . Children's Hospital diagnosed her with a psychological disorder. The . Pelletiers had been helping her get treatment for a different rare . genetic disease at Tufts University before the conflicting diagnosis . cast doubts on their parenting decisions. She . was finally released from Boston Children's Hospital early this year, . where she was only allowed to visit with her parents for an hour weekly. However, Justina wasn't allowed to go home and has since been living at . a residential treatment facility in Connecticut. 'All . I really want to be with is my family and friends,' Justina said in the . video. 'Right now - you can do it. You are the one that's judging this. Please let me go home Judge Johnson and Governor Patrick please right . now, please let me go home right now. I need to be home with my family. I . know you can do it. Please right now, I need to be home right now.' Mr . Pelletier says he didn't force his daughter to record the video, and . that it was an idea she had and created with one of her sisters. Despite the state filing a motion to close her case, Mr Pelletier isn't getting his hopes up too fast. 'We have come to learn actions speak louder than words,' he told My Fox Boston. Lou and Lin Pelletier lost custody of their 16-year-old daughter when she was diagnosed with a psychological disorder last year. Before that diagnosis, they had been paying for her to get treatment for a rare genetic disease . The Pelletiers' trying ordeal began 16 . months ago when they submitted their daughter for evaluation at Tufts . University hospital. Justina's . case has gained attention after a diagnostic dispute between her . doctors at Tufts Medical Center and at Boston Children's Hospital over . whether her deteriorating condition was primarily a physical or a . psychiatric problem. She . was being treated at Tufts for more than a year for mitochondrial . disease, a group of genetic disorders that affect how cells produce . energy, often causing problems with the gut, brain, muscles, and heart. However, doctors at Children’s hospital took a different view and . concluded that her physical symptoms were primarily caused by psychological disorders. After the . conflicting diagnosis, doctors allegedly gave Justina's parents the bewildering and . heart-breaking news that they wouldn't be able to take their daughter . home. Justina was released from Boston Children's Hospital early this year, but has not been allowed to go home yet . Justina’s parents . refused to accept that her condition was psychological in nature and tried to discharge her and bringing her back to Tufts. Speaking . of the moment their daughter was taken away from her, the teenager's . mother said: ''They came in, and they said we cannot take Justina out of . the hospital. 'They called DCF (Department for Children and Families). 'They said Justina had 'somatoform disorder,' a form of mental illness that is characterized by physical symptoms.' Linda and Lou Pelletier were escorted out of the hospital by . security, and within the short space of four days they had lost custody . of their beloved daughter. 'It's beyond any wildest nightmare that you could think of,' said the teenager's father. 'They . told me that Mitochondrial Disease did not exist,' says Lou, a . financial planner. 'Instead, they said she had Somatoform Disorder, . which is effectively a stress-related mental problem. 'They . said she had been misdiagnosed, over-medicated and forced to undergo . unnecessary procedures. It was as though they were accusing us of . needlessly harming our daughter.' Mr Pelletier says the idea for the video was completely his daughters. She recorded with one of her sisters . Experts . claim one in every 2,000 children in the U.S. suffer from Mitochondrial . Disease, which saps energy, causes intestine and organ problems and gets . progressively worse with age. The . disease is hard to diagnose and, according to the Mito Action support . group, parents have been suspected of child abuse and sufferers accused . of somatization disorders or fabricating pain. Meanwhile, . Somatoform Disorder is considered to be anxiety-related with sufferers . feeling real pain that cannot be medically explained. Between 0.2 and 2 . per cent of females and 0.2 per cent of men in the U.S. have been . diagnosed as sufferers. Justina's family insists she did not have Somatoform Disorder symptoms when she was admitted to Boston Children’s Hospital.","Justina Pelletier, 16, is currently in the custody of the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families .

"By . John Drayton . Scotland's Martin Laird neatly summed up the challenge of Royal Aberdeen after a rollercoaster third round in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open. Laird made the halfway cut with just a shot to spare after rounds of 70 and 73, but in a packed field was just seven off the overnight lead shared by fellow Scot Marc Warren, Sweden's Kristoffer Broberg and Argentina's Ricardo Gonzalez. Early leader: Marc Warren is currently topping the Scottish Open leaderboard . Concentration: Warren focuses on the ball during the third round of the Scottish Open . When he raced to the turn in 31 with five birdies in eight holes the US-based 31-year-old was just two off the pace, but a back nine of 39 meant he had to settle for a 70 and level-par total of 213. 'It was a tale of two nines,' said Laird, who claimed his third PGA Tour title in the Valero Texas Open last year, a closing 63 holding off the challenge of Rory McIlroy. 'I finally took advantage of the front nine with the best golf I have played in a long time, but the back nine is very, very hard. I made one bad swing and picked one bad club and it cost me four shots. 'Even if I had shot one over and got in at three or four under I would be in a good position to try and win the tournament tomorrow.' McIlroy had taken 40 shots to cover the back nine in his second round of 78 and with the wind blowing in the same direction, Laird added: 'I'm not going to be the only one. Everyone is making birdies on the front nine and struggling on the back.' Half of the tee times had been delayed by 20 minutes due to mist rolling in from the North Sea, meaning overnight leaders Kristoffer Broberg, Ricardo Gonzalez and Marc Warren were just beginning their third rounds. The trio had been joined at the top of the leaderboard when Sweden's Robert Karlsson also went to the turn in 31, but the former European number one then ran up a double-bogey six on the 13th. Playing partner McIlroy, whose run of poor Friday performances after excellent opening rounds continues to be a mystery, had recovered from a three-putt bogey on the first with four birdies to lie just three off the lead on three under. And defending champion Phil Mickelson was also three under after following a bogey on the fourth with a birdie on the next and eagle on the par-five sixth.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . A Texas woman who blamed herself for a car crash that killed her fiancé in 2004 is suing General Motors over claims that it covered up problems with the ignition. Candice Anderson was severely injured when her Saturn Ion went off the road ten years ago in a crash that killed Mikale Erickson. She pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide but the 31-year-old says she now believes GM was to blame and that the car manufacturer knew about the fault before she was charged. Guilt: For ten years Candice Anderson blamed herself for the crash that killed her fiancé . According to court documents, Ms Anderson is trying to reopen the lawsuit over claims that GM covered up faulty ignition switches. Ms Anderson . claimed that a recent letter from the National . Highway Safety Administration confirmed that her fiancé's death was one of 13 included in the car maker's investigation into the defect. 'For 10 years, I thought I caused the death of my best friend. It's a lot to carry,' Ms Anderson told Fox DFW. 'Five months before I pled guilty, they . knew. They had the investigation, everything was going . on…they sat on their hands and watched me go through that. It's . unbelievable,' she said. After the crash, Ms Anderson was sentenced to five years of deferred punishment and 260 hours of community service. She was also ordered to pay for Mr Erikson's funeral and $3,500 in court costs, according to a spokeswoman for her lawyer, Robert Hilliard. Ms Anderson found out about the recall through Mr Erikson's mother, who had contacted the National Transportation Safety Board to find out if the Saturn was part of the recall. Victim: Father-of-two Mikale Erickson died when the car he was in went off the road and hit a tree . Devastated: Candice Anderson says blamed herself for the crash . It was not only confirmed to be part of the recall, but officials said it was one of 13 deadly accidents attributed to the faulty switch, Rhonda Erickson discovered. Ms Anderson had sued GM along with Erikson's mother after the accident, and settled for $75,000. According to Ms Anderson's attorney, GM had blamed her for the accident. 'GM placed 100 percent of the blame on a 21-year-old innocent girl and ended up paying $75,000 to settle the entire case,' attorney Mr Hilliard, who is representing Erickson's family and Ms Anderson, said. 'She pled guilty to criminally negligent homicide and spent years wracked with guilt about Mr  Erickson’s death,' Mr Hilliard told CBS DFW. His client had been driving her new Ion in November 2004 when it veered off a country road and hit a tree. Erikson, who had two children, died and Ms Anderson suffered head injuries, a severed liver, ruptured spleen and broken bones. Wreck: The Saturn Ion was mangled after going off the road in 2004 . Faulty: The crash is one of 13 fatal accidents being blamed on the defective GM ignition switch . Traces of anti-anxiety medication, which Ms Anderson had taken the day before, were found in her bloodstream and there were no skid marks on the road. She was later faced felony charges. As she seeks to reopen the case, Ms Anderson said she wanted GM to be held accountable. Her lawsuit alleges that a faulty GM ignition switch was the real cause of the crash. It contends the switch slipped out of the run position, knocking out power steering and brakes and disabling the air bags. GM, the lawsuit alleges, knew about the bad switches but failed to disclose the problem even though Anderson was pleading guilty. A spokesman for GM said: 'We are taking responsibility for what has happened by taking . steps to treat victims and their families with compassion, decency and . fairness. 'We made serious mistakes in the past and as a result we're . making significant changes in our company to ensure they never happen . again.'","Candice Anderson pleaded guilty to negligent homicide after the crash .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A woman narrowly escaped injury after a courthouse toilet exploded moments after she used it. Norma Brewer was leaving a bathroom stall at Montana's Stillwater County Courthouse on Tuesday when the toilet's porcelain tank shattered. She said she's lucky to be alive. 'I had just closed the door behind me when it went off,' the Stillwater County deputy treasurer told Billings Gazette. 'That saved me. But it sounded like a huge bomb went off in this courthouse.' Scene: Norma Brewer narrowly escaped injury Tuesday a toilet exploded at Montana's Stillwater County Courthouse after she used it . The explosion scattered shards of porcelain through the stall and restroom. Brewer said the toilet used a Series 503 Flushmate III Pressure Assist system, for which the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a voluntary recall in 2012. According to the press release, 'the system can burst at or near the vessel weld seam releasing stored pressure. 'This pressure can lift the tank lid and shatter the tank, posing impact or laceration hazards to consumers and property damage.' Flushmate said it had received 304 reports of the system - a plastic two-piece device installed in toilet tanks - bursting and causing damage.

"By . Leon Watson . Doctors have successfully removed a baby's extra limbs after it was born with four hands and four feet. The child is now in a stable condition at a hospital in China's southern Guangdong province four days after the surgery. The 13-day-old boy, from Huizhou, was born joined to a headless parasitic twin joined at the torso on April 2. That has now been removed. Doctors at a hospital in Huizhou city, in China's Guangdong province, released this picture of the baby with four hands and four feet before surgery . Yu Jiakang, chief surgeon at Guangzhou Women and Children's Medical Center said: 'They were supposed to be twins, but one had underdeveloped and became deformed.' The conjoined twins weighed just over 3kg before surgery, with the removed parasitic foetus weighing 0.6kg. According to the Global Times, the . baby was diagnosed with pneumonia and congenital heart . disease, which is common among children in China, before surgery. His father, named only as Mr Chen, said he had . taken his son to many hospitals near his home but none have been able to give him . reasons for the deformity. Before surgery: The conjoined twins weighed just over 3kg before surgery . Identical twins form when a single egg splits during fertilisation - as opposed to two eggs both being fertilised. Conjoined . twins form when a split egg fails to fully separate. A ‘parasite’ conjoined twin can survive but not when one absorbs the other. In 2012 surgeons in Peru operated on a three year old boy to remove a 9in-long parasitic twin weighing a pound and a half. In 2008 doctors had to remove a 2in embryo from the body of a nine-year-old girl in Greece. The . brain, lungs and heart are some of the last parts of the body to . develop. Removing a parasitic twin is usually easier than attempting to . separate conjoined twins. Mr Chen said he blamed himself for not taking good care of his wife and son during pregnancy. 'I only cared about my work. I just thought of making money instead of taking her to hospital for a medical checkup.' In August last year it was revealed an eight-month-old baby who grew a second 'head' had undergone surgery to have it removed. Doctors in India said the second head was a 'parasitic twin', weighed almost a kilo and had brain tissue within it. The child, known as Tofajjal, was suffering from a rare disease called encephalomeningocele, said to affect one in 40,000 to 45,000 . babies. A similar case happened with a baby in Pakistan two years ago. A doctor at the National Institute of Child Health in Karachi said that the abnormal birth was the result of a genetic disease which affects only one in a million or so babies.","Child is in a stable condition at a hospital in China's Guangdong province .

"By . Sam Webb . A woman who has had an unusually deep voice since birth could not cancel her Sky subscription because call centre staff refused to believe she wasn't a man. Due to abnormally enlarged vocal chords, Norma Clarke, 56, from Eccles, Greater Manchester has spoken like a man for as long as she can remember. She said: 'When people call the house phone and ask for Mrs Norma Clarke, they don’t believe it’s me. 'I wasn’t able to cancel my Sky package because the person at the other end of the line didn’t believe I was a woman.' Scroll down for video . Bass: Norma Clarke, 56, has an unusually manly voice because she has enlarged vocal chords. A staff member at Sky refused to cancel her subscription over the phone because they would not believe she was a woman . She added: 'I get the same response every time I speak to someone on the phone. 'I can't disguise my voice, I tried. On the phone, from what I've been told, my voice sounds even deeper than when you see me in the flesh. 'Whenever I'm on the phone, it kind of starts with the person on the other end going ""Hello, can I speak to Mrs Clarke' and I say ""This is Mrs Clarke"". 'Then the other person responds with ""No, can I speak to Mrs Clarke?"" and I say, ""No this is Mrs Clarke"". This goes on for five minutes. 'This isn’t just a one-off thing. I’ve been the butt of jokes for years. Even my daughters take the mickey out of me.' Mrs Clarke, who grew up in Middleton, Greater Manchester, with three sisters and two brothers, has had her mannish voice since birth. 'Growing up, my voice was as deep as both my brothers’ voices but it was never an issue or a problem in my family,' she said. Mrs Clarke at 17. She has suffered with a deep voice her whole life, but doesn't let it get her down . 'I never heard my mum say, ""Let’s take you to the doctor so they can take a look at your vocal chords"". It was just something I had. 'I only fully realized what an unusual voice it was at the age of ten when I went to a booth in town and recorded a vinyl of myself singing ""Leaving On A Jet Plane"". 'We didn’t have tape recorders at that time so it was the first time I’d ever listened to my voice. I had no idea I sounded like that!' She has seen several doctors about her masculine voice but there’s no cure for her condition. 'Every new GP at the local surgery asks if there’s something wrong with my voice and if I’ve always spoken like this,' she said. 'The last time I had it checked out was ten years ago. The doctors put a camera down my throat and found that my vocal chords were thicker than anyone else’s that they had ever seen - man or woman. 'Apparently this thickness was very unusual to have in a woman. The doctors did try to look for a way to make them thinner and give me a more feminine voice. But they said nothing would work.' The mother-of-four, who has worked in a bakery for over 25 years, says that her macho voice has caused problems over the years. She added: 'It’s still a bit embarrassing for me when people hear my voice in a restaurant and they turn their head round. 'When I open my mouth and talk, I can see people thinking ""Is she really a woman?""’ 'Kids around town call me ""the woman with the voice"" - they come into the bakery just to hear me speak. 'A few younger blokes have come into the store and tried to belittle me but I just say ""When you get a voice like mine, come back"". They always leave rather embarrassed.' Mrs Clarke was shocked when she first heard her voice on a recording of John Denver's 'Leaving On A Jet Plane'. Left, as a six-year-old and right, in 1977 . Fun: Although it has caused Norma (pictured in 1988) problems, she also enjoys using her voice to play pranks on people . However, she tries to have a sense of humour about her voice, saying: 'I’m dead outgoing. I like a good chuckle and I like to laugh at myself. Because of that, I’ve been able to overcome all of the stick I get. 'I play jokes on people. I once pretended that I was my friend’s new boyfriend when she was speaking to her brother in Canada on Skype! He completely believed it.' She is married to medical courier driver, John Clarke, 61, and they have four daughters and six grandchildren. Mrs Clarke says that her voice has never deterred the opposite sex. She explains: 'I’ve been married twice and I’ve never had any problems with men because of my voice at all. I think they liked that I was a little bit different.'","Norma Clarke, 56, has had a deep manly voice since she was a child .

"By . Rachel Reilly . Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel have won this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry for laying the foundation for the computer models used to understand and predict chemical processes. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said their research in the 1970s has helped scientists develop programs that unveil chemical processes such as the purification of exhaust fumes or the photosynthesis in green leaves. That kind of knowledge makes it possible to optimise catalysts for cars, drugs and solar cells, the academy said. Scroll down for video . Martin Karplus, Michael Levitt and Arieh Warshel (left to right) have won this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry for laying the foundation for the computer models used to understand and predict chemical processes . 'The work of Karplus, Levitt and Warshel is ground-breaking in that they managed to make Newton's classical physics work side-by-side with the fundamentally different quantum physics,' the academy said. 'Previously, chemists had to choose to use either/or.' Karplus, a U.S. and Austrian citizen, is affiliated with the University of Strasbourg, France, and Harvard University. The academy said Levitt is a British, U.S., and Israeli citizen and a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Warshel is a U.S. and Israeli citizen affiliated with the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. The Nobel winners found a new way for computers to model proteins (pictured) and their interactions in the human body . Warshel told a news conference in Stockholm by telephone that he was 'extremely happy' to be awakened in the middle of the night in Los Angeles to find out he had won the prize, and looks forward to collecting the award in the Swedish capital in December. 'In short what we developed is a way which requires computers to look, to take the structure of the protein and then to eventually understand how exactly it does what it does,' Warshel said. When scientists wanted to simulate complex chemical processes on computers they used to have to choose between software that was based on either classical Newtownian physics or quantum physics. But the academy said the three laureates developed computer models that 'opened a gate between these two worlds.' Sven Lidin, Staffan Normark and Gunnar Karlstrom (left to right) give a press conference to announce the laureates of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry . The strength of their methods is that they can be used to study all kinds of chemistry, it said. 'Scientists can optimise solar cells, catalysts in motor vehicles or even drugs, to take but a few examples,' the academy said. Marinda Li Wu, president of the American Chemical Society, was enthusiastic about the award. 'I think it's fabulous,' she said in a telephone interview. 'They're talking about the partnering of theoreticians with experimentalists, and how this has led to greater understanding.' That is 'bringing better understanding to problems that couldn't be solved experimentally,' she said. 'We're starting as scientists to better understand things like how pharmaceutical drugs interact with proteins in our body to treat diseases. This is very, very exciting.' Earlier this week, three Americans won the Nobel Prize in medicine for discoveries about how key substances are moved around within cells and the physics award went to British and Belgian scientists whose theories help explain how matter formed after the Big Bang.

"By . Mia De Graaf . They have been trapped in the depths of eastern Antarctica since Christmas morning as every rescue mission so far has failed. But pictures sent from Russia's Academic Shokalskiy show the 74 people on board are not letting the setback get them down. Captured throwing snowballs, playing with penguins and gliding around the five-metre-deep ice sheets, the passengers and researchers claim they are more than content with being marooned in the coldest part of the world. The crew called for help at 5am on Christmas Day after their vessel became surrounded by ice sheets. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

The researchers on board have managed to get messages out saying they are well-stocked and continuing their research despite being trapped in five metres of ice sheets 1,500 miles south of Tasmanian capital Hobart . A top-of-the-range Chinese icebreaker, . the Snow Dragon ('Xue Long'), was deployed but it too got stuck at just . six nautical miles from the ship. Yesterday, Australia's back-up ship Aurora Australis took charge of the rescue mission, with hopes to arrive this evening. However, . the rescue team have warned they may need another fall-back as the . vessel, which can crack up to 1.35 metres of ice, may not be strong . enough to break through. The . captain of the Aurora, Murray Doyle, said his ship was always 'option B'. The Snow Dragon, which will remain on . standby, has a helicopter on board that can be used to rescue passengers . if the Aurora Australis can not break through the ice, said Australian . Maritime Safety Authority spokesman Lisa Martin. 'The Aurora Australis is expected to arrive at the scene Sunday evening. It's pretty slow going out there,' Ms Martin said. The third icebreaker, a French-flagged ship, is no longer involved in the rescue. Failed: This picture, tweeted by passenger Chris Turney, shows the top-of-the-range icebreaker, China's 'Snow Dragon' which also got stuck and was forced to retreat on Friday . Trapped: 74 people, including scientists, tourists and a Guardian reporter, are stuck in thick ice sheets .

The Academic Shokalskiy set off from New Zealand on November 28 to recreate a 100-year-old Australasia expedition . first sailed by Sir Douglas Mawson to see how the journey changes using . new technology and equipment. But on Wednesday morning, the boat hit a mass of thick ice sheets and today remains at a stand still. Chris Turney, an Australian professor who helped organise the voyage on the Russian ship, yesterday posted a photograph on Twitter apparently showing the Chinese vessel, a speck on the horizon beyond an expanse of ice. 'Everyone well,' Turney added. He said trying to break through ice that was too thick would be 'like driving your car into a brick wall'. Just before 5am on Wednesday, Australia deployed a The Snow Dragon to free the group into open water. French . vessel L'Astrolabe was sent out for back up, alongside .

After two days being stranded, passengers hoped to be rescued by the Snow Dragon as it powered through horrific conditions. Russia's Academic Shokalskiy is recreating Mawson's 100-year-old Australasia expedition using new tools . Blizzards could hamper the rescue mission, but the ship is well-stocked and the scientists are continuing their research on the snow around them . But on Friday the heavy winds became too great, and built up an impenetrable pile of snow. Academic Shokalskiy, an ice-strengthened ship built in 1982, was originally used for . oceanographic research before being refurbished to be used as a . passenger vessel in the Arctic and Antarctica. Marooned 1,500 nautical miles south of . Hobart - the capital of the Australian state of Tasmania - the thick . ice sheets built up during a bout of severe wind.

On . board are scientists from the University of New . South Wales, a journalist from The Guardian and dozens of tourists who . have paid to be part of the recreation of Mawson’s expedition. The research team has made contact with local stations from the Commonwealth Bay to say they are well-stocked with food.

France's L'Astrobe, also deployed to save the ship, has now turned back . Bleak: The ship has been stranded in the barren, frozen landscape since Christmas . 'We . all know that there's a possibility of this becoming quite a protracted . sit and wait,' said Andrew Peacock, a passenger onboard the Akademik . Shokalskiy, speaking via satellite phone. 'I think people are just looking at that next step when that second icebreaker arrives. 'We really are just hoping that the two powerful icebreaker ships will provide the breakage of ice that we need.' However, he said the ice floes appear to have built up dramatically overnight.

"By . Tammy Hughes . At 91 most of us would be over the moon to have all our own teeth and to be able to stay awake through an entire episode of our favourite television programme. Few could imagine taking part in triathlons which involve a gruelling test of physical endurance, often for hours at a time. But Arthur Gilbert, 91, has defied his years to become one of the world's oldest triathletes. The energetic grandfather stays young by going to the gym three times a week, cycling 25 miles on a Sunday and swimming 50 lengths of his local pool every day. Yesterday the pensioner took part in the Burnham Sprint Triathlon, in Somerset, completing the 500 metre swim, a 20k bike ride and a 5k run in less than three hours. Incredible: Arthur Gilbert after crossing the finishing line on Burnham beach is congratulated by one of the race organisers, Sara Cox-Conklin . Inspirational: Mr Gilbert completed a 500 metre swim, followed by a 20km bike ride and a 5km run - sprinting past the finish line in two hours, 47 minutes and 22 seconds . Arthur, who has taken part in 41 triathlons, said: 'I came last, but when you’re 91 I think you’re allowed to. 'There was a great crowd here - they cheered me on and helped me get to the end.' Arthur has always enjoyed running and has competed since the 70s, but at 68, he turned his hand to triathlons. He said: 'People think I’m bonkers but people inspire me to carry on, and I inspire them to do something like this for charity.' The former helicopter engineer, who was chosen to carry the Olympic torch this year, has been crowned British duathlon champion seven times. And has even received royal recognition for his outstanding achievements. Awarded an MBE for his charity work over 35 years, he was also sent a letter by Prince Charles congratulating him on his previous triathlons and wishing him luck in future races. The granddad, from Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, attributes his extraordinary stamina to living a stress-free life, giving blood and eating lots of bananas. He said: 'I started taking it all seriously when I was 68 - I was a bit late getting started so I’ve spent the years ever since then trying to make up for it. Determination: Hardy Arthur Gilbert, carried the Olympic Torch through Minehead, Somerset, last month. He has taken part in 41 triathlons . Back in the day: Arthur competing in a triathlon in 1999 . 'The secret is staying stress-free, being happy, doing charity work and being positive. 'I don’t drink or smoke and have regular check-ups. I also have a very balanced diet with lots of fruit for breakfast which helps tremendously - I love nuts and bananas. 'Some of it is down to giving blood. The old blood goes out, the new comes in to replace it and rejuvenates you. 'I’ve donated 45 pints of blood altogether since I was 51 and only stopped because I reached the age limit. People think it decreases your performance in life but it doesn’t. 'I have to work really hard at keeping fit. Being disciplined and going out and doing it even when you don’t feel like it is the key to success. 'The training is the hardest part and it’s almost a relief at the finishing line.' Over the years Arthur has had to overcome the loss of wife Mary, known to family and friends as Betty, to cancer and has also battled against pneumonia. Arthur, avid member of local running group, Burnham Harriers, added: 'I have a lot of help and I’m motivated by my wonderful family. 'They, along with regular training and the fact this is all for charity, help keep me going. Then and now: Arthur pictured showing up younger contestants during a triathlon in 2003 (left) and in training (right) Fitness fanatic: The slender pensioner regularly competes against athletes 50 years his junior . Taking the plunge: Arthur has always been an avid runner, but decided to take up triathlons later in life . 'I raise money for Musgrove Leukaemic Group Somerset which is really close to my heart. 'People are really generous and I really appreciate all their support. 'I must be the world’s oldest triathlete - I’ve never met anyone else still doing it at my age. 'I keep saying I’m going to give up soon, but I always end up going back to do more. 'The triathalon today was my third “last one” - I just can’t give up.' A Guinness World Records spokesman said: 'We don’t currently have a record on file for the category of oldest triathlete, so we would be interested in anyone who believes they may lay claim to the title.'","Hardy Arthur Gilbert has taken part in 41 triathlons since turning 68 .

These shocking pictures show frightened monkeys being held down, tattooed without anaesthetic, injected and examined as they await a flight to the UK to be used in scientific research. The images were taken at a factory breeding farm in Mauritius, from where hundreds of monkeys are flown to UK laboratories on Air France flights. They were released by the National Anti-Vivisection Society (NAVS), an animal rights organisation that recently concluded a probe into one of several Mauritian farms breeding long-tailed macaques for experiments. Scroll down for video . Panic: A wild-eyed monkey is held down at a farm in Mauritius that provides monkeys for UK laboratories . Pain: An adult monkey undergoing a TB test, where a needle is inserted into its eyelid. The pictures were taken on a farm that provides animals for experiments in UK labs . Investigators say they saw horrific scenes of distressed babies being tattooed without anaesthetic, monkeys restrained and injected in view of other animals, wild animals captured to re-stock breeding colonies, barren crowded cages and animals killed or injured from fighting. They also claim to have witnessed the stressful separation of mothers and their babies and rough handling, including monkeys wrenched from cages by their tails and netted animals slammed onto concrete floors. More than 1,500 monkeys were imported into the UK for experiments in 2012 - an increase of 50 per cent - and nearly 1,000 of those were from Mauritius. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Campaigners say mothers and their babies are separated - an incredibly stressful process for both . Harrowing: A baby monkey is tattooed for identification purposes . Just a few days ago the Home Office admitted to NAVS that it no longer checks and approves overseas breeding facilities, instead leaving it up to laboratories, according to the charity. In the UK, monkeys are used mainly to test drugs or for neurological research. Animals typically endure force-feeding or injections of experimental compounds, have electrodes implanted into their brains and are immobilised in restraint chairs while they are experimented on. NAVS said it has found monkeys that have suffered from rectal prolapse from the stress of being restrained, blackened lungs, trembling, collapse, bleeding and self-mutilation - including one animal who chewed its finger to the bone. Most monkeys are killed at the end of the experiment, but others are forced to endure years in barren laboratory cages. The National Anti-Vivisection Society has called for a ban on all animals for research . NAVS chief executive Jan Creamer said: 'Just as the use of great apes was abandoned decades ago, it is time to end the use of all primates in research. 'The pain, suffering and clear distress caused to these intelligent, emotional animals is inexcusable when there are advanced alternatives already available. 'Such crude and outdated animal research methods can be replaced with quicker, cheaper and scientifically superior methods – the cutting edge of modern science.'

"By . Emma Innes . A new weight loss balloon that can be swallowed in a capsule has been launched across the UK. Unlike other gastric balloon treatments, Obalon does not require invasive surgery. Instead, in a 10-minute procedure, patients swallow a capsule the size of a large vitamin pill which contains a deflated balloon. The capsule is attached to a hollow tube and, once the capsule arrives in the stomach, the balloon is inflated to the size of an apple. The capsule dissolves and the tube is removed via the mouth. A new gastric balloon procedure has become available in the UK - it sees patients swallow a capsule (pictured) which contains a deflated balloon and which is attached to a tube. Once in the stomach, the tube is used to inflate the balloon. The tube is then removed and the capsule dissolves . The balloon sits at the top of the stomach, giving patients the sensation of fullness with the hope they then eat less and lose weight. Patients receive a second balloon 30 days after the first procedure, with the option of a third balloon after around 60 days, based on their weight loss and feelings of fullness. At the end of the treatment plan, a few months later, the balloons are deflated and removed during an outpatient procedure. Patients are not able to retain the balloons for more than 90 days but the hope is that the treatment will help them make lifestyle changes which they will then be able to maintain once the balloons have been removed. Obalon costs from £2,995 for a two-balloon treatment. It is currently only available privately. It is aimed at people who are not sufficiently overweight to qualify to weight loss surgery. Clinical trials in the UK and in the U.S. have shown that patients lose an average of 1st 3lbs in 12 weeks. One patient, Helene Fleckney, 43, from . Shenley in Hertfordshire, said: ‘History of heart disease and diabetes . runs in my family, so I knew I had to take action with my weight gain to . lower my risk of susceptibility, as well as improving my confidence. The balloon is about the size of an apple and sits at the top of the stomach to give a feeling of fullness . ‘Obalon has proved an easy and quick treatment to help me lose weight. I'm not even fully through the treatment process yet and I've already lost a stone. ‘I'm looking forward to eating more healthily, doing more exercise and ensuring my weight loss struggles are a thing of the past.’ Sally Norton, a specialist keyhole surgeon for weight loss in the NHS and at Spire Hospital, Bristol, said: ‘I've been monitoring Obalon's progress over the last few years as I was very excited about the potential it could offer those patients who do not qualify for weight loss surgery but are struggling to lose weight and improve their health on their own. ‘It has minimal side effects, is quick and easy to place and is really well-tolerated. ‘It gives patients an initial weight-loss boost but also helps to change their eating behaviour - which is needed for long-term, weight-loss.’","Obalon does not require invasive surgery like other weight loss procedures .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Users of Apple's next handset may be able to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code found in the iOS 8 operating system. The files suggest a built-in barometer could provide instant weather readings by forecasting changes in the air pressure. The barometer could also be useful for mountain climbers, runners or bikers, who want to keep track of their altitude while training. Users of iPhone 6 could have sensors to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code hidden in the iOS 8 operating system. This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features what is believed to be an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset . A barometer is a used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure. This can be used to forecast short-term changes in the weather. Using barometric pressure and the change of pressure over time has been used in weather forecasting since the 19th century. In Apple's iPhone 6, a barometer could be useful for . mountain climbers, runners or bikers, who want to keep track of their . altitude while training. The new sensors would also improve the accuracy and speed of the phone’s location services. And as well as environmental readings, the new sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone’s location services. This is because the data on altitude could allow the phone to reduce the number of calculations it needs to carry out to get a GPS lock. According to 9to5Mac, the references were discovered by FutureTap developer Ortwin Gentz, who found frameworks dedicated to ‘altitude tracking’ in the new code. Gentz said he tried testing the framework with an iPhone 5S but it didn’t work, which suggests the new code was written for a yet-to-be-released Apple device. Gentz added Apple could include a barometer in the next generation of iPads and the much-anticipated iWatch. Pressure, barometer and humidity sensors have previously been included by Samsung in both the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5. According to 9to5Mac, the references were discovered by FutureTap developer Ortwin Gentz, who found frameworks dedicated to 'altitude tracking' in the new code . Last month, German phone firm Deutsche Telekom began telling customers Apple's iPhone 6 will launch on 19 September. The operator told call centre representatives to let customers know the date in a bid to stop them swapping operators, it has been claimed by apfelpage.de. Apple's next handset is believed to have a 4.7-inch screen - up from the 4-inch screen of its current models -  with a second version boasting a 5.5-inch screen. Australian blog MacFixit claims this is the rear case of the iPhone 6. As well as environmental readings, the rumoured sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone's location services . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. According to Apple Insider, however, the date could be little more than an informed guess. 'The date is consistent with Apple's recent launches, making it likely an educated guess,' it said. CEO Tim Cook, while promising only 'new product categories' for 2014, has played his cards close to his chest. It is believed Japan Display, Sharp and South Korea's LG Display have all been tapped to make the screens. Representatives for the three suppliers and  Apple declined to comment. Both iPhone 6 screens will be larger than the 4.0-inch panels on Apple's existing iPhone 5S and 5C models. Larger . iPhones, the subject of months of speculation, would mark yet another . incremental tweak to the popular smartphone line and an attempt to catch . up to rivals like Samsung. The new design has moved the power switch to the side of the handset, and featured rounded edges, according to these leaked images . Taiwanese sources said the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to 10MP, from its current 8MP version, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter, allowing for clearer pictures. If Apple follows its usual release schedule, the new models will be unveiled in September this year. Apple's new devices are expected to use the in-cell touch panel technology - which embeds sensors more tightly into the screen - seen on previous models to make the next device as thin as possible. But reports suggest difficulties with this technology in larger displays has caused Apple to delay production of the 5.5-inch versions. The images, pictured left and right, were posted on Chinese social network Weibo earlier this month and are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and protruding camera, similar to that seen on the iPod touch .","Sensors may provide weather data by looking at air pressure changes .

"By . Hugo Gye . Formula One heiress Tamara Ecclestone . has lost a court battle against her ex-boyfriend after a judge ruled . that she was wrong to try and reclaim a Lamborghini supercar she gave . him as a present. The . wealthy socialite must now pay more than £20,000 in compensation to two . car companies who were prevented from selling the vehicle while the case . was ongoing. Mr . Justice Dingemans said in a High Court judgement yesterday that the . wrangling over the £380,000 Lamborghini Aventador had 'caused everyone . far more trouble than it is worth'. Ms Ecclestone said she was 'disappointed' by the ruling - but today she was pictured in a Lamborghini showroom in Kensington, West London, apparently shopping for a replacement. Shopping: Tamara Ecclestone at a Lamborghini showroom in Kensington, West London today . Checking out the wares: Ms Ecclestone looks at the interior of a lime-green vehicle with a salesman . The 29-year-old gave the original car . to her then-lover Omar Khyami on his 38th birthday in April 2012, but . when they broke up three months later she claimed it belonged to her. Mr . Khyami, a former stockbroker, used the Lamborghini to secure a loan . from Elite Performance Cars Ltd in connection with a white Bentley which . he bought Ms Ecclestone for Christmas in 2011. In April 2013, bailiffs acting on behalf of Elite seized the car from a garage where Ms Ecclestone was having it serviced. The . firm sold the vehicle to Ansol Trading Ltd, which apparently arranged . to sell it on to a buyer in Turkey until the heiress obtained a High . Court injunction stopping the sale on the grounds that she had never . actually given the Lamborghini to Mr Khyami. Chat: The socialite talking to a salesman - a day after a judge ruled that she had to give a Lamborghini back to her ex-boyfriend . Walking out: It was unclear whether or not Ms Ecclestone made a purchase during her trip to the showroom . In a written judgement delivered in . Newcastle yesterday, Mr Justice Dingemans said that Ms Ecclestone was . wrong to interfere and did not own the car. He . ruled that she should pay Elite £7,500 in damages, while Ansol was . awarded £15,000 as well as the Lamborghini and an amount of interest . which has yet to be determined. 'Ms . Ecclestone's conduct was wrongful and interfered with the title and . possession by Elite and Ansol by interfering with sales made by Elite . and Ansol, and by removing the car, and by preventing dealings with the . proceeds of the sale of the car,' the judge said. 'The . injunctions obtained by Ms Ecclestone were wrongfully granted, because . they were obtained on the basis of false evidence to the effect the car . had not been a gift to Mr Khyami.' Court battle: Tamara Ecclestone, right, has lost a case against her ex-boyfriend Omar Khyami, left . Claim: The heiress tried to argue that she owned this Lamborghini Aventador which she gave her then-lover for his 38th birthday shortly before they broke up in 2012 . 2010: Tamara Ecclestone begins dating Omar Khyami . December 2011: He buys her a white Bentley as a Christmas present . April 2012: On Mr Khyami's 38th birthday, Ms Ecclestone gives him a black Lamborghini Aventador worth £380,000 . July 2012: The couple split up, and Ms Ecclestone keeps the supercar . April . 2013: Bailiffs seize the car while the heiress is having it serviced, . saying that Mr Khyami used it to repay the debt he incurred buying the Bentley . April 2013: Ms Ecclestone wins a High Court injunction stopping the car from being sold abroad . November 2013: She admits that Mr Khyami is the legal owner of the car . January 2014: A judge rules that she must compensate two car companies for obstructing the sale of the Lamborghini . The . car is currently being stored by the heiress' father Bernie Ecclestone, . who faces his own court case after being indicted on charges of bribery . in Germany. He denies any wrongdoing. Elite . argued Ms Ecclestone's allegation that the company was prepared to sell . a car it did not own had damaged its reputation, and cost it £440,000 . in lost profits, but the judge rejected that claim. After . the verdict, a spokesman for Ms Ecclestone said: 'Tamara is . disappointed by this verdict and she absolutely maintains that the . vehicle was never intended to be a gift. 'We . are, however, relieved the spurious counter claim brought against . Tamara by Elite Performance Cars was dismissed by the judge. 'The . judge was correct when he said the car had been more trouble than its . worth and this has been a difficult time for Tamara and her family. Tamara thanks everyone for their support and it is now time to focus on . the future and positive times ahead.' Ms . Ecclestone and Mr Khyami dated for two and a half years, but they split . after claims emerged that Mr Khyami had been filmed having sex with . other women. Defeat: Ms Ecclestone was told by a High Court judge that she is not the rightful owner of the car, pictured . Debt: Mr Khyami used the Lamborghini to repay the purchase of this Bentley, a gift for Ms Ecclestone . New partner: Ms Ecclestone pictured earlier this month with her husband Jay Rutland . Yesterday's ruling was the second legal setback the socialite had received in just a few days, after prosecutors decided to drop charges against a man accused of mugging her husband Jay Rutland. The 32-year-old was seen on CCTV grappling with an attacker, but he was later unable to identify the culprit and the Crown Prosecution Service has now concluded that there is insufficient evidence linking him with the alleged crime to continue proceedings.

"By . Mark Prigg . Google is rating Internet service providers' video streaming quality on a new website, the latest development in the fight between broadband providers and content companies over who is to blame for slow streaming speeds. A link to the website appears when videos on Google's streaming service, YouTube, are slow to buffer. The website quietly launched in May, but recently drew growing publicity. Google shows users how their ISP is doing - and which one can offer faster speeds . Google rates the Internet service providers based on how quickly billions of hours of YouTube videos watched every month load over 30 days and divides those results by provider and location to determine the quality of performance viewers get 90 percent of the time, the company said. 'There are many factors that influence your video streaming quality, including your choice of Internet Service Provider (ISP). Learn how your ISP performs and understand your options,' the website reads. Google rates the Internet service providers based on how quickly billions of hours of YouTube videos watched every month load over 30 days and divides those results by provider and location to determine the quality of performance viewers get 90 percent of the time, the company said. The website is intended to inform customers who want to view video in high-definition how best to do it, Matt McLernon, a YouTube spokesman said. 'We are just basically providing information, not trying to tell people to change their behavior or do anything different,' said McLernon. Customers can compare the performance of various Internet service providers in their area through the website. Google is not the first content company to send messages directly to consumers about their Internet service providers. The firm says it wants to warn consumers of the problem . In June, Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) sent its customers messages that Verizon Inc (VZ.N) and other Internet providers were to blame for slow speeds. Last month, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission announced it would investigate agreements between Internet service providers and content companies to determine whether they are causing slow speeds. Under the plans for priority usage, Netflix and other video providers would pay extra to use fast lanes to get the maximum amount of bandwith to its customers, and maintain and improve streaming quality and reliability. This is being heavily criticised by net neutrality campaigners. At the heart of net neutrality is an open internet in which all data being sent from websites to customers is treated the same, regardless of size or destination. All this traffic is given the same priority along the same lanes and no site is given preferential treatment. Although it seems like a fair model, in which sites that use the most bandwith pay the most money, campaigners claim it will drastically impact on industry competition. For example, Netflix has the money to pay for better service, using the fast lanes, while smaller companies don't. This means smaller companies may have the same range of content, but because they can't stream at the same quality, they are effectively priced out of the market. To address these claims, the new rules include a 'competition test'. ISPs would need to decide if a website meets the critieria to be given priority access and that this bar must be set high enough to protect competition. Netflix has been calling on the FCC to do away with fees content companies pay to Internet service providers for smooth delivery of their services to consumers. The FCC is expected to consider that idea as it seeks public comment on recently proposed Internet traffic, or 'net neutrality,' rules that suggest content companies should be allowed to strike 'commercially reasonable' deals with broadband providers to give priority to their traffic.","Google rates the Internet service providers based on how quickly billions of hours of YouTube videos watched every month load over 30 days .

For Serena Williams this victory was a 49-minute stroll that quite probably acted as a timely warm  down from the doubles match she only finished with her sister 15 hours earlier.

"By . Martha De Lacey . When two glamorous women departed The Strand Theatre in London on 28 April 1870 after a show, passers-by were startled to see them being arrested by police officers. The women, who had been flirting openly with male members of the audience all evening, had also, unbeknown to them, been the object of the officers' attention throughout the play. Producing a warrant card and apprehending the ladies, the arresting officer said: 'I'm a police officer from Bow Street, and I have every reason to believe . that you are men in female attire and you will have to come to Bow . Street with me now.' The officer was correct in his belief. The 'women' were Fanny and Stella, a pair of . middle-class gentlemen with a predilection for cross-dressing - and their subsequent court trial for being transvestites scandalised Victorian England. And now their extraordinary tale has been chronicled in a new book by writer Neil McKenna, author of The Secret Life Of Oscar Wild, entitled Fanny & Stella and published by Faber on 7 February. Stella, left, and Fanny, right, the two Victorian men who were arrested and charged with having sex with each other and also of several acts of conspiracy . Ernest Boulton, left, as Stella, and as himself, right . Fanny and Stella's real names were Frederick Park, 22, and Ernest Boulton, 21. And on the night in question they were charged with both having sex with each other . (homosexuality was a criminal offence until 1967) and also with several . counts of conspiracy. It even emerged police had had their 'dressing-up . flat' under surveillance for a year - and that the home secretary . himself was encouraging the attorney general to prosecute. Frederick was the elder of the two, the youngest in a family of 12 children and the son of Judge Alexander Park. His brother Harry had already left England and escaped to Scotland after being arrested for homosexual offences. Ernest, just 20, was the more naturally beautiful of the pair, and very attractive in his feminine guise. The son of a shipping broker, Ernest had a wonderful soprano voice and was determined to be a singer until his father pushed him into a career as a banker. His most famous lover was Lord Arthur Pelham-Clinton, son of the Duke of Newcastle and godson of Prime Minister William Gladstone. Fanny resting on the shoulder of Lord Arthur Pelham-Clinton, son of the Duke of Newcastle, at one time the lover of Stella, sitting on floor . Victorian drawings of Stella, left, and Fanny, right . The day after their arrest, Fanny and Stella arrived sensationally at Bow Street magistrates court where nearly 1,000 people gathered to watch them be taken inside. The two men spent four months in jail awaiting trial, and if convicted, their sentence would be between 10 years and life in prison. Regardless, the pair did not flee when they were released from prison before trial, and the case arrived at Westminster Hall court in May 1871 for a huge state trial with the lord chief justice as judge and the prosecution led the attorney-general with the assistance of the solicitor-general. Stella and Fanny, top right with croquet sticks, loved dressing up in resplendent women's clothes and going out in London society in the 19th century . Ernest Boulton, left, toured as a female impersonator with . his brother Gerard before dying in England in 1903, while Frederick Park, right, went to America with his . banished brother Harry and died in New Jersey in 1881 . The trial of Fanny, right, and Stella, left, was considered Britain's first great legal squabble with homosexuality, but was forgotten as quickly as it became a sensation . But because of a very weak prosecution case - and the fact that the two men were charged with conspiracy with six others who had, between them, fled, died or didn't even know each other - the trial failed and the men were acquired. Boulton's mother Mary Ann had, crucially, testified to say that it was no secret his son's nickname was Stella and that he enjoyed dressing as a woman - which made the case look more silly than sordid and sinister. Neil McKenna, who has written a book about the notorious Victorian transvestites entitled Fanny & Stella, told the Daily Express: 'The irony is that if they had just been charged with sodomy the medical evidence would have meant they would probably have been convicted, sent to prison and died there.' Ernest Boulton and Frederick William Park, also known as Stella and Fanny, arrested at the Strand Theatre for incitement to commit an unnatural offence, by going around London at night in women's clothes . A drawing of the two female impersonators' dressing room . McKenna explains that the furore surrounding the trial of Fanny and Stella can be put down to Victorian society 'having one of its periodic anxiety attacks' about homosexuality - which had recently become a term to describe an identity rather than just a fleeting behaviour - sexually transmitted disease, death and the effeminisation of a previously masculine Britain. After the trial - which was considered Britain's first great legal squabble with homosexuality, but forgotten as quickly as it became a sensation - Frederick Park went to America with his banished brother Harry and died in New Jersey in 1881. Ernest Boulton changed his name to Ernest Byne and toured as a female impersonator with his brother Gerard. He died in England in 1903. Fanny & Stella by Neil McKenna (Faber & Faber, £16.99) is out on 7 February . Fanny and . Stella were hard to fathom. They had behaved with such lewdness in . their box in the stalls as to leave not the faintest shred of doubt in . even the most disinterested observer that they were a pair of hardened . and shameless whores. And . yet, close up, Stella was revealed as a beautiful, almost aristocratic, . young woman who showed flashes of an innate, and most decidedly . un-whorelike, dignity and grace. One newspaper said later that she was . ‘charming as a star’, another christened her ‘Stella, Star of the . Strand’. And despite all the opprobrium that would later be heaped upon . her, despite all the mud that would be slung at her and all the mud that . would stick to her, she never lost the mysterious aura of a great and . stellar beauty. Mrs . Fanny Graham, too, was clearly a woman of some education and breeding, . and was certainly very far removed from your common-or-garden whore. Here in the saloon bar, it seemed harder to reconcile their obvious . quality with the ogling, tongue-waggling, chirruping lasciviousness of . the stalls. They spent half an hour or so in the refreshment bar. Before . they left, Mrs Fanny Graham, unaware that she was being watched, betook . herself to the Ladies’ Retiring Room and asked the attendant there to . pin the lace back to the hem of her crinoline where she had trodden on . it. At a quarter past ten, Mr Hugh Mundell had been despatched in . ringing tones by Mrs Graham to go and call for her carriage and soon . afterwards the remainder of the party made a leisurely progress to the . foyer and pushed their way through the noise and confusion of an . emptying theatre to the waiting conveyance. Just . as the carriage was about to depart, one of the men who had been . shadowing them all that evening jumped up and swung himself in through . the door. 'I’m . a police officer from Bow Street,’ he said, producing his warrant card, . ‘and I have every reason to believe that you are men in female attire . and you will have to come to Bow Street with me now.' Extracted from Fanny & Stella by Neil McKenna (Faber & Faber, £16.99) McKenna explains that the furore surrounding the trial of Fanny and Stella can be put down to Victorian society 'having one of its periodic anxiety attacks' about homosexuality .

"By . Bianca London . A young mother whose struggle with anorexia caused doctors to fear she would die just two days before her wedding says her recovery should give hope to young people suffering with the condition. Kelly Furlonger, 31, obsessively tracked her food intake and became addicted to calorie-burning exercise, causing her to lose more than four stone in just five months. She credits her partner Rhi, 31, and the arrival of their nine-month-old daughter Jasmine with helping her to keep her eating disorder in check. Kelly Furlonger's struggle with anorexia caused doctors to fear she would die just two days before her wedding. She says her recovery should give hope to young people suffering with the condition . She said: 'At my worst, my doctor was monitoring my weight constantly. She noticed things weren’t functioning properly. A couple days before our wedding I collapsed while I was out running and didn’t bounce back. I felt terrible. 'I was taken by ambulance to hospital, and I was warned that unless I started getting food inside of me, I might not live to see my wedding day because my heart wasn’t functioning as it should be. Their main concern was that my pulse was extremely low.' As a teenager Kelly, of Godalming, Surrey, struggled with alcohol abuse but found peace of mind through physical exercise. Kelly obsessively tracked her food intake and became addicted to calorie-burning exercise, causing her to lose more than four stone in five months . She said: 'Sport was my sanity. If I was frustrated in class, the teachers would encourage me to do something sport-related, like making me run round the field until I calmed down. 'I was captain of all the sports teams at school and felt pressured to excel. If I scored three goals in a game of football, I asked myself why I hadn’t scored four. 'My best friend died when I was 13 years old. It was a very confusing and upsetting time. I always strived for approval and never felt as if I had it.' Then, in January 2009, two years into her relationship with Rhi, her parents told her they were divorcing. She said: 'I felt as if I was losing my family. I had bent over backwards to try and keep my parents happy over the years and it hadn’t made any difference, apparently. 'I’m close to my mum now but at the time I reasoned that if my parents didn’t like me for who I was, I shouldn’t like myself. That very evening, I stopped eating properly. 'I started obsessively logging what I was eating. I would make sure I marked down the tiniest morsel. I would get up at 4am and measure out, gram for gram, every single meal. I would cut slices of tomatoes down to the tiniest sliver. I cut pieces of ham until they were the size of my fingernail.' By the time of her wedding to Rhi in July 2009, Kelly’s weight hovered around 7st, well down from the 11st 7lb she was just five months earlier. She said: 'I was running and circuit training constantly. On the one hand I thought, ""why am I wasting my life doing this?"" But on the other, the fear of not doing it and getting fat was terrifying. She said the arrival of her daughter Jasmine, pictured here at 9 months, who was carried by Rhi after the couple found a sperm donor, has placed a new emphasis on her future . Kelly'­s partner Rhi, 31, and their daughter Jasmine, who Kelly says needs to see her eating and being happy . 'It wasn’t about appearance - it was about control. I felt as if I didn’t have control over anything else, but eating was one area where I was in charge.' Her wedding day was blighted by her fixation on the amount of food she was expected to eat, and the couple’s honeymoon the following summer was marked by compulsive exercise. She said: 'It’s quite sad that my thoughts on the day were centred around the wedding cake. I kept asking Rhi to not let me overeat. I obsessed over the wedding menu, counting the calories.' But as the couple grew into their married life, Rhi’s support helped to turn Kelly’s thoughts to improving her health in a lasting and meaningful way. Rhi, left, and Kelly, right, on their wedding day in 2009, which Kelly said was blighted by her fixation on the amount of food she was expected to eat . She said: 'I looked in the mirror and realised that I looked gaunt and unhappy. At the gym I spent a lot of time talking to people about how to eat well and build muscle tone, and I realised it was time I followed my own advice. 'I had to become my own personal trainer. To build muscle, I needed to ingest more food. So threw away my food diary and started eating properly and forcing myself to eat square meals which included protein.'

She said the arrival of her daughter Jasmine, who was carried by Rhi after the couple found a sperm donor, has placed a new emphasis on her future. She said: 'At Christmas I wobbled with obsessing over how much food I was eating, but I’m able to vocalise those anxieties now. 'I’m happier in myself. I still struggle with confidence, but I’m much calmer than I was. Now I don’t let things throw me. Being mum for Jasmine makes me think about the need to keep healthy for her. 'I need to think about her view of things when she grows up. She needs to see me eating and being happy. I would hate it if she went through the same experience as I did.' She encouraged other people who are suffering with eating disorders to remember their inner strength. She said: 'I tell people not to be afraid to talk about what you’re feeling and how they might be struggling. I know I have to be vigilant. No-one’s going to be able to get better for me. I have to do it myself. 'I was determined when I was suffering with anorexia - I worked amazingly hard and went to incredible lengths to harm myself. But I discovered I could turn that energy around into a determination to get better and healthier.' Today Kelly, pictured with Rhi, owns a cleaning company and is studying a degree in sports science.

"By . Daniel Miller . Paramount Pictures has become the first major Hollywood film studio to stop releasing movies on 35mm film in the U.S., meaning only theaters equipped with digital projectors will be able to show their upcoming releases. The last Paramount movie to be available on 35mm will be the Will Ferrell comedy Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues, which opened in December. It means Director Martin Scorsese's The Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo Di Caprio, has become the first major studio film to only be released digitally. Curtain call: Paramount Pictures have becoming the first major film studio to stop releasing movies on the 35mm format and switch entirely to digital . With the other major studios expected to follow suit, there are fears that many small theatres, which have not yet upgraded to digital projectors, may be forced out of business. Currently there are around 1,000 theatres across the U.S. that are not equipped to show movies digitally. With digital projectors costing around $70,000, some are reportedly turning to members of the local communities in an attempt to raise the necessary funds. The Wolf Of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo Di Caprio, is the first film to be released in the U.S. purely on digital formats . Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues  starring Will Ferrell as Ron Burgundy, is the last Paramount movie to be released on film . Jan-Christopher Horak, director of the UCLA Film & Television Archive, told the LA Times: 'It’s of huge significance. 'For . 120 years, film and 35 mm has been the format of choice for theatrical . presentations. Now we’re seeing the end of that. I’m not shocked that . it’s happened, but how quickly it has happened.' Director Martin Scorsese is leading calls to preserve decaying film prints for posterity . Both 20th Century Fox and Disney have warned theatre owners that it would stop distributing film prints within the next year or two. One of the key advantages of digital systems is cost.  As many of the big film processing companies have now gone out of business, the price of a film print can be as much as $2,000. Digital copies can be sent out for as little as $100 with some theatres now embracing satellite technology that allows movies to be beamed to them directly. Digital technology also allows for the screening of 3D movies which allow theatres to charge a higher admission fee. Paramount say they will continue to provide film prints of movies to theaters in Asia and Latin America. Despite his latest film being the first to not to be revelased on film, director Martin Scorsese has been leading calls to preserve decaying film prints for posterity. Scorsese, who sits on the board of the National Film Preservation Foundation said: Film is history.

"By . James  Nye . A South Texas police chief said Monday that two Mexican citizens who were arrested at the border used account information stolen during the Target security breach to buy tens of thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise. But a federal official said later there currently was no connection between the arrests and the retailer's credit card data theft. McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez said Mary Carmen Garcia, 27, and Daniel Guardiola Dominguez, 28, both of Monterrey, Mexico, had used cards containing the account information of South Texas residents.

Arrested: Police arrested 27-year-old Mary Carmen Garcia (left) and 28-year-old Daniel Guardiola Dominguez (right)  trying to cross into the U.S. Sunday with credit card information believed to have been acquired in a December security breach of Target . Rodriguez said they were used to purchase numerous items at national retailers in the area including Best Buy, Wal-Mart and Toys R Us. 'They're obviously selling the data sets by region,' Rodriguez said. Late Monday, a federal official with knowledge of the case said there currently was no connection between the McAllen case and any ongoing investigation into the Target breach, but would not elaborate. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the official was prohibited from providing details about the investigation. The discrepancy could not immediately be rectified late Monday. Messages left for Rodriguez and his lieutenant Monday evening seeking a response to those comments weren't immediately returned . Garcia and Guardiola were both being held Monday on state fraud charges. It was not immediately known whether they had retained lawyers. Loot: Garcia and Dominguez's mugshots are displayed on a poster board behind dozens of credits cards found on them as they attempted to enter the country from Mexico on Sunday . Rodriguez said he did not know whether these arrests were the first related to the Target breach. Asked about the McAllen arrests, Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said in an email Monday that the investigation was active and ongoing. 'I'd have to refer you to local law enforcement there for any questions about their community,' she said. The Minneapolis-based company said last week that it has stopped more than a dozen operations that sought to scam breach victims by way of email, phone calls and text messages. A message left with the U.S. Secret Service seeking more information about the case was not immediately returned. McAllen police began working with the Secret Service after a number of area retailers were hit with fraudulent purchases on Jan. 12. The Secret Service confirmed that the fraudulent accounts traced back to the original Target data breach from December, Rodriguez said. McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez displays photos of Daniel Guardiola Dominiguez, left, and Mary Carmen Garcia, who were arrested Sunday after arriving at the border with 96 fraudulent credit cards . Investigators fanned out to McAllen-area merchants and reviewed 'miles of video' looking for the fraudsters, he said. From that, they were able to identify two people and a car with Mexican license plates. With the help of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, investigators confirmed the identities of their suspects from immigration records of when they had entered Texas in the same vehicle, Rodriguez said. Police prepared arrest warrants last week and waited for them to return. On Sunday morning, federal officials alerted police the two were at the Anzalduas International Bridge trying to re-enter the U.S. They were carrying 96 fraudulent cards, Rodriguez said. Fraud: An estimated 100million Target customers had their credit and debit card information released in a breach of the retail chain last month . Investigators believe the two were involved in both the acquisition of the fraudulent account data and the production of the cards. Rodriguez said investigators suspect Garcia and Guardiola were singling out Sundays for their shopping sprees hoping that the banks would not be as quick to detect the fraud. He said he expected Garcia and Guardiola to eventually face federal charges. The Target security breach is believed to have involved 40 million credit and debit card accounts and the personal information of 70 million customers.","McAllen, Texas Police arrested Mary Carmen Garcia, 27, and Daniel Guardiola Dominguez, 28, on Sunday .

"By . James  Nye . Three Cups of Tea author Greg Mortenson has made the unabashed claim that he is thankful to the reporters who exposed the fabrications in his New York Times best-selling book and accused him of mishandling money at his charity. 'In maybe a strange way, I’d like to thank CBS and Jon Krakauer because, had they not brought these issues up, we could have gotten into more serious problems,' said Mortenson, 56, about the 60 Minutes exposé and that of Into the Wild author Krakauer. Speaking for the first time since the allegations of lying in print and appropriating money were first made in 2011, Mortenson said that the stories he recounted in his book did happen - but that he was forced to be creative because he was under a strict word limit. Scroll Down for Video: . Admission: Greg Mortenson attempted to claim that he was thankful that all his fabrications in Three Cups of Tea were exposed - because it saved him bigger trouble in the future . 'I stand by the stories. The stories happened, but … not in the sequence or the timing,' Mortenson told NBC's Tom Brokaw. 'What I regret is that we were under tremendous pressure to bring about a million words down to 300,000 words.' Contrite: Mortenson was apologetic though to the people who thinks he let down with his inaccurate book which details his experiences in Afghanistan . After its release in 2006, Three Cups of Tea became a best seller and it, along with Mortenson's tireless promotion that included more than 500 speaking engagements in four years, resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations to the Central Asia Institute - the charity he ran. Three Cups of Tea details how Mortenson resolved to build schools in Central Asia after he became lost and wandered into a poor Pakistani village, then follows him as he expands his school-building efforts there. The books came under scrutiny in 2011 when reports by 60 Minutes and author Jon Krakauer alleged that Mortenson fabricated parts of both and that he benefited financially from the charity. Mortenson is alleged to have made up stories about how he built the schools and one particularly famous wrong recollection published is how he held Mother Teresa's hand while her body was lying in state in 2000. Mother Teresa passed away in 1997 - the same week that Princess Diana lost her life in car crash in Paris. Another claim, that he was kidnapped by Taliban on a visit in July 1996, was said to be untrue. 'I always have operated from my heart. I'm not a really head person. And I really didn't factor in the very important things of accountability, transparency,' Mortenson told Brokaw. Charity: Greg Mortenson with local businesswomen in Gojal Hunza, in Pakistan - where his charity worked to improve the quality of life for people ther . Mortenson said he’s spent a lot of time owning up to his mistakes. 'Yes, I've talked to people who were very adamant that I make changes. I have apologized to them,' he said. 'I'd also like to apologize to everybody. I let a lot of people down.' But Mortenson said his cleanup effort remains a work in progress. 'In 'Three Cups of Tea,' the first chapter, the first word is 'failure.' I failed in many ways, and it's an important lesson,' he said. 'I'm going to try as hard as i can never to make the same mistakes again.' In his first interview since 2011, when he was exposed as fabricating large parts of his best-selling book Three Cups of Tea - author Greg Mortenson has claimed that he did it because he was willing to 'kill himself' to raise money for impoverished people. Speaking to NBC's Tom Brokaw Mortenson, 56, said that while he admitted to hearing the 'alarms' over his 2006 work, he refused to acknowledge them in case they deflected from his goal of boosting his humanitarian projects. Famously claiming that he had met Mother Teresa, although she had died three years previously, Mortenson begs for a second chance in the exclusive interview and claims that he has settled all the allegations he mis-spent money from his charity flying around the world in his own private jet. Claiming in his interview with Brokaw that events did transpire in Three Cups of Tea as he wrote them - just not in the order he outlined them - Mortenson said that he ignored the warning signs in his own mind not to do this and promised not to repeat his mistakes. 'It still just has puzzled me and why there wasn't, at some point, in your mind, an alarm that went off and said, 'this just isn't right in some way,' Brokaw asked in the interview. Shamashatu, Pakistan: Greg Mortenson from Bozeman, Montana the former executive director of the Central Asia Institute, listens as newly arrived refugees from Afghanistan tell their stories on break from making bricks . 'There were alarms, Tom,' Mortenson said. 'I didn't listen to them. I was willing to basically kill myself to raise money and help the projects.' Mortenson himself reaped financial benefits at the expense of the CAI, including the free promotion of Three Cups of Tea and his later book, Stones Into Schools. Fabrications: Mortenson's 2006 book ""Three Cups of Tea: One Man's Mission to Promote Peace...One School at a Time"" chronicled his failed attempt to climb K2 . He also pocketed the royalties from thousands of copies CAI bought to donate to libraries, schools, churches and military personnel, a 2012 report by the Montana Attorney General said. After that investigation Mortenson was ordered to reimburse his charity to the tune of more than $1million under a settlement agreement. The book was originally conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of the Central Asia Institute, which Mortenson founded in 1996 with a $1million donation from Dr. Jean Hoerni, a Swiss physicist and mountaineer. Among many indescrepencies was Mr Mortenson's account that he wandered lost into the village of Korphe in Pakistan after trying to climb the world's second-highest peak, K2, then decided to build a school there. His previous writings made no mention of his being lost or wandering into Korphe, and he also previously indicated that he originally planned to build that first school in another village. The 2006 book Three Cups of Tea, which sold millions of copies, was conceived as a way to raise money and tell the story of his institute, founded by Mr Mortenson in 1996, and resulted in tens of millions of dollars in donations. Mortenson has been accused in past lawsuits filed against him by readers of racketeering, fraud, deceit, breach of contract and unjust enrichment. Tragic: David Oliver Relin (right), who co-wrote the best-seller Three Cups of Tea with Greg Mortenson (left), about how Mortenson set up schools in Afghanistan and Pakistan, has killed himself, aged 49 . However, in the aftermath of the 60 Minutes investigation Mortenson was accused of mismanagement of the non-profit organization he co-founded to build schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan and spent millions of dollars of charity money on charter flights, family vacations and luxury personal items. Mortenson's control of the Central Asia Institute went largely unchallenged by its board of directors, which consisted of himself and two people loyal to him, the report prepared by the Montana Attorney General's office said. When an employee would question his practices, Mortenson either resisted or ignored the person. The result was a lack of financial accountability in which large amounts of cash sent overseas were never accounted for. Itemized expenses listed as program-related were missing supporting receipts and documentation. Employees and family members charged items such as health club dues and gifts to CAI credit cards. In 2012, Mortenson was told he must reimburse the charity more than $1million under a settlement agreement - according to Montana's Attorney General. The attorney general's probe focused only on the charity's finances and operations, and did not examine the books' contents. The yearlong investigation from 2011 to 2012 concluded that the Central Asia Institute took in far more donations than it spent, and had $23million in reserves. Scrutiny: The book follows the adventures of co-author Greg Mortenson, pictured in Wakhan, northeastern Afghanistan in 2009, as he set up schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan . The charity was judged to need better oversight so that too much control is not in one person's hands, the audit found. ‘Mortenson's pursuits are noble and his achievements are important. However, serious internal problems in the management of CAI surfaced,’ Attorney General Steve Bullock said in the report. ‘Despite the severity of their errors, CAI is worth saving.’ Mortenson was permanently removed as CAI's executive director in November, 2012. Following the stresses and strains in the wake of the 60 Minutes piece, Mortenson had heart surgery. The investigation by Montana's Attorney General also found that CAI spent $4.93million on advertising and promoting Mortenson's books, costs that the charity and the author had agreed to split but never did. CAI paid $2million in charter flights for Mortenson to keep his rigorous speaking engagement schedule before he started paying for his own travel in 2011. 'Dishonest': But critics claimed some parts of the book had been fabricated and Mortenson, left, later admitted some facts were wrong. Relin suffered emotionally and financially in the aftermath . The investigation found that in many cases he was ‘double-dipping,’ where CAI paid for his travel to a speaking engagement and the host of the event also paid him a fee or honorarium for his travel, which Mortenson pocketed. Mortenson and his family also charged personal items to CAI in 2009-2010 amounting to $75,276 that included ‘LL Bean clothing, iTunes, luggage, luxurious accommodations and even vacations,’ according to the report. The controversy became tragic in November of 2011 when co-author of Three Cups of Tea, David Oliver Relin committed suicide. Relin suffered emotionally and financially after readers and critics doubted facts in the book. Mortenson, 52, lives in Montana with his wife, a clinical psychologist, and their two young children. His biography describes him as 'a living hero to rural communities of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where he has gained the trust of Islamic leaders, military and militia commanders, government officials and tribal chiefs from his tireless effort to champion education, especially for girls.'","Greg Mortenson has given his first interview since 2011 controversy surrounding his memoir Three Cups of Tea .

"By . Emma Innes . A teenage horsewoman who feared she would never ride again due to a severe curve in her spine has used an exercise routine to help her get back in the saddle. Joanna Davis, 16, was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago after her riding instructors noticed she was struggling to sit up straight when she was riding and complained of excruciating back pain. Doctors told her family she needed a major operation to save her mobility and she feared the spinal fusion surgery would shatter her dreams of riding horses again. Joanna Davis was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago and was warned by doctors she might need surgery to correct the curvature in her spine - the operation would involve placing metal rods on either side of her spine . But after researching scoliosis on the internet the teenager discovered an alternative form of treatment being administered at a clinic in London in which patients undergo four weeks of intensive therapy. She took a course in which she was taught stretching exercises to strengthen the muscles surrounding her spine and to bring her spine into a more upright position. Now Joanna, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, is riding again and is hoping to go to university to train as a vet. She said: ‘I feel like I have been re-born, it’s incredible the results I have. My back looks amazing and I have my energy back. ‘My confidence has soared and I am so excited about getting back to riding and really focusing on getting to university in two years’ time. I know I am young but I know what I want and I know that I will just need to go out and get it. ‘I am still very determined to continue riding even though I know it will be harder when I am living away from home. I have made some amazing friends and their support has been invaluable. In a bid to avoid surgery, Joanna attended an exercise course at the Scoliosis SOS Rehabilitation Centre (file picture). This taught her exercises to strengthen the muscles in her back and core . ‘I am ecstatic that I have been able to avoid surgery, having surgery would have stopped me from being who I want to be and would have damaged my ability to ride, these exercises are easy and I have just adapted them so that they fit in with everyday life. ‘I want to work with horses and train as a vet and these exercises have given me options again. I was getting so down about everything and how I was going to do what I wanted with my life and now it feels like a huge weight has been lifted from my shoulders.’ Scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an S-shape. Signs include a visible curve in the spine, one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other, clothes not hanging properly and back pain. In most cases, the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy. In the UK, scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000. It is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis. It is more common in women than in men. Most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows. However, in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing. Occasionally, a child needs surgery to straighten their spine. In adults, it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain. Source: NHS Choices . Joanna’s problems began when her family started to notice that her shoulder blade was protruding on one side. She had also started getting tired far quicker than normal and was complaining of aches and pains in her back. Riding teachers had noticed her lack of energy and saw her posture on horseback was getting worse and that she was struggling to sit up straight when she was riding. Joanna was sent to see her GP who diagnosed scoliosis and she was referred to an orthopaedic surgeon who said her curve was one of the worst he had seen and her only option was a ten hour operation to fuse her spine from top to bottom. Joanna was worried that she would have to give up her hobbies because of her spinal deformity, lost a great deal of flexibility and her confidence deteriorated fast. The teenager added: ‘Scoliosis destroyed my world. I have always been so passionate about riding, getting up on a horse and giving absolutely everything to be out in the fields. ‘But when I started feeling tired and getting pain down my back, it was really hard to stay motivated. I struggled to keep up with all my lessons and I lost loads of confidence. ‘Everyone around me was really worried and it was hard because I felt like I was letting everyone down and being a hassle.’ Later Joanna and her family researched the treatment of scoliosis and feared for the teenager’s future at it is a progressive condition and if left untreated can lead to fatal heart and lung problems. Current treatment for severe scoliosis usually involves surgery to insert metal rods either side of the spine, fusing it solid. However, the surgery is long and painful and comes with risks. Eventually, Joanna’s family found an alternative treatment known as the ScolioGold Method which is administered by scoliosis suffer Erika Maude. The exercise programme Joanna undertook is run by Erika Maude (pictured), a former scoliosis sufferer . It has eased her symptoms meaning she is able to avoid surgery for now. The treatment reduces pain by getting the patient’s muscles to work together to support the spine properly with the aim of preventing the curve progressing. Erika Maude, who opened the clinic seven years ago, said: ‘Joanna has done extremely well and has dramatically reduced the asymmetries surrounding her shoulders and hips. ‘She has reduced her pain and has de-rotated her rib cage to the point where she is now able to stand straighter and her muscles are able to support her spine properly. Since undertaking the exercise programme Joanna says her pain has reduced and her posture has improved. Image shows an X-ray of a person with severe scoliosis (file picture) ‘Joanna will now be under close observation to ensure she maintains the results she has achieved and will continue to exercise on a daily basis.’ A spokesperson for Scoliosis Association UK said: ‘With respect to the treatment of scoliosis we always advise that patients follow the advice of a scoliosis specialist. ‘The scientific evidence that intensive exercise “cures” scoliosis is sparse and unreliable. ‘In mild curvatures intensive exercise can improve posture, muscle strength (thereby supporting the spine more efficiently), flexibility, and appearance, but there is no long-term evidence that it will ultimately prevent progression of a curve. ‘It is important to remember that the scoliosis is different in individuals and that some may have only very mild curvatures that will not progress. ‘Such individuals will therefore benefit from treatments that improve appearance – largely because of positive psychological benefits. ‘Specialists undertake surgery only if it is essential for the long-term health of the individual, how much of the spine is fused will depend on the position and severity of the curve, and great care and consideration is taken to minimise the effect on spinal flexibility. ‘The dangers of surgery are overstated. Serious complications are very rare indeed. ‘Staying fit and active and keeping the core muscles strong is highly desirable for everyone, and especially so for people with spinal conditions, however, a life-long programme of specific exercise is a huge commitment, with no guarantee of long-term success.’ For more information visit www.sauk.org.uk .","Joanna Davis, 16, was diagnosed with scoliosis two years ago .

December 2013 . The prince appeared at an official event for the first time today since the challenge looking fresh-faced and clean-shaven. Speaking at the press conference to mark the charity trek, the prince’s enthusiasm for the cause was clear. He . said: ‘Inspiring others is one of the cornerstones of this charity. To demonstrate to those who have suffered lifechanging injuries that . anything is still possible. 'That . this truly unbelievable achievement by everyone behind me... will . remind everybody that they can achieve anything they want to.

With respect. ‘For some the journey may be more of a . challenge and it is up to us to make it as easy for them as we can. We . can do that with training, with employment, or even with adventure.

West lifted the lid on some of the group's celebrations on reaching the South Pole, which included drinking champagne out of a prosthetic leg . 'If anyone has the ability to give these guys and girls a stepping stone as regards employment, then please do. You won’t regret it.’ His teammate Duncan Slater added: ‘Harry was a real team player. There was always something to do and he was always instigating it. There were so many wind ups. He probably spread himself quite thin. He would spend time with each team every day. He was always making sure he mixed, bringing everyone to the fore. It was very nice as he was as tired as everybody else. ‘ . Referring to the team’s post trek champagne antics, he said: ‘We decided to use my legs as a primitive ice bucket. I don’t know why we did it, but we did!’ The . fourth-in-line-to-the-throne started to grow his beard after being . unable to shave during his three weeks on the ice but decided to keep it . even when he returned to the UK just before Christmas. On . Christmas day his ginger whiskers were just as much of a draw at . Sandringham as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and sparked an outbreak . of ‘pogonomania’ (an obsession with seeing men with beards) on social . media. Prince Harry speaks at the  Walking With The Wounded 'welcome home' press conference in London . His facial hair even . inspired articles in publications as far as the US and Australia, with . Vanity Fair magazine describing it as ‘grizzly, red and perfect’. In . recent weeks there were claims that the Queen, who has famously barred . her servants from sporting beards as she thinks facial hair looks . unprofessional, had demanded her grandson shave it off. This . was dismissed by palace sources, however, who said the prince had . decided to keep it because he fancied a change and would probably just . shave it off before he went back to work. Harry . himself told well-wishers at Sandringham that he had decided to keep it . because it was something of a royal tradition – no doubt referring to . the beards previously grown by his brother, Prince William, father, . Prince Charles, and grandfather, Prince Philip, when away on military . duties. Last week he was . photographed walking with his girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, with his beard . still intact, but by Thursday he appeared to have shaved it off, . according to reports on social media.

"By . Sophie Borland . An artificial pancreas could allow thousands of diabetes patients to live normal lives without constant injections of insulin, researchers claim. There are also hopes that the device could eventually help tackle the diabetes epidemic linked to obesity. The artificial pancreas resembles an iPod and is strapped to patients’ clothing with a small monitor and pump fitted to their skin. The device monitors blood sugar levels and then injects insulin when needed . It works by continually monitoring their blood sugar and then giving them regular doses of insulin to ensure it stays at a normal level. In the first trial of its kind, 24 British patients with Type 1 diabetes were given the device to wear for a month at home, instead of injecting themselves with insulin. Around 300,000 Britons suffer from Type 1 diabetes – a lifelong condition usually diagnosed in children or young adults – which is when the pancreas stops producing insulin. They have to inject themselves with insulin between two and five times a day and constantly monitor their blood sugar levels by pricking their fingers and putting samples on testing strips. A further 2.9million have Type 2 – whereby the body does not produce enough insulin or does not use it properly. The 14 per cent with the most severe forms of Type 2 diabetes also need insulin injections. Because of rising obesity levels, it is estimated that a total of five million Britons will have diabetes within the next ten years – the majority Type 2. Only last week figures showed that a third of adults have borderline diabetes. Diabetics have to inject themselves with insulin between two and five times a day and constantly monitor their blood sugar levels by pricking their fingers and putting samples on testing strips (file photo) Cambridge University researchers leading the latest study say the artificial pancreas was so successful that it could also benefit patients with Type 2 diabetes. Future studies will determine whether the device works just as well for them. The scientists, whose study is published today in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology Journal, plan to carry out a much larger trial involving more patients being given artificial pancreases and monitored for much longer. If this is as successful, the devices could eventually be routinely used on the NHS. Researchers are not sure exactly how much they would cost but similar devices used in America are around £5,000. Dr Roman Hovorka, lead author of the Cambridge study, said: ‘The advantage of a system like this one is the ability to fine tune insulin delivery to account for variations in overnight insulin needs. ‘The system was able to safely cope with these variations to achieve more consistent glucose control. Its benefits apply to a wide range of individuals.’ Dr Alasdair Rankin, Diabetes UK’s director of research, said: ‘These results are hugely exciting. The potential health benefits of this technology to people with Type 1 diabetes could be enormous.’","Artificial pancreas is strapped to patients’ clothing with small monitor and pump fitted to skin .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . A Malaysian teenager was gang raped by up to 38 men in an abandoned hut used as a drug haunt, reports today suggest. The horrendous assault is said to have taken place in the northern state of Kelantan, Malaysia, on May 20. The girl is said to have met a friend, 17, before being lured to an empty hut - reported to be a drug haunt by local media. There are reports the friend was an accomplice to the alleged rapists. The men then allegedly took turns to rape the teen for several hours. Some reports are suggesting there may have been . up to 38 men involved. Malaysian Police escort men suspected of gang-raping a 15-year-old girl in Kelantan, Malaysia on May 20 . There are reports the girl may have been arrested following the ordeal. Police are investigating whether the girls friend was also raped. Malaysian police have arrested at least 13 people, including a father and his two sons, over the alleged gang-rape, an officer said. All of the men are from the same village, police confirmed. Investigators claimed reports almost 40 people took turns in the rape may not be accurate - but said they were still investigating the attack. 'It's definitely more than 10. We are still investigating,' one said. Media accounts, quoting information from district police chief Azham Otham, said 38 men were involved. The alleged attack is said to have taken place in a remote hut in Kelantan state, pictured. It is alleged that up to 38 men attacked the teen, assaulting her for hours . Several of those detained had tested positive for amphetamine, the reports said. The New Straits Times said a man and his two teenage sons were among those detained. Police said action could have been taken had villagers reported the addicts' presence. 'It . is very disturbing to me that no one in the village was even suspicious . when the closest neighbour was a mere 20 metres away,' police chief . Azham told The Star. The alleged attack, one of several . brutal cases this week underscoring the violence to which women are . being subjected across Asia, sparked outrage among women's groups. Politicians . from a Muslim party running the region said their proposal to introduce . Islamic hudud law, with harsh penalties, would deter offenders. State and federal police officers either declined comment or could not be immediately reached. Almost 3,000 rapes were reported to the police in Asia in 2012, of which 52 percent involved girls aged 16 and below, according to police statistics. Convicted rapists face up to 30 years in prison and whipping, but many on Internet sites wanted stricter punishment. The attack is said to have happened in Kota Bharu, one area pictured. It is thought all of the suspects, who are in custody, are from the same village . 'We are seeing a prevalence in rape cases because boys are raised in an environment where they think it is okay to use violence,' Suri Kempe of Sisters in Islam told Reuters. Awareness of rape in Asia was heightened by the fatal gang rape of a physiotherapy student on an Indian bus in 2012. Several grisly attacks on women took place this week. In the Pakistan city of Lahore, a pregnant woman was bludgeoned to death by her family in front of a top court for marrying against the wishes of her parents. And in India's Uttar Pradesh state, two teenage cousins from a low caste were gang-raped and then hanged from a tree.

"By . Lizzie Parry . A young father who lost both legs and an arm when a cold developed into a flesh-eating bug is facing the prospect of losing his last remaining limb. Triple amputee Alex Lewis contracted Group A streptococcus last November, which then developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome. The 34-year-old battled against the odds . to make a remarkable recovery after doctors gave him a three per cent . chance of survival. Doctors were forced to amputate the 34-year-old's legs above the knee as well as his left arm. Alex Lewis (pictured with his partner, Lucy, and son, Sam) will have his last remaining limb, his right arm, amputated after losing both legs and his left arm to a flesh-eating bug . But a 16-hour operation to reconstruct his remaining arm, temporarily saved the limb. Last . Friday, months after his initial operation, Mr Lewis, who returned home . earlier this month, broke his remaining arm in three places. As he rolled over and tried to push himself up, he heard a snap. In . a cruel twist of fate, hospital scans have revealed the Group A . streptococcus caused an infection and seriously damaged the bones . leaving them weak and irreparable. The . former pub landlord now faces six weeks in Salisbury District Hospital . in Wiltshire, where doctors will also perform surgery to reconstruct his . lips. Despite the prospect of his future as a quadruple amputee, Mr Lewis has called the news a 'minor setback'. In . a message to all those who have supported him, he said: 'All of you . make this minor setback a walk in the park, excuse the pun. 'With . all your support I continue to feel humbled everyday and I still can't . thank everyone enough for what they have done and what they are about to . do for the trust. You are all amazing.' Streptococcus, a normally harmless bacteria, is . usually filtered out by the body but in the father-of-one's case, it . developed into septicaemia and toxic shock syndrome. Mr Lewis's major organs shut down and he spent a week in a coma as the deadly bacteria wreaked havoc through his body. Mr Lewis (pictured with his partner and son before his illness) thought he had developed a cold in November but he had actually contracted strep A which wreaked havoc throughout his body and left him close to death . Mr Lewis (pictured in hospital) was give just a three per cent chance of survival when he was in hospital . Group A streptococci is a bacteria commonly found in the throat and on the skin. The vast majority of infections are relatively mild illnesses, such as strep throat and impetigo. Occasionally, however, the bacteria can become life-threatening if it enters parts of the body where it is not usually found - such as the blood, muscles or the lungs. The bacteria is often spread through direct contact with the mucus of an infected person and through contact with infected skin wounds and sores. Invasive group A streptococcal disease, which may occur when the bacteria gets past the body’s defences, is a severe and sometimes life-threatening infection in which the bacteria has invaded parts of the body, such as the blood, deep muscle and fat tissue or the lungs. Two of the most severe forms of invasive group A streptococcal disease are called necrotising fasciitis (infection of muscle and fat tissue) and toxic shock syndrome (a rapidly progressing infection causing injury to the major organs). The early signs and symptoms of necrotising fasciitis include fever, severe pain and swelling, and redness at the wound site. The early symptoms of toxic shock syndrome may include fever, dizziness, confusion, low blood pressure, rash and abdominal pain. Doctors . had to amputate both his legs above the knee and his left arm after his . feet, fingertips, arms, lips, nose and part of his ears turned black. He . also lost part of his nose, his lips and underwent a pioneering 16-hour . operation to reconstruct his remaining arm in a bid to save it. Medics told his partner Lucy Townsend - who runs The Greyhound pub in Stockbridge, Hampshire - he wouldn’t make it. But just six months later, the 34-year-old was back home and playing with his three-year-old son Sam. He . said he felt lucky to be returning home, and that he had his remaining . arm to help him do the things most people take for granted - like . sending a short email on his iPad using the underside of his little . finger. He said the nerves were re-growing impressively and was expecting to be able to feel his thumb twitch shortly. But that has tragically been taken from him, as he prepares to adapt to life as a quadruple amputee. His . local community in Stockbridge are holding a fundraising festival for . the Al Lewis Trust but Mr Lewis can no longer wheel himself onto the . stage. Ms Townsend,  said: 'He is still wonderful and full of spirits. 'He’s a little scared in case they find something else but he hasn’t lost his sense of humour. Mr Lewis is set to have surgery to rebuild his lips in the next six weeks, to allow him to eat and speak normally . Mr Lewis hopes he will soon learn to  walk on prosthetic legs . 'We hope they will amputate below the elbow but they won’t know until they operate and see how badly damaged the arm is.' The . family home has been adapted to suit Mr Lewis’s wheelchair needs and . his best friend Chris Bagley has become his full time carer. Before . he was re-admitted to hospital, Mr Lewis said: 'Our whole life has been . turned upside down but for me, there’s a lot of clarity. 'I feel I’ve experienced life and death and I am just so lucky to be here.' After his operation to reconstruct his lips, Mr Lewis will go to a specialist unit in . Roehampton, south west London, for ten weeks to learn skills to regain . his independence. This includes taking his first steps on prosthetic legs. He said: ‘Words cannot describe how much I can’t wait to get walking. ‘All . Sam talks about now is “daddy when you get your legs you can kick a . ball about in the garden” and “when you get your legs you can do this, . that and the other”. ‘The frustration is when I watch Sam playing in the garden out of the window and I can’t play with him. Mr Lewis says he is delighted to be back at home with his partner, Lucy, and his son, Sam . ‘To think I could be walking by the end of the summer is just incredible. ‘But . it doesn’t take anything spectacular to make me feel great. It’s these . simple things, the normal things that make me so happy. ‘Just the other day Chris and I were sat here watching the golf, like mates do, and that was a lovely feeling. ‘It was just like the old days when we used to kick back, and at that point there wasn’t a care in the world. ‘But . despite what has changed, I’m not bitter or angry. I’m proud of the . fact I don’t think I’m mentally any different to how I was when I went . into hospital. ‘I wouldn’t change anything - no way.’","Alex Lewis, 34, thought he had caught a cold when he fell ill last November .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Caught: Miguel Mejias-Ramos, 28, allegedly stabbed his wife and children to death on Sunday . A husband suspected of brutally stabbing his young wife and their two daughters to death as they got ready for church has been caught by police trying to flee to Mexico. Miguel Mejias-Ramos, 28, was stopped by U.S. Marshals just before midnight driving a car with New York State license plates and attempting to get into Mexico, where he was born, police sources said. His arrest came a day after he allegedly murdered his wife Deisy Garcia, 21, and their two daughters, two-year-old Daniela Mejia and one-year-old Yaslin Mejia, at their home in Queens, New York. Police named her husband as a person of interest, and on Monday he was caught heading for the border. He was found with minor wounds and taken to hospital, the New York Post reported. Garcia's uncle stumbled upon the gruesome scene at around 7pm on Sunday. All three had suffered multiple stab wounds and sources said that two bloody knives were left in the two rooms where the bodies were found. A friend, Diana Villa, told the Post that Garcia had been petrified of Ramos and had even asked their local pastor for help - but that she was scared of calling police because she was an illegal immigrant from Guatemala. Killed: Deisy Garcia, 21, was stabbed alongside her daughters, aged one and two, in their Queens home on Jan 18 . Loved: Deisy Garcia's friends described her as quiet but happy, and a good mother to her young daughters . Villa said she had witnessed a violent . fight between the couple at a recent baby shower after Ramos blamed her . for having no beer at the party, which was at the church. Police officers had visited the residence . for domestic violence complaints against Ramos last November and May, . but he was not arrested on either occasion. Garcia’s . uncle Ramon Chuc, 37, recalled discovering the bodies with his two . sons, ages 12 and 10, after they returned to the home after playing . football outside. 'My . 12-year-old son, Rene, went inside the room and saw my niece on the . floor,' Chuc sobbed. 'After that, I... saw the two babies are covered . with a blanket. I take it off and see them.' Scene: Garcia's uncle came across the bodies at their Queens, New York home in January . Fears: Neighbors said that couple fought and police had responded to domestic violence complaints before . Investigation: The home, which is above a drug store, was cordoned off on Sunday night after the discovery . All three were pronounced dead at the scene with stab wounds to the chest. The apartment, which is above a drug store, was cordoned off by police. People who knew the victim from church say that Garcia had previously been married but they didn’t see the father around much. ‘She was a quiet but happy person. She always had a smile on her face. She was a good mom,’ Mario Sanchez, 16, told the Daily News.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The ‘rantings’ of celebrities like Russel Brand are encouraging young people to give up on politics, David Blunkett will claim today. The former Labour Home Secretary will take aim at the comedian for undermining democracy by telling people not to bother voting. And he will accuse politicians of wooing older people who are more likely to vote, while imposing deeper cuts on the young who have all but given up on the ballot box. Scroll down for video . Former Home Secretary David Blunkett warns 'ranting' by comedian Russell Brand is putting young people off politics . Brand sparked controversy last year when he said he had never voted because he regarded politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant. He told the BBC: 'I'm angry, because for me it’s real. This is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution. 'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.' In a speech today Mr Blunkett will accuse Brand of telling the disengaged to abandoned politics, leaving the main parties to focus on those who already have a voice. He will also criticise writer Will Self for claiming anyone who joins a political party is a ‘donkey’. Mr Blunket will say: ‘[Self] and those like him - forget even the rantings of Russell Brand, I’m talking about something far more serious and insidious - are encouraging others to give up whatever small influence they might have in favour of those who already have a voice, influence and, therefore, a say. Writer Will Self is accused of calling political party activists 'donkeys' ‘In the end, the two groups of people in positions of leadership have to be prepared to come together not in some sort of cosy cabal but in an endeavour to raise understanding, to provide information and encouragement to participation. ‘Those two groups are politicians, and in their various guises, those working through old and new media.’ will argue that disengagement from politics has major consequences for public policy. Giving the Centre For Social Justice’s ‘Good Society’ Lecture on the theme of Reconnecting the British People with the Political Process . Mr Blunkett is delivering a lecture on Reconnecting the British People with the Political Process to the Centre For Social Justice. He will point to figures showing that ‘older people, wealthier people, better educated people, engaged people’ are most likely to vote, which ‘young people, poor people, badly educated people’ are the least. As a result politicians of all parties ‘fear alienating’ the more engaged, while choosing to ‘ignore’ those who do not bother voting, placing them instead in the ‘firing line’ for spending cuts. ‘Paradoxically the more those who are not engaged are ignored, targeted under the austerity programme and dismissed, the more alienated and disillusioned they become. Politicians they say “don’t give a damn about us”.’ Last year a survey found 4 in 10 people are so disconnected from politics they might not vote. The alienated voters do not trust people in public life and are left unimpressed by all political parties. The Commons anti-sleaze watchdog warned that the under-30s are particularly disenchanted, raising fears for the voter turnout in the future. Voters are also now more likely to say MPs will take bribes, lie and are out of touch. Brand has appeared on several TV shows attacking politicians and arguing that people should rise up against the main parties. Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman took him to task in a high profile interview last year, but later admitted he finds the current parties so uninspiring he also has not bothered to vote. The TNS-BRMB survey for the Committee on Standards in Public Life revealed public attitudes towards MPs . Paxman revealed he failed to cast a ballot in a recent election because he was unable to choose between rival candidates. Writing in the Radio Times, Mr Paxman said: ‘In one recent election, I decided not to vote, because I thought the choice so unappetising. ‘By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote – cannot even be bothered to write “none of the above” on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all.’ But Paxman was heavily criticised by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg for setting a bad example. Mr Clegg said: ‘He’s a guy who gets paid £1million or thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers, he lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics.’","Ex-Home Secretary says young people are already least likely to vote .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . In X-Men, Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, a mutant with claws that fly from the back of his hands and a skeleton coated in super-strength adamantium. Inspired by this, a plumber from Lincolnshire has created a pair of Wolverine-inspired claws complete with 12-inch stainless steel blades. Not only do they automatically extend and retract, like Jackman’s claws in the film, they are so sharp they have been used to slice watermelon and rip card from a distance. Scroll down for video . The 12-inch metal claws were built by 32-year-old plumber Colin Furze, pictured, from Lincolnshire. Each claw consists of three blades made from 2mm-thick stainless steel . Colin Furze began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades. These blades were attached to metal mounts that are fitted to his arms, and a plate mounted to his hands. Attached to the end of each blade are valves, wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack. When . wearing the Wolverine system, Furze can press a button to fire air from . the tank through the valves and propel the claws forward. A . spring-loaded mechanism attached to another firing switch retracts the claws back into their housing. The claws were built by YouTube star Colin Furze, who has previously built a turbojet engine, vacuum shoes and hacked a mobility scooter. Furze began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades. These blades were then attached to metal mounts, fitted to his arms, and a plate around his hand. Attached to the end of each blade are valves, wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack. When wearing the Wolverine system, Furze can press a switch to fire air from the tank through the valves and propel the claws forward. A . spring-loaded mechanism attached to another firing switch retracts the claws back into their housing. To make the Wolverine system, Furze tried a number of different methods to propel the blades forward including motorised rigs, before settling on the air tank. Furze's claws were inspired by X-Men character Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, pictured. In the film, Wolverine, also known as James 'Logan' Howlett, is a mutant with bone claws that fire from his hands. During an experiment, his skeleton, including these claws, are coated in super-strength, fictitious adamantium . He also paid particularly close attention to the way in which the claws appeared. In the films, the blades are slim and discreet, and are designed to extend to different lengths. Furze said: ‘The blade spread was a must as parallel blades would just look wrong. 'If I wasn't bothered about this I could have made the blades thicker and stronger, but they would look rubbish, so 2mm stainless steel had just the right amount of flex but still enough strength not to fold on impact. ‘When the claws are retracted they compress together into their housing, which is what you can hear when they’re firing out.’ These blades are wired to an air . tank fitted to a backpack. They are controlled by firing switches on the . plate mounted to Furze's hands and extend and retract at the press of a button, pictured . Colin Furze began by using metal work to build and sharpen the blades, pictured left. These blades were attached to metal mounts fitted to his arms, and a plate mounted to his hands. Attached to the end of each blade are valves, pictured right, wired up to an air tank worn in a backpack . He added that he is pleased with discreet firing switches, but said that the system could be improved if the plate wasn’t mounted to the top of his hand. ‘But without this the whole device would move around your forearm and then you have blades firing in odd directions and possibly into the back off my hand, so it shall stay’, continued Furze. Addressing the bulky backpack, Furze added: ‘The main downer to this system is really the air tank and valves you need to carry to operate them, which means you have a rucksack on all the time. To make the Wolverine system, Furze tried a number of different methods to propel the blades, pictured, forward including motorised rigs, before settling on the air tank . 'But the pros outweigh the cons as it . works every time, costs nothing to recharge and can increase the speed . by charging with greater pressure. ‘The . system is just a few basic slots and holes drilled between plates so . when clamped or welded together form an internal pathway. The . project took about two weeks to complete and Furze has posted a video . explaining the design and build process on his YouTube channel. Furze also paid close attention to the way in which the claws, pictured, appeared. In the films, the blades are slim and discreet. Furze said: 'The spread was a must as parallel blades would look wrong. I could have made the blades thicker and stronger but 2mm stainless steel had the right amount of flex but enough strength' Speaking . to the MailOnline, Furze said: 'I've been meaning to build some of these . for a while as I've seen some pretty rubbish attempts and thought I . could do way better, and with the new film jogging my memory there's no . better time.'As of yet . I've not caught myself but there have been a few near misses, there not . mega sharp though as these are for show not for fighting anti-mutant . people. 'The . only thing I'd improve is a smaller air tank as wolverine is not known . for wearing a rucksack but I could be holiday wolverine!' Hollywood author and frontier scientist James A. Conrad has compiled a list of four psychic powers seen in the X-Men movies that he claims 'even an inventive teenager might be able to crack and join the ranks of the world's billionaires'. Telekinesis . Magneto of the X-Men can levitate and cause motion in both metallic and nonmetallic objects at will, the latter using the principle of diamagnetism. Products are already on the market, including toys, that simulate a telekinesis-like effect, but they rely on brain-computer interface technology. According to Conrad: 'If you can successfully and repeatedly demonstrate an act of telekinesis – that is, make an object move with just the power of your mind – and supply learning instructions so that others can do it, the value would be $100 billion in U.S. dollars, provided you don't mind selling your breakthrough knowledge to the government.' Telepathy . Dark intentions aside, it could be useful and a valuable talent, with appropriate legal authorisation, to read someone's mind or transfer a thought or emotion to someone's consciousness the way that Charles Xavier, wealthy leader of the X-Men does it, explained Conrad. Secrets hidden in the mind of a terrorist or kidnapper could be obtained quickly to save lives, while victims trapped in rubble could be located by their thoughts alone and mentally sent a reassuring message that help is on the way. Accelerated healing . Wolverine's body has the ability to heal bullet wounds fast without the slightest trace of scars. In the real world, bodies are in a constant state of gradual regeneration, but if we suffer too great a physical injury or too many smaller injuries, present human physiology cannot handle the increased workload. Some animals can regenerate entire severed limbs or tails. Scientists have been researching how to adapt those abilities for human use, but it is difficult transferring genetic traits from one species to another. Scientists have also been researching ways for human cells to undergo changes so that they can be used for other purposes in the body in processes called dedifferentiation, transdifferentiation and reprogramming. Consciousness time travel . In X-Men: Days of Future Past, Kitty Pryde uses her phasing powers to send the consciousness of Wolverine back in time to his 1973 body. People would not need to achieve physical time travel to become wealthy, noted Conrad: 'Sending a numerical thought message to yourself one to two hours in the past would enable you to unscrupulously win the National Lottery, Euromillions, Mega Millions and Powerball, at least until new laws were passed to prevent such an unfair advantage.'","The 12-inch metal claws were built by 32-year-old plumber Colin Furze .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin have been spotted searching for a new apartment as their current apartment rent is too steep. The disgraced former congressman and his political advisor wife have been living in an apartment which is estimated to cost $12,000-per-month in rent since he resigned amid a sexting scandal in 2011. The Flatiron apartment was being rented to them by Democratic donor Jack Rosen, who is close with Bill Clinton, the former president who officiated Weiner and Abedin's nuptials. Park Avenue digs: Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner have been living on Park Avenue South ever since he sold his Queens co-op during the 2011 sexting scandal that required him to resign from office . Inevitable: Weiner blasted CitiHabitats on Twitter after the broker spoke to a tabloid about what apartment the couple were considering . Now they are looking to move to a slightly cheaper apartment with their son Jordan but are apparently staying in the neighborhood. The New York Post reported that the couple have been seen looking at a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath apartment in a doorman building on East 23rd Street. CitiHabitats realtor Brian Morgan allegedly showed the couple the $8,000-per-month apartment in the modern building. 'He didn’t talk much; she was very nice. She was in control. She was asking all the questions and was way more vocal,' Mr Morgan told The Post. It comes as little surprise that just hours after the report was published, the former Congressman blasted the real estate company for not only allowing their broker to publicly speak about their working relationship, but to publicize it on their own Twitter account. Even though Weiner put down the company as having 'no class brokers', he didn't deny the report. The new building that they are looking at is only a few blocks further east than their current apartment, and it comes as little surprise that they would like to stay in the area: Anthony's brother Jason owns L&W Oyster Bar and Almond, two restaurants in the neighborhood. Daddy duty: Weiner has been regularly spotted with his son in the area around their apartment, taking now-2-year-old Jordan to the grocery store and the playground in Union Square . The couple married in June 2010 and . their home base was the apartment he owned in Forest Hills, which fell . in his congressional district in Queens. Shortly . after he resigned in 2011- meaning that he no longer had to live in the . district that he once represented- the couple sold his co-op apartment . and moved to one of Manhattan's most expensive neighborhoods. Before the scandal, Abedin was best known in political circles for being Hillary Clinton's top aide, and she has worked with the former Secretary of State for decades. Weiner has said in previous interviews that he gave his wife full reign to pick their new apartment amid the controversy he put them both through. They have been seen walking around the neighborhood by MailOnline, with Weiner shopping in the local grocery store and bringing their now-2-year-old son Jordan to the playground in nearby Union Square. Modern look: The couple are now reportedly looking at an apartment in this building on 23rd Street, which is only a few blocks east of the apartment they have called home for the past two years . For a while, they hoped that they would be calling Gracey Mansion home, as Weiner attempted to re-enter the public sphere by running for mayor, but his candidacy ended in flames when more dirty sexts and emails were released by a young woman who had a virtual relationship with the married man after he had already resigned from office. Now Abedin is still working for Mrs Clinton, and is considered to be one of the closest ‘gate keepers’ to the likely Democratic presidential candidate. Weiner has made a guest appearance on the new Amazon political comedy Alpha House and is restarting some of the consulting work that he had been doing in the time between his resignation and his failed mayoral bid.","The couple have started looking at other three-bedroom apartments in Manhattan's Flatiron and Gramercy Park neighborhoods .

"By . Sarah Harris . Grammar schools plan to admit more poor pupils, it was revealed yesterday. They are aiming to take a higher proportion of students who are eligible for free school meals by changing admissions policies. Over-subscribed schools could give preference to FSM pupils who pass the 11-plus test, just as children in care are currently given priority. Priority: Grammar schools could give preference to pupils eligible for free school meals, as they already can for pupils in care, according to plans unveiled by the Schools Minister David Laws (file photo) Selective schools also aim to hold more 11-plus ‘familiarisation sessions’ with primary schools, and to develop exams that are ‘resistant to coaching’ to help give a level playing field. Schools Minister David Laws discussed the plans before the Commons education select committee. He highlighted the Coalition’s pupil premium policy – extra cash given to schools based on the number of their pupils eligible for free school meals, given to the poorest, and those in care for six months or longer. He told MPs: ‘We are trying to talk to grammar schools about giving young people fairer access opportunities. ‘We are trying to allow them to use the pupil premium as a factor in their admissions policy, we are trying to encourage them to ensure that testing is fairer to young people.’ Fears: There have long been claims that wealthier pupils 'monopolise' grammar places with private tuition . Some grammar schools admit by ranked order – all candidates are ranked by their 11-plus score. In other areas, pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria, which can include the distance they live from the school. The schools are being encouraged to adopt FSM as another admission criteria. Policy: The plan was unveiled by the Schools Minister David Laws, pictured . Barry Sindall, of the Grammar School Heads Association, said some do this already – but ‘more are likely to do so as they look at the issue’. He said: ‘We have been negotiating with the Department for Education to make sure we can get the right form of words for schools. It’s a decision for each and every individual school... But where people want to do it, we’re looking at ways to support them.’ Mr Sindall said grammar schools ‘are not looking to lower the standard at all’. He added: ‘Schools might have two, three, four categories of criteria where people are given preference. ‘Some schools for example, might include an admission criteria in favour of FSM but only in their local area.’ Education charity The Sutton Trust has said grammar schools are being monopolised by affluent pupils. Its research shows just 2.7 per cent of entrants to grammar schools are eligible for free school meals. In December, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, claimed that ministers should resist calls to expand grammar schools because they are ‘stuffed full’ of middle-class children and fail to improve social mobility. ‘Sharp-elbowed’ parents who move house to get children into top schools are not at fault, the Schools Minister said yesterday. David Laws rejected the idea that those who pay a premium to live in good catchment areas should be blamed. He said: ‘To do all you can to help your children succeed in life is exactly what we want everybody to be doing. ‘So I’m afraid that we can’t cap any of those opportunities. What we need to do is extend them to those young people who are not getting them at the moment.’ He also attacked the ‘tolerance of failure’ for poorer pupils.","Plans were revealed yesterday by the Schools Minister David Laws .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporters . Updated: . 16:53 EST, 29 August 2013 . A New Jersey woman was sentenced to 18 months parole Thursday for abandoning her pet pit bull in 2011. The pit bull named Patrick was found around St. Patrick's day in 2011 in her apartment building's dumpster. He weighed an emaciated 19 pounds and was covered in sores. While his former owner Kisha Curtis, 29, denies ever having thrown the dog in the garbage, she has admitted to leaving Patrick outside her hallway while she left for a week. Miraculously, Patrick survived. WARNING: Graphic content . Parole: Newark, New Jersey mother Kisha Curtis was sentenced to 18 months parole today after she was convicted of animal abuse . Before and after: Curtis' dog was found at the bottom of her apartment building's trash chute wrapped in plastic, and severely underweight. Patrick's new owner nursed the pit bull back to health . Fair sentence: Outside the courtroom, Curtis told News 12 New Jersey that she found the ruling fair. Animal rights activists did not agree . Curtis, who cares for three of her children, plead guilty to fourth-degree animal cruelty late last month. Kisha's sentencing today came as quite a shock to Patrick's supporters who attended. The group called 'The Patrick Movement' was pushing for the maximum sentence: 18 months in prison. In his sentencing, Essex County Judge Joseph Cassini III said that Curtis has been 'tried in the court of public opinion' and 'portrayed as a monster' in the weeks after her arrest. He explained that while he himself was a dog owner and lover, Curtis' case needs to be put in perspective. He mentioned a case he was dealing with later in the day involving a man who killed a police officer. 'On a scale of 10, with 10 being the most serious, Ms. Curtis' case, from where I sit, is around a three or a four,' he said. 'In this case, fortunately, no one was killed; Patrick survived and is thriving. We have to put things in perspective.' Permanent home: An upside of today's ruling is that Patrick gets to stay with his new owners, the veterinarian and his wife who initially nursed the dog back to health . That sentence was a let down for the many who championed a stricter punishment for Curtis. 'I just wanted her to serve some time,' said Allison Ognibene. 'She left this dog to die. After 2 1/2 years of dragging this out, I don't think justice was served.' Curtis' attorney was happy with the decision, highlighting the fact that Curtis' court ordered mental health and substance abuse counseling seems to be working. 'She has done well the last two years; she has been a model citizen,' Rivera said. '(The judge) followed the law and followed it justly.' Because of the level of the offense, and the fact that she didn't have a prior record, Rivera says that her client was entitled to the probationary term. While Curtis may not be spending time locked up like her opponents would like to see, er actions have caused a change in the way crimes like this will be dealt with in the future. Last month, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed into law 'Patrick's Law' which increases the fines and maximum prison sentences for animal cruelty offenses. And a positive of today's ruling is that Patrick gets to stay with his new owners, the couple who originally nursed him back to health. Living corpse: Patrick was found a day before St. Patrick's Day in 2011 at the bottom of Curtis' apartment building trash chute, wrapped in plastic and very malnourished . Abused: Patrick was in bad shape when he was brought into Garden State Veterinary Specialists . Throughout the trial, Curtis continued to deny ever abusing Patrick . She claimed that she left the puppy in a hallway before it was found by someone else in the bottom of a trash shoot bone thin, curled in a ball and near death. The dog has since miraculously made a full recovery while now weighing a remarkable 50lbs after he was discovered moments before the trash compactor would have killed him. After the court decision today, Patrick will live permanently with his new owners: the Scavelli family. Dr and Mrs Scavelli run the Tinton Falls veterinary facility where the dog was first treated and are responsible for saving his life . Miracle recovery: Though they originally considered euthanasia, Patricial Smillie-Scavelli and her husband decided to give Patrick a chance at life . While the obviously horrific trauma the dog ensured as seen from some of the first pictures revealed inevitably left emotional and physical scarring, those who know Patrick talk only of how loving and trusting he is. 'He is a tremendous fighter,' said Dr . Thomas Scavelli, the director and founder of the Garden State . Veterinary Specialists, the pet hospital in Tinton Falls where Patrick . has been treated. His . wife, Patricia Smillie-Scavelli, told Irish Central: 'He really gives . love. He climbs into your lap, he would prefer to sit in your lap than . lay on the floor. He also sleeps in our bed at night, along with the . cat.' Recovered: Patrick loves sleeping in his owner's bed at night . A better life: Now back to a normal weight and living with a loving family, Patrick is thriving . Though understandably Patrick remains nervous around strangers, reported NBC, a treat or two quickly remedies his fear. 'There are very few animals, or any life form, that could have gone through and survived what he has, and really never looked back,' said Dr Scavelli of his courageous recovery. And few who have simultaneously become so much of a celebrity. Hospital staffers have chronicled his progress on their website . and a Facebook page has garnered fans from around the world. He's received hundreds of emails, donations, gifts and letters from those inspired by his tale of survival. The hospital ordered 500 thank-you cards with Patrick's picture to mail . to those who have sent collars, dog shirts, toys, scrapbook pages or dog . blankets embroidered with Patrick's name, and they are fast running out. When . Patrick was brought to the hospital after being rescued by officials at . the Associated Humane Societies, he was so starved, emaciated and . dehydrated he was curled into a ball, unable to walk or stand. His ribcage protruded, he . weighed about 20 pounds - roughly 30 pounds less than average - and was . covered in sores with parts of skin hanging off him, according to Mrs . Smillie-Scavelli. Famous dog: Patrick in 2011, posing with a bouquet of flowers sent from a supporter all the way in Alaska . 'Everyone thought that, you bring in . an animal like that, that looks like it's really just a corpse, you put . it to sleep,' Mrs Smillie-Scavelli said. 'But . of course, he looked up at you with those eyes, and you say: How can . you give up on this dog? How can you, when he's not giving up on life? So, we gave him that second chance, and he has just run with it, and . thrived.' - Vets on their decision to not euthanize Patrick . After weeks of emergency measures that . included a transfusion of three pints of dog blood, a special diet, . medicine and physical therapy, Patrick began to gain weight and eat . solid food. He also started to enjoy taking outdoor walks in the sun and playing with the many toys that well-wishers had sent him. 'This . is not a month of starvation,' Dr Scavelli said soon after his rescue. 'This is a lifetime probably, or at least months and months of neglect, . and to see the way he cares for people and trusts people, that's really . been the most interesting and rewarding thing to see about the canine . spirit.' Authorities said Curtis tied the dog to a railing in her Newark apartment building and left the state for more than a week. A janitor later found the emaciated dog in a trash bin. Her mother told reporters at her daughter's court hearing that the dog had been given to Kisha but she could not take care of it, so she'd tied it up outside hoping somebody else would take it. The Essex County courthouse has also received more than 600 letters and . faxes from around the world expressing concern for the dog and urging . swift and harsh punishment for Curtis. 'In the 17 years we've been here we've never seen this type of response . to an animal,' Mrs Smillie-Scavelli said. 'There's something about . Patrick that has really sparked interest, honestly, from throughout the . entire world.'","Kisha Curtis, 29, was sentenced to 18 months probation on animal abuse charges .

"By . Hannah Roberts . Allegations: Naomi Campbell will face a trial in Italy after it was claimed that she assaulted a photographer in 2009 . Naomi Campbell has been ordered to stand trial for an alleged attack on an Italian photographer, which put him in hospital. The supermodel allegedly flew at paparazzo Gaetano Di Giovanni battering him and scratching him, after he took pictures of her on holiday with her billionaire ex-boyfriend. Mr Di Giovanni claimed his face was scratched and bruised after Miss Campbell, allegedly slapped him and hit him with her handbag. The supermodel’s ‘nails had damaged his left eye’, he told Italian newspaper La Repubblica. ‘For a few seconds I could not see a thing. I could hear that her bodyguards and her boyfriend were trying to drag her away.’ He told the Italian newspaper: ‘First she hit with her bag, screaming at me and then she tried to slap me. ‘I managed to avoid her – but her nails still got my eye. Miss Campbell denies the allegations and in a statement today her spokesman said: 'Three years ago Ms Campbell was the victim of paparazzi harassment in Italy. 'The photographer has claimed to have been attacked by Ms Campbell, a claim our client has categorically denied and her team is confident to prove this in court later this year'. The alleged attack took place on the island of Lipari off the coast of Sicily in July 2009. Di Giovanni claims it took three days to recover from an eye injury, which he said was certified by medical experts at a local emergency room. The Streatham-born model has been summoned to appear in court in Sicily on December 4, legal sources told the Italian news agency ANSA. Lipari is part of the Eoliean Islands, a chain of volcanic islands stretching between Sicily and the mainland. Holiday isle: It is claimed that the alleged attack took place on the island of Lipari in 2009 when Miss Campbell was holidaying with her billionaire ex-boyfriend . Excitement: Naomi Campbell and Vladimir Doronin, pictured together in 2011, caused quite a stir when they arrived on the holiday island of Lipari by yacht in 2009 . Miss Campbell had caused a sensation when she arrived on the island by yacht with her Russian boyfriend Vladislav Doronin. Over a career that has spanned spanned four decades the beauty has acquired a reputation for having a short temper. She was sentenced to attend anger-management classes in 1998, after striking her personal assistant Georgina Galanis with a mobile phone. Court appearance: Miss Campbell is led from a US court in 2007 after facing charges of throwing a mobile phone at a housekeeper . By 2007, five other employees claimed Miss Campbell abused them. The following year she admitted attacking police at Heathrow in a row over lost luggage. And in 2010 she reportedly punched and slapped her limousine driver, again with a mobile phone.

"By . Sarah Harris . Examiners have included JB Priestley's classic 'An Inspector Calls' on the GCSE syllabus . British authors including J.B.Priestley and Meera Syal dominate a new English Literature GCSE amid the dropping of classic American fiction. To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee and John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men have been ditched by an exam board, along with Arthur Miller’s A View From the Bridge. Instead, teenagers will focus on Japanese-born British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, George Orwell and English playwrights Dennis Kelly and Charlotte Keatley. OCR has blamed the decision on . Education Secretary Michael Gove’s desire for English Literature to be . ‘more focused on tradition’ and fewer opportunities to include such . texts on the British dominated syllabus. It . yesterday published proposed new content for English Literature GCSEs . as more than 50,000 people signed a petition, protesting at government . reforms to the exams. The new courses will be taught in schools from next September, following accreditation by regulator, Ofqual. Pupils face a two-hour paper on ‘exploring modern and literary heritage texts’. Schools must choose one set text from a choice of four British novels and two plays as well as a 19th century book. The . modern texts are: Meera Syal’s Anita and Me; Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let . Me Go; George Orwell’s Animal Farm; J.B.Priestley’s An Inspector Calls; . Charlotte Keatley’s My Mother Said I Never Should and Dennis Kelly’s . DNA. The 19th century prose includes Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations; Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice; H.G.Wells’ The War Of The Worlds; Robert Louise Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre. An ‘exploring poetry and Shakespeare’ section features Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, Macbeth and Much Ado About Nothing. In the previous OCR specification, under ‘prose from different cultures’, pupils could study Of Mice and Men; To Kill A Mockingbird; Anita and Me; Amy Tan’s The Joy Luck Club; Roddy Doyle’s Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha and Athol Fugard’s Tsotsi. However, the decision to drop Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize winning 'To Kill A Mockingbird' has been criticised by campaigners . A View From A Bridge used to feature in a ‘modern drama’ section, along with R.C. Sherriff’s Journey’s End; Willy Russell’s Educating Rita; Harold Brighouse’ s Hobson’s Choice and Alan Bennett’s The History Boys. Paul Dodd, OCR’s head of GCSE and A-level reform, said: ‘While the restrictions mean that there is no room for texts such as Of Mice and Men or To Kill a Mocking Bird, the new syllabus does include exciting additions such as the play DNA by Dennis Kelly and Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go, both appearing for the first time. ‘We understand of course that the new syllabus will be a challenge for teachers (..)  but we will be with them every step of the way.’ He added: ‘The essential thing is that in the new GCSE English Literature you cannot do fiction or drama from 1914 unless it is British. This cuts out John Steinbeck’s Of Mice and Men and other similar texts.’ The Department for Education has insisted that its document about content for the subject, published last year, ‘doesn’t ban any authors, books or genres’. New English Literature GCSE courses must include at least one play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’. Exam boards can add extra books, but OCR has pointed out that the rules leave very left little room for 20th century writing outside Britain. Mary Stevens, an English teacher from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, who has launched a petition against the reforms, said: ‘Do we teach literature in English or the literature of England?’ She added: ‘By telling us we have to teach Romantic poets, a 19th century novel, a Shakespeare play and a British text, he (Gove) is taking choice away from teachers; that is the reality. ‘This doesn’t broaden the curriculum in real terms.’ Referring to the reforms, a Department for Education spokesman said: ‘That is only the minimum pupils will be expected to learn. It is now up to exam boards to design new GCSEs, which must then be accredited by the independent exams regulator Ofqual.’ Meanwhile five per cent of marks in the OCR English Literature GCSE will be allocated to accurate spelling, punctuation and grammar and 20 per cent in English Language.","Harper Lee's classic To Kill a Mockingbird has been pulled from the GCSE syllabus .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Updated: . 08:47 EST, 8 October 2011 . A nationwide face recognition service is to be activated in some U.S. states by the FBI which will allow local police to identify suspects. The program, part of a $1 billion overhaul of the FBI's existing fingerprint database, will begin by mid-January and will allow police to pinpoint wanted criminals more quickly and accurately, . Other biometric markers such as iris scans and voice recordings will also be implemented into the revamped database, it has been reported. Police scanner: It is hoped the face recognition software will help law enforcement pinpoint wanted criminals more quickly and accurately . Bureau officials told Nextgov that the new face recognition feature could help provide the 'missing link' for police for unsolved cases. Nick Megna, from the FBI's criminal justice information services division, said: '[Law enforcement authorities] have a photo of a person and for whatever reason they just don't know who it is [but they know] this is clearly the missing link to our case.' It would allow officers to use the software to retrieve mugshots of suspects and rank them on in order of similarity to the features of the person in the picture. Currently, FBI agents need to have the name of an individual to find a suspect's mugshot within the 10 million images stored in the bureau's Integrated Fingerprint Identification System. Big Brother: The FBI, whose Washington headquarters are pictured here, have been accused of using local police to create a 'massive surveillance system' The next generation identification system will allow analysts to upload a photograph and, depending on the number of results, could be given a list of potential matches within 15 minutes. Megna added that the service does not provide a direct match. The service is to be trialled in Michigan, Washington, Florida and North Carolina this winter before it is offered to other justice professionals across the country in 2014. However, critics say they are concerned that the system could be abused, for instance, by swapping information with other government agencies to check immigration  immigrants are in the country illegally. 'The federal government is using cops to create a massive surveillance system' There are also concerns about accuracy and civil liberties. Sunita Patel, a  staff attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights, said told Nextgov: 'Any database of personal identity information is bound to have mistakes. 'And with the most personal immutable traits like our facial features and fingerprints, the public can't afford a mistake.' She also said she was worried about local police gathering information for federal law enforcement. She added: 'The federal government is using local cops to create a massive surveillance system.' Questions were also raised over whether innocent Americans would be identified by the facial recognition feature by, for instance, retrieving mugshots of people who had only been arrested and were not guilty of any crime. Megna responded by saying the system would not change the way FBI works and serves to help local police to identify suspects in pictures. He added that the bureau had in place an elaborate system to protect existing databases of fingerprints, palm prints, mug shots and all other criminal data.","Program will overhaul the FBI's fingerprint database .

"By . Sarah Harris . Scruffy new teachers will be forced to dress smarter and get a tighter grip on pupil misbehaviour under an Ofsted shake-up. They will be expected to project a more professional image in the classroom to set a better example to their students. Ofsted insists that from ‘day one’, trainees and freshly qualified teachers should act and dress in a way that befits their position. Crackdown: Scruffy new teachers will be forced to dress smarter under an Ofsted shake-up. They will be expected to project a more professional image in the classroom to set a better example to their students . The move is part of a crackdown on teacher training providers, which the watchdog believes are not adequately preparing new recruits for the rigours of the classroom. Ofsted yesterday launched a consultation on a revised framework for inspecting initial teacher education (ITE), which will be implemented in June. This places a greater emphasis on trainees’ handling of pupil misbehaviour and the standard of their ‘professional dress and conduct’. Inspectors will judge the quality of their training in how to instil discipline and cope with bad behaviour. Concern: Ofsted's chief inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, warns that trainee teachers are being sent into classrooms inadequately prepared . Specific attention will be paid to how well trainees ‘manage behaviour effectively to ensure a good and safe learning environment’. Inspection frameworks will be changed to ensure that inspectors can ‘directly observe how well trainees teach nearer the end of their training’. They will also return to assess newly qualified teachers (NQTs) in the first term of their employment as part of a two-stage inspection process. At present Ofsted does a single visit - observing the teaching of trainees and former trainees based in the same schools or colleges. Referring to the shake-up, the consultation document says: ‘We believe that this will allow a sharper focus on trainees’ outcomes and how well they are prepared for teaching and the rigours of the classroom.’ In a speech to the North of England education conference in January, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw, warned that trainee teachers are being sent into classrooms inadequately prepared. He said: ‘How many times have I heard that trainees are being sent into schools without proper guidance on professional behaviour or dress?’ ‘How many times have I heard that trainees have been inadequately prepared to deal with poor behaviour?’ Sir Michael said that if trainee teachers are struggling in the classroom, the college where they trained should share some of the responsibility. He added: ‘Ofsted has not been as demanding as it should have been with training providers who have sent newly qualified teachers out into schools unprepared for the rigours of the classroom. ‘In my view, there is no such thing as a bad NQT (newly qualified teacher), just one that is badly trained, poorly accredited and badly supported.’ Sean Harford, Ofsted national director of Initial Teacher Training, said yesterday: ‘Parents know that it is really important that trainee teachers get the best quality training before they face a classroom of pupils or students. Discipline: New teaching recruits will also be forced to get a tighter grip on pupil misbehaviour. The move is part of a crackdown on teacher training providers, which Ofsted believes are not adequately preparing new recruits . ‘That’s why from June, Ofsted will raise standards for teacher training partnerships to make sure that all new teachers are as ready as they can possibly be to excel in the classroom.’ An Ofsted spokesman added: ‘We are not being prescriptive about what teachers should and should not wear. ‘But we are clear that teachers must, on day one, conduct themselves and be dressed in a manner which befits their professional status.’ Ofsted inspects all training which leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) for maintained schools and further education teacher training that has been endorsed by higher education institutions. Its public consultation runs until May.","New teachers expected to project more professional image in classroom .

"By . Fiona Macrae, Science Correspondent . It’s often said you are what you eat. But it seems that what your mother ate is also important. Research points to a woman’s diet before she becomes pregnant affecting the genes of her future child. Preparation: A woman's diet before she becomes pregnant affects the genes of her future child, new research suggests . What is more, pre-conception diet may have a life-long impact on the as yet unborn child’s health. Researcher Andrew Prentice, of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ‘The key message is that a mother’s nutrition before she becomes pregnant is super-critical. ‘There is a lot going on before the moment of conception.’ The science is still in its infancy, but it could lead to women who want to start a family being advised to take a cocktail of vitamins and other food supplements ahead of pregnancy. To pin down the effect of a mother’s diet on health, Professor Prentice studied women in rural West Africa, where the marked seasons lead to distinct changes in the foods eaten. Working with colleagues from the Medical Research Council’s unit in the Gambia, he measured the concentration of various nutrients in the blood of nearly 170 newly-pregnant women. Half had conceived at the height of the rainy season and half had become pregnant at the peak of the dry season. Stocking up: Good sources of the nutrients needed to make chemical changes include milk, green leafy vegetables and protein . He also . scrutinised the DNA of their babies after they were born and quizzed . other local women about their diet through the seasons. Crunching the results together showed a clear link between a woman’s diet and her child’s genes. Crucially, it was what she ate before pregnancy that was important – not what eaten when carrying the child. The difference involved ‘epigenetic’ changes to the baby’s DNA.  These aren’t mutations but chemical changes that affect when genes become active and how active they are. Not all of our genes are active all of the time, and if they are under or over-active, it can cause problems. Building blocks: Choline, found in eggs, in another influential nutrient, the study found . It is not known if the changes found here affect health but, in other work, Professor Prentice has found linked pre-pregnancy diet to the chemistry of genes involved in obesity, cancer and the immune system. Some changes can be erased over time, others are life-long. Nutrients needed to make the chemical changes include vitamins B2, B6 and B12, as well as choline and methionine and folic acid. Professor . Prentice said that while it is too early to give advice, good sources of . these compounds include, milk, green, leafy vegetables and protein. Women are already advised to take folic acid, or vitamin B9 in the run-up to pregnancy. The professor said: ‘Now research is pointing to the need for a cocktail of nutrients, which could come from the diet or from supplements. ‘What is pretty thrilling is that we seem to have hit on something that has worldwide consequences for women trying to conceive.’ Variations: The diet differences involved 'epigenetic' changes to the baby's DNA (pictured). These are chemical changes that affect when genes become active and how active they are . Almost ten years ago, scientists showed the nutrients in a mouse’s diet before pregnancy can alter the colour of the coat of her future pup. The latest research, published in the journal Nature Communications, is the first to definitively link preconception diet with epigenetic changes in people. It is part of a growing body of research that points to a child’s health being programmed early in life – including in the womb and even before conception. It is argued that these early days shape a child’s chances of everything from developing diabetes in their 40s and 50s to having a heart attack in old age. It is even said that life expectancy can be traced back to those early days and months, as can a lifelong battle of the bulge.","Mother’s nutrition before she becomes pregnant is 'super-critical'

"By . Sarah Harris . The head of Britain's largest teaching union NASUWT, Chris Keates, said that the cameras were stripping teachers of professionalism . Teachers are being treated like ‘lab rats’ and subjected to Big Brother-style surveillance during lessons, it has been claimed. Schools are using CCTV cameras in classrooms to ‘spy’ on staff and monitor their performance as well as check the times they arrive and leave. Some members of staff are being punished for moving chairs and interrupting colleagues’ lessons after headteachers have reviewed footage. This . ‘excessive monitoring’ comes as rising numbers of state schools across . the country are installing cameras as a safety measure. In . December, principal Neil Houchen came under fire after deciding to . install CCTV cameras in the boys' and girls’ toilets at The Eastwood . Academy, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. The . move formed part of a security crackdown on vandals and bullies, but . parents claimed it was a ‘disgusting’ invasion of privacy. More . than 200 schools across Britain are using CCTV cameras in pupils' toilets or changing rooms, according to a Big Brother Watch report two . years ago. Chris . Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, warned that teachers are also . being ‘undermined and stripped of their professionalism’. She . said: ‘Now in some schools, they are being subjected to permanent . surveillance through CCTV cameras. Lab rats have more professional . privacy.’ Around 7,500 members responded to the . union’s CCTV survey. Nearly one in ten teachers (eight per cent) reported cameras in their classrooms. Of these, 89 per cent said they could not switch off the CCTV and 88 per cent said that it was constantly recording their lessons. Over half (55 per cent) said headteachers viewed the footage and 41 per cent claimed it was being used to ‘find evidence to form negative views about staff’. While teachers acknowledged that CCTV could ‘enhance pupil and staff safety’, a third believed it was an invasion of their professional privacy. A third of teachers believed that the cameras were an invasion of their privacy. Teachers are also unable to turn off the cameras in 89 per cent of cases . Some schools are using CCTV to monitor Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) who are believed to be under-performing. One teacher surveyed said they were disciplined for visiting another colleague’s classroom – a five minute disruption that had been recorded on tape. ‘This tape was played back at least ten times by the headteacher and a note of the incident has been put on my file for a year,’ he said. Another spotted senior staff members reviewing CCTV footage in the school office. The teacher said:  ‘When I asked what my head of department was doing watching a colleague in this way she said she was trying to catch him out.’ A member of staff claimed that CCTV had been used against teachers ‘to imply they are handling a situation incorrectly even though the CCTV has no sound’. It was also used to ‘scare’ staff and to punish them, for example when chairs were moved from one ‘zone’ to another, he added. In December, principal Neil Houchen came under fire after deciding to install CCTV cameras in the boys' and girls' toilets at The Eastwood Academy, Leigh-on-Sea, Essex . A teacher said: ‘In my last school it was routinely used to see what time teachers were in class and what they were doing. It was also used to monitor leaving times.’ One teacher said they received an email from their deputy head during a maths lessons ‘asking me to inform pupils that he was watching them on CCTV’. However, a member of staff claimed that their senior management team had ‘erased CCTV when they have been caught on camera being unprofessional’. Ms Keates said: ‘In some cases, teachers reported having their private conversations filmed when the school was not in session. ‘The stories teachers recounted to us in the survey are a shocking catalogue of professional disrespect and unacceptable intrusion. ‘No other professionals are subjected to such appalling treatment. No one should be subjected to the stress and pressure of being watched constantly. ‘The NASUWT will support members in resisting such practices in schools where such abuse is taking place through all appropriate means, including industrial action.’ Members of the NASUWT will debate a motion condemning the excessive monitoring of teachers at their annual conference in Birmingham today. Last July, a report from the British Security Industry Authority (BSIA) estimated there are between 291,000 and 373,000 cameras in state schools, plus a further 30,000 to 50,000 in independent schools.

Some 900 school leaders are paid at least £100,000 including 300 who take home £110,000 or more, according to recent Department for Education figures. Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, yesterday warned that the Government’s overhaul of leadership pay could lead to further large increases. Changes giving governors more flexibility over the awarding of heads’ salaries are being introduced this September. This means they will have greater freedom to ‘rubber stamp’ requests from school leaders for their performance-related rises, Miss Keates warned. But restricted school budgets could lead to less cash being available for the wages of classroom teachers. Chris Keates, NASUWT General Secretary, is demanding greater scrutiny of headteacher pay . Miss Keates said the union was ‘very concerned’ about a possible ‘dash for cash’ from head teachers at the beginning of the autumn term. She said: ‘We’re being extremely vigilant and are preparing ourselves during the summer term for what we think is going to be considerable casework in schools and possibly escalation of (industrial) action at school level where we find that schools have depressed teachers’ salary for arbitrary reasons but headteachers’ salary is increasing. ‘More and more power is being delegated to governing bodies, many of whom, of course, rubber stamp what head teachers say.’ She added: ‘This is public money and our view is there’s a very quick way to resolve this. All the Government has to do is stop exempting headteachers from not having to publish their salaries annually. ‘Every other senior executive in the public sector is required to publish their salary annually, except headteachers. Public money should not be changing hands behind closed doors.’ It emerged earlier this month that one in four secondary school heads now earns at least £100,000, with some receiving almost double that amount. An annual census of the school workforce - published by the Department for Education - showed that 600 heads earned between £100,000 and £109,999 and 300 took home more than £110,000. Prime Minister£142,500 . NHS Consultant£75,249 - £101,451 . Principal Crown Advocate for CPS£70,271 - £80,747 . Member of Parliament£67,060 . CoE Diocesan Bishops£40,600 . Police sergeant£36,519 - £41,040 . Station manager in Fire Service£36,365 - £40,109 . Teacher (outside London)£34,523 - £37,124 . NHS Nurse Team Manager£30,764 - £40,558 . Paramedic£21,176 - £27,625 . All were secondary heads - 600 at academies and 300 at council-operated schools. Two years ago, 700 were on six figures. However, the figures may under-estimate the actual number of large pay packets because another 600 leadership salaries were recorded as ‘misreported’. Earlier this year, the School Teachers’ Review Body, which makes recommendations to the government on teacher salaries and working conditions, said Education Secretary, Michael Gove, had sought ‘maximum discretion’ for governing bodies in setting head teachers’ pay. Outlining its reforms, the STRB said it was providing ‘formal headroom at the top of the pay range to incentivise and reward heads taking on some of the largest and most challenging leadership roles’. It added: ‘Schools are now free to make differentiated, performance-based progression awards to classroom teachers; and have local discretion to pay a higher salary to the very best teachers. We believe similar flexibilities should apply to pay of school leaders.’ Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said yesterday: ‘I am not in favour of publishing individual heads’ salaries because they already have some of the most exposed, scrutinised roles in the public sector.’ A spokesman for the Department for Education said: 'It’s essential we have the best people in place to lead our schools if we are to raise standards. That’s why decisions on pay are down to schools so that they can recruit and retain the highest calibre of school leaders. We are also giving schools the freedom to reward classroom teachers who get the best out of their pupils. 'Academies already publish the salary bands of all teaching staff earning over £50,000. We have accepted the recommendations of the School Teachers Review Body to provide clear guidelines around how governing bodies should decide on headteachers' pay.'","The NASUWT wants greater scrutiny of headteacher pay .

"By . Sarah Harris . A third of strip club  dancers are students who are increasingly likely to come  from middle-class families, a study shows. They have become a ‘core supply group into the sex industries’, with clubs even attempting to recruit pretty girls during university freshers’ week events. Researchers say that the ‘normalisation of porn’ and the rise of ‘raunch culture’ have led to sexual services  such as stripping increasingly being viewed as respectable, particularly among the middle-classes. Extra-curricular: Almost a third of strip club workers are now students, according to a recent study. Some are middle-class and see the cash-in-hand work as a 'bonus' while others need to make ends meet . Some students are secretly joining the industry because they are excited about experiencing a ‘forbidden occupation’ and enjoy the party atmosphere of the clubs. They consider earning cash in hand ‘a bonus’, while other less affluent students are working in strip clubs to help pay for their education. The study was carried out by Leeds University academics Dr Teela Sanders, a reader in sociology, and Dr Kate Hardy, a lecturer in work and employment relations. They interviewed almost 200 dancers from pubs and strip clubs across the UK and found that 29.4 per cent were students. Dr Sanders told the Times Higher Education magazine: ‘Many of these dancers are from middle-class backgrounds – they are not coming from families where money is a big issue.’ One student told the study: 'It's just like party night! I prefer to go to work than go out on a weekend' A number of the students saw themselves as dancers, not sex workers, because ‘selling striptease had become more palatable and socially acceptable’. Dr Sanders added: ‘They enjoyed dressing up to go out and many say it wasn’t too different to heading out on a night out.’ Their study, published by the British Journal of Sociology of Education, claimed that there was a ‘growing acceptance and normalisation of sex work among undergraduate students in the United Kingdom’. It said: ‘Student dancers often saw the financial aspect as only one of the advantages to the work; being in a party atmosphere and part of the night-time economy was often a significant attraction. The decisions to enter the industry are complex, not only driven by financial incentive but also by the desire to engage in a “forbidden” occupation. ‘Students often started dancing with friends as a joint venture, drawn in by the initial excitement of engaging in a transgressive world, and the prospect of earning cash in hand on the night was considered a bonus.’ However, the study found conflicting attitudes between student strippers and other girls. It said: ‘There was a definite tension between the “old school” dancers who were there to earn good money and not socialise, and the new, inexperienced younger women who had a range of motives for entering stripping.’ A 34-year-old dancer called Faith told researchers: ‘There’s kind of the student group that maybe might kind of work from time to time. They see it as an extra boost of cash but (they are) not necessarily amazing at the job ‘cos they don’t do it enough to really know how to work.’ One 23-year-old student, identified as Lana, told researchers: ‘It’s like – just like party night! I prefer to go to work than go out on a weekend really.’ Another student, Anna, 27, said the work was ‘sociable’ and she liked to ‘catch up with everyone’. Many of the students had begun working in clubs after visiting as a customer or starting off doing bar work in the venue. A club manager in a northern city said he put flyers out at freshers’ week events, inviting female students to audition. He claimed that September – when students return to campuses – is a ‘peak time for requests from experienced and inexperienced dancers alike to work a shift’.","Some are middle-class and join industry to experience a 'forbidden' world .

"By . Tara Brady . 'Shaman': Juliette D'Souza persuaded a woman to have an abortion by claiming the unborn child was evil and seriously deformed, a fraud trial has heard . A ‘witch doctor’ told clients she was hanging their money from a magical tree in the Amazonian rainforest when she was in fact spending it on Louis Vuitton handbags, a court heard. Juliette D’Souza, 59, duped people including cancer sufferers out of £1m for ‘sacrifices’ to ward off evil spirits, it is claimed. But the self proclaimed ‘shaman’ used the cash to rent four luxury flats at a time and blow a fortune on jewellery, antique furniture, and holidays, Blackfriars Crown Court heard. The court heard that D’Souza’s victims, mostly referred to her by osteopath Keith Bender, were so ‘under her spell’ that they sold their homes at her request. D’Souza even swindled one woman out of £170,000 before convincing her to have an abortion by claiming that her child would be born seriously deformed, jurors were told. When the woman realised she had been scammed she broke into one of D’Souza’s rented flats in Hampstead, north London, with Mr Bender. The pair discovered drawings of the ‘Evil Eye’ symbol, burned photographs half buried in earth, freezers filled with rotting meat, a brand new barrister’s wig, and her pet monkey Joe in a cage. Mr Bender told the court he referred patients who were having difficulties and personal problems on to D’Souza for treatment. He said the alleged fraudster and former friend would send him on shopping errands at Louis Vuitton on her ‘clients’ behalf’. ‘Juliette asked me every so often to take her to a particular shop on Bond Street, the lead branch of Louis Vuitton’, Mr Bender said. ‘She would say “I’ve been sent by Rebecca to purchase on her behalf”. ‘Juliette would then buy several Louis Vuitton handbags’. Mr Bender said the alleged fraudster and former friend would send him on shopping errands at Louis Vuitton on her client's behalf . Jurors have heard Mr Bender ‘genuinely believed’ that D’Souza had special powers until he found the ‘voodoo black magic’ items in her flat in 2007. He added: ‘We weren’t terribly happy finding and holding those items, we felt that we would be harming ourselves by touching such items. ‘We were frightened and scared just touching those items’. Case: D'Souza pretended to be a shaman who could cure terminal illnesses and help women conceive babies, Blackfriars Crown Court (pictured) was told. She allegedly tricked the woman into parting with £170,000 . The court heard that between 1998 and . 2010 D’Souza duped clients into parting with their cash by claiming she . had supernatural powers that could cure cancer and infertility. She also boasted of celebrity clients including Princess Diana and music mogul Simon Cowell, the jury was told. Mr . Bender said he would sometimes receive payments into his bank account . from D’Souza of up to £55,000 at a time that were from her clients. ‘Juliette . told me that I was simply holding that individual’s monies, that the . woman’s partner wouldn’t want to know about it’, he added. ‘As . soon as the money was paid in I was required to get it out in cash, I . then had to put the money into an envelope and give it to Juliette’. D’Souza claims she has never professed to be a shaman and blames Mr Bender for the fraud. But . the court has heard that a mother of a 10-year-old boy with Down’s . syndrome was conned out of £42,000 by D’Souza in 2004 after she claimed . the cash would cure his behavioural problems. Another . man was allegedly persuaded to hand over £43,000 to D’Souza between . 2004 and 2006 after she claimed his mother and girlfriend would die if . he did not send the money. D’Souza, of Perrin’s Lane, Hampstead, denies 23 charges of obtaining property by deception and fraud. The trial continues.

"By . Sarah Harris . Threats: The escalation of strike action comes as the rift with Education Secretary Michael Gove deepens . Militant teachers yesterday announced a major escalation of strike action which is set to close thousands of schools this term. Members of the National Union of Teachers will walk out on July 10 as a bitter rift with Education Secretary Michael Gove deepens. They will be joined by union members who work in education and local government as Unison, GMB and Unite plan to co-ordinate industrial action. The strike misses the GCSE and A-level exam season. In March, a national strike by the NUT forced the closure of 3,000 schools and pushed thousands more on to reduced timetables. NUT general secretary, Christine Blower, last night accused the Government of failing to make progress in their dispute over teachers’ pay, pensions and workload. She claimed Mr Gove’s education reforms are damaging the teacher profession and making it a ‘totally unattractive career choice’ which will ‘most certainly lead to teacher shortages’. But in an angry exchange of words, the Department for Education insisted there was ‘no justification’ for further strikes as NUT talks with Ministers remain ongoing. It also challenged her portrayal of teaching as being an unappealing profession. A DfE spokesman said: ‘In fact, teaching has never been more attractive, more popular or more rewarding. ‘A record number of top graduates are now applying to become teachers and there have never been more teachers in England’s classrooms, with a rise of 9,000 in the last year.’ He added: ‘Further strike action will only disrupt parents’ lives, hold back children’s education and damage the reputation of the profession.’ The NUT’s campaign is aimed at challenging performance-related pay, changes to pension rules and tackling ‘excessive’ amounts of work. The new system of performance-related pay has brought automatic pay rises to an end, with schools given the flexibility to offer higher salaries to the best teachers. Head teachers can deny pay rises to staff who fail to improve exam results, demonstrate pupil progress, maintain discipline or opt out of extra-curricular activities. The NUT claims the new system is ‘unfair’ and will lead to pay cuts for many because of budget constraints. Changes to pensions would make them less generous and mean teachers retiring later. Ms Blower said: ‘This (strike) action is the responsibility of a Government and Education Secretary who are refusing point blank to accept the damage their reforms are doing to the teaching profession. ‘Strike action is a last resort for teachers and we deeply regret the disruption it causes parents and pupils. This date has been chosen to cause minimum disruption to examinations. ‘Teaching is one of the best jobs in the world but is being made one of the worst under Michael Gove and the Coalition.’ Criticism: Christine Blower, the NUT general secretary, has accused the Government of failing to make progress in their dispute over teachers¿ pay, pensions and workload . The NASUWT joined the NUT in regional strike action across the country last year but did not take part in the March walkout due to Mr Gove agreeing to talks. Last year, Mr Gove told teachers they have never had it so good and accused union leaders of peddling the damaging falsehood that teaching is a ‘depressing and demotivating activity’. Referring to the NUT and NASUWT, he said: ‘The picture these union leaders paint is of a profession which no one rational would want to join – a profession which is unattractive, unrewarding and unfulfilling. ‘The truth, however, is very different. Teaching, as a profession, has never been more attractive, more popular or more rewarding.’ In March, about one in eight schools in England were forced to close fully due the NUT walkout, according to Government estimates, but it is thought that many more were partially shut. Norwich, Waveney in Suffolk, Great Yarmouth and Burnley were yesterday named and shamed by the Department for Education as being among the worst places in England for GCSE results. Secondary schools in 17 areas fail to ensure the majority of their pupils get five A* to C grades including the core subjects of English and maths. Department for Education statistics show that the worst area in England for GCSE results is Norwich, where only 45 per cent of pupils leave school with a set of decent qualifications.","Members of the National Union of Teachers will walk out on July 10 .

"By . Sarah Harris . The rise of online computer games on social media sites could lead to a surge in childhood gambling problems, an expert has warned. They are introducing teenagers to the excitement and rewards of gambling even when they do not involve playing for money. Games such as Candy Crush Saga - which can be played on Facebook - have a ‘moreishness quality’ which hooks players in. Addictive: Candy Crush Saga, pictured, can hook users in for hours at a time and lead to children becoming addicted, according to a report by Nottingham Trent University's International Gaming Research Unit . Players of Candy Crush Saga win points by swiping rows of sweets until they line up three matching ones . Meanwhile many social media sites offer chances to play online poker with virtual money. Cash gambling sites also offer free-play introductory games and because no real money is involved there are no age restrictions. The problem has been highlighted by Mark Griffiths, director of the International Gaming Research Unit at Nottingham Trent University, who is a world authority on gambling. He believes that teachers have a vital role to play in ensuring that children understand not only the potential rewards of gambling but also its risks. Moreish: Children are beating age restrictions on some games, the report said (posed by model) Professor Griffiths wants to see gambling and gaming covered on the timetable during personal, social and health education (PSHE). Such lessons could explore the fact that there must always be more losers than winners. He told the Times Educational Supplement: ‘One of the biggest predictors of whether people become gamblers is the playing of gambling-type games on free-play sites. ‘When you start winning, you start thinking that if I was playing with real money, I could be doing quite well. ‘Children who play those free games are more likely to gamble and more likely to develop problem gambling behaviours. ‘These are gateway activities that can lead people down the gambling road.’ Professor Griffiths insists there is a significant overlap between gambling and seemingly innocuous online games. Many allow players to customise their avatars by spending money on virtual accessories or extra clothing. He said: ‘It’s a psychological masterstroke that people pay money to buy virtual items. The next step is for gambling firms to say, ‘Maybe you could win back some of the money you’re spending’.’ Candy Crush Saga gives players the option of paying money to access higher levels. It has been downloaded more than 500 million times. Professor Griffiths said: ‘It’s a bit like the old drug-dealing analogy of giving a bit for free and hooking them in. ‘Games like Candy Crush have a moreishness quality, a bit like chocolate. You say you’ll just have one chunk and you end up having the whole lot. ‘So you say, ""I’ll just play for 15 minutes"" and you end up still there four or five hours later.’ Writing for the Education and Health journal, Professor Griffiths cites a 2011 study of more than 2,700 British secondary school students, which found that 15 per cent had played free gambling games during the week prior to the survey. One in ten said they had played free games on Facebook. Controversy: Bingo Friendzy touted itself as the first game available through Facebook on which players could win real money. It is only available to over-18s but some bypass the limit, the report said . Cash: The game features cartoon characters similar to Moshi Monsters alongside a traditional Bingo board . Social gaming products such as Candy Crush and Bingo Friendzy are created by third parties and not developed by Facebook. They are hosted on Facebook and other social networking sites. Facebook said it has tough controls in place to protect under-18s and vulnerable people. This includes users undergoing checks on their identity, age and that they are located in the UK. The social networking site adheres to UK rules to protect under age people from gambling products. It said that to all intents and purposes these sorts of services do not exist to people aged under 18 on Facebook. Professor Griffiths highlighted concerns about Bingo Friendzy, available on Facebook, which ‘features cartoon characters similar to Moshi Monsters’, in his paper, Adolescent Gambling Via Social Networking Sites: A Brief Overview. ‘Having studied youth gambling and written two books, I don’t believe gambling games should feature anything that might encourage children or adolescents to gamble,’ he said. ‘Although players have to be aged 18 years to play Bingo Friendzy, research has shown that adolescents regularly bypass the minimum age limits to have a Facebook profile simply by giving false information and/or with the help of their parents.’ King, the company that makes Candy Crush Saga, told the TES that its games were specifically targeted at adult women between the ages of 35 and 50, although the age range of players was currently widening. The majority of people who complete King's games don't pay. Gamble Aware, which encourages responsible gambling, said that two per cent of 11 to 15-year-olds had trouble controlling their gambling behaviour. This is equivalent to 60,000 secondary school pupils in Britain. A spokesman said: ‘Worryingly, those who begin their gambling careers earlier in life are more likely to be problem gamblers in adulthood.’","Report also criticised Bingo Friendzy, which features cartoon characters .

"By . Sarah Harris . Dozens of exam qualifications in subjects such as film studies and home economics are to be axed. Regulator Ofqual plans to cull 14 GCSEs and 29 AS and A levels, while reforming other qualifications. Media studies, for example, is to be reformed in GCSEs, AS and A levels. Under the proposals, film studies will be revamped at GCSE and AS-level but scrapped at A-level. Pay attention! Dozens of exam qualifications in subjects such as film studies and home ec are to be axed . The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities. The aim is to make qualifications in different subjects ‘similar in their level of demand and assessment structure’ and to cut out ‘similar or overlapping’ courses. Tougher GCSEs in English and maths are being introduced from September 2015, and in history, geography, the sciences and languages the following year. In 2016, reformed GCSEs will also be launched in subjects including art and design, music, drama and dance, computer science, PE and religious studies. Ofqual has published a consultation paper on new standards for all other subjects in the secondary curriculum. It plans to ‘regulate in ways that are likely to affect the range of subjects available’ in future and could lead to exam boards ‘choosing not to continue with some existing subjects’. Its report says: ‘We plan to set out clear principles that we will use to determine, before core content is developed, if a subject is likely to lead to the development of the GCSE, AS and A-level qualifications we expect. ‘If a subject does not meet these principles we will not allow it to be developed as a GCSE, AS or A-level subject.’ Shake up: The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities. The GCSEs planned to be discontinued include expressive arts, electronics, catering, home economics, manufacturing, engineering, performing arts and humanities. Home economics – a qualification awarded to 32,064 students in 2012 – and catering – awarded to 20,891 teenagers – are deemed too similar to the new design and technology GCSE in food technology. Performing arts at GCSE, which was awarded to 4,365 students in 2012, is seen as overlapping with new exams in dance and drama. At AS and A-level, courses set to be cut include environmental studies, which overlaps with new science courses, along with human biology, which is listed as similar to biology. A separate list shows 20 GCSE subjects that are being considered for reform including business studies, economics, geology, hospitality and law. There are also 27 AS-level subjects to be considered for reform, along with 26 A-levels. These include media studies, law, history of art, critical thinking and philosophy. Exam boards will be expected to draw up ‘core content’ for each, with input from teachers, employers and higher education. The reformed qualifications will need approval by Ofqual. Revamped qualifications will be first taught from 2017. The majority of unreformed AS and A-levels will go from 2016 and GCSEs from the following year. Ofqual’s chief regulator, Glenys Stacey, said: ‘We will expect exam boards to consider factors such as demand and merit before making a case to us that any subject they choose to develop can meet the standards we set.’ Brian Lightman, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said last night: ‘There are a few areas where we do have concerns about proposals to discontinue popular qualifications, in particular film studies at A-level and home economics at GCSE. We will be picking this up with Ofqual.’","Fourteen GCSEs and 29 AS and A levels will be culled in exam shake up .

"By . Daniel Martin . Bank of England staff have been awarded more than £25million in bonuses since the start of the credit crunch, it emerged yesterday. The payments have been handed out despite the fact that Governor Sir Mervyn King and his top team failed to anticipate the global financial crisis, and did nothing to prevent the Libor interest-rate rigging scandal. Figures yesterday showed that the level of payouts actually increased last year by £200,000 to £4.9million – as Britain returned to recession. Gloom: . Executives at the Bank of England have received bonuses of up to . £30,000 despite Governor Sir Mervyn King and his staff failing to . predict the credit crunch or the Libor interest-rate scandal . One MP called the taxpayer-funded sums ‘rewards for failure’. Over the past five years, thousands of Bank of England executives have received up to £30,000 in performance-related pay. The awards, handed out between when the credit crunch began in 2007 and this year, have totalled £25.3million. They come on top of generous salaries which exceed £150,000 a year for some of the Bank’s senior staff. However, Sir Mervyn, his deputies and members of the committee which set interest rates, are not among those who have received the extra money. Labour MP John Mann said paying bonuses to their staff when the Bank has performed so badly sets ‘a terrible example to commercial banks’, which have been accused of paying too much in bonuses. He added: ‘They [the Bank] should be leading the way in creating a new banking culture, not leading the way in paying excessive bonuses.’ Sir Mervyn has had to revise the Bank’s economic forecasts a dozen times since the credit crunch began, most recently on Wednesday, when he downgraded a previous 0.8 per cent growth prediction to zero. Last month the Bank of England injected an additional £50 billion into . the economy through its quantitative easing programme bringing the total . stock to £375billion . Mr Mann, a member of the Commons Treasury select committee, added: ‘It beggars belief that they could be paying bonuses at this time. They failed to pick up on the Libor scandal, they failed to pick up on other wrong-doings. ‘They have failed to properly analyse what is happening in the economy. It is totally wrong that they should be rewarded for failure.’ A spokesman for the Bank of England defended the bonuses. She said: ‘Our staff are on a two-year pay freeze which began in 2011. ‘Bonus payments are based on individual performance. The pot has been frozen at 6 per cent of the total salary bill for the past three years. Average awards for the past five years have been between £2,000 and £3,000.’","Thousands of Bank executives have received bonuses of up to £30,000 in performance related bonuses .

"By . Sarah Harris . Tough start: Alex Ferguson, pictured aged 11, said the belt that once beat him at school is now his prized possession . Sir Alex Ferguson keeps the belt he was beaten with by his favourite schoolteacher, it has been revealed. The former Manchester United manager said he was inspired by the ‘fierce’ Elizabeth Thomson who taught - and harshly disciplined - him as a boy. Despite corporal punishment being banned from British state schools in 1987, Sir Alex admitted he had fond memories from his schooldays in the 1950s when teachers did not ‘spare the rod’. In an interview for the Times Educational Supplement’s My Best Teacher (please credit) feature, the 72-year-old described how he would stand, hands out, waiting for his punishment from Mrs Thomson. Sir Alex, who built a fearsome reputation for disciplining his players, was a pupil at Broomloan Road Primary School in Glasgow, where Mrs Thomson personally visited the parents of truanting children. He admitted that his teacher’s ‘gritty determination’ had rubbed off him and the belt was now a prized possession at his home. He said: ‘It’s in my study. My grandchildren are terrified of it. Six from that belt and you were in absolute agony. I used to try to draw my hand away. ‘But that was the sort of punishment you had if you stepped out of line. In my case, it was usually for fighting in the playground. ‘She took an interest in kids, though. If she was worried that they weren’t eating much at home, she’d sure as hell make sure that they ate well at school.’ Sir Alex kept in touch with his former teacher throughout his trophy-laden career in football with Rangers, Aberdeen and Manchester United. He said: ‘When she died, I couldn’t go to the funeral because Manchester United were playing abroad, but months later I received a parcel. ‘She had bequeathed her belt to me. Her nephew sent it to me along with a letter that said: “You’ll know more about this belt than anyone”.’ Sir Alex described Mrs Thomson as having an ‘incredible drive’ which ‘commanded the utmost respect from students’. He said: ‘Elizabeth Thomson was an inspiration to me. ‘That’s the perfect word to describe her. The area of Glasgow I grew up in, Govan, had one of the highest truancy rates in the city. Lesson learnt: Sir Alex Ferguson with his old teacher Elizabeth Thomson. He describes how he would stand outside waiting for her punishment . ‘She came from a different world, really. She was from a middle-class, wealthy family, but she had a raw determination about her. ‘When she first got to Broomloan Road Primary, she went round to the house of every student who wasn’t in her class that day and said, “If your kid isn’t in school tomorrow, I’ll be back at your door”. ‘Maybe 2,000 teachers turned the job down, turned down that sort of challenge, but she thrived on it. She improved everyone she touched. She actively sought out challenge. ‘The three ingredients to Elizabeth, when I think about it, were personality, determination and energy. Anyone who’s in charge of someone else needs those three ingredients. It just won’t work without them.’ He added: ‘When I think about her now, I realise that it wasn’t all about education. Mrs Thomson endeavoured to make you want to be the best you could be. Contact: Sir Alex kept in touch with his former teacher throughout his trophy-laden career in football with Rangers, Aberdeen and Manchester United . ‘Did she help to form my character? Well, she had a gritty determination about her; a competitive nature. ‘On a Friday afternoon, she’d always give an hour of playing rounders. Once, I was batting and I tapped the ball, then did the bare minimum to get to first base. ‘“Ferguson!” she roared. “You tap that ball again and I will have you.” So I battered the next ball out of sight and ran like hell. ‘She was good like that. She got you performing, you know? ‘Yes, I think there’s part of me that comes from her. That determination and that sense of drive. That ‘never give in’ attitude she had about all her students.’ Sir Alex is a patron of education charity Shine, which runs Let Teachers Shine, a competition to fund innovative teacher-led ideas to raise attainment in the classroom.","Former Manchester United manager was inspired by his 'fierce' teacher .

Ten percent of water samples taken from U.S. coastal and lake beaches fail to meet safety standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a new report finds. 'There can be hidden dangers lurking in many of our waterways in the form of bacteria and viruses that can cause a great inventory of illnesses like dysentery, hepatitis, stomach flu, infections and rashes,' Steve Fleischli, water program director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said.

Nasty: Beachwood Beach in Ocean County New Jersey had water samples below safety standards . California:  Malibu Pier, 50 yards East of the pier, in Los Angeles County . Indiana: Jeorse Park Beach in Lake County . Massachusetts: Cockle Cove Creek in Barnstable County . Maine: Goodies Beach in Knox County . New Jersey: Beachwood Beach in Ocean County . New York: Main Street Beach in Chautauqua County . The findings confirm that water pollution caused by storm-water runoff and sewage overflows persists at many U.S. beaches, the agency said. Storm-water runoff often includes trash, chemicals, oil and animal and human waste as well as bacteria and viruses. 'It's really all of our urban slobber going untreated into local waterways,' Fleischli said. Swimming in bacteria-infested waters can cause stomach flu, skin rashes and pinkeye. The report stated that children tend to be most susceptible to these and other waterborne illnesses likely because they tend to submerge their heads. Beaches in California, Illinois, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Wisconsin were listed as ‘repeat offenders.’ Sickening: Two-thirds of beach closings and advisories were caused by bacteria levels surpassing public health standards . Hazardous: It may look pristine, but Malibu Pier, 50 yards east of the pier, in Los Angeles County had violations . Delaware: Dewey Beach-Swedes in Sussex County . Florida: Bowman's Beach in Lee County . Georgia: Tybee Island North in Chatham County . Massachusetts: Singing Beach in Essex County . New Jersey: Stone Harbor at 96th St. in Cape May County . Louisiana fared particularly poorly, with 29 per cent of the reported water samples below safety standards, followed by Ohio, Illinois and Indiana. A . dozen U.S. beaches received a five-star rating . indicating strong testing and safety practices, as well as low violation . rates. The agency singled out 35 popular 'superstar' beaches that have excellent water quality. Each of these met national water quality standards 98 percent of the time over the past five years. Silver lining: Despite a number of beaches violating national recommended health standards, Long Beach City in New York was names as one of the cleanest the nation . In the Great Lakes, 13 percent of samples failed to meet federal public health standards, the researchers said. Other regions with excessively high bacteria in swimming water samples include: the Gulf Coast (12 percent), New England (11 percent), the western coast (9 percent), New York and New Jersey coasts (7 percent), and the southeast (7 percent). States with the highest failure rates include: Ohio (35 percent), Alaska (24 percent) and Mississippi (21 percent). For cleaner water, try the Delmarva Peninsula area on the East Coast, where 4 percent of samples failed the test. Three states had a failure rate of just 3 percent: Delaware, New Hampshire and New Jersey, the researchers found. Beach-goers who wish to avoid swimming in polluted waters are advised to choose beaches away from urban areas; stay away from pipes that drain storm water runoff; and avoid swimming for at least a day after heavy rains. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that up to 3.5million people become ill from contact with raw sewage from sanitary sewer overflows each year, and that number could even be higher since many people who become ill after swimming in polluted water are unaware of the underlying cause of their symptoms, and it often goes unreported.

"By . Sarah Harris . Parents should tell their children they love them every day to help make them more ready for learning at school, according to new advice from head teachers. Families often assume their sons or daughters feel loved but they need to hear the words frequently to boost their self-esteem. They should also praise youngsters by repeating phrases such as ‘you are learning fast’, ‘that was a kind thing to do’ and ‘keep working on it, you’re nearly there’. Parents should tell their children they love them every day to help make them more ready for learning at school, according to new advice from head teachers (file picture) The recommendations are contained in a leaflet, Your Child’s Wellbeing: A Short Guide For Parents, issued by the school leaders’ union, the National Association of Head Teachers and the Family Action charity. But education campaigners have condemned the advice as ‘nanny state meddling’, insisting that parents do not need ‘patronising’ reminders from head teachers about how to speak to their children. The leaflets are being distributed to NAHT’s 28,500 members who will share them with parents at their schools. They are the fifth in a series produced by the NAHT and Family Action, with other topics covering literacy and numeracy and speaking and listening. The latest top tips for parents include trying to be a ‘positive role model’ by not shouting or swearing in front of children and establishing boundaries to help them ‘feel safe’. They should praise their child’s efforts as well as achievements, for example telling them they’ve done well for trying hard and that it’s okay to make mistakes. When their son or daughter does something wrong, they should ‘tell them, but focus on their action and how to do better next time’. A section on raising self-esteem adds: ‘When things are difficult help your child to see it as part of life and learning and that it happens to all of us. Teach your child not go give up and to keep trying. Bernadette Hunter, NAHT president, said: 'If children feel happy and healthy at home then they come into the classroom free from worries and ready to learn' (file picture) ‘Listen to your child and show them you value their views and opinions.’ Other tips include encouraging children to eat a balanced diet, bake and help prepare family meals and exercise vigorously for at least 30 minutes each day. The leaflet suggests getting out and about as a family, playing tag in the park or going on a bike ride together. Saying ‘well done’ will encourage children to ‘learn that taking on challenges and making mistakes is an essential part of learning’. Under ‘emotional well-being’, it adds: ‘Tell your child that you love them every day’. But Chris McGovern, a former head teacher and chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said that ‘99.9 per cent of parents’ don’t need that reminder and ‘instinctively’ say such things. He said: ‘Head teachers need to trust parents more. Mostly parents don’t need that sort of advice. It’s nanny state, it’s interfering, it’s patronising and it’s unnecessary. ‘It’s almost discouraging parents from following their natural instincts and doing what’s right. By saying ‘we’re taking over’, you’re going to undermine parents and probably damage the children. ‘It’s yet another example of the State or the profession’s failure to understand that people don’t need to be told the obvious. It’s distrustful in that sense.’ But Bernadette Hunter, NAHT president 2013-14, said: ‘Modern life is so highly pressured for parents that it can be easy to forget to do the little things that can make a real difference to a child’s self-esteem. ‘For instance, sometimes we assume our children know that we love them but children need to hear the words. - ‘Listen to your child and show them you value their views and opinions' ‘If children feel happy and healthy at home then they come into the classroom free from worries and ready to learn. I believe parents are the best partners schools can have in helping pupils make the most of their education.’ She added: ‘The leaflet tells about the importance of helping a child persevere with tasks and reassuring them that it is ok to make mistakes. Trying out some of the suggestions can go a long way to giving children a sense of wellbeing which will give them a good starting point for school life.’ David Holmes, chief executive of Family Action, said: ‘If the practical advice in this simple leaflet makes a parent pause just for a second and reflect on the wellbeing of their child then it will have done a good job.’ * Three-quarters of 1,018 parents surveyed by the NAHT believe that introducing ‘too much change into schools too quickly’ damages their children’s education.","Parents also advised to be 'positive role models' and to lead by example .

"By . Sarah Harris . Competitive parents are stripping the enjoyment from school sport, a leading headteacher has claimed. Leonard Blom, headmaster of St Aubyn’s School, Woodford Green, Essex, said that pushy mothers and fathers are making exhibitions of themselves and damaging children’s confidence. They are losing sight of the importance of ‘good sportsmanship’ and setting a poor example to others, he said. Too competitive: Leonard Blom claimed parents are losing sight of good sportsmanship (file picture) Mr Blom said everyone has seen ‘the hysterical parent pacing up and down the sideline, shouting instructions to the player on the field who is already doing his or her best for the team’. He cited a mother at a swimming gala who paced the swimming pool, yelling encouragement to her daughter who ‘never excelled’ at the sport. The woman did this ‘to the extent that she would collapse in a heap at the end of each race, exhausted at the attempt to get her daughter across to the other end of the pool’. Writing in Attain, the magazine for the Independent Association of Prep Schools, Mr Blom said he had no doubt that the girl would ‘never swim another stroke again’ as soon as she hit puberty. Another ‘over-excited’ father embarrassed himself at a rugby match by ‘hysterically’ shouting instructions and then throwing the ball to the player himself when a boy didn’t respond. Mr Blom, whose school has 500 boys and girls aged three to 13, urged parents to be proud when their child does well and ‘make sure that, win or lose, you love them and are not disappointed with their performance’. Shouting: He cited a mother at a swimming gala who paced the swimming pool, yelling encouragement to her daughter who 'never excelled' at the sport (file picture) In a bid to tackle the problem, Mr Blom has written a series of top tips for parents on how to act at school sporting events, stressing they are ‘not the World Cup’. This includes making an effort to support sons and daughters more, accepting the team they are placed in and not yelling at other players, coaches and officials when they make a mistake. In an article entitled Parents Behaving Badly, he said: ‘You may not even realise that you’re doing it but do make sure you aren’t comparing your child to their team mates. ‘This can start to eat away at their self-confidence. Comments like, ‘You need to run your lines more like James’ or ‘Jane practices all the time, that’s why she’s better’, might not be meant as harmful but it can give the impression that you aren’t proud of what they have achieved.’ Parents should also be ‘realistic’ about their child’s physical ability and stage of development. Mr Blom said: ‘Always remember that children play sport for their enjoyment and not yours. Emphasising improved performances, not just winning, positively reinforces improved skills. ‘It is important that parents control their emotions at games and events - don’t yell at your child, other players, coaches and officials if they make a mistake. Rather be a cheerleader for your child and the team. Claims: Leonard Blom is the head of St Aubyn's School in Woodford Green, Essex . ‘Respect all coaches and do not question their selections. ‘Accept the team your child is selected to play in. They can’t all be in the first team. He/she might be a late developer and, as a result, could make higher team later on at senior school. ‘More importantly, try and be a positive role model - enjoy sports yourself.’ Parents should avoid ‘becoming wrapped up’ in how well their child performs and must remember the need to develop good sportsmanship. He said: ‘By all means shout encouragement, not directions, from the sidelines. ‘Only make positive comments, never bad mouth players, coaches or game officials. If you have a legitimate gripe, discuss it privately with those involved. ‘Always applaud good plays without regard to who makes them and set a good example by congratulating parents of the opposing team when they win.’ Mr Blom’s intervention comes just months after former World Cup footballer, Gary Lineker, warned that families screaming abuse from the sidelines are killing their children’s love of football. In an article in the New Statesman, the Match of the Day presenter hit out at the ‘utterly depressing’ culture of pushy parents attempting to turn their children into footballing superstars. Meanwhile, in December, the football coach of a under-10s village boys’ team in Buckinghamshire was fired after insisting that boys weren’t there to have fun as he was ‘only interested in winning’. Justin Byrne, 42, outlined his views in an email to parents at Chalfont St Peter’s Football Club in Buckinghamshire and was sacked four days later.","Headmaster Leonard Blom said they have lost sight of ‘sportsmanship’

"By . Associated Press . and Sarah Harris . Classic: Maya Angelou's autobiography is being taken off the syllabus by Welsh board WJEC . The British education minister has . sparked anger after American classics have been dropped from high school reading . lists in an attempt to put Britishness back into schools. Michael . Gove has outraged some readers and academics with the campaign, which . has seen longtime American favorites including John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice . and Men' and Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' dropped from the . syllabus for a major high school qualification. Maya Angelou’s autobiography, I . Know Why The Caged Bird Sing, has also been culled by an exam board. The acclaimed author, poet and civil rights activist died on Wednesday . aged 86. Instead, the book . lists for the English Literature GCSE, an exam taken by 16-year-olds . after a two-year course of study, feature almost exclusively writers . from Britain and Ireland. Some educators fear that could lead to the narrowing of British minds. 'The . idea of cutting out American books because they are not British is . crazy,' said John Carey, a literary critic and emeritus professor at . Oxford University. Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison even waded into the debate, telling the Hay Festival that it was wrong . to divide literature into 'nationalistic categories'. She said Mr Gove . would regret the decision. Exam . boards in England and Wales - which set school syllabuses in line with . government rules - have now finished releasing their new book lists for . the English Literature GCSE. Removed: Angelou's autobiography I Know Why The . Caged Bird Sings (book pictured left) and Harper Lee's To Kill A . Mockingbird (right) will no longer be studied by pupils as they are both . 'prose from different cultures' Gone are Lee, Angelou, Steinbeck and . Arthur Miller's play 'The Crucible'. Gone, too, are African and Asian . writers including Haruki Murakami, Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Ngozi . Adiche. Gove strongly denied that his goal was to banish non-British authors. 'I . have not banned anything,' he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. 'All we are . doing is asking exam boards to broaden - not narrow - the books young . people study for GCSE.' The . education department says the guidelines represent the minimum students . are required to learn, and that those who read more widely - and . internationally - will do better on the exams. 'Everyone will have an opinion about which texts should be studied. We can't please everyone' - Exam board spokesman . It . also says pupils are required to study 'seminal world literature' - . including American classics - between the ages of 11 and 14. New GCSEs must include at least one . play by Shakespeare, at least one nineteenth century novel, a selection . of poetry since 1789 including representative Romantic poetry and . ‘fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards’. A DfE spokesman: ‘The new . GCSEs in English Literature will be broader and more challenging for . pupils than those available at the moment. They will give pupils the . chance to study some this country’s fantastic literary heritage, . including works by Jane Austen, George Orwell, Kazuo Ishiguro and Meera . Syal. Michael Gove has come under fire for the changes but insists exam boards have the freedom to choose texts . ‘We have not banned . any authors, books or genres. The exam boards have decided what . literature to include, subject to the minimum requirements we set out. GCSE specifications are only a starting point.’ Mr Gove has also argued that all exam . boards have the freedom to ‘include any number of other texts from which . teachers can then choose’. American favorites including John Steinbeck's 'Of Mice . and Men', Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird', Maya Angelou’s autobiography, 'I . Know Why The Caged Bird Sing' and Arthur Miller's play 'The Crucible' have been dropped from the syllabus. African and Asian . writers have also been dropped including Haruki Murakami, Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Ngozi . Adiche. But . an spokeswoman from one of the exam boards, AQA, said: ‘Whilst . technically it would not be impossible to add additional texts beyond . the essential requirements, to do so would place an unacceptable . assessment burden on teachers and students, which we are clearly not . prepared to do.’ Critics of the new English rules say they will have a restrictive, rather than broadening, effect. 'Michael . Gove wants everybody studying traditional literature, and he wants it . to be British,' said Bethan Marshall, chair of the National Association . for the Teaching of English. 'I think that's a bit of a mistake.' Paul . Dodd, OCR's head of GCSE and A-level reform, has personally blamed Mr . Gove for the 'restrictions', saying that the Education Secretary 'really . dislikes' Of Mice And Men. One . board, OCR, proposed new content features Meera Syal’s Anita and Me; . Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go; George Orwell’s Animal Farm, Dennis . Kelly’s DNA and J.B.Priestley’s An Inspector Calls. Critic: Nobel Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison, pictured last year, said it was wrong to divide literature into 'nationalistic categories'. She said Mr Gove would regret the decision . AQA . lists these texts as well as Stephen Kelman’s Pigeon English; William . Golding’s Lord of the Flies and AQA Anthology, Telling Tales, under . modern prose. In modern . drama, pupils will be able to study Alan Bennett’s The History Boys; . Willy Russell’s Blood Brothers; Shelagh Delaney’s A Taste of Honey and . Simon Stephens’ The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time . (script). Under the ‘19th . century novel’ teenagers will study texts including Robert Louis . Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and Sir Arthur . Conan Doyle’s The Sign of Four. The . AQA poetry selection has a strong emphasis on British and Irish . writers. It includes Byron, Shelley, Tennyson, Seamus Heaney, Thomas . Hardy and Ted Hughes.

"By . Harriet Arkell . and Sarah Harris . Teachers should not tell teenagers to stop watching porn, according to government-backed guidelines. Pupils must instead be taught the difference between real-life relationships and the distorted world of X-rated films. This could involve playing card games in class to decide whether various sexual scenarios belong on ‘Planet Earth’ or ‘Planet Porn’. Children should be taught about porn to help them protect themselves, charities say in new guidance (file image) Porn-addicted secondary school pupils should also be advised to seek help from a ‘trusted, non-judgmental adult’. Schools . should give lessons on pornography to teach pupils that it shows a . 'distorted image' of sex and relationships, according to new guidance. Youngsters . need to learn that pornography does not reflect real life, often . showing 'perfect' bodies and exaggerated sexual prowess', it says. The . document - which has been criticised by an education campaigner for . 'taking children's childhoods away from them' - also calls for students . to be told about the dangers of 'sexting' - sending explicit text . messages - and sharing sexual photos and images. The . new guidance has been drawn up by sexual health charity Brook, the PSHE . Association and the Sex Education Forum in a bid to give schools advice . on how to teach pupils about the topic. It comes in the wake of a report published by Ofsted last year which found that sex and relationships education (SRE) needs to be improved in more than a third of schools. The guidance comes weeks after teachers said children were accessing porn on their phones at break (file image) It . called for secondary school pupils to learn more about issues such as . porn, relationships, sexuality and staying safe, rather than just the . 'mechanics' of reproduction. Teachers . have also spoken out about the issue, with one survey suggesting that . schoolchildren are increasingly having sexually explicit conversations . with each other after being exposed to pornography. The . new advice, which has been welcomed by ministers, says schools should . teach about the impact of pornography, arguing that there is widespread . support from parents for this. 'Teaching . should emphasise that pornography is not the best way to learn about . sex because it does not reflect real life, and can therefore be . worrying, confusing and frightening for young people,' it says. But education campaigner Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, criticised the report's suggestions . He . told MailOnline: 'Internet pornography is a serious issue but schools . need to consult with, and reach agreement with, parents before teaching . about it. 'Many parents do not wish to see their children having their childhood taken away from them - blanket solutions just will not work' - Chris McGovern, Campaign for Real Education . 'Many parents do . not wish to see their children having their childhood taken from them - . they would prefer infants to learn about Thomas the Tank Engine rather . than how to handle porn. 'With regard to this matter 'blanket solutions' just will not work.' The report also says: 'Pupils should understand that . pornography shows a distorted image of sex and relationships, including . 'perfect' bodies and exaggerated sexual prowess. 'SRE . provides opportunities to discuss body image and understand how . pornographic pictures and videos are routinely edited and . 'photoshopped'.' The . document goes on to say that young people are growing up in a culture . where technology and social media are important and there are more . opportunities for sharing personal information. 'SRE should encourage pupils to think about what they want others to know and see about them - whether on or offline.' It . adds: 'Research shows that sexting is of most concern to young people . in their early teens, schools should address privacy and boundaries from . a very early age in the context of personal safety and abuse. 'Specific work about 'sexting' should be addressed in SRE as soon as it is identified as a potential issue.' The advice also warns schools that SRE should be inclusive and that teachers should not assume that all relationships are between opposite sexes. It suggests that sexual health information should include lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people in case studies, scenarios and role-plays, with pupils exploring topics from different points of view. Brook chief executive Simon Blake, said: 'Young people have been telling us for years that SRE is not relevant to their lives and they want better.' The Government already publishes statutory guidance for schools on SRE and the new document, which was welcomed by Schools Minister Lord Nash, is supplementary advice.","New guidance was drawn up by sexual health charity Brook, the PSHE Association, and the Sex Education Forum .

"By . Chris Greenwood, Crime Reporter . Nazakat Ali was jailed for six years today. The immigration lawyer arranged sham marriages . A corrupt lawyer boasted of using 'b*******' European human rights laws to keep immigrants in the UK illegally. Nazakat Ali, 38, said he would use the controversial legislation to stop clients being deported while they waited for a sham marriage. The father-of-four helped broker deals in which desperate Pakistani and Indian men paid up to £10,000 to marry Eastern Europeans. But he was secretly recorded gloating that he also used human rights laws to help his 'clients' evade the authorities. Asked what he put on official paperwork claiming removal from the UK would breach their right to a family life, he replied: 'Just b*******.' Yesterday, Ali was branded a disgrace to his profession and jailed for six years for his role in the sophisticated and lucrative scam. Judge Mark Bishop said he was an arrogant man who traded on his reputation as someone who could 'get around' immigration controls. He said: 'As an officer of the court you have a duty to maintain the rule of law and uphold the integrity of the legal system - by your actions you were doing the exact opposite. 'You were demonstrating a deep cynicism for the principles you plainly saw as expendable to get the result for your client that you wanted.' Ali posed as a wealthy and successful self-made lawyer, running his own firm from offices in East London's Upton Park. He was a well-known as a generous member of the congregation at his local mosque and was urged to stand for election as a local councillor as a 'role model' for others. But Inner London Crown Court heard he was secretly profiting from the misery of women smuggled into the UK and desperate immigrants on short-term visas. The scam revolved around 'certificates of approval', in which non-European nationals had to ask border officials for permission to marry before applying for residency. Ali charged up to £600 to complete the paperwork and 'set the ball rolling' for people who had exhausted every other route into the country. The documentation was designed to convince officials at the UK Border Agency that the couple had met and fallen in love with the women. Ali conned the Border Agency into believing that his Pakistani clients had met the women and had fallen in love with them . In fact, the women were flown in especially for the weddings and had only met their 'husbands' a few days earlier at Ali's office. Ali's law firm processed a thousand certificates of approval over three years, but he was only convicted of acting unlawfully over three. Detectives suspect the lawyer, who one victim said 'lived like a prince', is probably linked to dozens of other illicit marriages. In 2010 Ali was caught red-handed by an undercover reporter posing as a concerned relative who wanted his nephew to stay after his student visa expired. The lawyer kicked out the husband-to-be after his first 'bride' asked too many questions, but offered to arrange another deal if they found another candidate. He was then filmed telling the relative in Punjabi that he must not discuss the sham marriage in front of his staff or the woman. The judge said secretly recorded footage gave a 'bird's eye view' of how the confident and composed lawyer brokered the deal. The case is being heard by Judge Mark Bishop at Inner London Crown Court in Southwark . He added: 'You advised that you would make a human rights application alongside the certificate of approval application, which would give appeal rights if it was refused. 'It would prevent the nephew being deported before the marriage took place. When asked what was put on this application you dismissively and cynically replied, ""just b*******"" The court heard that some of the 'brides' were trafficked into the UK from the Czech Republic and Slovakia with the promise of legitimate work. But once here they were forced into prostitution by a crime gang before being forced to marry Indian or Pakistani men. One Czech woman said she was forced to have sex with Ali and up to four other men before handing over her passport for the marriage con. In another case a man claimed he had met his bride at a party in 2008 but she had applied for an emergency passport to travel to the UK just two days earlier. Forged utility bills also appeared showing the man had been living with the woman for some time to bolster their application. Ali's barrister Matthew Ryder said Ali's crimes were the result of a 'misreading and misunderstanding of how a solicitor should act.' He said his wife, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, is now likely to return to her native Denmark with their four young children. 'He has lost everything, his business, his reputation and his good name. It has been a very traumatic process for him,' he said. Ali's high street company, which he started with a loan from his father in 2004, was shut down last week (April 17) and all staff made redundant. The lawyer, of Forest Gate, East London, was convicted of two counts of assisting unlawful immigration and a further count of assisting an offence after an eight-week trial. The crimes took place between July 2009 and December 2010. A further hearing will take place to strip him of the profits he made. Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: 'We are clamping down on the criminals who seek to abuse the marriage system for their own gain. 'This sort of criminality is often linked to serious organised crime and preys on some of society’s most vulnerable people'.","Nazakat Ali, 38, used a crime gang to lure women to Britain .

"By . Fiona Macrae . and Matt Charles . BBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood, 51, is one of the many  people who have traced their ancestry using the groundbreaking DNA 'mapping' You might have traced your family tree back a few generations and discovered where your relatives come from. But a new test that uses DNA can pinpoint your roots much further back in time. The biological ‘satnav’ created by scientists shows where a person’s ancestors lived up to 1,000 years ago – and in some cases can even identify a specific village or tribe. Previous tests were only accurate to around 450 miles – which in Europe could be two countries away from the right place. Dr Eran Elhaik of the University of Sheffield, who invented the Geographic Population Structure (GPS) test, said: ‘Most people live in houses – they have addresses. They may live in castles, they may live in caves, they may live in tents, but although they were born there, their DNA came from elsewhere. ‘Their DNA was forged through processes of migrations and slavery and victories and conquests but it was not necessarily formed where they currently live. 'Our question was one of the most basic questions the human species has always been asking – where am I from?’ BBC weather presenter Carol Kirkwood, 51, is one of the many  people who have traced their ancestry using the groundbreaking DNA ‘mapping’. She was thrilled to discover her origins lie in the quaint Scottish town of Crieff, near Perth – the childhood hometown of actor Ewan McGregor. Scroll down for video . Hoem sweet home: The Geographic Population Structure (GPS) tool (pictured) can locate the village where your ancestors lived 1,000 years ago and the scientists behind the technology think it could have big implications for life-saving personalised medical treatments . The new technology claims to be 98 per cent successful in locating people to the geographic region of their ancestors (illustrated) - down to their village of origin . Mrs . Kirkwood said on BBC Breakfast: ‘I used to go to Crieff when I was a kid . on holiday.’ She also revealed that the town is only 126 miles from the . village of Morar, near Fort William on the west coast of Scotland, . where she and her seven siblings grew up and her parents ran a hotel. In honour of her heritage, she presented the weather from Crieff yesterday morning. She usually hosts the forecast from her home in London via a video link. The GPS tool can locate the village where your ancestors lived 1,000 years ago. Previous tools could only locate the whereabouts of ancestors within 434miles (700km). Its creators claim it is 98 per cent successful in locating people to the geographic region of their ancestors. The technology models the admixture processes to pinpoint where a person’s DNA was formed. Members . of the public can pay to use the tool and the process involves taking a . swab of DNA that is passed on to scientists who upload it and use the . GPS tool to find the home of a person's ancestors. The technique means that we can no longer easily classify people’s ethnic identities with one single label. It . could also be used to inform the selection of personalised medicines so . that medication can be selected to work effectively with certain . genotypes. Dr Elhaik’s GPS test works by scanning a person’s DNA for parts that date back to the last time two ancestors were from different populations. For instance, this might be when a Viking invaded Britain and fell in love with a local. He said it can find DNA that was ‘mixed’ in this way up to 1,000 years ago. Once the DNA has been identified, it is compared with samples from populations around the world that have not moved for hundreds of years. A computer programme then calculates how close to these populations the person’s ancestors lived and fixes a location. Details of the test’s accuracy are published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Elhaik, who developed the test with a researcher from the University of Southern California, said it will work for anyone anywhere in the world. But there are some limitations. If a person’s grandparents are all from different areas, it will struggle to come up with a result. Test subjects must provide a saliva sample, pay £70 to have their DNA read and a further £20 for their ancestral home to be identified. Viking heritage: Genetic admixture occurs when individuals from two or more previously separated populations begin interbreeding and it results in the creation of new gene pools that represent the mixture of the founder gene pool. Such processes are common in history during migrations and invasions such as when the Vikings invaded Britain in the 11th Century (illustrated) Dr Elhaik was surprised to find Italian heritage in his own results.

"By . Sarah Harris . The Education Secretary said that 'more and more children have the potential' to benefit from selective education across the country . Grammar schools have a ‘moral purpose’ to open their doors to the country’s poorest pupils, according to Michael Gove. The Education Secretary said that ‘more and more children have the potential’ to benefit from selective education across the country. He has backed grammar schools that are controversially overhauling their admissions to admit more bright disadvantaged pupils. This is despite warnings that middle-class pupils face being ‘discriminated’ against and squeezed out as a result. Ministers are urging grammar schools to admit tens of thousands more deprived pupils over the next decade in a bid to make them less socially exclusive. They want grammar schools’ admissions policies to take into account the Coalition’s flagship pupil premium policy – extra cash given to schools for youngsters eligible for free school meals (FSM). At present, some grammar schools admit successful students by ranked order- all candidates are ranked by their 11-plus score. In other areas, pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria, which can include the distance they live from the school. Growing numbers of over-subscribed grammars are now giving preference to FSM pupils who pass the 11-plus test, just as children in care are currently given priority. Thirty selective schools have already agreed to give preference to bright children who are eligible for FSM and another 58 are seriously considering the move. Speaking at a reception for the Grammar School Heads Association (GSHA) in London on Wednesday night, Mr Gove referred to a recent meal he shared with Ofsted’s former chief inspector of schools, Sir Chris Woodhead, and Sir Geoffrey Hill, the poet. Both had experienced a ‘great grammar school education’. He said: ‘I was incredibly moved by the thought that these two men had benefited from the sort of education that you keep alive and which I know more and more children have the potential to benefit from. ‘And one of the things that I am also deeply encouraged by is the fact that grammar schools are playing a leadership role in the whole education system. ‘You are playing the leadership role in making sure that more children from disadvantaged backgrounds have the chance to enjoy an academic education by making use of the fact that you can now favour children who are eligible for the pupil premium in your admissions criteria. Ministers want grammar schools' admissions policies to take into account the Coalition's flagship pupil premium policy - extra cash given to schools for youngsters eligible for free school meals. File picture . ‘And the great thing about that is that it’s a freedom that we have given you rather than a requirement that we’ve imposed. And what’s great is that schools are showing that they have an appropriate sense of moral purpose about extending the reach of those schools.’ Graham Brady, Conservative MP for Altrincham and Sale West, made the case ‘very early on in the lifetime of this Parliament, that we should do everything possible to ensure that grammar schools were true to their original mission of educating children from the very poorest backgrounds to give them the chance to achieve everything of which they are capable’, he added. His comments came as David Laws, the Liberal Democrat Schools Minister, yesterday told the GSHA annual conference in London that all grammar schools should overhaul their admissions policies. The government’s aim is for each grammar school to admit the same proportion of poor children as seen in their local catchment area. Mr Laws said: ‘This would mean an additional 3,500 free school meal pupils in selective schools every year, or an additional 35,000 pupils over ten years. ‘There are likely to be many barriers in the way of this ambition and it is not something we can achieve overnight. ‘The problems range from parents not applying; pupils not revealing their full potential in the tests; local primary schools not considering your school as an option.’ Mr Laws also called on all 163 grammar schools to adopt ‘tutor-proof’ 11-plus tests to stop middle-class parents who pay for coaching giving their children an unfair advantage .","Ministers are urging grammar schools to .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Anyone who's familiar with Harry Potter will know about the Cloak of Invisibility. While we're yet to see such a gadget that conceals objects completely, a firm has developed a 'cloak' that makes people's data invisible from large companies such as Google. The unique coat blocks radio waves to stop firms using phones and other devices to collect data on our everyday lives. The Jammer Coat (pictured), which admittedly looks similar to a duvet, is a padded cloak fitted with metallic fibres. These fibres block part of the electromagnetic spectrum from accessing devices inside the pockets. It was created by Austrian company Coop Himmelb(l)au . Data collection has become a growing concern for many users of smart technology, which can record numerous personal details, some of which is collected without their knowledge. Microsoft Mobile Devices has created the first ever wireless charging trousers. Together with designer A. Sauvage, the leggings are on display at London Collecions: Men today. The technology, known as inductive charging, comes from the new Nokia DC-50 wireless charging plate. This was fitted into a piece of clothing to let people charge devices in their trousers while wearing them. ‘We think that integrating wearable tech into a wardrobe staple, makes the technology more accessible to the image conscious,’ said the team. With that in mind Coop Himmelb(l)au, an Austrian architecture company, created the Jammer Coat to protect the wearer from unwanted data collection. The Jammer Coat is a padded cloak that contains metallic fibres designed to block radio waves, shielding the wearer from tracking devices. All signals are designed to be blocked from reaching devices once they are stored inside the coat, meaning vital information from important items such as credit cards is protected from those looking to obtain it. This also means it is blocked from WI-Fi networks, mobile providers and more. And with numerous pockets of different sizes the coat can accommodate smartphones, tablets and a range of other devices. The white coat is also patterned with black spots, which have been designed to mask the wearer’s true body shape. You're a (tech) wizard Harry: Fans of Harry Potter will be familiar with the fictional Cloak of Invisibility (pictured). While this technology, if it were real, would block light waves to make it appear invisible, the Jammer Coat blocks radio waves to hide devices from Wi-Fi networks, mobile firms and other companies . The CHBL Jammer Coat is a piece of clothing that enables its user to 'disappear', meaning 'Google cannot find you anymore' according to the company. Numerous pockets of different sizes (pictured) can hold smartphones, tablets and a range of other devices . 'The CHBL Jammer Coat is a piece of clothing that enables its user to disappear: Google cannot find you anymore,' said a spokesperson for Coop Himmelb(l)au. 'The piece is made of metallised fabrics, which are blocking radio waves and shielding the wearer against tracking devices. 'You are no longer reachable on your mobile phone and no information from your credit card can be captured. And they added: 'The Wave Circle pattern of the fabric gives an illusion of strange multiple body parts, which hides and frees the individual physicality.' Coop Himmelb(l)au created the CHBL Jammer Coat for the Abiti da lavoro exhibition, which takes place at the Triennale in Milan, Italy, at the end of June 2014. The company said users will no longer be reachable on their mobile phone and no information from their credit card can be captured, while wearing the cloak (pictured). It adds the Wave Circle pattern of the fabric to give an illusion of strange multiple body parts, to disguise the person's body shape .","Vienna-based Coop Himmelb(l)au have made a coat that stops radio waves .

"By . Bianca London . A slimmer who piled on the pounds yo-yo dieting after a schoolyard crush called her fat has shed nine stone after ditching food and living on a diet of juice. Emma Tolliday, 37, began dieting at the age of just 13 when she received the cruel jibe. Despite Emma trying every regime she could, nothing helped her lose weight permanently and she reached 21 stone at her heaviest. Emma Tolliday became a lifelong yo-yo dieter at the age of just 13 when a schoolyard crush branded her fat - she has now lost nine stone on a juice diet . Struggling with anxiety and pre-diabetes, size 26 Emma booked a seven-day detox retreat with a friend to cleanse the fat and sugar from her system in July 2012. Ditching her diet of pizzas and crisps, Emma, from Kent, lived on pure juice and dropped a stone in a week; the experience spurred her to adopt the diet permanently. She spent the next nine months cutting out sugar, caffeine and dairy, sticking to two juices a day and managed to drop nine stone. Emma, head of retail for cosmetic firm Models Own, said: 'Ever since I was a teenager I was always podgy. Despite Emma trying every diet she could, nothing helped her lose weight permanently and she reached 21 stone at her heaviest (pictured left) Emma booked a detox retreat, ditching her diet of junk food to live off pure juice and dropped a stone in a week; the experience spurred her to adopt the diet permanently . 'I started dieting at just 13 years old when I asked my mate to ask the boy I liked at school what he thought of me. He answered with one word - ""fat."" 'I was devastated and cried all night. The next day I went on a diet, and over the years I tried everything from slimming groups to shake replacements. 'Nothing worked for long and I eventually put the weight back on with more added on. 'I struggled with severe anxiety and during one of my GP visits the doctor told me my blood sugar was very high and diabetes was imminent. I was scared and desperate. 'The next day I was reading a magazine that talked about celebrities like Kim Kardashian using juice detoxes to lose weight. Emma has cut out sugar, caffeine and dairy, sticking to two juices a day and has managed to drop nine stone in the process . 'I thought that’s something I haven’t tried and decided to research more about it. I found a company called Obsidian that offered health retreats with juice detoxes. 'I got a mate of mine to join me for a week-long break in Spain. We thought if we made it more of a holiday it would motivate us. It was affordable so we signed up.' During the retreat, which cost £500 all-inclusive for seven days, Emma stuck to three juices a day, exercise and relaxing by the pool. 'The only way I can describe it is like fat people rehab,' she said. 'I went into it thinking I would be starving. But after the first day I woke up feeling incredible. Emma, pictured here before the weight loss, struggled with severe anxiety, her blood sugar was very high and the doctor even told her that diabetes was imminent . Emma was reading a magazine that talked about celebrities like Kim Kardashian using juice detoxes to lose weight and it inspired her to try one herself . 'I had all this energy and felt better than I had in years. And the best bit was the juices were so filling I wasn’t hungry at all. When I lost a whole stone by the end of the week I knew that it actually worked. 'I got home and threw out all the junk food around the house and stocked my fridge full of fruit and veg. I bought a juicer and started juicing for meals. 'Eventually, a few weeks later, I started adding a healthy dinner like steamed chicken and vegetables into the mix but I kept to juicing all day. Within a year I had lost almost nine stone and fit into a size 12.' Emma’s husband Ben, 30, was so inspired by her weight loss he decided to try the juice diet. The engineer managed to lose four-and-a-half stone alongside his wife. Emma's husband Ben, left, was so inspired by her weight loss he decided to try the juice diet and lost four and a half stone .

At Emma’s next GP visit she was stunned to learn her body was in tip top shape; she no longer had to worry about diabetes and her anxiety had disappeared. The newfound confidence triggered by her weight loss helped Emma land her dream job as a retail executive for a global cosmetic firm. 'Before I started juicing I never would have had the confidence to go for my job,' she said. 'The Obsidian retreat started a change that has improved my life immeasurably. I’ve even had friends start juicing because they are so impressed by the results. 'There’s a reason why so many celebrities pay big money for juice detoxes and diets. It’s because they work.'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A new computer program is scanning satellite images from Google Earth looking for faces hidden in the world's landscape. Google Faces has been developed by German design studio Onformative and uses an algorithm that can highlight land masses and terrains with face-like features. The system scans the world, switches to the next zoom level, and starts the scan again taking snapshots and coordinates of the faces it finds. Scroll down to video . This face was found in the Magadan Oblast region of Russia, in the Far Eastern Federal District of the country. This part of the world is mainly made up of mountainous desert, tundra, and forests . This image is one of the faces found in the UK. It was taken next to Priory Road in Ashford in Kent and could be either a human face in profile, or the face of an animal. Trees appear to form the face's mouth and nostrils . In 1976 Nasa sent two spacecraft called Viking 1 and Viking 2 to the Cydonia region of Mars. Both spacecraft took images of the planet's surface and beamed them back to Nasa scientists on Earth. One image, taken on 25 July 1976 by Viking 1, showed what appeared to be a face in the rocks. This 'Face on Mars' image was taken about half-way between the Arandas Crater and Bamberg Crater in Cydonia. When the image was seen by Viking chief scientist Gerry . Soffen, he dismissed it as a 'trick of . light and shadow'. But another image taken at a different angle also appeared to show a face in the planet's surface, and was found by Vincent DiPietro and . Gregory Molenaar, two computer engineers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight . Center. A total of 18 images of the Cydonia region were taken by the Viking orbiters. The entire scan is expected to take several months because each time the scanner zooms in, the amount of time it takes to scan the images and travel the globe increases. Onformative founders Julia Laub and Cedric Kiefer from Berlin used openFrameworks - an open-source creative coding program - to develop the algorithm. In a blog about the project, the founders explained that they developed the idea for the Facetracker because they wanted to explore 'how the psychological phenomenon of Pareidolia could be generated by a machine.' Pareidolia is the tendency to see faces in clouds or inanimate objects, or hear hidden messages when songs are played backwards, for example. Human eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them recognise friends in a crowd, work out how fast a car is travelling, and see patterns. Onformative claims that we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and 'recognise meaningful shapes in clouds or detect a great bear upon astrological observations.' Another image captured by the Google Faces project in Russia. This grumpy-looking face was found in the Jewish Autonomous Oblast, in the Russian Far East - an area also known as Yevrey. Soviet leaders created the autonomous oblast in 1934 as a result of Joseph Stalin's nationality policy to give the Jewish population an area in which to practice Yiddish culture . This frowning face with large teeth was found in the Sakha, or Yakutia Republic, of Russia. Sakha makes up half of the Far Eastern Federal District of the country and is the largest subnational governing body by area in the world . To see if a machine could detect this . phenomenon, Laub and Kiefer wrote a computer algorithm that mimics the . way human eyes work and our tendency to distinguish faces. They were inspired by the Face on . Mars image taken by the Viking 1 Orbiter - one of two spacecraft . sent to Mars by Nasa in July 1976. Laub . and Kiefer said: 'Our Facetracker already circumnavigated the world a . couple of times and astonished us with quite versatile results. 'As it continues to travel the world within the upcoming months, it continuously zooms into the Earth. 'Some . of the detected images aren’t usable at all, as we are not able to . recognize any face-like patterns within the detected images. The Onformative Facetracker also discovered this image in the Magadan Oblast region of Russia. The face detector uses a computer algorithm that attempts to mimic how human eyes work, in particular their ability to see faces in clouds and inanimate objects. This psychological phenomenon is called Pareidolia . Onformative's Google Facetracker mainly found images in natural landscapes; fields, mountains and rocky terrains. However, some faces were also detected in industrial and urban regions. The face in this image is seen in the centre of the screen. A green hairdo is shown above two 'eyes' that have trees for eyebrows. It then has a wide open mouth below . 'Other satellite images, on the other hand, inspired our imagination in a tremendous, yet funny way. 'However the search goes on, as our diligent robot continuous investigation.' The team use the face detection algorithm on top of different satellite images and stores the geographical coordinates. They . then use software to send these coordinates from the Facetracker to a virtual browser scanning Google Earth images in Google Maps. This face isn't as instantly recognisable as some of the other images captured by the Google Faces project, yet you can see its eyes, nose and what appears to be a quiff-style haircut. This image was taken on the side of one of the mountains at the Denali National Park and Reserve in Alaska. The park is home to Mount McKinley - the tallest peak in North America . The Google Faces tracker scans the satellite images from Google Earth using a computer algorithm. When it detects an area of land that appears to look like a face, the features are highlighted and the coordinates are sent to the design team in Germany to record its location and take a screenshot of the hidden face .","Google Faces project is scanning the world one zoom level at a time, recording the coordinates of each hidden face .

Ex-corporal Andy Reid, who now uses a wheelchair after stepping on an IED just 10 days before the end of a voluntary tour of Afghanistan five years ago, said the chance to meet up with old comrades and friends is invaluable. 'It’s a massive honour to be recognised here at the Palace for what has happened and the sacrifice we’ve made,' he said. 'I am grateful that I am still alive, I lost friends out there. 'This kind of event gives me the chance to mix with people who have been through similar things and that’s important, especially when you’ve gone back into civilian life,' said Mr Reid, who left the Army two years ago.

"Investigators probing the theft of Michael Schumacher's medical notes believe a helicopter firm contacted by doctors looking to transfer the former racing driver from a hospital in France to Switzerland may have been involved in the disappearance. Schumacher, 45, suffered a major head injury when he fell while skiing in France in December and was kept in a medically induced coma for six months after the accident. Schumacher  was recently transferred from the hospital in Grenoble, France to a unit near his Swiss home, allowing his wife Corinna to attend a public event at her ranch in Givrins. Michael Schumacher, right, with his wife Corinna, left, were skiing in France in December when the major accident happened. Now his family fears that his confidential medical notes have been leaked to the media . Media in France and Switzerland said that prosecutors in Grenoble, France are currently looking a computer IP address which belongs to a Swiss helicopter firm who were consulted during the rescue. Prosecutors have not named the company publicly, but they have been working with authorities in Switzerland on the case. Medics in Grenoble are believed to have contacted the company while discussing the possibility of flying the former Formula 1 champion to Switzerland to continue his recovery. The records, which are believed to consist of several pages of medical notes outlining the extent of the injury suffered by Schumacher. Last month, Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm revelaed that the documents had been 'clearly stolen', warning that anyone buying or publishing the 'confidential files' would be prosecuted. It is understood that the notes were offered for sale across Europe to media organisations for £40,000. Corinna Schumacher, left,  made her first public appearance in several months at her ranch in Givrins, Switzerland after her husband was transferred to a clinic near their home to continue his recovery . According to the BBC, the new information was reported in French newspaper Le Dauphine Libere. Initially it was believed that a hospital worker or a member of the ambulance team that transferred Schumacher from France to Switzerland may have been behind the theft. The latest development emerged in French newspaper Le Dauphine Libere, and Swiss media said it had been confirmed by the prosecutor in Grenoble. Suspicions had initially fallen on the hospital in Grenoble and the ambulance team which eventually drove him across the border. According to the Grenoble prosecutor, the computer was traced back to a helicopter company in the Swiss canton of Zurich. The company's name has not been made public. The file had been sent to a doctor at the company, although there was nothing to link the doctor to the alleged offence. It is thought the findings of the French inquiry will now be handed to the authorities in Switzerland. Ms Kehm said: 'We cannot judge if these documents are authentic. However, the documents are clearly stolen. The theft has been reported.’ Schumacher’s office will ‘press for criminal charges and damages’ if the documents and data are made public, Kehm said. Schumacher's manager Sabine Kehm warned media outlets that they face prosecution if they either buy or publish her client's medical records which have been 'clearly stolen', confirming the theft has been reported .","Several pages of Michael Schumacher's medical notes have been stolen .

'He's done some running on the grass and I don't want to put a date on his return but I've watched him running and he's in good condition. He's kept himself right while he's been away.' Another huge boost for Moyes is that Robin van Persie is expected back in training this week. The Holland striker had a huge influence on United's title-winning campaign last season, but this term he has been hampered by a recurring thigh injury. The return of United's two talismanic strikers could provide the stuttering champions with a renewed confidence with games against Arsenal, Olympiacos and cross-town rivals Manchester City on the horizon in the coming months. Back soon! Robin van Persie is also nearing a return for the struggling champions . Pressure cooker: David Moyes needs his star strikers back in action as soon as possible . Meanwhile, Sunderland goalkeeper Vito . Mannone believes his side, who carry a 2-1 aggregate lead into the Old . Trafford second leg, are in with a genuine chance of reaching the . Wembley final. 'Wednesday is another game and a . massive one for the club and the fans,' the former Arsenal stopper said. 'We need to focus on the semi-final again as we did in the first leg. Routine: Chelsea were comfortable winners at Stamford Bridge as United went down 3-1 . Dejection: Phil Jones and Michael Carrick (right) look frustrated as the champions battled in vain .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Older men who take statins to combat high cholesterol are less likely to exercise regularly, a new study has found. Researchers in Oregon have raised fears about a decline in physical activity among men who take the medication - one of the most widely prescribed in the world. Statins are credited with saving thousands of . lives a year by preventing heart attacks and strokes. Older men who take statins to help combat a high cholesterol are less likely to take regular exercise, a study has found . The study could not pinpoint why men who . took statins exercised or not. Rather, they confirmed a link between those that . take the drug and a lack of physical activity. Scientists said possible causes could include muscle pain that can be a side effect of taking statins. Lead author of the study, David Lee, an assistant professor in the Orgeon State University and the Oregon Health and Science College of Pharmacy, said: 'Physical activity in older adults helps to maintain a proper weight, prevent cardiovascular disease and helps to maintain physical strength and function. 'We're trying to find ways to get older adults to exercise more, not less. It's a fairly serious concern if use of statins is doing something that makes people less likely to exercise.' He said five to 30 per cent of people . who take statins complain of suffering muscle pain, while some report . feeling less energetic, weak or tired. In a study of 3,071 men aged 65 or older, from six geographic regions in the U.S., researchers found that men who took statins averaged about 40 minutes less of moderate physical activity over a one-week period, compared to those who were not taking the medication. Researchers said a link between taking statins and experiencing muscle pain and fatigue could be a reason for a lack of physical activity in those taking the drugs. File picture . Dr Lee said it would equate to the loss of 150 minutes a week of slow-paced walking. He said: 'For an older population that’s already pretty sedentary, that’s a significant amount less exercise. 'Even moderate amounts of exercise can make a big difference.' The Oregon study also found that new statin users had the largest drop in physical activity. An increase in sedentary behaviour, which is associated with all-cause mortality and death from cardiovascular disease, was also found in those taking the drugs. 'Given these results, we should be aware of a possible decrease in physical activity among people taking a statin,' Lee said. 'This could decrease the benefit of the medication. 'If someone is already weak, frail, or sedentary, they may want to consider this issue, and consult with their doctor to determine if statin use is still appropriate.' The study focused on older men and researchers highlighted it may not be pertinent to apply the same theory to older women. ;Last month an eminent British heart surgeon declared that everyone over the age of 40 should take cholesterol-busting statins. Professor Sir Magdi Yacoub, who has carried out more heart transplants than anyone else, said the benefits of taking the controversial drugs ‘massively’ outweigh the risks and to not make them more widely available is ‘lunacy’. Sir Magdi, professor of cardiothoracic surgery at Imperial College London, also believes statins should be available without a prescription.","Study in Oregon found older men on statins are less likely to exercise .

"By . James Tozer . A newborn twin boy died because managers at an overstretched maternity unit failed to make proper checks on whether a bungling doctor was up to the job. Dr Olufemi Dina was allowed to work only under the supervision of a consultant after being blamed for the death of a young mother following childbirth, and also after falsifying medical records. But with a severe shortage of staff, managers at the unit where he had been working as a locum for three days allowed him to take charge of delivering Natalya Almond’s twin boys. Moments before the end: Arron in the arms of his parents. He was deprived of oxygen at birth after his head got stuck for 20 minutes, causing severe brain damage. He died after three weeks on a life support machine . The first, Lien, was born safely, but his brother, Arron, was deprived of oxygen when his head got stuck for 20 minutes, and suffered severe brain damage. Yet Dr Dina still placed him on his mother’s chest – only for her to see to her horror that he had turned grey and wasn’t breathing. Arron died after three weeks on a life support machine. After a lengthy battle to learn the truth, Mrs Almond and her husband Neil, from Darwen, Lancashire, have now been awarded more than £50,000 after the hospital accepted Arron would probably have survived had he been delivered competently. Dr Dina, 49, who was found to have ‘communication problems’ because English is not his first language, was later banned from practising for lying to investigators. But the Almonds are furious that none of the staff who put him in charge of such a complicated birth have been disciplined. ‘You put your trust in these people and believe that they know best,’ said Mrs Almond, 27. ‘Now we know managers at the hospital knew he wasn’t competent enough to deliver my twins but simply left him to it. ‘We feel the people who let him work that night are partly responsible for what happened.’ The lost twin: Arron, right, with Lien, now three. Dr Dina, who was found to have 'communication problems' because English is not his first language and was later banned from practising for lying to investigators . In 2007 the Nigerian-born doctor, who specialises in obstetrics and gynaecology, was branded negligent by a High Court judge after sending home a new mother who complained of headaches with painkillers when she in fact had a fatal blood clot. Then in 2008 he was accused of falsifying medical records and prescribing powerful drugs to a pregnant patient he had not seen while working as a locum in Manchester. The General Medical Council ordered that he should work only under the supervision of a consultant. In September 2010 he secured a locum post at Royal Blackburn Hospital. On the night Arron was born there were staff shortages and clinical director Mark Willetts let Dr Dina work unsupervised because the alternative was shutting the maternity unit. Dr Dina: He was allowed to work only under the supervision of a consultant after being blamed for the death of a young mother . Lien was delivered safely but Arron was deprived of oxygen when he became stuck. Three weeks later his parents were advised to turn off his life support machine. In an initial report, the hospital claimed Arron’s death had been unavoidable, saying ‘no gaps in care were identified’.But after his angry parents discovered that Dr Dina should not have been practising unsupervised, Arron’s inquest was halted. An independent medical expert concluded that ‘the outcome could have been significantly better’ had he been supervised by an experienced consultant, but the coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. Dr Dina was initially allowed to continue practising but after pressure from Arron’s parents there was a fresh investigation. The Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service banned him from practising for 12 months for lying that  he had told the GMC about his Blackburn locum post. He has now lost an appeal. Mr Almond, a 36-year-old plasterer, said: ‘His mistakes have now caused the deaths of a mother and a baby, but he could be able to work again next year – what does it take for a doctor to be struck off?’ East Lancashire Hospitals NHS Trust described Arron’s death as a ‘very sad incident’ and said ‘changes in practice have been put in place’. But it added: ‘The Trust has found no grounds for action against individual doctors.’ Dr Dina’s solicitors declined to comment.","Olufemi Dina was previously blamed for death of mother after childbirth .

"By . Victoria Bischoff . Follow @@VBischoff . The traditional high street bank branch has taken another step towards extinction after Barclays announced plans to scrap cashiers. Britain’s third biggest bank is to transform its branches in a bid to get customers to use self-service machines and cut down on queues. Instead of waiting to see a cashier at a glass booth, customers will be greeted at the door by staff armed with iPads, who will answer their questions in the open reception area and help them with the self-service machines. Upgrade: Britain’s third biggest bank says the changes will save customers time. It also said that people are increasingly carrying out transactions such as transferring money online . Barclays claims the new branches will save customers time. It also said that people are increasingly carrying out transactions such as transferring money online and only use branches if they need more complicated advice. But yesterday campaigners warned that the new service could alienate pensioners and small businesses. Derek French, director of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, said: ‘Banks are trying to move too fast. ‘We don’t want to stand in the way of progress but they haven’t moved for years and now they’re rushing ahead shouting we’ve gone digital without any regard for small business, charities, churches, schools and vulnerable customers. ‘These people rely on the traditional bank branch and the privacy it offers them.’ To trial the new system, Barclays has scrapped cashiers and counters in 37 of its 1,560 bank branches, including Bournemouth, Doncaster, Middlesbrough and Leicester Square, in London. The cashiers who are scrapped will be retrained as ‘community bankers’ and given a 2.8 per cent pay rise – roughly equivalent to £500. Instead of being stuck behind a counter they will help customers in the reception area and answer queries by using iPads. Customers who need to deposit sums of up to £4,000 or withdraw up to £750 will be asked to use self-service tills. Anyone who wishes to open an account will also be served in the reception. Homebuyers who want a mortgage and investors will be shown to private rooms. The new system means many customers will need to exchange cash in an open seating area in front of other customers, or go to one of the more private meeting rooms. Concern: Campaigners have warned that the new service could alienate pensioners and small businesses . But at busy lunchtime periods there may not be a free room available, and the waiting time for these rooms can be substantial as they are typically used for more complicated transactions. A Barclays spokesman said: ‘We want our staff to serve customers side-by-side rather than from behind a glass window. We think helping customers make the most of our technology in branch will reduce waiting times. ‘As with the traditional branch format, our new branches have just as many private rooms for one-to-one conversations.’ Banks have appeared determined to push customers online as a cheaper alternative to serving customers in branches. They have spent millions developing mobile phone banking apps and super cash machines that also bank cheques and open savings accounts. Barclays also has 7,000 so-called Digital Eagles – employees who help customers become more comfortable with computers. The local branch, meanwhile, has been disappearing. Some 1,200 towns and villages have lost their only bank branch, and 900 now only have one. A report by Campaign for Community Banking Services suggests that Britain’s 9,500-strong branch network will plummet to 7,000 by the end of 2018.","Staff armed with iPads and will answer questions in an open reception area .

"By . Matt Lawton . Follow @@Matt_Lawton_DM . and Neil Moxley . West Bromwich Albion have told Nicolas Anelka he will have to pay for his own lawyer if he wants to fight an FA charge for his quenelle gesture. The French striker is at the centre of a race storm that could yet end with the termination of his contract at the Hawthorns. Anelka is facing at least a five-match ban after being charged on Monday — it was not officially announced until Tuesday — for the gesture that is widely considered, particularly in his native France, as anti-Semitic. West Brom responded to that on Tuesday by stating that they would conduct their own ‘internal inquiry’ once the FA’s disciplinary process has been concluded. Bad morning: Nicolas Anelka drives away from training with the West Brom squad on Tuesday . Anelka has until 6pm on Thursday to . respond to the FA and he runs the risk of seeing a suspension extended . to eight or even 10 matches if he fights the charge. Given the . expense involved in bringing in a QC of their own as well as a QC to . chair the independent three-man commission, the FA would take a dim view . of such a challenge when they allege it is ‘an aggravated breach’ of . their rules ‘in that it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or . race and/or religion or belief’. After a meeting with West Brom . technical director Richard Garlick on Tuesday, Anelka was left in no . doubt of his employers’ position. While the club insisted that Anelka . remain available to new manager Pepe Mel for now, the 34-year-old was . told they would not be footing the bill for a top QC if he wants to . stick to his stance that his quenelle was not racially motivated but . ‘anti-system’.

Ham on December 28, Anelka has shown no contrition. On the contrary, he . has argued what he did was not anti-Semitic. But the FA consulted . experts before presenting their case on Tuesday and the fact that the . comedian Anelka was said to be supporting — Dieudonne M’Bala M’Bala — . has been prosecuted for anti-Semitism and banned from performing in a . number of major cities in France seriously undermines his argument. 'He was my idol since I was a kid and he still is. He should never have been banned for that. He showed support for a stand-up comedian in France. We don’t need to make such a big deal of it. He’s an adult and I hope he isn’t suspended because he’s a player that people want to see play on the pitch.'

"By . Holly Black . Lloyds Banking Group and Nationwide are asking mortgage applicants to prove the size of their pensions . The over-40s are now being told they are too old to take out a mortgage. Some of Britain’s biggest banks and building societies are asking older homebuyers to prove they can afford repayments once they hit retirement age. Anyone who cannot show they have a big enough pension will have their applications turned down. The crackdown follows new rules introduced in April which forced mortgage companies to make tougher checks on applicants, to ensure they can afford to repay loans. Borrowers must already sit through 90-minute interrogations, and provide months of bank statements and payslips. Now some banks have gone one step further, with lenders such as Lloyds Banking Group and Nationwide demanding evidence of what applicants’ income will be after they reach the State retirement age – currently 65 for men, and 62 for women. They won’t be allowed to depend on the state pension, which will rise to £155 a week from 2016. They also won’t be allowed to include investments and other savings. Instead, those who will be making repayments after the State pension age must prove they are paying in to a private or company pension. Anyone without personal provisions will be turned down, or asked to pay off their loan before they retire. Banks could also refuse to accept applicants who intend to carry on working into their late sixties, or past 70. The new rules mean many over-40s will . have to take out loans over shorter periods, if at all. They will . typically have to borrow less overall, so they can afford the higher . repayments on shorter-term loans. David . Hollingworth, a director at broker London and Country Mortgages, said: . ‘There is no doubt it is harder for people trying to take out a mortgage . now. 'The maximum age lenders will go to has reduced substantially.’ Under new rules introduced in April, borrowers must already sit through 90-minute interrogations, and provide months of bank statements and payslips . He added: ‘If someone has a very . physical job such as a builder and says they intend to work past . retirement age, the bank may not agree to take that into consideration.’ Couples . with different ages will have to prove they can afford loans once the . older partner hits the State pension age. Younger borrowers taking . longer mortgages in order to afford a home will also be affected. Before the financial crisis, buyers could receive up to seven times their income, and borrow 25 per cent more than their property was worth with no deposit. Many took loans which were interest-only, meaning they never paid back the capital they borrowed. Other types of mortgages allowed buyers simply to state their income without ever having to prove it, known as self-certification deals. However, these became known as ‘liar loans’ because so many people exaggerated their income. These practices led to thousands taking out mortgages they could not afford. After the crash, a new regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, introduced restrictions to clamp down on the reckless lending that came before. It has all but banned interest- only loans, and forced banks to put potential borrowers through stricter tests. New rules introduced in April have had an immediate effect. The number of existing homeowners taking new deals has dropped by a quarter in the last two months, as borrowers have been put off by the daunting application process.","Rules introduced in April see borrowers sitting 90-minute interviews .

"By . Peter Campbell . Under pressure: Christopher Bailey with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley . Burberry shareholders have voted against an ‘obscene’ £28million pay package received by the new boss of the fashion house. Chief executive Christopher Bailey was handed 1.35million shares in the business prior to taking the top job earlier this year. But in a humiliating blow for the company, 53 per cent of investors voted against the controversial measure – one of the biggest revolts in British boardroom history. It is only the sixth time that a major UK firm has seen its pay arrangements defeated in a ballot. However, it is likely Mr Bailey will get  to keep the awards because the vote is  not binding. The Burberry boss, who had been creative director at the design label, was appointed to the top job earlier this year, replacing Angela Ahrendts who left to join technology giant Apple. From the outset Mr Bailey’s pay and perks have raised eyebrows. As well as a base salary of £1.1million and pension contributions of £330,000, he was entitled to receive up to £6.6million from two annual incentive schemes. He was handed free shares worth £1.8million when he took the post and an executive discount of 80 per cent. Mr Bailey also receives an unexplained ‘cash allowance’ of £440,000, which is paid in monthly instalments. The company refused to say what this was for. But the measure that galled shareholders was free shares worth £20million, handed to him before he took the job and only disclosed once he became chief executive – a post that requires the firm to reveal his rewards. Unlike most schemes used by other companies, Mr Bailey is due to receive a payout from these shares irrespective of Burberry’s performance, providing he stays with the firm for five years. The Investment Management Association, which advises pension funds on how to vote, gave the company an ‘amber’ warning over the scale of its pay deals, and corporate governance group Pirc labelled the payouts ‘excessive’. Burberry chairman Sir John Peace, who is now facing calls to resign, told shareholders at the London meeting that it was ‘essential that we retain Christopher in the business’. He warned . that a rival firm had tried to poach the executive, who will also keep . his position as creative director, and that Burberry had to open its . cheque book to keep him. Christopher Bailey with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and actress Kate Bosworth at the Burberry Body Event in 2011. The pay package included a base salary of £1.1million and pension contributions of £330,000 . Warning shot: Experts say that investors, 53 per cent of whom voted against the group's pay arrangements for Mr Bailey, were sending a message to the company - one of its stores, pictured . SALARY: £1.1million(Base figure given annually)CASH ALLOWANCE: £440,000(Paid in monthly installments. The company refused to say what this was for.)PENSION: About £330,000(CEO is entitled to pension contributions equivalent to 30 per cent of his salary)PERFORMANCE-BASED GRANT: Up to £7million(Based on 500,000 shared in the company)OTHER SHARE OPTIONS: Up to £20million(Said to be the initiative that really galled investors. Was handed to him before he took the job and only disclosed once he became chief executive)POTENTIAL TOTAL: £28million . But . the argument did not wash with shareholders and 53 per cent of them . voted against the group’s pay arrangements of the past year. Speaking . after the meeting, Sir John said it was ‘disappointing’ that . shareholders did not back the awards – but pointed out there was nothing . they could do to stop them.’ He added: ‘What we have to do is reflect . on that and talk  to shareholders.’ Shareholders . vote twice on pay – once on the directors’ rewards from the past year . and once on the company’s pay policies going forward. The . vote on pay from the past year is only symbolic, because the directors . have already received the money and it would be impractical to claw it . back. But the ballot on future pay arrangements is binding. Yesterday only 16 per cent of shareholders voted against Burberry’s forthcoming pay policies. Deborah . Hargreaves, director of the High Pay Centre, said: ‘The message to . Burberry is loud and clear – multimillion-pound pay packages are . obscene, unnecessary and will damage the economy in the long-term. ‘If . those at the top are seen to grab such vast rewards while wages . stagnate for everybody else, it completely undermines public faith in . business.’ Chief executive: Christopher Bailey, who was appointed to the job earlier this year . When he took the job as boss of Burberry, Christopher Bailey knew he had one man to thank more than any other. The fashion veteran’s interest in design and technology was sparked by his electrician grandfather, who bought him the latest gadgets as he was growing up – as well as his first Burberry trench coat. The son of a carpenter, Mr Bailey studied at the Royal College of Art before being headhunted by Donna Karan for the post of creative director of women’s collections. The American fashion designer was so taken with the young graduate’s work that she is said to have stripped in front of him just three minutes into their meeting in order to try on his collection. Mr Bailey rose to senior designer at Gucci before being poached by Burberry in 2001, when he became part of a team that increased the value of the business from £1.1billion to £6.5billion. Now 43 and in a civil partnership with actor Simon Woods, he has taken one of the most prestigious jobs in the fashion world by becoming chief executive. But he will also keep his position as creative chief. Part of his success in the role was linking the firm to its British heritage while modernising the brand. He has said he will donate 10 per cent of his salary after tax to the Burberry Foundation which supports disadvantaged children.","Christopher Bailey took role as CEO of British fashion house earlier this year .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Founder: American entrepreneur Natalie Massenet set up British fashion chain Net-A-Porter . Internet shopping firm Net-A-Porter last night became the latest corporate giant to be accused of dodging tax. The British fashion chain raked in sales of £435million in the year to March 2013 – but posted a loss of £24.7million, according to Channel 4 News. The report claimed that Net-A-Porter used clever planning to pay a fraction of the tax you would expect it to, by turning profits into a loss. It was claimed the loss was created in part by the way the company chose to reward its senior executives through shares. Net-A-Porter is also able to use the losses it makes to reduce its future tax bill, according to the report. Tax experts said that from the firm’s accounts it was very difficult to see what was really going on. Richard Murphy, of Tax Research UK, said: ‘In this particular company’s case, we don’t know where it’s making its profits, we don’t know where it’s paying its tax. 'We don’t actually even know it’s paying its tax because there is no cash flow statement in these accounts because there is a Swiss parent company.’ He said this means Net-A-Porter doesn’t have to include information ‘to tell us if this tax, which it says it owes, is even being passed over to the revenue’. Mr Murphy added: ‘We’re still living in a world where there’s an enormous amount of opacity that a company like this can exploit to leave us in doubt about what is going on.’ Labour MP John Cryer, a former member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘I think it stinks. This company is getting away with not paying what they should be paying. HMRC should pull their finger out and have a look at exactly how this system works. Scroll down for video . The scheme allegedly used by Net-A-Porter is perfectly legal, but will raise eyebrows among UK taxpayers.

"By . Bianca London . They say opposites attract and one loved-up couple really are proof of that. A recovering anorexic and a morbidly obese man are getting married - just months after meeting at an eating disorder clinic. Lizzie Elsburg, 24, was just 6st 5lb when she was admitted to rehab for anorexia and bulimia, while Chris Glasgow, 28, was a 35st overeater. Scroll down for video . Opposites attract: Former anorexic Lizzie Elsburg and fiance Chris Glasgow, who she met in an eating disorder clinic are set to wed . The couple, who met in August 2012 and bonded at counselling sessions for their very different eating problems, began dating in January this year, and became engaged in February. Their whirlwind relationship shocked family and friends but now the couple are living near each other in Lizzie's hometown of Lorton, Virginia, and planning their future. Lizzie, now a healthy nine stone, said: 'At first I was a bit afraid of Chris. I couldn't understand how anyone could let themselves get to that size. 'But after a while I got to know the person inside. I was able to see past his body issues, because I have body issues too.' Weighing in: Lizzie Elsburg, 24, weighed just six and a half stone when she met 30 stone Chris Glasgow, 28, during therapy sessions at Pacific Shores Hospital in California . Where it all began: Lizzie Elsburg and fiance Chris Glasgow on the day they met at Pacific Shores Hospital in 2012 in California, they are now planning to get married . Chris, a junk food addict with low self-esteem, said: 'When I found out through a friend that Lizzie liked me, I was really shocked. 'I didn't think any girl would ever find me attractive, let alone one as beautiful as Lizzie. There's no way I would ever hit on a girl like her in the past because I would have thought she'd just laugh at me.' During mealtimes at the clinic, Lizzie, who once ate 100 calories per day, had to piled her plate with food. True love: The couple became engaged at a park near the clinic, Pacific Shores Hospital, in Oxnard, California, after Chris got down on one knee and proposed . Better together: Lizzie Elsburg, 24, weighed just six and a half stone when she met her fiance, they helped each other battle their eating disorders . Unexpected: 'I went to an eating disorder clinic to lose weight, and came out with the love of my life' says Lizzie . Meanwhile Chris, who binged on five takeaways per day, has so far lost 5st after he was was limited to muesli, salad, and a small side plate of food for dinner. Lizzie admitted: 'It was a little weird at first. It felt like we should swap plates. 'But we recognised that we were both determined to beat our eating disorders - and that's what drew us together.' The couple became engaged at a park near the clinic, Pacific Shores Hospital, in Oxnard, California, after Chris got down on one knee and proposed. 'I barely got the question out when she excitedly said yes,' he said. Skeptical: Lizzie says her friends found their relationship strange at first but now are very happy for the couple . Common goal: The pair recognised that they were both determined to beat their eating disorders - and that's what drew them together . 'I went to an eating disorder clinic to lose weight, and came out with the love of my life.' Now the couple are learning to cope with their eating disorders in the outside world and still receive weekly counselling sessions to deal with their emotional issues. 'I use food by cutting it out, he uses food by overdoing it, so it's the opposite but serves the same purpose,' said Lizzie. Lizzie is helping Chris in his diet and exercise regime - and even set him an ultimatum in case he falls back into his old ways. Different diets: Chris, who binged on five takeaways per day, was limited to muesli, salad, and a small side plate of food for dinner whereas Lizzie was encouraged to eat more . Life after the clinic: Now the couple are learning to cope with their eating disorders in the outside world and still receive weekly counselling sessions to deal with their emotional issues . Big plans: The couple are planning to move in together soon, and have a medium-sized wedding next summer . 'If he doesn't lose the weight then I won't marry him,' she revealed. 'If he went back to eating fast food and junk food the relationship wouldn't work from a health standpoint and from a point of physical attraction.' Instead of being hurt, Chris is determined, and said: 'There's a lot on the line. But it makes me realise just how important it is to stay on track.' Meanwhile, the couple are planning to move in together soon, and have a medium-sized wedding next summer, with rustic-themed colours of mint and navy. Warning: Lizzie has warned Chris that if he doesn't lose weight, she won't marry him . Family support: Lizzie's mother was worried they rushed into their relationship but is now very happy for them . 'A lot of my friends were surprised at first, but they're excited for me now,' said Lizzie. 'No-one has said anything negative about how we look together or anything,' she insisted.

"By . Lydia Warren . A cyclist has suffered a broken cheekbone and concussion after a surprise attack by a goose. Kerry Surman was riding alone near her home in Stittsville, Ottawa on June 10 when she saw the gaggle of geese and goslings crossing ahead of her along the Trans Canada Trail. Speaking to CBC, she said that she thought she would be able to ride past them as they left the path - but she was wrong. When geese attack: Kerry Surman was left with a fractured cheekbone, concussion, loose teeth and a scar beneath her eyebrow after she was attacked by a Canada Goose while on a cycling trail . 'I misjudged how fast I was going and the goose misjudged my intentions,' she told the channel. As she neared the group, she saw the last goose turn and look at her. 'What . I remember is the goose giving me the evil eye and then the goose . wrapping its wings around my head, and I can't see and I hear myself . screaming.' She was thrown from her bike and, even though she was wearing a helmet, she was knocked unconscious and landed in poison ivy on the trail, CTV reported. Terror: Surman, pictured on the Ottawa trail where she was attacked, said she saw the geese and thought she could get past them without a problem - but one turned on her and attacked her face . Terror: She said the large bird wrapped its wings around her face before she fell to the ground . Threat: She said she often sees the geese on the trail and thinks they were just protecting their young . When she . came to, she remembers struggling to drag herself to a nearby road where . she was able to flag down a passerby who called 911 and waited with her . for an ambulance to arrive. Surman spent five days in hospital after . suffering a concussion, fractured cheekbone, face lacerations and loose teeth, CBC reported. An image taken 48 hours after the attack in hospital shows her scratched face, black eye and scars beneath her eyebrow. Her helmet and sunglasses probably prevented further damage, she believes. Surman, who has been left with a scar beneath her eyebrow, said she is not physically ready to return to her bike, but she will be more careful when she does. Wary: Surman's husband Todd Edwardson, pictured together, said that they have often seen geese along the trail but now no to exercise much more caution . Canada geese are extremely adaptable so are often found in urban areas. They are particularly attracted to mowed lawns, golf courses, parks, and similar areas next to open water, which means conflicts can arise. They are aggressive . defenders of their nests and young so you should do not approach them. They . may charge and can inflict injuries. If you see a goose's neck go vertical and straight, it is wary of some danger, and if you see it begin to rapidly lower and raise its head in a pumping motion, they are about to attack. In this situation, do not look away from the goose and back away slowly, Ohio Geese Control suggests. If one flies at you, duck while still facing the bird. You can prevent confrontations by never feeding geese, placing flags outside your home, using low-power lasers or fencing off their territories, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. 'You have to know they are going to attack if they feel threatened,' she said. When she was in the hospital, she learned that attacks by Canada Geese are not uncommon. Michel Gosselin, Manager of the Bird Collection at the Canadian Museum of Nature, told CTV that attacks almost always involve an adult trying to protect its young. 'Normally they just fly away, but when they have a nest or young they cannot leave them behind so they have to defend them,' he said.

"By . Rob Cooper . Updated: . 01:30 EST, 16 January 2012 . Jury trials face the axe in thousands of cases each year under reforms being drawn up to cut the costs of court cases, it was revealed today. The changes could save in excess of £30million per year but will meet fierce opposition from civil liberties campaigners. Juries in minor theft cases, assaults, burglaries, some drug offences, criminal damage cases and some driving cases will be scrapped under the reforms, The Times reported. Under threat: Juries could be axed from thousands of cases each year under proposals to cut costs. Pictured is the panel of jurors from the ITV drama The Jury . Currently these offences are 'triable either way' and can be heard either by magistrates or by a judge sitting with a jury in the Crown Court. The least serious offences are already heard only by magistrates. The proposals will be contained in a White Paper to be published next month. As well as saving money, by sending more cases to magistrates' courts it will enable judges to hear murder trials, rape cases and serious frauds more quickly. Civil liberties campaigners and criminal law barristers are opposing the reforms and say the right to be tried by 12 ordinary men and women is sacrosanct in the English legal system. The right to a jury trial dates back to the Magna Carta in 1215 and the principle was famously described by the late Lord Devlin as 'the lamp that shows that freedom lives'. Opposition: Civil liberties campaigners say the right to trial by jury - which has existed since 1215 - is sacrosanct in English law . However, it costs the taxpayer £3,000 per day to send a case to the Crown Court - but just £900 if it is heard by Magistrates. Currently two thirds of the triable either way offences are sent to the Crown Court. Many of these result in guilty pleas just before the trials start. In 80 per cent of theft cases the items involved are worth less than £200 in total. The Magistrates' Association are backing the proposals and Louise Casey, a Government adviser appointed to lead the response to the riots, said she was in favour of the reforms. Backdown: Jack Straw tried to cut the number of jury trials a decade ago but the reforms were killed off amid widespread opposition . She told The Times: 'We should not view the right to a jury trial as being so sacrosanct that its exercise should be at the cost of victims of serious crime. 'It is known that waiting for a criminal trial often means that victims put their lives on hold; bereaved families of murder victims cannot grieve until the trial is over. 'Defendants should not have the right to choose to be tried by a jury over something such as the theft of a bicycle or stealing from a parking meter.' Under the proposed changes, Magistrates may be allowed to order a trial by jury. It takes an average of 22 weeks for cases to be heard in the Crown Courts, and a year for the most serious cases. Opponents say that in a low-value theft case although the value of a stolen item may be small, the impact of a conviction will be very large - especially if the defendant has never been before the courts before. Four men who carried out a £1.75million hold-up at Heathrow Airport became the first people to be found guilty by a judge sitting alone in march 2010. Juries can be removed from serious criminal trials if there is a serious risk of jury tampering. Jack Straw tried to reduce the number of cases that go before juries more than 10 years ago although the proposals were dropped following widespread opposition. David Blunkett also tried to introduce judge-only trials in complex fraud cases but the proposals were later dropped after they ran into opposition in the House of Lords.","Some theft, assault, burglary and drugs offences will have juries axed under proposals .

"By . David Kent . Louis van Gaal claimed he had no doubts his Holland side would finish victorious even before substitute Memphis Depay's decisive strike in the 3-2 World Cup Group B defeat of Australia. Holland beat defending world champions Spain 5-1 in their opening match, but the Oranje had to come from 2-1 down to win 3-2 against the battling Socceroos to put one foot in the knockout stages ahead of their concluding group game with Chile. And the Dutch manager welcomed King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima into the Dutch dressing room after their win in Porto Alegre. 'I'm not relieved, because I believe in the second half we played better than Australia,' Van Gaal said on fifa.com. Guests: King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands celebrate with Louis van Gaal . Royal appointment: The Dutch royalty joined the team in their dressing room after beating Australia . 'In the first half they played better, but in the second half we had five, six, seven chances. I expected us to win. When (Australia's Mathew Leckie) missed that chance, I said to Patrick Kluivert, ""We're going to win this match.""' Depay's swerving 30-yard strike, which deceived Australia goalkeeper Maty Ryan, came seconds after Leckie's missed opportunity and settled an end-to-end contest which came alive when Arjen Robben ran at the Socceroos defence and put Holland in front. It was a sublime strike which was almost immediately surpassed in quality by a goal reminiscent of memorable strikes from Dutchmen Marco van Basten and Robin van Persie. Content: Van Gaal was happy as his side won their second straight game of the tournament . Right-back Ryan McGowan drilled a cross-field pass over the Dutch defence and Tim Cahill's exquisite left-footed volley went in off the bar in what is sure to be one of the goals of the tournament.Van Persie - booked to earn a suspension which rules him out of the contest with Chile - swiftly cancelled out Mile Jedinak's penalty before Depay's winner eliminated Australia. Man of the match Robben said: 'We've seen so many great goals at this World Cup. It's great for everybody, great for the fans, and we saw (some more) today.' Robben praised Australia's performance. Decisive: Memphis Depay scored the decisive goal for Holland in their win over Australia in Porto Alegre . Lethal: Arjen Robben was once again on the score sheet for Holland after his brilliant performance against Spain . 'They played really aggressively,' he said. 'They played like it was their last chance. 'We were a little bit under pressure, but we gave the ball away too easily. But we made big step today. We have maximum points.

"By . Chris Brooke . A cancer patient endured a terrifying ordeal believing she was going to die after being refused oxygen on a holiday flight to Cyprus, she claims. Annette Townend, 56, says she boarded the easyJet plane late and gasping for air after being stopped from using a pre-booked wheelchair. Shortly after take-off, she told a steward ‘oxygen, oxygen’, only to be informed that it was ‘for emergencies only’. Help: Anette Townend was forced to write on a piece of paper 'I cant breathe need oxygen dying' She became so desperate after having an asthma attack she scribbled the message ‘I can’t breathe need oxygen dying’ on a piece of paper and put it on the seat next to her. Apart from a disabled woman  behind her, she said no one showed concern for her plight. She got through the four-and-a-half hour journey from Manchester, but says she was left in such a state that she ended up in hospital with pneumonia. Recalling the ordeal, she said: ‘I was absolutely gasping for air, I couldn’t breathe and I have never been so frightened in my life. I really thought I was going to die. The higher the plane went the worse my breathing got. It was pure purgatory. ‘My doctor told me later I am lucky to be alive. The attitude of the easyJet stewards was disgusting.’ The airline dismissed the criticism, claiming Mrs Townend had declined wheelchair assistance at the airport and had agreed to cope without oxygen. However, the widow, who owns a family laundry business, is furious and is considering legal action. Clear conscience? Easyjet have denied any wrongdoing - which has forced Mrs Townend into considering legal action . Mrs Townend, from Baildon, West Yorkshire, has been undergoing chemotherapy for bowel cancer and hoped the ten-day trip to see a friend in Cyprus would help her recovery. She said wheelchair assistance had been booked for both legs of the £190 return trip to Paphos. But a 15-minute delay caused by security staff checking the medication in her hand luggage meant that when she arrived at the wheelchair assistance desk, no one was there. She was forced to walk across the terminal, dragging her bag behind her.She said she became ‘hysterical’ when her name was called out on the tannoy to urgently go to the gate. 'I was wheezing, breathless and angry when I got there and the flight was ten minutes late because it took me so long,’ she said. ‘I wrote the note when the passenger behind me asked what was wrong. The stewards must have seen it on the chair but they did nothing.’ A spokesman for the airline insisted yesterday that ‘special assistance’ staff collected Mrs Townend from the airport shopping area when she was in difficulty. She added: ‘EasyJet’s highest priority is the health and safety of all on board. Our cabin crew spoke to Mrs Townend in detail to ensure her comfort and agreed with her that she was content to continue the flight without requiring the oxygen. ‘Whilst we feel our crew made every effort to look after Mrs Townend’s needs, we would like to apologise for any distress that was experienced.’","Annette Townend believed she was going to die on flight to Cyprus .

"By . Suzannah Hills . Three children of murderer Melanie Smith have revealed the torture they suffered at their mother's hands growing up. Lisa, Charlotte and Jonathon have spoken for the first time about their mother who they describe as the most evil woman in Britain after she was convicted last week of burning five people to death. They revealed how Smith burned them with cigarettes, poured boiling water over them and locked them in a tiny cupboard if they cried. She also chopped off their hair if they made 'too much noise'. Their father Paul, now 51, fought Smith for custody of the children but lost. It was only when she abandoned them in voluntary foster care that he won them back and their ordeal ended. Devastated: Lisa and Charlotte, pictured with their father Paul, have spoken for the first about the abuse they suffered at the hands of their mother Melanie Smith . Jobless Smith was yesterday convicted by a 10-2 majority of five counts of murder, making her one of the most prolific murderesses in modern British history. Smith set fire to a baby's pushchair because she was fed up with it being outside her front door. But the blaze spread into a devastating . inferno which ripped through the first-floor flat in Prestatyn, North . Wales, last October. Guilty: Melanie Smith has been convicted of killing her neighbours by setting fire to their home . It trapped and killed Lee-Anna Shiers, 20, her partner Liam Timbrell, 23, their baby son Charlie, 15 months, Miss Shiers’s nephew Bailey, four, and niece Skye, two. Smith will be sentenced next month. Her daughter Charlotte, now 23, told the Sunday Mirror: 'We all wish she was dead. Knowing that the evil woman who killed that poor family is our mother is almost impossible to bear. Dad rescued us from hell. He’s brought us all up without her but now she’s back in our lives in the most horrific way imaginable. She’s been dead to us since we were tiny. Now I just want her to rot in hell.' Paul married Melanie in August 1987, two years after they met at Pontins near Prestatyn where she worked as a chamber maid. She gave birth to their three children - Lisa, now 24, Charlotte, 23, and Jonathon, now 22, within the next four years but Paul said he immediately noticed she lacked any maternal instinct. As she began to drink more and more, Paul began to notice marks on the children but Melanie always had an excuse. The final straw came when he discovered her in bed with another man while their three children were locked in another room. Blaze victims: Liam Timbrell, right, with Lee-Anna Shiers and their baby Charlie shortly after his birth . Tragic: Skye Allen, two, and her brother Bailey , four, who were killed in the fire in the first-floor flat in Prestatyn . Deaths: Ms Shiers, left, and her 15-month-old son Charlie were both killed following the blaze set by Smith . The couple divorced and Melanie won custody of the children but put them in care a day later because she couldn't cope. Paul told the newspaper: 'When I picked the kids up from the foster home that day, I vowed that Melanie would never hurt them again. None of us ever saw or spoke to her again. She’s never sent one birthday or Christmas card and there’s never been a single letter.' The next time Paul and his children saw Melanie was when her photo appeared on TV following her arrest over the blaze. Paul added: 'Her cruelty has finally got her what she deserves. We just feel so sad for the victims and their families.' Fire: The smoke-damaged property in Prestatyn after the blaze which killed five people last year . Innocent: Bailey and Skye were staying with their aunt, Ms Shiers, at the time of the killing .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Her snow white skin has been iconic for centuries. But it seems Queen Elizabeth I may not have been the pale and interesting poster girl history dictates. Microscopic analysis of one portrait has revealed she had blushing cheeks blotted with rouge. The Blushing Queen? Scientists at the National Portrait Gallery have found a hint of pink on Queen Elizabeth I's cheeks (right, microscopic analysis) in this portrait by an unknown Dutch artist painted around 1575 . And our perception of the monarch as austere comes after her numerous portraits have faded, losing their subtle pink touches, National Portrait Gallery scientists claim. During Elizabethan times, women went to great lengths to maintain smooth, pale skin - a sign of wealth and high class. Tanned skin, blemishes, sunburn, or freckles were reserved for lower ranking members of society who toiled on the land, while the upper classes relaxed indoors. Pioneering the style, the Queen took great care to maintain smooth, pale skin. She painted her face and neck with ceruse - an ointment of white lead and vinegar - to cover the scars left by an attack of smallpox at the age of 29. Only the very wealthy could afford the solution, which was very bad for her health as it slowly poisoned her body and impacted her skin problems. For many, the severity of the white has been taken as a symbol of Elizabeth's strong, unemotional persona. Faded: Few portraits of the monarch include the rosy detail, which experts put down to them fading over time . Imitations: Her iconic look has captured the imagination of artists and filmmakers for centuries. Cate Blanchett (left) donned the elaborate make up in The Golden Age and Vanessa Redgrave (right) in Anonymous . Despite reportedly having numerous suitors, she painted herself as the Virgin Queen who would never marry. But the rosy colour on her cheeks - detected by scientists at the National Portrait Gallery - suggests a more bashful and flirtatious side to the monarch. On her lips, she applied red. With poor dental care in the period, the monarch was forced to have many teeth removed as she aged. Queen Elizabeth I is widely believed to have mixed red dye with mercuric sulphide for her red lips - and possibly her rosy cheeks. It was dabbed on after she pasted white lead and vinegar over her face and neck. Kohl, a black lead sulphide, was used to outline her eyes to make them appear whiter and brighter - a trick still in vogue today. She plucked her hair line back by about an inch to increase the size of her forehead, and also plucked her eyebrows to make them appear more arched and fair. With poor dental care, she was forced to have teeth removed - which she hid by stuffing rags in the gaps. To hide the appearance of hollow cheeks - caused by the loss of teeth - she reportedly stuffed rags in her mouth. Arched brows and a high hairline were also in vogue, and Elizabeth - like many others at the time - plucked her hair daily. Emphasising the look, she wore a wig which pulled her hairline back. Kohl was used to outline the eyes, making the whites seem brighter. Deconstructing the Queen's exhaustive make up routine, scientific analysis of her portraits will be displayed in a major exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery this year. Following seven years of research, it will hang alongside many other art works, diaries and jewellery from the Tudor dynasty, which have also been examined. The project, which involved the use of X–rays, infrared reflectography and pigment analysis, included the gallery's oldest portrait of Henry VII. Five paintings of Mary I are to go on display, with her prayer book, on loan from Westminster Cathedral. Elizabeth I's locket ring, borrowed from its home at Chequers, will also be exhibited. Dr Tarnya Cooper, the chief curator of the National Portrait Gallery, said: 'This special display will bring together some of the most important portraits of all the Tudor monarchs, revealing how paintings were made and changed at later dates.' The Real Tudors: Kings and Queens Rediscovered will open on Sept 11.","Scientific analysis of portraits show painters blotted cheeks with pink .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Capturing glorious images of the cosmos is no mean feat; not only do photographers need to have the technical know-how to focus on celestial objects, but they also have to contend with light pollution. That makes the incredible entries into the 2014 International Earth and Sky Photo Contest all the more impressive as they showcase the wonders of the night sky. From a magnificent view of the Milky Way rising above a volcano in the southern Indian Ocean, to the enchanting glow of the zodiacal light over the coast of Oregon, the winners of the fifth annual Earth and Sky Photo Contest highlight the natural beauty of the universe above our heads. Scroll down for a video slideshow of all the winners and other notable entries . The first prize in the Against the Lights category (and the overall contest winner) went to Giorgia Hofer of Italy for her photo 'Light in the Sky' taken on 1 January 2014 from Cibiana Pass in the Dolomites (Alps), northern Italy. It shows part of the Big Dipper (the prominent part of the Ursa Major constellation) between rays of light . Organised since 2009 by the international programme The World at Night, the contest is a collaboration with the science-education group at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory and Global Astronomy Month, a programme of Astronomers Without Borders. The World at Night is a global photography and astronomy outreach program in partnership with Astronomers Without Borders. The aim is to produce and present a collection of stunning photographs of the world’s most beautiful and historic sites against the night-time backdrop of stars, planets, and celestial events. The eternally peaceful sky looks the same above all symbols of different nations and regions, attesting to the truly unified nature of Earth as a planet rather than an amalgam of human-designated territories. The contest entries are so-called ‘nightscape’ images - photographs showing the night sky and the terrestrial landscape - with special attention to astronomical perspectives and celestial phenomena. This is also known as landscape astrophotography and is sometimes referred to as The World at Night-style photography. The contest was open to anyone of any age, anywhere in the world, and to both professional and amateur or hobby photographers. ‘This competition encourages photographers with imagination to push their cameras to their technical limits and to produce eye-catching images that appear perfectly natural and are aesthetically pleasing,’ said British-Australian astronomer and judge David Malin. ‘Hundreds of nightscape photographers from across the world rose to the challenge, and the panel of nine judges was ultimately faced with finding the best from almost 800 images.’ ‘We are pleased to see contributions this year from new countries in which night-sky photography is emerging, as well as nightscape images taken in the countries and areas less exposed to landscape astrophotographers,’ added Babak Tafreshi, The World at Night director and co-founder of the contest. The first prize in the Beauty of the Night Sky category went to Luc Perrot from Réunion Island of France (southern Indian Ocean), for his image 'Over the Top' captured on 28 February 2014. In the image a volcano in the Reunion Island peaks out of a sea of clouds and rests under stars . The second place winner in the Beauty category was Ben Coffman of Portland, U.S. for his photo 'False Dusk and Falls at Oregon Coast', taken in February 2014 from Hug Point at the Pacific Ocean coastline in northern Oregon. It shows a waterfall with zodiacal light (dust from the atmosphere) in the background . The 10 winners of the fifth Earth and Sky Photo Contest are from Australia, Austria, China, Egypt, France (Réunion Island), Iran, Italy, New Zealand, Romania and the United States. The annual contest follows the theme of ‘Dark Skies Importance’ to publicise efforts on preserving the night sky as part of our natural heritage. The submitted photos were judged in two categories: ‘Beauty of the Night Sky’ and ‘Against the Lights.’ The winners in the second category are eye-catching views of night-time illuminations that, while they are striking and beautiful at first glance, also deliver a message about an nature is often obstructed by light pollution. 'Reflected Aurora' by Alex Conu of Romania was the second place winner in the Lights category. Taken on 15 March 2014 from Lofoten Islands in northern Norway the image shows the Aurora Borealis (or Northern Lights) reflected in the water of a scenic fishing village after a few stormy days . The third place winner in the Beauty category was 'Kirkjufell Nights' by Nicholas Roemmelt of Austria for his capture of aurora over Kirkjufell waterfalls in Iceland in a moonlit night of March 2014. In the image the aurora can be seen 'sweeping' around the pole . Contest judge and National Geographic photographer James Richardson said:  ‘These images capture the great ambiguity we feel about the night and night lighting. ‘They are at once beautiful and beautifully composed. Today most city skies are virtually devoid of stars, and the photos in the ‘Against the Lights’ category illustrate how starry skies are vanishing because of excessive artificial lighting that scatters into the sky instead of illuminating the ground. 'Both contest categories provide a visual awareness of the disappearing starry night sky and hopefully an understanding as to its cause,' said contest co-founder Connie Walker, associate scientist and education specialist at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. 'The added hope is that the photos will provide an incentive to be more actively involved in reasonable light pollution solutions and therefore dark skies preservation.' For photographers hoping to get involved with the next contest the sixth International Earth & Sky Photo Contest will be announced in late February 2015 on The World at Night's website. Contest submission begins every year in March and ends on Earth Day on 22 April as part of Global Astronomy Month. Third place in the Lights category went to 'Unlimited Sky' by Majid Ghohroodi of Iran, a February 2014 image from Maranjab Salt Lake near the city of Kashan. 'The winter starry sky (with constellation Orion in the middle) is merged into light domes of three major cities in this panorama' said the photographer . 'Little Explorer' by Ibrahim Elawadi of Egypt took fourth place in the Beauty category. It was captured in November 2013 from desert near Fayoum, about 62 miles (100 kilometres) south of Cairo. 'This visualises the story of building the future by placing a passion in the young minds to explore the universe,' he said .","Photos from astronomy contest showcase various night sky sights, with the winning photo from the Alps in Italy .

"By . Graeme Croser . Christian Nerlinger has delivered a blow to Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace by rejecting the chance to become the club’s new football operations officer. The German, who played for Rangers between 2001 and 2004, held talks with Wallace about returning to Ibrox and filling a role similar to the one he previously held at Bayern Munich. The pair met twice in recent weeks but Sportsmail understands that, after careful consideration, 41-year-old Nerlinger has decided to decline. Turned down: Former Rangers player Christian Nerlinger will not become their football operations officer . Discussions: Rangers chief executive Graham Wallace has held unproductive talks with Nerlinger . The appointment of a new football figurehead was one of the key recommendations of Wallace’s 120-day business review of the club. Had Nerlinger accepted, he would have been responsible for player identification and recruitment. Rangers boss Ally McCoist would have welcomed assistance in that department but any new appointee would essentially have assumed some of the manager’s duties. Ultimately, McCoist is understood to favour the establishment of a new scouting system, an area that has been neglected during the attempts to recover from financial meltdown.

"By . Fraser Mackie . Kenny Miller has revealed his wish to retire as a Rangers player, ideally with the parting gift of one last top-flight winners’ medal as he plans to plunder more prizes before hanging up his shooting boots. The 34-year-old is back with the club for a third spell this summer and would like to make his return signing the 10th and final move of his nomadic career. Miller flew out to Los Angeles on Saturday as Ally McCoist’s squad embarked on a four-game North American tour that will take the striker back to Canada, where he starred for Vancouver Whitecaps in a previous pit-stop. Old boy: Kenny Miller is back with the Ibrox club for his third spell in a Rangers shirt . For Miller, though, there is no place like the football home that he regards as Ibrox. Yet this is no comfort zone for the former Scotland international, who stresses his ambitions stretch  further than helping hoist Rangers into the Premiership next May. He would love to finish his playing days with his current employers  and, feeling fresh into a new pre-season, has no interest in setting a time limit on that. So he still has a top-flight title challenge within his career compass and a desire to add to the three  Scottish Premier League medals he won for Rangers back in stint two under Walter Smith. Miller’s motivation on the first step towards that goal is to contribute  sufficiently to a successful promotion campaign against former club  Hibernian and Hearts so that he earns the optional year on his new Rangers contract. He’ll then take aim at bigger prizes. ‘You never know because if they kick me out of the door at Rangers after a year, I’d imagine I’ll still want to play on,’ said Miller. ‘But it would be my intention to finish up here. I’ve got a year with a year option, depending on games. So it’s pretty much on me. Reunited: Kris Boyd is back at Rangers too and will look to forge a potent strike pairing with Miller . ‘As long as I’m fit, playing and performing then, hopefully, it will turn into another year. It’s going to take a good season this year for us to get there and then obviously some serious competition next year to get back challenging. ‘But that’s the aim for me anyway — to be back at the top of Scottish football where we belong. To top things off would be to win the league back in the Premiership. ‘Rangers shouldn’t go in to any competition thinking of accepting second best, so that’s what we’ll be aiming for next year if we get there. ‘I hope to be around for that. I want to play as long as I can. I feel strong and fit right now. Of course, only time will tell if the performances follow but, if I do that, then there’s no reason why I can’t be around for a bit longer.’ Home: Miller has spoken of his delight as he starts his third spell at Ibrox after the pre season break . The highlights of Miller’s 67 goals in 147 appearances so far for Rangers were in SPL and Champions League competition. The second tier of the Scottish game, though, is nothing new to him. As an Easter Road teenager, he played seven games either side of a loan spell at Stenhousemuir as Hibs bounced back at the first time of asking in 1998/99. Franck Sauzee, Russell Latapy, Paul Hartley and Mixu Paatelainen were among the heroes of Alex McLeish’s team that year as crowds flocked  back to Leith to see a team canter to the First Division title. Not since that campaign has there been such a buzz about the division now known as the Championship. As Miller recalls the year that one of the traditional top-flight teams had to claw their way back up, he admits he can’t wait to sample the curiosities of a season like no other as three giants of the game collide in an unfamiliar environment. Poacher: Miller slides home the first goal of his Rangers return during pre season . ‘I made my debut the season Hibs got relegated and made a few  appearances while the team was  promoted,’ he said. ‘It was a big season for me. They brought Latapy and Sauzee — that pair must have sold 5,000 tickets alone each week, given the standard of players they were. ‘Hibs had a fantastic season. To draw those players to the club was phenomenal and what they went on to do was amazing. ‘A winning team on the pitch can create a fantastic atmosphere within the club and the crowds were up. I can see big crowds and huge games in this division. It’s going to be a fantastic season and one I’m really looking  forward to. ‘To come back to Rangers not in the top division is incredible in itself but for Hearts and Hibs to be there also is phenomenal. I never thought I’d be back playing against them in the Championship. ‘It will be a competitive league and a big challenge for us. But it’s a challenge I feel this squad probably needs after the last couple of years. ‘No disrespect to the opposition Rangers have been facing but I feel the challenges coming our way this year will really raise the standards of the players we’ve got.’ Welcoming: Miller is looking forward to coming back to the place he calls home - Ibrox . Miller and strike partner Kris Boyd were reunited last weekend as both players got off the mark on a two-game Highland tour. The next phase of pre-season will involve the long-haul journeys to which he was accustomed as a Vancouver Whitecap. After games on the west coast of the United States against Ventura County Fusion and Sacramento Republic FC, Miller returns to British Columbia for a game against Victoria Highlanders a week tomorrow, before the final game with Ottawa Fury on July 23. He called Vancouver home for two years after joining the Major League Soccer side from Cardiff City midway through their 2012 season. Under the Scottish coaching team of Martin Rennie and ex-Scotland  international defender Paul Ritchie, Miller helped guide Whitecaps to a first-ever appearance in the MLS Cup play-offs that year. Strike: Miller will be hoping he can provide the scoring touch that will oust Celtic from the Scottish summit . However, he admits there were  facets of professional life in Canada that he found difficult to embrace. ‘If you are a guy like myself who if he doesn’t win the weekend is ruined, then that side is not there so much,’ explained Miller. ‘You see others who don’t have that. It’s not that they don’t care — far from it — but just not as much as I did. ‘In Scotland, you lose and you don’t want to go out. It’s straight home on a Saturday, a Chinese and the X Factor. Here we live, breathe and eat football. Across there, it’s not quite as life or death as it is for us. I found that  mentality towards it a bit hard to get used to. ‘This is not any slight on anyone I played with. It’s just the way they are brought up. This has been my life since I was four. Ever since I could walk, I had a ball at my feet. ‘I’d argue till the cows come home that it doesn’t mean as much to them, whereas it’s a way of life for us. That’s what I’ve come back to at Rangers. Ger: Miller train with his new teammates at Dudgeon Park ahead of a pre season friendly . ‘Vancouver is a beautiful place and there are amazing cities to live in or visit for players going to MLS. ‘There’s a more relaxed lifestyle, so I can understand why people want to do it. I’d just say it’s a very different attitude to football. ‘I was grateful for the opportunity as it was something I’d always talked about trying. I enjoyed some aspects but not others. I was fortunate that there were British guys as coaches, we had good people in charge. ‘Being so far from home and away from friends and family is always tough, though. ‘Towards the end, I had an eye on moving home somewhere — and Rangers was always that No 1 option.’ Buddies: Miller gets to grips with Dean Shiels as they seek to return to the Premiership together .","Miller begins his third spell at Ibrox as he reaches the end of his career .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The filming of a race scene in the latest Fast and Furious film was cancelled by studio bosses because it was too dangerous, it has been reported. The scene was reportedly due to feature a modified yellow Chevelle performing a wheelie while racing another car with cheering bystanders by the side of a track. Sources have told TMZ that studio bosses on Thursday cancelled the shot just before filming began over fears of another crash following the tragic accident of the film franchise's star Paul Walker last year. A race scene in the latest Fast and Furious film, similar to a sequence in the first film (pictured), has been cancelled by the studio, it has been reported . Paul Walker, who shot to fame in the Fast And Furious franchise alongside Vin Diesel, died at the age of 40 in a high-speed car crash in Santa Clarita, California, in November . Insiders at the Willow Springs . International Raceway near Palmdale, California, also told TMZ that a member . of the production team had said there were problems with insurance for . the scene, which had been planned for the latest film in the franchise, . Fast and Furious 7. Mr Walker died at the age of 40 after . the Porsche Carrera GT he was riding in as a passenger crashed and burst . into flames, killing him and his friend Roger Rodas, who was driving. The accident took place following an event in Santa Clarita, California, for Mr Walker's charity Reach Out Worldwide in November last year. On Thursday his long-time co-star Michelle Rodriguez made a point to show he'll never be forgotten. She posted a photo on Instagram alongside Vin Diesel to pay tribute to their late co-star.

"By . Sean Poulter . Npower is axing almost 2,000 staff as it outsources work to India, it emerged last night. Just weeks before Christmas, the firm has decided to close its British call centres. The move was condemned by the GMB and Unison unions, who called for a public inquiry into the way Npower is being run. Npower has decided to close its British call centres, axing almost 2,000 staff just weeks before Christmas . It is understood that sites at Peterlee in County Durham, Thornaby in North Yorkshire, and Stoke will be closed, with the transfer of 1,400 jobs to India, while 570 customer service jobs will go to another company in Britain. Npower is owned by RWE of Germany, which earlier this week dumped a project to build a vast wind farm in the Bristol Channel. Colin Smith, of the GMB, said: ‘This is about cost of living, bad management and naked greed.. ‘At this time of the year, when the Christmas lights are being turned on for most people, Npower workers their families and communities have no Yuletide greetings. ‘They have only fear from a company only interested in their fat-cat salaries and what they can get out of consumers who are paying ever higher energy prices so corporate bureaucrats can get fatter as their reward for failure. 'It is an absolute scandal that a company like Npower can operate as a cartel player in a captive market, while jobs are placed offshore.’ Npower is to move all UK call centres to India . Matthew Lay, Unison national officer, said: ‘Npower have consistently let their customers and staff down by not investing enough in the workforce, technology or the latest customer-service techniques. ‘This has led to a huge number of complaints which the company seems to think they can deal with by shifting the responsibility to somewhere else, including India. ‘If the company goes ahead with this disastrous plan, it will backfire badly, damaging their already tarnished reputation for service.’ Its poor record on complaints, a punishing 10.2 per cent price rise and its failure to pay tax have angered many customers of Britain’s most expensive energy firm. But chief executive Paul Massara, who earns £600,000, has rejected calls to give up a bonus of £150,000 awarded for hitting targets for employee and customer satisfaction. Just last week, Npower was named and shamed as the nation’s worst performer for customer service. The company receives 202.5 complaints for every 100,000 customers – five times more than the best energy supplier. Audrey Gallacher, director of energy at official customer watchdog Consumer Futures, said Npower’s performance was ‘unacceptable’ and it was unclear how moving call centre services to outside firms would improve the situation. She added: ‘Energy companies have repeatedly said they want to rebuild consumer trust. Good customer service and complaints handling are key ingredients to achieving this and suppliers still have a long way to go.’ The firm is also about to hit customers with a 10.2 per cent rise in the cost of heat and light, which will take average bills up by £139 to just under £1,500 a year. Npower said: ‘Npower has been undertaking a major review of sites, operations and people across the UK to improve customer service and keep costs down, at a time of external pressures on customers’ bills.’","Announced weeks ahead of Christmas, the move will see 2,000 jobs axed .

"By . Gerri Peev . Imbalance: Woman spend 18 per cent more of their time on activities including housework and childcare in comparison to men (file picture) For any worn-out mothers stealing a . glance at this story in between vacuuming the living room, sorting out . the washing and cooking dinner, it will probably come as little . surprise. British women do . more unpaid housework and childcare than most other women around the . world, according to research – devoting more time to domestic duties . than the industrious Chinese. In . a week, British women spend an average of 11 more hours on household . matters than their husbands do, while putting in three hours less in . paid work. In China, women . invest eight hours more a week in housework than their husbands do, . while the men give an average of three hours more to their jobs. The . Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development puts the UK at . 19th place out of 28 in its table of gender equality in household . chores. Couples in countries . including the United States, South Africa, Finland, Estonia, Ireland, . Hungary, Poland, Germany, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, Portugal, . Slovenia, Austria, Belgium and Denmark all split the housework more . evenly than we do. Meanwhile, . Italy – which has one of the lowest birth rates in the western world – . has the biggest gender gap when it comes to carving up chores. Italian . women clock up 21 hours more per week than men on housework. They . are followed by Japan (21 hours), India (18 hours), Spain (15 hours), . New Zealand, Turkey and Canada (all 14 hours), Korea (13.5 hours) Mexico . (13 hours) and France (12.5 hours). On average, women put in 31.5 hours a week of unpaid work across the nations belonging to the OECD. Men do just 21 hours of unpaid work, but put in more hours in their day jobs – 33.7 against women’s 24.5. The . Better Life Index report concludes: ‘Women continue to bear the brunt . of household tasks despite their increasing participation in the labour . market. 'As time is a scarce resource, more time devoted to unpaid work . often means less leisure, with negative consequences on wellbeing.’ It . warned that ‘large responsibilities for household work impinge . directly on women’s decisions to participate in the labour market, the . hours they put in and their investment in human capital, reinforcing . gender inequalities in access to economic opportunities and resources’. It . also leads to the ‘double burden of holding a job and looking after the . family [which] can generate time deprivation and stress, with negative . effects on life satisfaction and health’ for women. Unsurprisingly, . women were also more likely to have less time to spend on having fun . and looking after themselves. Catching up: Men are sharing more of the household chores, but are more likely to multitask by watching sport while looking after the children . Those with children were described as the . most ‘time poor’. Every child generated a reduction in discretionary . time for women of 2.3 hours a week but just 1.7 hours for men across the . OECD. Researchers also . found women were more likely to multitask by carrying out two domestic . tasks at the same time, such as cooking and childcare. Men, on the other . hand, would combine one chore with a ‘leisure’ task, such as ‘looking . after the children while reading the newspaper’. ‘As a result, men tend to associate more positive feelings with multitasking than women do,’ the report concluded. But . overall women in the OECD countries are spending less time on housework . than they were a decade ago, dropping 2.6 hours a week while bumping up . their time at the office by one hour. Men’s . paid work, meanwhile, has decreased by 4.5 hours a week and they have . increased the time spent on domestic chores by two hours. Women . are also now more likely to hire cleaners, nannies or childminders . while buying more ready meals or eating out to cut down on the amount of . time spent on unpaid household tasks.","Report by Organisation for Economic Cooperation surveyed 28 countries .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . While some viewers of last night's Emmy Awards were impressed by the glamorous dresses on display on the red carpet, others were alarmed at how far the celebrities had gone to squeeze into them. Breaking Bad's Anna Gunn won the gong for best supporting actress in a drama series but many viewers didn't focus on her win but on her gaunt appearance on the red carpet. The 45-year-old looked noticeably skinnier than when at last year's event as her shoulders protruded and her collar bone jutted out as she wore her sleeveless Romona Keveza gown.

Referring to her character's name, another said: 'Skyler looked so skinny at the Emmys.' Gunn wasn't the only actress at the Emmys who viewers thought looked worryingly thin.

Cat lost her curves: It looks like pressure of Hollywood has taken its toll on Brits Cat Deeley, left, and Emilia Clarke, who both looked gaunt . Homeland . actress Claire Danes and Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke were also among . those displaying ultra-skinny figures and jutting collar bones. Modern . Family actress Julie Bowen admitted she had 'starved' herself to get . into her tightly fitted dress with a fish tail. And it was clear she . wasn't joking about skipping a meal or two by her bony neck and . shoulders. Meanwhile, nobody would have . guessed Danes had given birth to her son just nine months ago as she . revealed a flat chest and slim stomach in a plunging dress that exposed . her tiny neck and gaunt shoulders. Britain's Cat Deeley looked a shade of her former self as she blended in with the skinny stars with her leaner frame. The red carpet display of skeletal women caused Fox News to ask in their report of the awards, is skeleton the new skinny? Bad role models: Actress Julie Bowen, left, admitted she had to starve herself to fit into her dress while viewers said presenter Giuliana Rancic looked like she needs 'a filling meal' They noted how the emaciated frames . caused concern for many viewers who expressed their views via social . networks. Many feared impressionable youngsters could use them as their . 'thinspiration' and try to emulate their size 0 figures. One said that Bowen's starving comment was 'refreshingly honest but sad nevertheless,' while another Tweeted, 'Julie Bowen talking about starving to fit into her dress. Nice message about body image.' Another said: 'Claire Danes is WAY too skinny. Not feelin it'. Referring to E! presenter Giuliana Rancic, another wrote: 'Funny thing about awards shows. You see what ""too skinny"" really looks like. Thanks, Giuliana. Eat some ice cream. Or anything.' In agreement, another viewer said: 'Guilianna needs a filling meal' while another mused: 'Is it just me or are all of these women incredibly and awkwardly skinny? Lots of skin and bones at the 65th #Emmys tonight.' Skeletal: Actress Julianna Margulies was another slim celeb with a jutting collar bone, left, while Allison Williams' figure was so slight her dress looked too big and hung off her . One male viewer pointed out: 'Attention all women: Most men do not like rail thin women. Please eat a cheeseburger. Trust me, it's OK.' Style expert Michael Cohen told Fox News that recent fashion week trends seen on the catwalks in New York, London and Milan were to blame for the displays of stick-thin figures. He said: 'There was a lot of bone showing dresses this year but that shouldn't be any surprise because that's what was on the fashion runways and that's what stylists turn to when dressing celebrities for the red carpet. Thank heavens for the Mad Men girls: Christina Hendricks, left, and Elisabeth Moss bucked the skeletal trend . 'Unfortunately, it doesn't always translate to a desirable red carpet look as in this years Emmy's, but then again this is the entertainment business which is supposed to be salacious.' Thankfully not all the stars had succumbed to the skeletal trend.

Substitutes: Zaluska, Waters, Findlay, Twardzik, McGeouch. His condition will be assessed at Lennoxtown tomorrow but Deila believes he is more than capable of being involved in the first leg of their opening qualifier against KR Reykjavik in Iceland. Forster has been attracting interest from Benfica and Southampton, but the Norwegian manager reported no news in terms of ins or outs from his squad. ‘Fraser and Emilio are quality players, you can see it,’ said Deila, as he reflected on the Dukla friendly before Celtic fly back to Scotland. ‘This was a good match for both of them. I can understand that Fraser is an attractive goalkeeper. He made saves and he played well with his feet as well today. It was good to see. On the ball: Celtic's Anthony Stokes (left) is closed down by Dukla Prague's Patrik Gedeon . Not letting go: Celtic's Derk Boerrigter finds himself under pressure from Matej Hanousek (right) ‘Of course, he can give the team a lift. We need all our quality players. ‘This 90 minutes has to be enough for them ahead of Reykjavik. That’s how it is. ‘For Emilio it won’t be a problem because he played in the World Cup. It was important that Fraser played in this game but he has been training well and I think he is ready. ‘Efe will join up with the squad on Sunday and we will see how he is but he will be in the squad for the game against Reykjavik. ‘He also played four matches in the World Cup and that is important. I would have no hesitation about throwing him in. He is a quality player and we need all the quality we have.’ Celtic departed Austria with two wins and two draws from their four run-outs, but the real value for Deila was in building a relationship with his players at their training base in Bad Leonfelden. He is confident the fruits of that labour will be seen in Reykjavik. Strike: Celtic's Emilio Izaguirre sees his effort on goal saved by the Dukla Prague goalkeeper . Snap happy: Izaguirre poses for a photo with a young Celtic fan at full-time . ‘I think we have prepared for the qualifiers as well as we could do,’ he said. ‘We have not had that many days together, but this training camp was very important. I got to know the players and they got to know me. We will have a good team on Tuesday. ‘The game against Dukla was one against a good opponent. I think the performance was one step forward from Rapid Vienna last Sunday. ‘Of course, there is still a long way to go but we finished this game strongly and that was a positive for us. ‘We have to be ready for the European matches. I’m looking forward to the game against Reykjavik.’Celtic famously defeated Dukla in the European Cup semi-final en route to their 1967 glory in Lisbon, but this reunion was a distinctly forgettable affair. Back to business: Celtic's Fraser Forster makes his first appearance since returning from the World Cup . Miss: Celtic's Callum McGregor has his shot easily saved during the 0-0 draw in Austria . Deila’s side wove some pretty passing patterns in the first half but too often the little triangles were in front of a defence which was quite happy to sit in. The greater attacking threat came from the Czechs when they broke forward. Forster had already saved from Tomas Berger when a loose touch from Kris Commons in central midfeld suddenly left his defence exposed. Michael Krmencik was played through but couldn’t get his drive on target. Shortly afterwards, Forster did well to spread himself in front of the same player as he tried to dink a shot into the net. The lack of wide options available to Deila was underlined by Stefan Johansen being shifted to a left wing role, with Derk Boerrigter operating on the right. Challenge: Celtic's Charlie Mulgrew (left) wins the ball as he tackles Matej Hanousek . Charging through: Striker Tony Watt causes problems for Hanousek (left) and Jan Joruska (right) Getting in behind Dukla was proving decidedly tricky, but an overlapping Izaguirre managed to do so before drilling in a low cross that was only half-cleared. Anthony Stokes seized upon the loose ball but his strike was directly at goalkeeper Filip Rada. The format remained largely the same after the break, albeit that Celtic were less troubled defensively. A breakthrough very nearly arrived when young centre-back Eoghan O’Connell picked out Stokes with a lob forward. The Irish striker’s control was good but Rada reacted well to parry away the angled shot. Receiving orders: Watt (left) is given some tactical advice by Celtic captain Scott Brown . Sidelined: Injured Brown (left) looks on from the dugout during the friendly in Steyr . Virgil van Dijk then tried to catch out the Dukla No.1 with a thump from distance, before Izaguirre saw a near-post drive blocked after neat interplay with substitute Tony Watt. Ultimately, though, the match meandered to a stalemate that meant Celtic remain so far unbeaten in Deila’s short tenure. The first real test, of course, will come in Iceland next week.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Victim: United Airlines flight attendant DeCarol Deloney-Cain, pictured, was murdered and dumped in the trunk of her own car where she was discovered on Monday . A woman whose body was found in a car trunk in Gary, Illinois, has been identified as a missing United Airlines flight attendant. Lake County Deputy Coroner George Deliopoulos said 54-year-old DeCarol Deloney-Cain of Crown Point was positively identified through serial numbers on her breast implants. An autopsy determined she died from blunt force trauma to her head and multiple stab wounds to her chest and the manner of death was ruled a homicide. The mother of two adult sons and a teenage daughter was in the midst of a divorce that was due to be finalized August 14, court documents show. Her body was found Monday wrapped in material in the trunk of her car in a wooded area in Gary, 12 miles north of Crown Point. Deliopoulos said Gary detectives and Lake County crime scene investigators executed a search warrant and retrieved evidence at the victim's home on Wednesday. Authorities have not identified any suspects. Deloney-Cain's son, Blake Deloney, told The Times that United Airlines contacted him Sunday when his mother didn't report for work. An airline spokesman says Deloney-Cain served as a flight attendant on international flights out of Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. She'd worked for the airline for 28 years. The air hostess was often gone for days at a time because of her job. As such, her family thought nothing of her absence, the Chicago-Sun Times reported.

"By . James Rush . There have been more violent clashes between angry residents and police in a Rio de Janeiro favela with the start of the World Cup in Brazil just 50 days away. Residents lit fires and peppered a busy avenue in a busy tourist area with homemade explosives and glass bottles after the death of a 25-year-old man. They blame police for the death of a well-known dancer Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira, whose body was found earlier in the day. Exchanges of gunfire were heard after an elite police unit moved into the Pavao-Pavaozinho area yesterday. He was a well-known figure in the community, as he was a dancer on a TV show for Brazil's Globo network, the nation's largest channel. The circumstances of his death are not yet clear. Iconic: The Rio de Janeiro skyline with the famous Maracana Stadium in the background that will host the city's  first match on June 15, between Argentina and Bosnia-Hercegovina . Sharp shooter: Violent protests broke out in Rio's landmark beachfront district, Copacabana, following the death of a resident . Take cover: People walk through smoke from fires set by protesters following shootings in the Pavao-Pavaozinho community, just blocks from Copacabana Beach . Ablaze: Residents run for cover during violent clashes between protestors and Brazilian Police Special Forces in a favela near Copacabana . Angry: Residents blame police for the killing of 25-year-old Douglas Rafael da Silva Pereira whose body was found earlier in the day . Hands up: Brazilian Police Special Force members detain a man during a violent protest in a favela near Copacabana . On the run: A Brazilian Police Special Forces member takes position during the violent protests with angry residents on Tuesday . The O Globo newspaper, citing local health officials, reported that another resident of the area was shot and killed, and a 12-year-old boy shot and wounded, during Tuesday night's gunfire. It's not clear who fired the shots that hit either, nor did police confirm the reports. The Pavao-Pavaozinho favela lies just a few hundred yards from where Olympic swimming events are expected to take place in 2016. It was the latest violence to hit one of Rio's so-called 'pacified' favelas - impoverished areas that for decades were controlled by drug gangs. Police began an ambitious security program in 2008 to drive the gangs from such slums and for the first time set up permanent posts. It is part of Rio's overall security push ahead of the World Cup that begins this June and the Olympics the city will host. So far, 37 such 'police pacification units' have been created covering an area with a population of 1.5 million people. Reaction: Angry residents lit fires throughout the slum and tossed homemade explosives, bottles and other objects down onto Copacabana's main avenues . Close eye: Brazilian police on patrol following shootings in the Pavao-Pavaozinho community, just blocks from Copacabana Beach . History: Drug gangs have brazenly attacked police outposts, in what authorities themselves say is an effort to block the expansion of the 'pacification' programme . Fatality: The O Globo newspaper, reported another resident of the area was shot and killed, and a 12-year-old boy shot and wounded, during Tuesday night's gunfire . But there have been repeated complaints of heavy-handed police tactics that have ended in the deaths of residents, and that is what set-off the latest clashes, resident said. More than two dozen police face charges from a high-profile case in a different area, when investigators said a local man died while being tortured by police. Residents have also lamented the lack of social services that had been promised to arrive along with the police presence in their communities. Tuesday's violence erupted following the discovery of the 25-year-old dancer. 'The police beat my friend to death, just like they've tortured and killed in other communities,' said Johanas Mesquita, a 23-year-old resident of Pavao-Pavaozinho. 'This effort to pacify the favelas is a failure, the police violence is only replacing what the drug gangs carried out before.' High hopes: The Brazilian people are expecting the home nation - with the likes of Dani Alves (left), David Luiz (top) and Marcelo (right) - to win the World Cup in their country this summer . Police on the scene refused to answer questions about what prompted the violence. A spokeswoman reached by telephone said they did not have an immediate statement. Following the discovery of the body, angry residents began lighting fires throughout the slum and tossing homemade explosives, bottles and other objects down onto Copacabana's main avenues. Elite police units later entered the slum, and at least three prolonged exchanges of gunfire were heard, presumably between officers and the drug gang members who continue to maintain a presence in the shantytown. In recent months, drug gangs have brazenly attacked police outposts, in what authorities themselves say is an effort to block the expansion of the 'pacification' programme and to win back lucrative drug-selling territory. Since November, gunfights have regularly broken out in the slum where Tuesday's violence took place.","Violence breaks out in a Rio de Janeiro favela near Copacabana beach .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Cambridge scientists have found evidence that the Milky Way was formed from the inside out. Using data from the Gaia-ESO project, scientists were able to back up predicted divisions in the chemical make-up of stars. Their research reveals how stars in centre of the Milky Way ‘live fast and die young’, shedding light on the formation of disk galaxies. Scroll down for video... By tracking fast-produced elements, and specifically magnesium, astronomers have uncovered evidence that stars in the inner regions of the Milky Way's disc formed first . The scientists analysed levels of magnesium - which is present in older stars - to determine their age. Using the eight metre Very Large Telescope in Chile, they discovered the inner regions of the Milky Way were the first to form, explaining its 'flying saucer' shape. When the Milky Way first evolved it is thought to have been made purely made of hydrogen and helium. The older the star the less it contains other contaminated elements built up over time. When the Milky Way first evolved it is thought to have been made purely made of hydrogen and helium. Pictured here is the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy from Spitzer Space Telescope . The purpose of the Gaia mission is to create a precise 3D map of the Milky Way. The billion stars that Gaia will map is still only one per cent of the Milky Way's total number of stars. It is Europe's successor to the Hipparcos satellite which mapped around 100,000 stars. Hipparcos . was the very first mission for measuring astrometry - the positions, . distances, motions, brightness and colours of stars. It is hoped Gaia will find also reveal new asteroids, dead stars, and test current theories about our cosmos. Its map will also become a reference frame to guide the investigations of future telescopes. But older and purer stars in the centre actually have very high levels of magnesium. Magnesium is present in more efficient stars that form quickly, but bursts of magnesium also explosively shoot out of stars as they die. This catastrophic event can form a neutron star or a black hole, and even trigger the formation of new stars. Because of this the astronomers have now worked out that the older stars in the centre will die before those on the outer circle where the sun sits. ‘The different chemical elements of which stars - and we - are made are created at different rates - some in massive stars which live fast and die young, and others in sun-like stars with more sedate multi-billion-year lifetimes,’ said Professor Gerry Gilmore, lead investigator on the Gaia-ESO Project. The findings are the part of the first wave of new findings from the Gaia-ESO survey, launched by the European Space Agency at the end of last year. ‘We have been able to shed new light on the timescale of chemical enrichment across the Milky Way disc, showing that outer regions of the disc take a much longer time to form,’ said Maria Bergemann from Cambridge’s Institute of Astronomy, who led the study. ‘This supports theoretical models for the formation of disc galaxies in the context of Cold Dark Matter cosmology, which predict that galaxy discs grow inside-out.’ Gaia, pictured, is fitted with a 1,000MP camera that will also hunt for planets and asteroids. It cost £620million to build and the project cost a total of £2billion . The new research also sheds further light on another much debated ‘double structure’ in the Milky Way’s disc – the so-called ‘thin’ and ‘thick’ discs. ‘The thin disc hosts spiral arms, young stars, giant molecular clouds – all objects which are young, at least in the context of the galaxy,’ explained Aldo Serenelli from the Institute of Space Sciences , a co-author of the study. ‘But astronomers have long suspected there is another disc, which is thicker, shorter and older. This thick disc hosts many old stars that have low metallicity.’ ‘From what we now know, the galaxy is not an ‘either-or’ system. You can find stars of different ages and metal content everywhere’, said Professor Bergemann. ‘There is no clear separation between the thin and thick disc. The proportion of stars with different properties is not the same in both discs - that’s how we know these two discs probably exist – but they could have very different origins.’ In theory, say astronomers, the thick disc could have emerged in a variety of ways, from massive gravitational instabilities to consuming satellite galaxies in its formative years. ‘The Milky Way has cannibalised many small galaxies during its formation. Now, with the Gaia-ESO Survey, we can study the detailed tracers of these events, essentially dissecting the belly of the beast,’ said Greg Ruchti, a researcher at Lund Observatory in Sweden, who co-leads the project.","Scientists studied magnesium levels in older stars to determine their age .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . The Obama administration is considering ending spying on allied heads of state, a senior administration official said, as the White House grappled with the fallout from revelations that the U.S. has eavesdropped on German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The official said late Monday that a final decision had not been made and an internal review was still underway. The revelations about National Security Agency monitoring of Merkel were the latest in a months-long spying scandal that has strained longstanding alliances with some of America's closest partners. Scroll down for video . President Obama is considering ending spying on allies, as the White House grapples with the fallout from eavesdropping on German Chancellor Angela Merkel . Earlier Monday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a ‘total review of all intelligence programs.’ Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement that the White House had informed her that ‘collection on our allies will not continue.’ The administration official said that statement was not accurate, but added that some unspecified changes already had been made and more were being considered, including terminating the collection of communications from friendly heads of state. The official was not authorized to discuss the review by name and insisted on anonymity. As a result of the spying allegations, German officials said on Monday that the U.S. could lose access to an important law enforcement tool used to track terrorist money flows. As possible leverage, German authorities cited last week's non-binding resolution by the European Parliament to suspend a post-9/11 agreement allowing the Americans access to bank transfer data to track the flow of terrorist money. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, called for a 'total review of all intelligence programs' on Monday . A top German official said she believed the Americans were using the information obtained from Merkel to gather economic intelligence apart from terrorism and that the agreement known as SWIFT should be suspended. Feinstein said while the intelligence community has kept her apprised of other issues, like the court orders on telephone record collection, intelligence officials failed to brief her on how they followed foreign leaders. Her statement follows reports based on new leaks from former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden indicating that the NSA listened to Merkel and 34 other foreign leaders. ‘With respect to NSA collection of intelligence on leaders of U.S. allies - including France, Spain, Mexico and Germany - let me state unequivocally: I am totally opposed,’ Feinstein said. She added that the U.S. should not be ‘collecting phone calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers’ unless in an emergency with approval of the president. European Union officials who are in Washington to meet with lawmakers ahead of White House talks said U.S. surveillance of their people could affect negotiations over a U.S.-Europe trade agreement. They said European privacy must be better protected. A top German official said she believed the Americans were using the information obtained from Merkel to gather economic intelligence apart from terrorism . Many officials in Germany and other European governments have made clear, however, that they don't favor suspending the U.S.-EU trade talks which began last summer because both sides stand to gain so much through the proposed deal, especially against competition from China and other emerging markets. As tensions with European allies escalate, the top U.S. intelligence official declassified dozens of pages of top secret documents in an apparent bid to show the NSA was acting legally when it gathered millions of Americans' phone records. Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper said he was following the president's direction to make public as much information as possible about how U.S. intelligence agencies spy under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Monday's release of documents focused on Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the bulk collection of U.S. phone records. The document release is part of an administration-wide effort to preserve the NSA's ability to collect bulk data, which it says is key to tracking key terror suspects, but which privacy activists say is a breach of the Constitution's ban on unreasonable search and seizure of evidence from innocent Americans. The release of the documents comes ahead of a House Intelligence Committee hearing Tuesday on FISA reform. New leaks from former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden indicate that the NSA listened to Merkel and 34 other foreign leaders . The documents support administration testimony that the NSA worked to operate within the law and fix errors when they or their systems overreached. One of the documents shows the NSA admitting to the House Intelligence Committee that one of its automated systems picked up too much telephone metadata. The February 2009 document indicates the problem was fixed. Another set of documents shows the judges of the FISA court seemed satisfied with the NSA's cooperation. It says that in September 2009, the NSA advised the Senate Intelligence Committee about its continuing collection of Americans' phone records and described a series of demonstrations and briefings it conducted for three judges on the secretive U.S. spy court. The memorandum said the judges were ‘engaged throughout and asked questions, which were answered by the briefers and other subject matter experts,’ and said the judges appreciated the amount and quality of information the NSA provided. It said that two days later, one of the judges, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton, renewed the court's permission to resume collecting phone records. The documents also included previously classified testimony from 2009 for the House Intelligence Committee by Michael Leiter, then head of the National Counterterrorism Center. White House press secretary Jay Carney denied on Monday that NSA intelligence gathering had been used to benefit American economic interests as well as for security purposes . He and other officials said collecting Americans' phone records helped indict Najibullah Zazi, who was accused in a previously disclosed 2009 terror plot to bomb the New York City subways. The documents also show the NSA considered tracking targets using cellphone location data, and according to an April 2011 memo consulted the Justice Department first, which said such collection was legal. Only later did the NSA inform the FISA court of the testing. NSA commander Gen. Keith Alexander revealed the testing earlier this month to Congress but said the agency did not use the capability to track Americans' cellphone locations nor deem it necessary right now. Asked Monday if the NSA intelligence gathering had been used not only to protect national security but American economic interests as well, White House spokesman Jay Carney said: ‘We do not use our intelligence capabilities for that purpose. We use it for security purposes.’ But National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden later clarified that: ‘We do not use our intelligence capabilities to give U.S. companies an advantage, not ruling out that we are interested in economic information.’ Carney acknowledged the tensions with allies over the eavesdropping disclosures and said the White House was ‘working to allay those concerns,’ though he refused to discuss any specific reports or provide details of internal White House discussions.","Obama administration considering ending spying on allied heads of state .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . British tourists are facing sky-high car hire costs in some of the most popular summer holiday destinations. Costs in Majorca, for example, are almost twice as high as those in Cyprus, which has the lowest charges among 16 resorts surveyed by Post Office Travel Money. Other popular spots where charges were particularly high include Faro in Portugal, Split in Croatia and Dublin. Costs in Majorca (pictured), for example, are almost twice as high as those in Cyprus, which has the lowest charges among 16 resorts surveyed by Post Office Travel Money . The survey took into account not just the basic care hire cost, but also such expense as satnav hire, additional-driver cover and 40 litres of petrol. On this basis, one-week car hire in Larnaca in Cyprus was just £295, while in the most expensive - the Norwegian capital Oslo - it was as much as £614. Majorca was the next most pricey - at £514 - while Split was £509, Faro £503 and Dublin £482. After Larnaca, the best value destination was Luqa in Malta (£317), followed by Marmaris in Turkey (£325), Copenhagen (£335) and Salzburg in Austria (£362). The survey took into account not just the basic care hire cost, but also such expense as satnav hire, additional-driver cover and 40 litres of petrol . Post Office Travel Money said its survey of 2,106 UK adults showed that in hiring a car, 56 per cent failed to take out excess waiver insurance that reduces the excess payable for accidents or theft to zero. Even more (76 per cent) did not take out insurance cover for tyre, undercarriage and window damage. Andrew Brown, of Post Office Travel Money, said: 'These figures make it clear that it is a false economy to cut costs by sticking to the basic cost when booking car rental online. 'We advise against taking a risk that could cost hundreds of pounds if your hire car suffers damage or is stolen.'","Costs in Majorca, for example, are almost twice as high as those in Cyprus ."
"By . Jonathan Petre . A senior judge has issued a stark warning to lesbians about the dangers of fathering children using donated sperm. Mr Justice Peter Jackson became the latest senior legal figure to express fears over unregulated artificial conception after ruling in a bitter battle between a separated couple over access to their six-month-old baby. The High Court judge said the case was ‘one more example of the painful legal confusion’ that arises when lesbians have children without considering all the consequences. Landmark ruling: A woman, who cannot be named, has been ruled the 'psychological parent' of the baby she and her partner conceived using sperm from a donor they met online . He spoke out after hearing a case involving two women, one English and one Irish, who had been in a relationship for about 18 months. They had decided to have a baby together and the English woman had used a syringe to inseminate her partner with sperm from a donor they found on the internet. The Irish woman, who is in her mid-30s, gave birth in October and the couple lived together in England and jointly looked after the girl, with the English woman even breastfeeding her when her natural mother fell ill. But the couple’s relationship was ‘fraught with difficulties’ and they separated. The judge said that in January, when their daughter was two months old, the Irish woman had taken  the child from the arms of her ‘protesting’ partner and moved back  to her native country. He said the ‘extremely distressed’ English woman, who is in her mid-40s, was fighting for contact with the child, but as she was not the biological parent she had limited legal rights. In his ruling, delivered after a private hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London, Sir Peter concluded that the baby’s ‘removal’ to Ireland was lawful and an English court did not have jurisdiction. Legal rights: Same-sex couples who conceive at home rather than a clinic are not both legally granted parental status. The non-birth mother must file for adoption (file image) But he also said that at the time  the girl was taken to Ireland, ‘family life’, as defined in the European Convention on Human Rights, had existed between the baby and the English woman. He also quoted Mrs Justice Eleanor King describing a similar case as ‘a valuable cautionary tale of the serious legal and practical difficulties that can arise where men or women, desperate for a child of their own, enter into informal arrangements.’ Experts said such cases were likely to increase as the nature of families in Britain changed. Solicitor Hannah Cornish, a family law expert at Slater and Gordon, said: ‘The couple needed to make an application to the court to protect the parental rights of the woman who was not the biological mother as soon as the child was born. ‘But they just didn’t address it, and unfortunately, when everything is going well, people don’t automatically think about the legal implications. I think these sorts of scenarios are going to increase as the nature of the family changes.’","Couple found sperm donor online, administered injection together .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Government must crack down on untaxed foreign cars on British roads, the RAC has said. Around 60,000 non-UK vehicles are registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) every year but an estimated 15,000 are not registered, the RAC said. It means that around £3 million in vehicle excise duty (VED) is not being collected each year, the RAC added. The Government must crack down on untaxed foreign cars on British roads, the RAC has said . The RAC said that under current regulations visiting non-UK cars must be registered with the DVLA once they have been in the UK for six months when they must pay a £55 first registration fee, ensure they have paid VED, obtain an MOT if the vehicle is over three years old and in some instances pay VAT. Around 60,000 non-UK vehicles are registered with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) every year but an estimated 15,000 are not registered, the RAC said . The RAC added: 'However, despite the fact the UK Border Force gathers details of every non-UK vehicle entering and leaving the country this information is not currently used by the DVLA for licensing purposes, which means the Government is missing out on valuable tax revenue. 'And, as the DVLA has no idea whether non-UK-registered vehicles have stayed in the country longer than six months, many over three years may well not have a valid MOT and therefore will be contravening insurance rules, thereby compromising the safety of all road users. 'The lack . of a record also means that EU-registered and other foreign vehicles are . more likely to evade fines generated by the UK's army of speed cameras - . a further source of revenue that could be ploughed back into the . country's roads.'

"By . James  Nye . A cop who set up a hidden camera to video the town police chief having sex in a public ambulance lost his job on Friday, while his boss kept his. New Mexico officer Joshua Terrell tried to catch Jal police chief Larry Burns having sex inside and up against an ambulance on city property because he wanted to sabotage his run for magistrate. Despite catching Burns on camera with a woman while wearing his gun and badge, the dastardly plan came back to haunt Terrell after he gave the footage to local television instead of Jal city manager, Bob Gallagher. Scroll Down for Video . Reprieved: Larry Burns (pictured) kept his job despite being caught having sex in a town ambulance while  Joshua Terrell lost his job . Initially, Burns was suspended for two weeks without pay while an investigation was launched. That discovered that Terrell planted the camera and led to his dismisal for violating eight different policies including using a key to access the ambulance bay when he was not authorized to be there. And, because he did not keep the video evidence internal, he is not protected from the sack as a whistleblower, because he released it to the public. 'To try to destroy a person that he did not like – I thought we didn't need Terrell with a badge or a gun,' Mr Gallagher said to KRQE. Caught in the act: Jal police chief Larry Burns is seen here in these grabs having sex inside and on the ambulance as videoed by Joshua Terrell . 'It would have been very easy if he had just come in with the tape and said, 'Mr Gallagher, I think something is going wrong in the department'.' Gallagher said that Burns did make an error of judgement, but that no evidence could be found that he committed a crime or was even on duty when the tape was filmed. The police chief, Larry Burns, also serves as the town of Jal’s Emergency Medical Services Director. 'In this case there was no criminal activity whatsoever, there was no proof whatsoever that it was on duty when he should have been working, ' said Gallagher according to Opposing Views. 'I think it was lapse of judgment. Something that I don’t think will keep him from being able to perform his duties when he comes back.'","Jal police chief Larry Burns was suspended for two weeks after footage of him having sex was recorded and leaked by officer Joshua Terrell .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Sam Twiston-Davies is only 21 but he is hobbling around the office building at Grange Hill Farm like a wizened old man. A crashing fall at Wincanton the previous evening has left him barely able to walk. Most people would be in bed but Twiston-Davies, like all jump jockeys, is a breed apart. His most pressing concern is not the crippling bruising on his left hip but passing a medical examination so he can ride at Market Rasen that afternoon. ‘I spent the night with it iced up,’ he said. ‘But then the ice fell off my leg and my bed was soaking wet when I woke up. I’ll ice it in the lorry on the way down to take away the swelling. They make you do squats and press-ups to show you’re OK. They’re very good at strapping you up and getting you back out there.’ Falls are as much a part of the job as hot baths to make weight and studying the formbook every morning. Twiston-Davies knows they are coming — ‘I think one in every eight or nine rides ends on the deck’ — but it would never stop him from racing. Sam Twiston-Davies is relishing his new role as stable jockey for Paul Nicholls . The risk . of bone-crunching falls is even perversely useful in engendering a sense . of brotherhood in the weighing room. ‘You’re like a massive . dysfunctional family in there,’ said  Twiston-Davies. ‘You . might not get along with the lad three pegs down but if  he was to have . a fall you’d be  the first to help him out, get his car home and see . him in the  hospital.’ Twiston-Davies . is the hottest property in race riding. Last month he was made stable . jockey for Paul Nicholls — champion trainer in eight of the last nine . years — and had his first winner in his new job on Pressies Girl on . Thursday evening. Nicholls has previously shared his best horses among a . number of jockeys but Twiston-Davies will have the pick of the bunch . this season. It . is a move which means he could be the biggest threat to the dominance . of AP McCoy in the last two decades. Not that he has any ideas about . toppling the greatest champion racing has ever had. ‘To . think about ever challenging him is crazy,’ he said in reverential . tones. ‘You wouldn’t ever think about trying to beat AP. Richard . Johnson’s tried for 19 years and finished second and third every time. I . think AP’s the most dominant champion in world sport, just to ride in . the same generation as him is a privilege. The long-term dream for me is . to be champion jockey but it’s never going to happen when AP’s around. Laid-back: Twiston-Davies was relaxing at his father's yard in the Cotswolds . ‘The . day AP retires is going to be a sad day for racing because we’ll all . miss him, but it’s going to be so competitive because the whole thing’s . going to open up. The domination he has is amazing.’ Twiston-Davies . was three years old when McCoy won the first of his 19 champion jockey . titles in 1996. With his lightly freckled face, red hair and airy charm, . he oozes youth but has had a whole lifetime preparing for this career. The oldest son of trainer Nigel Twiston-Davies grew up in Cheltenham, . the home of jump racing,  surrounded by jockeys. ‘Carl . Llwellyn was stable jockey for my dad when I was growing up. He won two . Grand Nationals on Saturdays and then was sat down with us on Monday . morning at the kitchen table eating boiled eggs and soldiers for . breakfast before we went to school. Family affair: Sam will keep the ride on his father's star horse The New One, who is a leading contender for next year's Champion Hurdle . ‘I . learned so much from having all these amazing jockeys around so there’s . no way I would be riding as well as I am without having my start here. But at the same time, the early days were all about trying to prove . myself, to show that I wasn’t just getting rides because of my dad. ‘I did all the mucking out and riding out the same as everyone  but I think sometimes people didn’t understand that at first.’ Twiston-Davies . is rake thin, with his tracksuit bottoms hanging from his hips and . wearing a Las Vegas hoodie bought during a trip to Nevada last week with . fellow jockeys Aidan Coleman and Richie McLernon. ‘I . went away to Vegas weighing 9st11 and came back 9st12 despite eating . three massive meals a day. I’m quite lucky in that respect.’ Younger brother Willy, 19, rides on the flat and is stable jockey for Mick Channon. Rising star: Twiston-Davies' spiralling profile has seen him get the job as Paul Nicholls' stable jockey . ‘You . wouldn’t believe we were brothers,’ said Twiston-Davies, ‘He’s 6ft tall . and made of nothing. Because he has to watch his weight so much he’d be . lucky to have a meal a day so he’s grumpy a lot of the time. He’s very . quiet because he saves so much of the energy for trying to be bubbly in . the paddock beforehand. He’s great fun when he’s eating and drinking . normally. ‘It’s hard watching . what he does but those are the sacrifices he’s willing to make. We all . make sacrifices because it’s the best job in the country.’ A . natural raconteur, Twiston-Davies is more ebullient than most jockeys . and sees his responsibilities as extending beyond the winning post. ‘I . try to be happy,’ he said. ‘When the owners are there I try to make . their five minutes before and after their horse has run enjoyable. Even . if I’ve pulled it up five out, if I can somehow put a smile on their . face afterwards then I’ve done my job.’","The 21-year-old is the new stable jockey for champion trainer Paul Nicholls .

"By . Mark Prigg . A mysterious Twitter user has posted a series of pictures claiming to be the casing of Apple's iPhone 6. They show handset in various states of competition sporting a bigger screen and a slimmed down, curved design. The images were posted to a mystery Twitter account, with no way to know if they are real. Scroll down for video . Is this the iPhone 6? Images claim to show the handset have been posted to Twitter . The images appear to show a large handset, but with curved edges similar to early iPhone models . According to the latest rumours, there will be three models of iPhone 6: . 4 inch 1136x640 ( 326 ppi ) display for the cheapest iPhone . 4.7 inch 1920x1080 ( 440 ppi ) display for the standard handset, which rumours say could be called the 'iPhone Air' 5.5 inch 2272x1280 ( 510 ppi ) display for the largest 'iPhone Pro' The user, mornray866 does does reveal how he obtained the prototypes - or why many of the shots show them in plastic bags. They are the latest in a long line of images claiming to reveal apple's latest handset - even though Apple itself has refused to comment on any details of the upcoming phone. Rumours claim it will be a a range of handsets with a 4inch, 4.7inch and 5.5inch screen. It was also claimed today the handset will use a new camera module from Sony to boost its front facing camera to improve the quality of selfies. The Japanese firm already supplies nearly all of the CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) sensors for the current iPhone models' rear-mounted main cameras, according to Nikkei. Apple is likely looking to switch to Sony sensors for the secondary camera on the screen side, used for taking self-portraits, it claimed today. Another recent concept by Italian artists Enrico Penello and Ran Avni reveals a host of new features they would like to see included, with a curved glass screen and  shows how these devices will be. Introducing the iPhone 6 devices. It shows a curve screen with 'bumps' at the top and bottom, along with an illuminated Touch ID sensor used to recognise fingerprints. The handsets are shown in a white and gold and silver version . The latest  rumors claim that Apple will launch three new iPhone models - 4 inch, 4.7 inch, and 5.5 inch. This new concept by Enrico Penello and Ran Avni shows how these devices could look. The pair also outline what they think the screens will be: 'The screens: 4 inch 1136x640 ( 326 ppi ) display for the cheapest iPhone, 4.7 inch 1920x1080 ( 440 ppi ) display for the standard iPhone, 5.5 inch 2272x1280 ( 510 ppi ) display for the largest iPhone. The concepts show a phone made from curved glass with a 'bump' at the top . The latest mockup comes after Taiwanese sources say the camera in the iPhone 6 will get a boost to ten megapixels from its current eight, along with a new lens offering better picture quality. It is also expected to boast a new filter allowing clearer pictures. According to MacRumours, the new filter will replace the hybrid IR filter used on the iPhone 5s with a resin lens filter manufactured by Japanese company JSR. Recent rumours also claim there will be two models, one with a 4.7inch screen, and one with a 5.7inch screen. Apple's latest iPhones: The firm is believed to be preparing to release two new large-screen phones in June . Apple's iPhone 6 is rumoured to come in a slim 'Air' version. Up until August last year, Huawei was the . record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, . at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Samsung's Galaxy S4 is 7.9mm thick, while the HTC One is 9.3mm. Previous rumours have pointed to a super slim 'iPhone Air' model, which could be the smaller handset. The two new handsets are expected to be revealed at Apple's annual annual developer conference, held in San Francisco in June. It is where the firm traditionally makes new product announcements. If announced, the handsets are expected to go on sale within weeks. Chinese analyst Sun Changxu told Chinese-language website QQ Tech that Apple will launch the follow up to its flagship smartphone in two large screen sizes. According to Sun, the iPhone 6 will come with a 4.7-inch screen, with a display resolution of 1,136 by 640 pixels. The company would then launch a larger 5.7-inch model shortly afterwards. Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, and rumours suggest it could be working on making an equally slender version of its iPhone. Concept images have emerged that show Apple's next-generation handset with a super-thin slender chassis. This concept, by Italian-based firm SET Solution, predicts the handset could be 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom, in order to retain the home button . By comparison, Apple's current iPhone 5S, pictured, has a depth of 7.6mm. This makes it 1.7mm thinner than the iPhone 4S and 1.37mm thinner than the iPhone 5C . Two concept images have emerged that show Apple’s next-generation handset with a slender chassis, as well as a larger 5-inch screen similar to those seen on the Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One. The first concept predicts the phone - dubbed the 'iPhone Air' - will be 4.5mm thick, while the second goes a step further showing the device as 1.5mm at the top and 3mm at the bottom. By comparison, Apple’s current iPhone 5S has a depth of 7.6mm, while the iPad Air is slightly thinner at 7.5mm. Up until August last year, Huawei was the record-holder for the thinnest phone in the world with its Ascend P6, at 6.18mm. This was then replaced by the Vivo X3 at just 5.75mm. In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken’s concept suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys. In order to make the Apple phone super-thin, Fuse Chicken's concept - dubbed iPhone Air - suggests doing away with the physical home button in place of touchscreen keys and swipe controls . Apple surprised a number of people last year when it unveiled its super-thin iPad Air, pictured, which was 20% thinner than previous models . SET Solution’s concept, instead, keeps the home button by making the bottom of the phone thicker than the top. It also appears taller than Fuse Chicken’s version in order to fit the larger screen. Apple’s iPhone has one of the smallest screens on the market and many experts predicted the screen on the iPhone 5S would be the first to break the 4-inch mark - but it didn't. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has previously said his firm has kept to smaller screens because they’re easier to use and more comfortable to hold in the hand. However, with main rivals Samsung, HTC and Nokia releasing phones with screens in the 5-inch region, analysts claim Apple may have to increase the size of their designs to appeal to more people. Last November, designer Martin Hajek created a concept demonstrating it was possible to increase the iPhone's screen size, without drastically increasing the size of the handset. In his image, the screen is shown as stretched to reach left and right edges. However, because the bezel would need to be a certain size to avoid the screen being touched by accident, when it’s picked up for example, the usable screen size would be much smaller reduced. According to Forbes journalist Anthony Wing Kosner: 'The only way I could see something that thin working for users, is if the material was flexible as well so it could easily slip into a pocket.' He continued that if Apple was capable of making a phone as thin as the concepts suggest, which would also depend on making the components small and thin enough to fit inside the chassis, it could also pave the way for foldable devices.

"By . James Gordon . Published: . 15:33 EST, 28 August 2013 . | . Updated: . 17:40 EST, 26 November 2013 . Buyers paid up to $17 million for canvases said to have been created modernist painters such as  Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline and Robert Motherwell. But it now appears that most, if not all of the 63 works of art (which fetched almost $80 million in sales) were nothing more than fakes and painted in a garage in Queens, New York. 'Thief': Glafira Rosales is accused raking in more than $33million by selling phoney artwork to New York galleries . Gallery president: Ann Freedman sold 40 works of art for Knoedler & Company thinking they were masterpieces when they were in fact fake. The gallery raked in $63 million . Authentic: This is what a REAL Jackson Pollock painting looks like . The paintings were instead created by an artist (73-year-old Chinese-American painter Pei-Shen Qian,) who was paid a few thousand dollars each to create the counterfeit masterpieces. Federal prosecutors have not named or charged the painter. There are few details except that it is known he trained at Manhattan art school and was selling his work on the streets of New York City until a Chelsea art dealer converted his work into a multi-million dollar fraud. Glafira Rosales, an obscure dealer from Long Island, has been charged with wire fraud, tax evasion and money laundering, after a lengthy FBI inquiry. Investigators say Ms. Rosales sold 40 of the counterfeit works through Knoedler & Company and received about $63 million from their sale. Atelier: The gallery owners were told the works of art had been in someones private collection and sealed up. In reality they were being created in a garage at this home in Queens . Talented: Pei-Shen Qian, 73, a quiet 73-year-old immigrant from China, is suspected of having fooled the art world by creating dozens of works that were modeled after America¿s Modernist masters that were later sold for more than $80 million . Another $17 million was garnered after sales through a second Manhattan dealer, Julian Weissman. Ms. Rosales has pleaded not guilty and was released earlier this month. Knoedler, until recently one of New York’s oldest and most respected art galleries, its former president Ann Freedman, 65, and Mr. Weissman have both repeatedly said they believed the works they sold had been authentic. ‘I am as shocked as everybody, more shocked, as I am the central victim. Fifteen years. In my head, these paintings have been right. Horrible,’ she told New York magazine. Knoedler sold 40 of the fakes for an alleged $63 million. Before shutting down abruptly in late 2011, the gallery made a $20 million payment to Rosales. The saga all began when Rosales approached Ms. Freedman claiming to represent a foreign collector who ‘was of Eastern European descent, maintained residences in Switzerland and Mexico, wished to remain anonymous, and had inherited the works ... from a relative.’ ‘The story was credible,’ said Ms Freedman to New York magazine. ‘Dealers often do not know the specifics of origin or background, or how the art left the artist’s studio. You cannot turn the pages of an auction catalogue or museum publication without seeing a majority of the works labeled ‘private collection.’ The chain of ownership is often out of order and incomplete.’ Low-profile: This is the garage in Queens where  Pei-Shen Qian over a period of 15 years churned out at least 63 drawings and paintings that carried the signatures of artistic giants like Jackson Pollock, Barnett Newman and Robert Motherwell . Freedman says that she did her best to get answers from Rosales. ‘I went to Glafira and pushed and pushed to get more information, relentlessly,’ Freedman said. ‘My ongoing diligence met more than the gold standard; there is plenty of evidence of that.’ She even claims that she had the paintings checked over to ensure their authenticity. ‘They were very credible in so many respects,’ says Freedman. ‘I had the best conservation studio examine them. One of the Rothkos had a Sgroi stretcher. He made the stretchers for Rothko. They clearly had the right materials. I got a consensus. Some of the paintings were featured on museum walls.’ Some experts were convinced due to the quality of the paintings that they could only have been achieved by the artists themselves. ‘‘The fact is that the entire Eastern establishment believed in them. I saw the paintings,’ said Stephen Polcari, a scholar of Abstract Expressionism ‘And they were very good. You wouldn’t think twice about them for a second. Ann did everything she could possibly do.’ Near-perfect copy: Rosales allegedly sold bogus versions Willem De Kooning works similar to this authentic piece worth more then $3million . A true original: This authentic Mark Rothko oil on canvas is part of 'Selections From the Collection of the Guggenheim Bilbao' Did she know? Ann Freedman ended up leaving Knoedler, until recently one of New York¿s oldest and most respected art galleries, around the time suspicions were aroused. The gallery then folded after more than 160 years . But others were not convinced so easily. One of the first experts to publicly identify some of these paintings as forgeries, Jack Flam, president of the Dedalus Foundation told the New York Times that  not only the works themselves, but also the backs of the paintings and the way the canvases were treated and the frames constructed were virtually identical to that artists originals. ‘The way we look at reality is highly influenced by the context it’s presented to us. The fact that they were sold by Knoedler, a respected gallery, influenced people’s opinions, he said.’ The newly painted fakes were even heated, cooled and exposed to elements outdoors in order to make them appear older than they were. Stories were even created to explain the appearance of so many never-seen-before works. Both Mr Weissman and Ms. Rosales said  the works had come from a family friend who had inherited the paintings. That they had been in the family since the 1950s and kept in a sealed container. Things began to unravel for the gallery in 2009 after forensic testing on two paintings supposedly by Robert Motherwell revealed paint chemicals that were historically inconsistent. Suspicion descended on the lot, and mufti-million-dollar buyers agitated for their refunds. Meanwhile, the FBI began circling Rosales. Ms. Freedman left Knoedler just as . these suspicions began to emerge. Soon, the 165-year-old business shut . up shop without warning - the very same week the buyer of the $17 . million Pollock sued both the gallery and her. Now the lawsuits have begun with eight customers so far suing after claiming they were duped into purchasing forgeries. Ms. Freedman’s lawyer, Nicholas Gravante Jr. told the Times ‘Rosales’s . confession confirms that Ann Freedman was the central victim of this . criminal scheme.’ Knoedler’s . lawyer, Charles D. Schmerler, said in a statement: ‘If proven true, the . new allegations against Rosales are a sad development for the entire . art world.’ He said that claims Knoedler knowingly sold inauthentic . paintings were without foundation. Astonishing:  'Untitled' by Jackson Pollock was one of the forged works. How imitations of the most heralded Abstract Expressionists by a complete unknown could have fooled connoisseurs and clients remains a mystery . Philip Vann, a Cambridge-based art historian told MailOnline that he is sceptical about how 'convincing' such so-called 'masterpieces' could ever appear to art experts. 'Usually when such a body of forged work is examined en masse and in retrospect, something stylistically awry, anachronistic and perhaps even downright dodgy becomes evident to the discerning eye. But if Mr Pei-Shen Qian's work avoids and evades all such doubts, then his quite unique, if totally deceptive artistic flair would be a matter of some wonder!' The paintings from Rosales proved to be enormously lucrative for the Ms. Freedman’s gallery. Among the sales were a ‘de Kooning’ that went for $4 million, a ‘Rothko’ for $8.3 million, and a  'Pollock’ for $17 million. ‘If something had been off or wrong on any one of the paintings, I would have put on the brakes,’ she told New York Magazine. She was so convincing, and so convinced, about the paintings that she even bought three herself — a ‘Rothko,’ a ‘Motherwell,’ and a ‘Pollock.’ ‘I was a believer. Not to be stubborn, but I lived with three of those paintings,’ she said. ‘I lived with them, and in the context of my personal collection.’","63 paintings thought to be rediscovered 'masterpieces' by modernist painters were fake .

"Last of quirky little French cars left British showrooms in 1990 costing £4,552 on the road . By . Nick Enoch . For years, the Citroen 2CV was the laughing stock of British roads. The upturned pram or tin snail was slow and old fashioned. Conceived before the war, to carry a farmer’s eggs across a rough field, nearly 5million ‘ugly ducks’ were sold. The last of the quirky little French cars left British showrooms in 1990 costing £4,552 on the road. But the 2CV has now, most definitely, had the last laugh. Prices for the 600cc deux chevaux are now rocketing, with refurbished cars selling for £11,000. A company based near Bradford has set up a production line, turning old 2CV wrecks back into new cars, and is also making new chassis... and sending them to France to keep the French cars alive . Prices for the 600cc deux chevaux are now rocketing with refurbished cars selling for £11,000 . British company 2CV City pays around £300 for the scrap cars from all around Britain . In a true ‘coals to Newcastle’ story, one company based near Bradford, West Yorkshire, has set up a production line, turning old wrecks back into new cars, and is also making new chassis... and sending them to France to keep the French cars alive. Tony Shields, 58, who owns 2CV City said: 'We sell nearly 300 chassis a year to the French - and a few of our refurbished cars too. 'French restoration leaves a lot to be desired. Over there, the MOT isn’t as stringent - they just seem to keep the cars in one piece by riveting new bits of metal to them. 'Twenty years ago, there were enough good ones around that they didn’t need refurbishing - good second-hand cars were retailing for up to £700. 'But now we’re paying £300 for scrap cars. We buy them from all over the country – and some from France too. Tony Shields, 58, who owns 2CV City said: 'We sell nearly 300 chassis a year to the French - and a few of our refurbished cars too' Mr Shields: 'French restoration leaves a lot to be desired. Over there, the MOT isn't as stringent - they just seem to keep the cars in one piece by riveting new bits of metal to them.' Above, a 1988 2CV Dolly, Plums and Custard. Fully restored and on sale for £10,995 . Owner of 2CV City, Tony Shields, is seen with another classic French car . 'Like the Mini, they were mass produced and cheap so people didn’t throw money at them. They were neglected and it’s hard to find a good original one now. 'They’ve become popular now again as an affordable classic. 'Part of the attraction is their simplicity. Their electrical components are simple and people can work on them themselves. 'We have about six cars in production at any one time. There are two levels of restoration on our cars. 'They cost between about £5,000 and £11,000 for a fully rebuilt car. 'We can’t get hold of old cars quick enough. We recently sold one to one of The Hairy Bikers! 'Our fully restored cars are made with new body panels and many new or reconditioned parts. 'They come with a 12-month warranty and, if well looked after, could last for another 15 years. 'They leave here as they would have left the factory – although we can fit a CD player and speakers if customers want them.' Mr Shields employs six full-time staff and restores a variety of 2CV-based vehicles including vans and vehicles dating back to the 1950s. They make chassis and have a huge selection of new and used parts. He also sells a selection of other classic French vehicles. Last week, he bought a black 60-year-old Peugeot van from France. 'It was a used by a funeral company – it was so ugly – I just had to buy it', he said. Mr Shields employs six full-time staff and restores a variety of 2CV-based vehicles including vans and vehicles dating back to the 1950s . The French Citroen 2CV Dolly, from 1985 . The prototype for the Citroen 2CV - 'an umbrella on four wheels' - dates back to the 1930s' design by engineer Pierre-Jules Boulanger. Officially unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in 1948, the name is an abbreviation of 'deux chevaux vapeur' -  which translates as 'two steam horses'. Regarded as a simple, reliable vehicle, the economy car was produced by the French manufacturer up until 1990. It was famously heralded as being able to be driven across a ploughed field without breaking the eggs it was carrying. Over its 42-year production run, the car was a great commercial success - around 5million units were sold, including just over a million vans. In 1981, a yellow 2CV was driven by James Bond in the film For Your Eyes Only, including a chase sequence through a Spanish olive farm. From 1988 onwards, production took place in Portugal rather than France. This continued for two years until 2CV production halted.

"By . Claire Bates . A horrifying catalogue of serious errors at NHS hospitals in Scotland has come to light, following a Freedom of Information request. They include a report from NHS Lothian where a patient on oxygen therapy died in an explosion after lighting a cigarette in a hospital toilet. In another shocking case, NHS Ayrshire and Arran revealed a patient died after they were stuck in a lift while being transferred to intensive care. The oxygen supply they were receiving and suction equipment ran out during the time they were trapped. Warning: Two patients using oxygen died after they got too close to a heat source . Another report from the same Trust revealed a patient with pneumonia who died didn't receive medication for nine days after they were admitted because the pharmacy failed to deliver the drugs. These examples made up a handful of the 345 NHS reports from last year, that were only released following an FOI request from BBC Scotland. Reasons for deaths or illness included receiving the wrong doses of medication or . emergency treatment not being available. More than 100 deaths resulted from the incidents reported by Scottish hospitals. However, the number is likely to be far higher as only seven of the 19 boards supplied the number of adverse incidents they had recorded over the past year in response to the FOI request. Despite this, it is the first time a clearer picture for the whole of Scotland has emerged, because unlike England and Wales, there is no national system for reporting serious incidents. The documents show variations between health boards in the number of incidents that are reported and what types of investigations are conducted. Differences in what each board considers to be 'serious' are also apparent, with incident reports ranging from a nurse being injured while hanging Christmas decorations to a baby dying during labour and a surgeon removing a patient's healthy organ. Work overload: A number of serious incidents revealed NHS staff who had not received adequate training . Scotland's largest health board, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, reported 95 incidents last year despite serving the largest population compared to NHS Shetland, which noted 138. The study also highlights that all of NHS Tayside's reports list 'nearly identical' learning points. The BBC investigation also found that the NHS has paid out over £120 million in compensation and legal expenses over the last three years in Scotland. In two individual cases, NHS Lanarkshire paid out a total of over £6 million. Jim Martin, the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman, has called for a national system for reporting serious incidents. AYRSHIRE & ARRAN . Patient died after an oxygen mask they were wearing got too close after a heat source and exploded. Inexperienced nurse incorrectly administered medication which caused the death of the patient. Patient died after treatment ran out while they were stuck in a lift on transfer to intensive care. BORDERS, DUMFRIES & GALLOWAY . Stillborn baby allocated a community number by a midwife so was recorded as being alive. Family distressed after receiving a birthday card through a public health initiative. LOTHIAN . Patient on oxygen therapy died in explosion after lighting a cigarette in the toilet. GRAMPIAN . Surgeon stapled the wrong organs together during elective surgery. GREATER GLASGOW . A pad used during a surgical procedure was unaccounted for and staff couldn't locate it using X-ray. He said: 'I think one of the things that your (the BBC's) inquiries have highlighted is that across Scotland just now we're pretty confused about what we call things, what things mean and whether for example a critical incident review is a health and safety review, whether it's a review of something that's gone wrong surgically or in a GP's surgery or in a dental surgery. 'It's a confusing picture. I think if we had a simple national system it would be far easier to ask a simple question of the health service and get a clear statistical answer.' The Scottish Government said it has asked for an urgent review of incident reporting from Health Improvement Scotland (HIS), the body set up to support NHS Scotland and other healthcare providers deliver high quality and safe services. BBC Scotland said that, in the programme, Robbie Pearson, director of Scrutiny and Assurance at HIS, admits they have no idea of the national picture, and that the officials will be visiting each health board from now until the end of next year. A total of 22 complaints are made against the NHS every day and the numbers being upheld by the Public Services Ombudsman have increased. Mr Martin said: 'Last year we upheld something like 56 per cent of the complaints, which is a very worrying number particularly given that the year before the number was only 43 per cent. 'There seems to be an increase in the number of complaints not being resolved satisfactorily in health boards. 'Where I'm worried is that if the trend continues, it will dilute the confidence of the population. 'I can only assume that if we get the learning better, then that will save lives. 'At the moment, the bureaucracy seems from the outside to be the most important thing. In my view the learning should be the most important thing.' A Scottish Government spokeswoman said a national framework for the management of adverse events is being put in place. 'Scotland is the first country in the world to implement a national patient safety programme across the whole healthcare system and has some of the safest hospitals in the world,' she said. 'We need to support a culture of openness, trust and quality improvement so that we can make sure that lessons are learned from these events.' Earlier this year, the health secretary ordered an investigation in NHS Ayrshire and Arran after the health board withheld more than 50 reports on serious incidents at its hospitals and clinics. The BBC revealed that some of that Trust's reports were so heavily redacted (blacking out sections) that they were almost incomprehensible.

"By . Mia De Graaf . It was once a budget belt in the shadow of glossy Manhattan. Cash-strapped New Yorkers would bag a flat in Brooklyn and keep it schtum. But times have changed. Brooklyn is now 'in vogue', and the price gap between New York's high end and low end is closing, New York Daily News reports. Manhattan, the other side of Brooklyn Bridge. Once the beacon New Yorkers aspired to. Now Brooklyn is competing . It is the second smallest gap in history. The median rental in Brooklyn is now just $300 cheaper than its Manhattan counterpart, according to an August 2013 report by Douglas Elliman. Inching down from last year's $371 gap, experts have branded the drop significant. HBO series Girls is credited with boosting the district's reputation by market experts. The series, written by Lena Dunham, glamorises budget living. The characters are based in Brooklyn's Greenpoint, which is now one of the city's most sought-after places to live. Hot ticket: Brooklyn has soared in popularity. Some rents have increased by 10 per cent in one year . The global hit series Girls follows the lives of four cash-strapped New Yorkers who live in Brooklyn's Greenpoint. The show has been touted as a major factor in the district's new-found popularity . The yearly rate of new rentals has jumped up from 208 last year to 554. It is the highest rate of new rentals in the area since the market crash. In turn, the median rental price has been pushed up to its highest since records by the brokerage company started more than five years. Brooklyn properties are getting snapped up quicker and quicker. A property will now spend an average of 39 days on the market, down from 42 last year. Letters in Manhattan - home to Broadway, Central Park and the Empire State building - are less eager than the hordes of aspiring Brooklynites. It takes estate agents 45 days to shift a Manhattan property, nine days longer than last year when they would go in 36. Although Manhattan's median rental prices continue to press higher, the rate is slower. Greenpoint renter Joe Ammon, 28, told New York Daily News his rent has jumped up by 4 per cent this year - and neighbours are facing a 10 per cent hike. On the other side of New York, median rents have increased by just 1.8 per cent.

"By . Paul Thompson . The chances of being involved in a fatal air crash in the U.S are now only one in 45 million, after 2012 saw the fewest commercial airline accidents in over half a century. Last year’s figures were the lowest since 1945, seeing only 23 accidents and 475 fatalities, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Researchers have said flying has become so reliable that a traveler could fly every day for 123,000 years before being involved in a fatal crash. Last fatal U.S crash: In February 9th 2009 a regional plane crashed while landing in snowy conditions in Buffalo, New York (pictured) There are 10 million commercial flights a year in America and there has not been a fatal crash for four years. Improvement in safety standards, more reliable planes and engines are the key factors in making flying among the safest mode of travel. The last fatal accident in America  was on February 9th 2009 when a regional plane crashed while landing in snowy conditions in Buffalo, New York. The crash was put down to pilot error after ice formed on the wing and the wrong maneuver was carried out. There has not been a crash involving one of the major carriers since 2001 when an American Airlines flight crashed shortly after taking off from New York. Air space: There are 10 million commercial flights a year in America . The Aviation Safety Network said advanced navigation and warning technology has sharply reduced accidents such as midair collisions and crashes into mountains in poor visibility. Airlines and plane manufacturers are also sharing data about flying hazards with the aim of preventing accidents instead of just reacting to them. Improved design of seats and hull structures of planes also make it more likely for passengers to survive a crash landing. ""The lessons of accidents used to be written in blood, where you have to have an accident, and you had to kill people to change procedures of policy, or training,"" said Deborah Hersmann, chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. ""That's not the case anymore. We have a much more proactive approach to safety.""","Passengers in the U.S. could fly every day for 123,000 years before being involved in a fatal crash .

"By . Deni Kirkova . A lack of social participation on Facebook leads to people feeling less meaningful, a new study suggests. Furthermore the less reaction people get on statuses and photographs the more excluded and invisible they feel. Social media shunning can even lead to lower self-esteem and a sense of loss of control. The findings come from new research into how Facebook impacts feelings of social belonging, affecting outlook on life, . loneliness and self-worth. Passive and shunned users - who receive no comments - feel excluded, 'invisible' and less important . And the way for regular social media users to avoid such feelings is to stay active and participate. The study published in the journal Social Influence was led by Dr Stephanie Tobin from The University of Queensland's School of Psychology. Researchers conducted two studies centred on 'lurking' - or passive - Facebook participants, and on ostracism, aiming to analyse how people would feel when deliberately 'snubbed'. An initial first study looked at a group who frequently posted on Facebook. During the study half were actively posting participants and the other half instructed to passively observe friends' posts and statuses. The study revealed that not posting for two days had a negative impact on personal well-being, Science Daily report. For regular social media users the way to avoid feelings of exclusion is to stay active and participate . In a second study, a group used anonymous bespoke accounts in a controlled space where participants were urged to post and to comment on others' Facebook posts. However half of the group were unwittingly set up to receive no feedback whatsoever. In both cases, participants were interviewed on their feelings of belonging, meaningful existence, self-esteem and control after the exercise. The passive and shunned users both reported feeling excluded, invisible, and less important than the active users. Shunned users also experienced lower self-esteem and control. With 1.11 billion users per month on average, Facebook has become a . global phenomenon offering continual and direct communication with . friends and family. But new researchers suggest it also defines us socially . and influences our personal welfare. Researchers concluded that active participation on Facebook was key in producing a sense of belonging among social media users.","Lack of participation on Facebook 'leads to people feeling less meaningful'

And as the pictures show this technique includes laying the horses on their back while handstands are performed on them. The Doma India School's website states: 'In contrast with most known methods, taming is established body-to-body in a natural game similar to that used in a herd of horses. The school say that their yoga technique helps to tame the horses and makes them calm . 'Acts that are widely considered dangerous (due to the intense physical contact between horse and tamer) become safety techniques and methods by which the horses quickly lose the fear (spooking/sensibility) which renders them so unpredictable. 'The removal of fear (spooking/sensibility) using the Scarpati method guarantees a loyal relationship with an untamed horse.'

The mystery buyer who splashed out £89million for Francis Bacon’s Three Studies of Lucian Freud is claimed to be a 30-year-old Qatari royal dubbed ‘the most powerful woman in art’. Speculation has been rife about the identity of the anonymous bidder who made history last week by buying the most expensive artwork ever sold at auction.

"By . Andy Dolan . Georgia Williams, 17, agreed to pose for Jamie Reynolds with a rope around her neck for a 'fantasy photoshoot' The parents of a teenager murdered by a friend who was obsessed with violent internet porn told yesterday of their anger at how easy it is to find extreme content online. Georgia Williams, 17, agreed to pose for Jamie Reynolds with a rope around her neck for a ‘fantasy photoshoot’, but he left her hanging and took photographs of her as she died. Yesterday, her parents Lynette, 52, and Stephen, 58, a detective constable, spoke for the first time about the role extreme pornography played in their daughter’s murder. They said Reynolds, now 23, had been viewing depraved acts online even as their daughter, who attended college with him, walked to his home 90 minutes before she died. The heartbroken couple, who have another daughter, Scarlett, 23, want measures against the kind of material that fuelled Reynolds’s fantasies. Mrs Williams said: ‘Something has to be done about internet porn. I was so naive – I had no idea how easy it is to go on the internet and find the kind of extreme pornography that Reynolds was accessing. It’s horrendous. ‘Worst of all, men, including Reynolds, are re-enacting what they see online.’ Reynolds, described by Mr Williams as ‘pure evil’, killed Georgia in May last year while his parents and 19-year-old sister were away, then posed her body around the house in Wellington, Shropshire. He sent text messages from Georgia’s phone to make her family think she was safe before driving to Wrexham the next morning to dump her body, then continuing north to Glasgow. He was arrested in a budget hotel there three days after the murder. Sentencing him to a whole-life term at Stafford Crown Court last December, Mr Justice Wilkie said Reynolds was a ‘potential serial killer’ whose ‘long-standing preoccupation with violent and sadistic pornography’ had fuelled Georgia’s killing. Last month, it was revealed Devon and Cornwall Constabulary will investigate the West Mercia force’s handling of a previous inquiry into Reynolds in 2008, when he tried to strangle another teenage girl lured to his house under the pretence of a photoshoot. He was given a caution, despite police discovering doctored pictures of the victim with a noose around her neck. Parents Mr and Mrs Williams (left) say violent porn fuelled Jamie Reynolds (right) to kill their daughter . Mrs Williams had called for an independent investigation, saying her daughter might still be alive if inquiries into that attack had been more thorough. Her husband, who works for the West Mercia force, which also investigated Georgia’s death, told The Sun yesterday the investigation ‘won’t bring Georgia back but it might save other people’s lives’. Mr Williams said: ‘He [Reynolds] lynched her for sexual pleasure. I’ve never come across anything quite this cruel. It is pure, pure evil.’ Mr Williams added that the murder had destroyed the family, but they have set up a charity, the Georgia Williams Trust, aimed at keeping the teenager’s spirit alive. In a victory for the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign to clean up the internet, UK families were given a choice last year whether to opt in or block online pornography from home networks.","Georgia Williams, 17, agreed to pose for Jamie Reynolds for a 'photoshoot'

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A tiny bat has become the first on record to fly from Britain to mainland Europe - despite being just the size of a thumb. The Nathusius' pipistrelle bat was last seen near Bristol in 2012 before being discovered 370 miles away in the Netherlands last month. It is the first known British bat to have crossed the North Sea and the finding gives weight to claims that the bats may migrate in a similar way to birds. Researchers attached a miniature identity ring to a tiny Nathusius' pipistrelle bat, pictured, in October 2012. It was discovered in the Netherlands last month, making it the first known bat to have crossed the North Sea. The finding gives weight to claims British bats may migrate in a similar way to birds . The reddish-brown furred Nathusius' pipistrelle typically grows to between 46 and 55mm in length, with a . wingspan of 220 to 250mm. It is a protected species in many countries and is so rare in Britain, experts are anxious to protect the remaining numbers. Threats to the species include the loss of hollow trees and toxic chemicals from the treatment of timber in buildings. Experts say it is important to track the tiny creatures' movements so that wind turbines aren't built in their flight path. Bats as small as the . Nathusius' pipistrelle are hard to tail because they are too small to . carry the sort of sophisticated satellite trackers used to monitor bird . migration. Daniel Hargreaves . of the Bat Conservation Trust said there had been occasional reports of . bats landing on North Sea oil platforms - but this was the first proof . that they were capable of reaching the continent. Researchers from Exeter University attached a miniature identity ring to the tiny bat in October 2012 as part of research into bat migration habits. The 7.6g mammal's last know UK location was Blagdon, a small village in the Mendip Hills just outside Bristol. Yet on 23 December last year, a wildlife expert found it dead inside a farm shed used to store fruit in Pietersbierum, on the north coast of the Netherlands. The bat’s exact route remains unknown, although researchers believe it likely would have travelled past Kent, before crossing the English Channel and heading northeast along the French and Belgian coastline and the North Sea. Experts say it's important to track the tiny creatures' movements so wind turbines aren't built in their flight path. However, bats as small as the Nathusius' pipistrelle are hard to tail because they are too small to carry the sort of sophisticated satellite trackers used to monitor bird migration. The mammal was last spotted in the UK at Blagdon, pictured, a small village just outside Bristol in 2012. On 23 December last year, a wildlife expert found the same bat inside a farm shed in Pietersbierum, pictured, on the north coast of the Netherlands. The bat's exact route remains unknown . Daniel Hargreaves of the Bat Conservation Trust said there had been occasional reports of bats landing on North Sea oil platforms - but this was the first proof that they were capable of reaching the continent. He said: ‘We have hypothesised for a long time about the migration of bats to and from the UK but it's very difficult to prove. Experts say it's important to track the movements of the rare, tiny creatures, pictured, to ensure wind turbines aren't built in their flight path . ‘This finding was a great surprise and is helping us to understand the huge journeys that these bats can make. ‘We already knew that bats migrated over incredibly long distances over land, but were not sure whether they flew over the sea. ‘As a result of this finding, we suspect that this in fact happens quite a lot.’ The reddish-brown furred Nathusius' pipistrelle typically grows to between 46 and 55mm in length, with a wingspan of 220 to 250mm. It is extremely rare in Britain and experts are anxious to prevent the remaining numbers from facing certain death by flying into wind turbines. Biosciences expert Dr Fiona Mathews, who is spearheading Exeter University's Bats and Wind Turbines project, said: 'Nathusius's pipistrelle is one of the species most at risk from land-based wind turbines throughout Europe. ‘We now urgently need to identify the migration routes they use to cross the sea between the UK and continental Europe - offshore wind farms in the wrong place could be very bad news.' Dr Mathews will now analyse samples from the bat in an attempt to establish whether it originated in the UK or the Netherlands, and whether it had only recently arrived or had spent the summer there.","Researchers from Exeter fitted the 7.6g bat with an identity ring in 2012 .
It was last seen in Bristol before being found in the Netherlands last month .
This makes the tiny bat the first on record to fly from Britain to Europe .
Its exact route is unknown, but the findings add weight to claims British bats may migrate in a similar way to birds ."
"By . Claire Bates . The NHS recommends people over 65 take a daily vitamin D supplement . Older women who pop vitamin D and calcium supplements to prevent broken bones may be taking them in vain, according to leading experts. A U.S government advisory group found taking typical low doses provided no benefits for average post-menopausal women. What is more taking 400IU of vitamin D and 1,000mg of calcium daily increased the risk of developing kidney stones. Both nutrients are crucial for building and maintaining strong, healthy bones and specialists advise getting as much as possible from a good diet and exposure to sunlight. If an older person has a vitamin deficiency or bone-thinning osteoporosis, doctors often prescribe higher-than-normal doses. But for otherwise healthy postmenopausal women, adding modest supplements to their diet makes no impact. It isn't clear if those doses offer bone protection if taken before menopause, or if they help men's bones, according to the new guidelines from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. It's a confusing message considering that for years, calcium and vitamin D supplements have been widely considered an insurance policy against osteoporosis, with little down side to taking them. The NHS currently recommends people over 65 take a daily vitamin D pill, although no more than 25micrograms (or 1,000IUs). 'Regrettably, we don't have as much information as we would like to have about a substance that has been around a long time and we used to think we understood,' said Dr Virginia Moyer of the Baylor College of Medicine, who heads the task force. 'Turns out, there's a lot more to learn.' The recommendations are not for people at high risk of weak bones, such as those with a history of bone fractures. These people should consult their local doctor. Calcium should be provided by your diet where possible . In the U.S the average adult is advised to get about 1,000mg of calcium, 1,300 for postmenopausal women, every day. For vitamin D, the goal is 600 IUs of vitamin D daily moving to 800 after age 70. The nutrients can be found in foods including orange juice fortified with calcium and D; dairy foods such as milk, yogurt and cheese; certain fish including salmon; and fortified breakfast cereals. Dr Moyer also advises healthy pensioners to exercise as this is proven to shore up bones and good for the rest of the body, too . Cara Welch, senior vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs for the Natural Product Association in Washington, D.C., told Reuters Health the group disagrees with the new recommendation. 'We believe this recommendation is out of step with current research, and it really should not affect consumers who are trying to supplement their calcium and vitamin D intake with supplements,' Welch said. According to the most recent data from a national survey of Americans, 56 percent of women over 60 years old take vitamin D supplements, and 60 percent take calcium supplements. The two vitamins are often sold together and are relatively inexpensive.","Taking typical supplement dose provides no benefits for average post-menopausal women, finds U.S task force .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Buddy Valastro, star of the hit show 'Cake Boss', learned Friday night that driving a boat in foggy conditions is no cakewalk. Valastro, 37, who was on a 36-foot Whaler with his wife as well as two other adults and nine children between the ages of 5 and 12, experienced a few moments of fright when the boat ran into a patch of dense fog. The boat floated into the Ambrose Channel, a heavily-trafficked portion of New York Harbor under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Buddy Valastro, star of 'Cake Boss' on TLC, posed with a cake depicting his 2010 book. Valastro received help from the NYPD and FDNY after his boat got lost in thick fog under the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, in New York Harbor . The Verrazano Narrows Bridge, where Valastro's boat hit thick fog and floated into . Cargo ships in New York Harbor, which would not have been able to stop in order to avoid colliding with the Cake Boss' boat . The Ambrose Channel is route where large commercial vessels pass regularly. Had Valastro's boat found itself in the path of one of the vessels, the large cargo boats, much like a speeding train, would have been unable to stop. Fortunately, the NYPD and FDNY quickly responded, using a thermal-imaging camera to locate the boat and tow it out of the shipping lanes. The boat was then hauled back to its dock in Jersey City, New Jersey . Valastro took to social media after the mishap, posting his thanks to the city's police and fire departments on Instagram. In another Instagram post, he stated that the next time he took the boat out he would 'need to check the forecast.' He posted the picture and message with the hashtag #mywifewantstokillme. The authorities that responded to Valastro's distress calls didn't blame him for getting lost. 'The fog rolled in like a wave,' Chris Tucker, one of the firefighters that rescued the boat, told the New York Daily News. 'It was sunny one . moment and the next you weren’t able to see what's in front of your . boat. Even an experienced boater would tell you that isn't something you . want to find yourself in.' The Cake Boss thanked the NYPD and FDNY on his Instagram following his rescue from fog and danger . In another Instagram post, Valastro admitted that his wife was none too pleased with how their boat trip went . According to Tucker, the firefighters used a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) system to find the boat. An FLIR system uses thermal-imaging cameras to pick up heat signatures from up to 100 yards away. No one was injured, although one of the children reportedly complained of sea sickness. Valastro is the star of 'Cake Boss' on TLC. The season finale of the show's sixth season aired on February 24, 2014. 'Cake Boss' is a reality show which follows Valastro as he runs Carlo's Bakery, a cake shop located in Hoboken, New Jersey.

Describing the Germans as 'very powerful' physically, mentally and tactically, Sabella said Saturday that there's no room for error. 'We must play a perfect game,' Sabella said. Elborating on how to accomplish that, the 59-year-old coach turned poetic for a moment. Celebration: Sabella rejoices with his coaching staff after reaching the World Cup final . 'We will give everything we've got,' Sabella said. 'Through humility, sacrifice, hard work, simplicity. By giving instead of taking, by forgiving instead of complaining.' Argentina last played in a World Cup final in 1990, when they lost to West Germany. Four years earlier, Argentina had become world champion for the second time, also in a final against the Germans. Sabella said there are 'parallels to a . certain degree' between this World Cup and that of 1986, including the . fact that the team to a large extent depends on a star player.

What began as a revitalizing trip to the spa for Laurie Anderson, renowned performance artist and wife of the late Lou Reed, suddenly transformed into a nightmare when she found herself trapped inside of a hyperbaric chamber for nearly two hours this week. Anderson, 67, was at the Pure Flow spa, located West 15th Street near 8th Avenue, in New York. She was inside of an oxygen-filled blue hyperbaric tube and was attempting to get out of it when the zipper allegedly became stuck. Anderson began shouting for help, but when no employees could hear her cries, she frantically texted a friend, who then called 911 for her. Laurie Anderson, 67, found herself trapped in a hyperbaric chamber this week, causing her to text an SOS to a friend for 911 as she struggled with shortness of breath .

She claimed to experience shortness of breath while trapped, but did not sustain any serious injuries. According to reports, Anderson was not in the chamber for any longer than two hours. Anderson is best known as an experimental artist, active in the New York scene since the 1970s. In 1981, her single 'O Superman' reached as high as #2 on Britain's national pop charts. In 2008, Anderson married Lou Reed, guitarist for both the Velvet Underground as well as his own solo work. In his career, Reed penned classics such as 'Walk on the Wild Side', but more often challenged the musical status quo with albums such as 'Berlin' or 'Metal Machine Music.' Reed passed away due to liver disease on October 27, 2013. Anderson posed in 2012 with her late husband, rock legend Lou Reed . The couple posed together attending 2010 Public Theater Gala in New York City. Reed died in October 2013 of problems related to his ongoing liver disease .

The owner of the spa, Andrew Barile, told the New York Daily News that Anderson was inside of the chamber for 45 minutes before she fell asleep. According to Barile, she must have been disoriented upon waking up, causing her to panic. He denied that any malfunction had taken place.

"By . Tamara Cohen . MPs are expected to have a £7,600 pay rise rubber-stamped within weeks – despite fears of a public backlash. David Cameron is facing pressure from a powerful group of backbenchers who insist the 11 per cent rise recommended by their independent pay watchdog must be implemented. In July, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) was condemned by all three main party leaders after recommending an increase from the current MPs’ salary of £66,396 to £74,000 in 2015. Charles Walker MP, left, the vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee, that represents Tory backbenchers, said David Cameron could not ignore Ipsa recommendations . But as the consultation on the proposal ended yesterday, with about 200 responses from MPs, senior MPs said it was ‘beyond doubt’ the Prime Minister would have to accept the increase. Ipsa was set up following the expenses scandal in 2009, but has attracted criticism for recommending the pay rise for MPs at a time when most workers are seeing their real wages fall. Under the proposal, MPs would earn almost three times the national average wage of £26,000. Charles Walker MP, the vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee that represents Tory backbenchers, said Parliament could not ignore Ipsa, the body it set up to rule on the issue, as that would mean putting pay and expenses back into the hands of MPs, which did so much to damage public faith in politics. He added: ‘Pay is a matter for Ipsa. Either it is independent and the party leaders accept its decisions, or scrap it. 'Because what is the point of us paying its £6.5milion a year operating budget if it is ignored?’ Ipsa’s recommendation for a 11 per cent rise would cost taxpayers an extra £4.6million a year, but would come with more restrictions on MPs claiming expenses for items such as dinner and taxis. Another senior member of the 1922 Committee said that the Prime Minister had to accept Ipsa's recommendation - which would see salaries rise to £74,000 . Mr Walker said: ‘What is required is a bit of leadership and courage. With the PM saying that the Ipsa recommendations aren’t ideal, respecting the independence of this body must be better than returning to the failed system of the past, which nearly shattered faith in our democracy.’ Another senior member of the 1922 Committee said: ‘It is beyond doubt the Prime Minister has to accept Ipsa’s recommendation. Parliament gave it the power to decide. We cannot withdraw that power because it looks bad.’ Sources claimed yesterday that No 10 would seek a way out of the impasse by publicly condemning the rise but conceding that the watchdog’s word on salaries is final. A No 10 spokesman said they would wait for Ipsa’s final report at the end of the year. He added: ‘We will publish our final decision after examining all the responses. This is not subject to a vote in Parliament.’","David Cameron facing pressure from a group of .

"By . Bianca London . As the World Cup kicks off in Brazil today, the WAGs are cramming their Christian Louboutins into their Louis Vuitton . suitcases to fly out and join their other halves. Coach Roy Hodgson has told his boys their wives aren't officially . authorised to be there and has banned them from travelling with the team. But . luckily for us - and Brazil's retail economy - the likes of Coleen Rooney and Alex Gerrard, whose husbands Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard are key players, may well be setting up camp in . Brazil anyway. FEMAIL caught up with the two glamorous footballers' wives to find out their summer style, beauty and fitness tips. Chief WAG: Coleen Rooney, who is married to England player Wayne, is preparing to jet off to Brazil to support her husband in the World Cup and has shared her summer beauty tips with FEMAIL . Leading the pack is the WAG who needs . no introduction; Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen, who is packing her bags ahead of the tournament. The . 28-year-old mother-of-two told MailOnline: 'I'm so excited to go as I've never been before and I'm always really curious to discover new places. I'm sure when we find our feet there, we will have a great time.' While Coleen may have become notorious for her penchant for designer handbags and high-end clothes, the mother of two reveals that she's going to be embracing a more casual style in Brazil. 'I don't think many of the football fans will be dressing up so I am going for the casual look, nothing too dressy. I am loving tailored shorts at the moment, which I'll team with wedges and some fashionable jewellery. New campaign: Coleen is currently fronting the new Comfort Creations campaign, a new perfume-scented range of washing detergents, and says the ultra-feminine campaign reflects her personal style . 'I also love crop tops but because I don't like showing my belly, I will wear them with high-waisted shorts.' The Littlewoods designer says her favourite high-street store is Zara, because it takes trends straight from the catwalk, while her favourite designer label is Balenciaga because the clothes help 'show off her figure well' and cinch in at the waist, her least favourite body part. Sharing her top tips for looking glam poolside , something Coleen knows all about, she said: 'My top tip is getting a well-fitting bikini. Lots of people get it wrong and when I designed my range for Littlewoods, I really focused on creating a fit for every body type.' Coleen, who cites her style icon as 'gorgeous' Blake Lively, will also be cramming lots of kaftans, kimonos and maxi dresses into her suitcase for Brazil. As for her Brazilian beauty regime, Coleen says she will be keeping it natural. 'I barely wear any make-up on holiday and just pop on some blush when I head out,' she said. The WAG who needs no introduction: Coleen . Rooney, 28, who is married to Wayne has announced that she - and no . doubt her many Louis Vuitton suitcases - will be making the trip to . Brazil . She hasn't been working out too much ahead of her trip ('I'm not doing more than usual,' she said), and has scheduled in some pilates sessions in the week running up to her flight. Professional as always, Coleen has been cramming in her work duties ahead of the trip. Yesterday, she helped launch the new Comfort Creations range, a range of fabric conditioner blended by perfume experts. As someone with a passion for fashion, this was a campaign close to Coleen's heart. 'When they approached me to work with them, I thought it was a fantastic idea. Obviously having kids, I do so much washing so I want it to smell nice and this is the first product out there like this. 'Like all women, I’m obsessed with perfume and it’s the reason I’m passionate about Comfort Creations. There’s nothing better than coming home to the smell of fragrant laundry, so I think it’s a perfect idea combining fine fragrance with a softening product. Blonde bombshell: Another WAG who may well be flying out to support husband and England captain Steven is Alex Gerrard . 'I still remember the smell of my mum’s laundry and it’s really important for me to create that comforting and memorable experience for my own family. 'I just thought ""Why hasn't anyone done this before?"" The campaign was girly and floral and reflects my style.' Other than working with Comfort Creations, Coleen has been busy designing her AW14 range for Littlewoods, which she says is 'coming on well,' and is planning a summer holiday for after the World Cup so the family can relax together. Another WAG who may well be flying out to support husband and England captain Steven is Alex Gerrard. Alex told us: 'I'm really not sure if I'm going yet so I haven't even thought about what I would take.' The mother-of-two did, however, reveal that Steven's healthy lifestyle ahead of the World Cup has been having a positive effect on hers. She said: 'I eat pretty healthily most . of the time. Obviously Steven’s diet is really healthy so that . encourages me to eat well. 'Maybe if I'm going away I would be extra good . the week before and try not to snack in between meals or eat carbs . after 6pm.  I train three times a week with my . trainer Deana Mogan and we do a mixture or cardio and weights and core . strength. We mix it up so I don't get bored and sometimes if I am being . really good I may go for a run as well during the week.' While she and Steven share a healthy lifestyle, the model and columnist says they'd never share her beauty products. 'He knows I love my products so he wouldn’t dare touch them!,' she laughed. Alex is a huge product junkie but while she may be able to afford the most luxurious lotions and potions on the market, the WAG loves a good budget buy. 'I have lots of budget beauty secrets. I love Vaseline Spray and Go because it's a . lovely body moisturiser if you’re in a hurry and it absorbs really . quickly and smells lovely and fresh. It's great for taking away on . holiday. Fighting fit: The mother-of-two said that husband Steven's healthy lifestyle ahead of the World Cup has been having a positive effect on hers . 'My favourite . budget beauty gadget is the MICRO Pedi. I use it to keep my feet nice . and smooth. It’s handy in the summer as I can give myself a quick pedi . before I head out in my flip flops or sandals. 'I also love Batiste dry shampoo. It's great for freshening up between washes . and also if my hair’s feeling a bit flat it's great for adding some . volume. 'Also, little Vaseline tubs are great. I . put it on my eyelashes to make them grow and to keep them moisturised. I . also use it as a quick cheap lip gloss. I always have a little tub in . my bag,' she said. Citing her ultimate beauty icon as Kate Moss, who she describes as 'amazing',  Alex says she 'isn't one to have loads of beauty treatments'. Beauty buff: Alex Gerrard opened up beauty bag for FEMAIL and most of it is budget. The WAG also revealed that she'd love to work in health and fitness . She said: 'I'm not one to have loads of treatments to be honest but probably a spray tan or a hydro facial. I have them every couple of months if I can. It's like a really nice deep clean for your face. Your skin feels so clean and soft afterwards.' Aside from supporting her husband, Alex has a World Cup column and a fitness blog with Hello! magazine, which she says she 'loves' doing. Speaking about her future ambitions, she said: 'I would like to do more with health and fitness as I really enjoy it'. Alex Gerrard is the face of MICRO Pedi, available from boots.com.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Family and friends of Henrietta Regina Dickson, the woman killed in a Tampa, Florida carport on Wednesday after a resident unknowingly ran her over and pinned her arm to the ground, have spoken out and revealed a surprising insight into her past. Dickson, 55, was found Wednesday morning under a 2002 Daewoo sedan owned by Fathima Masoud, 55. Masoud had pulled into the carport at 11:30pm the previous evening, and did not see Dickson sleeping in the parking space, although she felt a bump as he pulled in. According to Masoud, she saw a tote bag belonging to Dickson. However, she guessed that it was the object that she had ran over, and moved it out of the lot. At approximately 8am the next morning, a passerby saw a hand under one of the wheels of Masoud's vehicle. Dickson was found, and pronounced dead at the scene. Masoud has not been charged for the accident. Henrietta Regina Dickson in her 20s (pictured left), before addiction to drugs and alcohol ruined her life (pictured right) The story is a sad tale of the invisibility of those living on the streets, something heightened in poignancy when Dickson's relatively comfortable background and sad fall into homelessness is considered. Raymond Scahefer, 52, said Dickson had moved into his apartment weeks prior to the incident. The two had met while working as cleaning staff at Tropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays. The two became fast friends, Schaefer never even learning her last name, and when Dickson lost her job, Schaefer let her stay with him until she got back on her feet. He recalls her vibrant personality and love for the Rays baseball team. 'She was just fun to be around,' Schaefer told The Tampa Bay Times, 'except when she was drinking.' It . did not take long before Dickson showed up at the apartment drunk and . belligerent. Schaefer, himself a recovering alcoholic, told her to take . her belongings and leave. He never saw her again until he picked up a . newspaper on Thursday morning, then seeing his former roommate's . picture. The woman on the cover of the newspaper was a far cry from Henrietta Dickson that her family had once known. Dickson was the youngest of four children born in Highland Park, Illinois. Described by her older brother David Dickson as having a personality that 'lit up the room,' Dickson soon moved to Paris with her mother after her parents divorced. She attended private school there, and eventually earned a degree from American College. Dickson then returned to the United States, where she went to live with her father and earn a Master's degree from Florida International University, in Miami. Dickson planned on pursuing a career in the fragrance industry, and enjoyed a successful life until her late 20s. The carport where Dickson was ran over and pinned to the ground overnight. She was pronounced dead the next morning . Wide view of the apartment complex and carport where Dickson passed out and was ran over by a resident's vehicle . In 1989, Dickson's father passed away from a heart attack. After this, Henrietta developed crippling addictions to drugs and alcohol, causing her to be unable to hold down a steady job as she received certifications from different programs she drifted between, attempting to find a career to stick with. In 2006, she married a registered sex offender. She was later arrested for battery and drunken driving. Her family claimed that they attempted to help her pull out of her destructive lifestyle, even helping her into a rehabilitation program in Tampa, which she completed. However, she was unable to maintain her sobriety. 'She was a young lady who had every possible advantage and then something happened,'  said David Dickson, 'and I don't even know what.' Police . believe that Dickson was on alcohol and drugs when she was run over. Inside of her tote bag was $16.29 in cash, four cellphones, makeup, . shampoo, prescription medications, old tax returns and job applications. The family is set to have Henrietta cremated and plan to travel to Florida for a small and private service.","'She was a young lady who had every possible advantage and then something happened' says her older brother of Henrietta Dickson .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A New Jersey man has been found guilty of murder and other charges in the 2012 stabbing death of a 6-year-old boy who was trying to save his 12-year-old sister as the killer attacked her in her bed. It took a Camden jury less than three hours to find 33-year-old Osvaldo Rivera guilty of the murder of Dominick Andujar, as well as charges of attempted murder, aggravated sexual assault, burglary and weapons violations. About 12 a.m. on September 2, 2012, Rivera broke into Andujar's family's home and attacked his sister Amber as she slept on the couch. Guilty: Osvaldo Rivera will likely be sentenced to life in prison in the murder of 6-year-old Dominick Andujar . Hero: 6-year-old Dominick fought with Rivera enough so that his sister could escape the attack . Amber began to scream, which awoke 6-year-old Dominick - and he rushed to his sister's aid. The small boy fought with the attacker and managed to free his sister in the process. Amber, who was bleeding after being slashed in the throat by Rivera, ran to a neighbor's home to call for help. She also says she was raped in the attack. Rivera, however, murdered the boy - Dominick's throat was cut and he had injuries on his hands. He was found dead in the home by police. Monster: Rivera also has charges pending that he molested a 2-year-old boy who also lived in his neighborhood . 'He gave his life for his family,' his mother, Debbie Burgos, told Philly.com. Amber, Burgos told reporters, is 'doing great. She's a survivor.' Rivera, who likely will spend the rest of his life in prison, also has charges pending for the alleged molestation of a 2-year-old boy in August of 2012. He will be tried separately in that pending case. Prosecutors say that Amber's testimony was instrumental in convicting Rivera, who used to give haircuts to the neighborhood kids. Brave: Dominick's sister Amber had her throat slashed in the attack but managed to survive and testify against the man who killed her brother . Tragic: Rivera faces a likely sentence of life in prison for the murder of 6-year-old Dominick . 'It's further evidence of what a survivor she is - at her . age that she could walk into a courtroom full of people most of which . were strangers and (recount) the most terrible things that could happen . to a person, let alone a child,' prosecutor Christine Shah told reporters. 'She is an incredibly courageous girl,"" Shah continued. 'I think she did it for her brother.' Shah says her office will 'aboslutely' ask the judge to sentence Rivera to life in prison. His next court date is October 23.","Osvaldo Rivera was found guilty of murdering 6-year-old Dominick Andujar .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The 64-year-old woman branded the 'nanny from hell' over claims she was refusing to leave the house of the California family who hired her has claimed she was the victim. In an interview with ABC's 20/20, broadcast Friday night, Diane Stretton claimed that Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte took advantage of her. Stretton also said that she wanted to move out but claimed that because the couple had allowed the media in it was making it hard for her to collect her belongings. Diane Stretton claims the Bracamonte family took advantage of her when she moved into their home . The 64-year-old had moved in with the Bracamonte family after answering an advert they had posted on Craigslist at the start of the year. At the time Stretton was homeless and having to sleep in her car, which was affecting her health and causing her legs to swell. SHe said that the job offer - light help around the home and watching over the children in return for free bed and board - had seemed like the ideal solution. 'For 20 hours a week [of] work, I'd get my legs up and take care of my heart condition and get to sleep in a bed,' Stretton told 20/20. But she claims that the work load was unreasonably added too, and said the couple took advantage because they knew she had nowhere else to go. 'I feel very exploited and very much . taken advantage of ... They knew that it would be . difficult for me to do something else,' she said. The Bracamontes claimed that Stretton had been like part of the family when she first moved in, but later refused to work . Stretton had moved into the family's Upland, California home after answering a Craigslist advert . Stretton told 20/20 that the family had wanted her to work more hours than what was a fair exchange for her room and board. Mrs Bracamonte allegedly also tried to make Stretton sign a letter as part of a final warning letter, in which she would agree to do more chores, including steam cleaning the floors once a week. 'She kept asking me and pressuring me ... the issue was . they just thought that they could have me 24/7,' Stretton said. She told ABC that under the terms of the original contract, either party had to give 30 days' notice to terminate the agreement. Under that, she claimed, she was entitled to stay in the property and have full use of its amenities. Stretton added that because the family brought the media in, it was making it hard for her to slowly being the process of moving out. She said she hadn't wanted their situation to become a 'spectacle'. Stretton says when she answered the advert she was homeless and in poor health . The couple who took Stretton in to their home told 20/20 that initially she had been a welcome addition the family. 'She was absolutely part of our family. And then she changed,' Mr Bracamonte said, as the couple claimed that after a few weeks Stretton had refused to work and just stayed in her room demanding meals. Under California law, the couple were unable to remove Stretton immediately - a situation which they say has put stress on their marriage, and has worried their three children.","Diane Stretton says Bracamonte family increased her workload .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Britain's first wild beaver for 500 years has been caught on camera for a second time - but this time gnawing on a tree in the dead of night. The mammal was first photographed in July last year, but evidence of the its living habits have since been scant. The rare creatures were thought to have been hunted to extinction in the wild, but a retired scientist has used an infrared camera to photograph a beaver living locally. Scroll down for video . Sightings of a single beaver, pictured, were reported in July 2013, and again in January this year, in the same location where the family has been seen. These images, as well as the new shots of the beaver family, were all captured by retired scientist Tom Buckley . Beavers normally live in family groups and can survive up to 24 years in the wild and 35 years in captivity. They are herbivorous rodents that build corridors in their dams to escape predators such as wolves and bears in the wild. The animals are nocturnal and can grow to more than 3ft, weigh up to 70lbs, and feed on a diet of reeds, leaves and bark. Beavers were hunted almost to extinction in Europe, both for fur and for castoreum - a secretion of its scent gland for medicinal properties. The animal is pictured in a sequence of shots sinking its teeth into a tree trunk beside the River Otter, in Ottery St Mary, near Exeter, Devon, where locals recently reported sightings of a beaver. Beavers were once native to England but were hunted to extinction during the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th century. Conservationists have introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the UK, but this is thought to be the first one found living in the wild. Retired environmental scientist Tom Buckley set up his specialist photographic equipment after several sightings of the creature on the banks of the River Otter, which flows through Somerset and Devon. He used a trail camera - which automatically takes photos when it detects signs of movement - and positioned it at several points around a small island owned by local farmer David Lawrence, after spotting evidence of bite marks on trees. When he checked his camera he was delighted to have caught the nocturnal beaver on film, chewing wedges out of the base of a tree in a bid to topple it. Conservationists have introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the UK, but this is thought to be the first one found living in the wild. Here the animal gnaws on a tree . The animals were pictured in a sequence of shots taken beside the River Otter, in Ottery St Mary, near Exeter, Devon, pictured . Mr Buckley said: ‘I first noticed a tree that had been damaged because I walk around that area every day - then I saw a few trees had been nibbled. ‘For me it posed the question: could it have been a beaver, or was it some kids messing about? ‘When I looked more closely it was clear the damage to the trees had been done by a beaver.’ He explained that the island where he set up his equipment is at the point where the river divides, which might be the ideal location for a dam. Mr Buckley said: ‘It's where most of the trees have been laid down, not necessarily forming a dam, but it may be that this is the early stages.’ During recent years beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but none are unaccounted for. Here, a beaver gnaws on wood in captivity . Tom Buckley used a trail camera - which automatically takes photos when it detects signs of movement - and positioned it at several points around a small island near the river, after spotting evidence of bite marks on trees. This image is one of the results . Last July a wild beaver was spotted  in the Rover otter near Budleigh Salterton, Devon. It was sighted by Lorna Douglas, 35 who was walking her dog at the time. She said it seemed calm and swam in circles before returning to cover beneath a tree. She photographed the animal chewing on bark and dragging pieces of wood through the shallow water. The beaver caught on camera is believed to be the same one spotted in July by Lorna Douglas, 35, while she was walking her dog. She saw the animal relaxing in the water 13 miles upstream in the same river and Mr Buckley believes the evidence that there is a wild beaver living in the area is irrefutable. ‘The only time I've seen the beaver in the flesh was around Christmas time when I saw its nose while it was in the water,’ he said. ‘Every time I've spotted it on the camera it's been in the pitch dark. It chews on trees and gathers branches together. Lorna Douglas spied a wild beaver in the River Otter last July. The animal is believed to be the same one sighted by Mr Buckey and the first of its kind spotted in England since they became extinct around 500 years ago . The retired scientist first noticed a tree that had been damaged from nibbling, which made him want to get photographic evidence of the beaver's existence.This photo documents the damage done by the wild beaver . The RSPCA said that the last few British beavers were hunted to extinction in Scotland during the 16th century. To return the creatures to the UK, conservationists have reintroduced them by using close relatives from Norway. Between May 2009 and September 2010, the Scottish Beaver Trial released four family groups and one pair of beavers into Knapdale Forest, Argyll. More recently, beavers have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of . breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but . none are unaccounted for. ‘Most of the sightings, if not all, have been when it comes out of the water and onto the land. The question now is if it's just one, or is it a pair. ‘It may be one that's just passing through from somewhere else - it might be an escapee, but nobody seems to be saying they've lost a beaver.’ Mr Lawrence said he suspected people were messing around with axes when he first saw that a couple of trees had been felled last summer. ‘We haven't seen the real animal yet, only the one in Mr Buckley's photographs. But you can see the ""artwork"" he does to the trees all around the area,’ the farmer said. ‘It's early days yet but, as long as lots of people don't go there and frighten the beaver away, he should be happy enough. The island where Mr Buckley set up his equipment is at the point where the river divides, which might be the ideal location for a dam. Here, farmer David Lawrence (pictured) looks at the animal's habitat on the River Otter in east Devon . ‘What's going to be really interesting is how it gets on with the other animals, like the otters which we see on the river.’ The RSPCA says that the last few British beavers became extinct in Scotland during the 16th century. During recent years they have been reintroduced in captive areas as part of breeding programs including at Ottery St Mary and Gloucestershire - but none are unaccounted for. In Ottery St Mary the breeding pair built a dam and had two kits and by 2005 and in October 2008 three escaped from their home in Lifton, Devon, but were all re-caught.","The wild animal was photographed beside the River Otter, in Ottery St Mary, Devon, where locals have reported sightings of a beaver .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A sudden break has come in the case of a day trader who left a comfortable life in New York for a transcontinental motorcycle journey, only to go missing January 25 in a deeply troubled region of Mexico. Authorities have found the green Kawasaki motorcycle owned by Harry Devert, the 32-year-old adventurer from Pelham, N.Y. Beside the abandoned motorcycle were the remains of a body wrapped in a black plastic bag. Ann Devert, the mother of the missing man, said by telephone that authorities took photographs of the motorcycle, including its vehicle identification number, or VIN. 'I had them send me an image of the VIN number and it’s the same VIN number as Harry’s Kawasaki,' Devert said. Adventures: Harry Devert on the motorbike he bought to drive across Mexico. He vanished in the dangerous Michoacan state. A body found next to his abandoned Kawasake has not yet been identified . A sudden break has come in the case of missing New Yorker Harry Devert, an adventurer who vanished in Mexico . Local police say they found a body wrapped in plastic next to Devert's abandoned motorcycle . 'The remains have been transported to a morgue in Zihuatanejo. 'I’ve heard word that the state of decomposition is about five months.' Devert, who held both French and U.S. citizenships, was an adventurer who had already spent five years traveling through Europe and South Asia, keeping friends and followers apprised of his wanderings on anewyorkertravels.com. One blog post begins like this: 'I’m the owner of a big smile and a broad taste for adventure.' The last his girlfriend heard from Devert was on Jan. 25. He’d visited a monarch butterfly reserve in Michoacan state, home to a powerful organized crime group, and was headed to a beach on the Pacific coast where the final scene in the 1994 film The Shawshank Redemption was filmed. The beach is in adjacent Guerrero state. A statement from the Guerrero office of public security Friday morning said authorities found the abandoned motorcycle along a dirt road leading to La Majahua beach in the township of Union Isidoro Montes de Oca. The Pelham man quit his job in order to follow this route through America, which was posted on his travel blog . Risks: Mr Devert is a seasoned adventurer who had previously traveled around the world for years . The statement said authorities also found '10 packages of what appeared to be narcotics (marijuana and cocaine)' near the motorbike and body. A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said issued a brief statement: 'We are aware of the news reports that indicate a motorcycle and human remains were discovered in the state of Guerrero near the town of Lagunillas and are working closely with the authorities to get more information.' Devert’s mother said she’d gone to a police station in Pelham this afternoon to provide a DNA sample. Meanwhile, 'the American Embassy has sent someone to get bone scrapings from the corpse to send to a laboratory in the States'. The samples will be compared to see if there is a genetic match. The mother praised the help she’s gotten from U.S. diplomats in Mexico. Wild times; Mr Devert said he had previously been threatened with a gun in Venezuela . 'They’ve been great. Especially now that they’ve gotten something solid to go on,' she told me. Harry Devert was heading for Brazil on his lengthy motorcycle journey, hoping to catch part of the World Cup soccer tournament, which ends this Sunday in Rio de Janeiro. He was a 'mega' fan, his mother noted. 'He would come out of the jungle to see a game by Barcelona or Real Madrid,' she said. Devert said she believes the remains may be of her son but is holding out hope that a crime gang could have launched a 'subterfuge' to delay a pending raid on a ranch known to hold kidnapping victims. 'I’m saying 55 (percent) that it is Harry, but I’m holding on to that 45 (percent),' she said.","Harry Devert, 32, went missing in a troubled area of Mexico on January 25 .

Fellow Victoria's Secret models have revealed that the 33-year-old is a 'true athlete' and that the secret of her incredible body is boxing. 'Adriana is pretty amazing,' said Alessandra Ambrosio, 33. 'She does all of that boxing that I've never done before and I'm scared to even try — what I do is more mild and better suited for girls, but she does what the athletes do. It's really tough.' Boxing clever: Victoria's Secret Angel Adriana Lima got her catwalk-worthy body via bouts in the boxing ring . The model made the comment during an interview with Fashionista.com's Alyssa Vingan at a New York event in aid of cycling charity, Pelotonia. And it seems Ambrosio isn't the only one in awe of Lima's tough approach to getting fit for catwalk appearances. 25-year-old Martha Hunt, a recent addition to the Victoria's Secret stable, also spoke of her admiration for Lima's butt-kicking workouts and revealed that the Brazilian model 'gets better' every year. 'She's a born athlete,' revealed Hunt, 'and she gets better and better every year — she's not human!'

"By . Niamh Walsh And Simon Watkins . Cheryl Cole has mysteriously closed down a £2.5 million Irish company which has apparently helped her avoid paying hundreds of thousands of pounds in UK corporation tax in the last three years. The company, Tara Entertainments Ltd, set up in 2011, was widely seen as a way of paying a lower rate of company tax on her international earnings than would be owed in Britain. But both Tara and its British-based parent company CC Entertainments International were put into voluntary liquidation in the last two months, suggesting that the star is keen to avoid accusations that she is dodging tax. Scroll down for video . Cheryl Cole  with  Michael Spencer at a charity event. Cole has recently closed an Irish company . The move came just days before Gary Barlow and two other members of Britain’s most successful boy band, Take That, learned that they owed millions in unpaid tax after an investment vehicle they had been using was ruled to be a tax avoidance scheme. While Cole’s actions are perfectly legal, the last accounts for Tara showed assets of £2.5 million at the end of 2012, suggesting earnings of at least this much have been funnelled through the company. If so, the singer would have avoided paying more than £200,000 in tax that would have been owed in Britain. This is the difference between the standard corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent in the republic – compared to 21 per cent in the UK. Cheryl Cole's company CC Entertainments International Ltd has been wound up . Meanwhile, documents for the  liquidation of the UK company, CC Entertainments – which in 2013 only declared £1 in net assets – now show it has cash of £1.88 million, which is likely to be paid to Cole as the company’s sole owner once liquidation is complete. If the money has been moved from Ireland to the UK, taxes could be liable on that amount. But last night a leading accountant said that Cole could add to her savings by declaring the windfall as a capital gain, liable for 10 per cent tax under business tax relief rules – as opposed to paying up to 45 per cent income tax on declared income. Gary Barlow (left) used a tax avoidance scheme that left him owing millions; Olly Murs (right) channelled more than £400,000 through his Irish company in 2012 . ‘[Irish companies] are a very popular way of lowering the amount of corporation tax owed compared to that in the UK,’ he said. ‘When you bring your money back into Britain, if you liquidate your company, the money can be drawn out as a capital gain which means you only pay 10 per cent tax.’ Neither Cole’s Irish accountant nor her spokesman would comment last night, but company filings seen by The Mail on Sunday confirm Cole’s role in the company: ‘Tara Entertainments was 100 per cent owned by CC Entertainments International Ltd a company registered in the UK. The directors consider the ultimate parent undertaking and controlling party of the company to be Cheryl Cole.’ Tara and CC Entertainments International were set up with the help of Irish music industry accountant Alan McEvoy, who is the accountant for some of the UK and Ireland’s biggest names in music. He lists money-making machine One Direction, JLS and a host of other stars among his clients. Last year it was reported that another client, former X Factor star Olly Murs, incurred an Irish tax bill of €61,735 (£49,067) on earnings of €516,816 (£410,765) through his Irish company in 2012 – much less than he would have paid in the UK. McEvoy also acts for Ronan Keating and his estranged wife Yvonne, and has also looked after Boyzone and Girls Aloud. Just this month, McEvoy set up a company with One Direction member Harry Styles called HSA Publishing Ltd – adding to suggestions that the heart-throb star may be about to launch a solo career. A statement on McEvoy’s website reads: ‘Our strength lies in bespoke financial and accounting packages to suit the client. Our services can range from dealing with a client once a year regarding tax compliance to dealing with a client on a week to week basis on their financial and accounting management.’ Cole’s rearrangement of her financial affairs comes amid growing condemnation of all forms of tax avoidance in the UK. In the last two years companies such as Amazon, Apple, Starbucks and Google have been heavily criticised for declaring their profits in Ireland and other low tax jurisdictions, while celebrities have also come under the HMRC spotlight. HM Revenue & Customs always refuses to comment on individual cases but has previously emphasised it will not ‘tolerate abuse of the system’.","Geordie singer wound up company that apparently helped her avoid hundreds of thousands of pounds in UK corporation tax .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former North Korean spy who used to steal sex secrets for Kim Jong-Il has revealed that she now lives on benefits as nobody will employ her thanks to her previous career. Won Jeong-hwa, who now lives in the small town of Gunpo, just south of Seoul in South Korea, has found that her espionage skills are not valued in her adopted country, and she has struggled to hold down waitress or cleaning jobs because employers fire her as soon as they discover her past life. While some former spies find their new life in the South a joy - writing books and speaking about North Korea on television - that is far from the experience Won has had. Scroll down for video . Tears: Won Jeong-hwa's espionage work is not taken seriously enough in South Korea for her to cash in on her past, yet she's also too notorious to find an ordinary job . A year after finishing a five-year espionage sentence for using sex to obtain military secrets and plotting to assassinate intelligence officers, Won is a 40-year-old single mother eking out a living on an $800 monthly government subsidy. Her espionage work is not taken seriously enough in South Korea for her to cash in on her past, yet she's also too notorious to find an ordinary job. She says she has been fired from several waitressing and cleaning jobs after employers learned about her past, which she had attempted to conceal. 'I've thought about killing myself many times,' Won said in a recent interview at her small apartment in Gunpo, just south of Seoul. She has two big strikes against her. There are allegations that she was merely a low-level informant whose deeds were inflated by South Korean officials eager to make Pyongyang look bad, and by reporters digging for a sexy story. Additionally, the sexual nature of her crimes carries a stigma in this conservative country. The sexual nature of Won Jeong-hwa's crimes carries a stigma in conservative South Korea . Won was imprisoned in 2008 after a court ruled that she posed as an ordinary North Korean defector, then used sex to extract secrets from South Korean military officers. The media began calling her 'North Korea's Mata Hari' in reference to an exotic dancer from the Netherlands who used sex to obtain military secrets during World War I. North Korea accused South Korea of cooking up a spy scandal to tarnish Pyongyang's image and said Won was a criminal. After Won was released, she was a popular guest on TV talk shows where she spoke about her harsh, elite spy training. She said she disobeyed Pyongyang's orders to assassinate two South Korean army intelligence officers with poison. She also talked about how she fell in love with a junior army officer - the ""man of my life."" He was later imprisoned for passing her secrets including a list of North Korean defectors even after learning she was a spy. The attention caused South Korean media to revisit her case. Some reporters questioned the value of her espionage work, and raised suspicions based on testimony by North Korean defectors who said they knew Won and her family members in the North. Won's 2008 court verdict said she was trained at a special operations unit in Pyongyang and was a daughter of an agent killed on a spy mission in South Korea in 1974. But Won's stepfather, Kim Dong-soon, who came to South Korea in 2007, said in an interview that Won's biological father was an ordinary laborer who died of a heart attack, and that Won was a high school dropout who had nothing to do with special operations forces. Won denies Kim's allegations. In the verdict and in interviews, it was said that North Korea first sent Won to South Korea in 2001 to take photos of the exteriors of U.S. military installations and to collect South Korean newspaper editorials about North Korea. People dubious of Won's elite status consider that low-level spy work. Some defectors who met Won before her 2008 arrest say she was often incoherent and unprofessional and could not have been a highly trained spy. 'I believe that she was exploited as an informant. ... She wasn't even worth being called a spy,' said Kim Yong-hwa, a defector-turned-activist. He said he once rejected Won's request to meet with a high-profile North Korean defector because she rambled too much. A key debunker of Won's espionage record is Won herself. She has said in media interviews that she was pressured by prosecutors to provide false testimony, particularly about her use of sex in spy work. 98128 . 67710 . 92346 . 56262 . 78275 . 87600 . 19854 . 128360 . 130080 . 62439 . 152741 . 80640 . 73840 . 79599 . 140928 . 80481 . 81549 . 125992 . Life: Won Jeong-hwa said she once disobeyed Pyongyang's orders to assassinate two South Korean army intelligence officers with poison. She also said she fell in love with a junior officer in the South Korean army . The trial verdict and an investigation by prosecutors said she slept with numerous men, including South Korean officers and her boss at an agency where she worked. Won said she used sex as a spying tool only once, to steal personnel management-related documents from an army major's home computer. She said she couldn't resist pressure by prosecutors who gave her alcohol and urged her to confess during questioning. They ""manufactured (the story of) my relations with men,"" she said. 'I'm not a Mata Hari.' Prosecutors have dismissed Won's claims. South Korea has a history of forgiving former spies and assassins, though they are still sometimes ostracized. Their careers in the media often depend on whether they were involved in high-profile cases that captured global attention, and whether they followed Seoul's propaganda line against the North. Won said a prosecutor told her during her questioning that she could make a new start in the South by following in the footsteps of Kim Hyon-hui, a North Korean agent sentenced to death for bombing a South Korean jet in 1987, killing all 115 passengers aboard. Kim was later pardoned and wrote a best-selling autobiography. She often appears on TV to speak critically of North Korea. Several other North Koreans who once attacked the South now embrace it. Previous life: While working undercover for North Korea's late dictator Kim Jong-il, Won Jeong-hwa would steal sex secret about his rivals in the South . One of the 31 North Korean commandos who launched a brazen mission to assassinate South Korea's president in 1968 is now a Christian pastor who lectures about the North. A North Korean crew member of a submarine that ran aground in the South, and who was captured alive after a massive manhunt that left 25 other comrades dead or missing, is a lecturer for the South Korean navy. A spy arrested after a deadly shootout in 1995 works for a think tank run by the South's spy agency and wrote a book about his mission. Won, on the other hand, feels trapped. No South Korean TV station wants her as an expert because of reports that she may not have been an elite spy. Finding work unrelated to her past is also impossible, she said, because no one wants to hire an unskilled woman with a criminal espionage record. One of the jobs she gained and quickly lost was at a noodle restaurant. She said a former colleague later told her the boss had been worried she would poison the food. The army officer Won fell in love with has been released, but they are no longer in touch. Nor is the father of her 12-year-old daughter in the picture: She said he is a South Korean businessman she met in China, where she had been assigned to find and repatriate North Korean defectors before she was sent to South Korea. Won said the government assistance she gets was not enough for her to even buy a school uniform for her daughter. A center that helps female ex-inmates gave one to her. Many defectors shun her. She said her neighbors once asked that she move, and that her daughter's friends have been told by their parents to stay away from the girl. 'I've told my daughter she should go to an orphanage because she'd be happier living there,' Won said, sobbing. 'I want to move to a country where no one knows me.","Won Jeong-hwa used to work undercover in South Korea selling sex secrets about army generals to the North Korean government .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A key component of anti-ageing creams is next to useless, research suggests. Some moisturisers use fatty shells called liposomes to ferry wrinkle-busting compounds under the skin, where they can fight the ageing process. But a study carried out by Danish researchers, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, found that rather than passing through the skin the liposomes break into pieces almost as soon as they make contact. New research suggests a key component of anti-ageing creams does not work . Professor Luis Bagatolli, of the University of Southern Denmark, said: ‘The skin’s task is to block extraneous substances, which is why it will generally reject anything that tries to penetrate it. ‘So it is no easy task for the beauty industry to find methods of transporting rejuvenating and moisturising substances deep into the skin. ‘We have now shown that liposomes cannot do the job, despite some rather persistent advertising claims.’ The University’s Centre for Miomembrance . Physics and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology carried out . new tests of the abilities of liposomes. Scientists say liposomes - an ingredient in anti-wrinkle creams - are unable to get into skin and break on the surface . Using a method called RICS - Raster . Imaging Correlation Spectroscopy - they monitored what happens to . liposomes as they enter the skin by marking them with fluorescent . colour. If, under the RICS system, the colours . are seen to show ‘concerted’ movement as the liposomes contact the . skin, then it means the liposomes remain intact as they penetrate it. But, no such movement happened, which, . according to the researchers, proves that liposomes do not remain . intact and so do not penetrate the skin as beauty firms claim. Professor Bagatolli added that liposomes may still work, but not in the way manufacturers believe.","Liposomes often contained in anti-ageing creams .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . North Korea has denounced Seth Rogen and James Franco as 'terrorists' in a stern letter to the UN Secretary General over their new comedy which lampoons its leader. The secretive regime lodged a formal protest over The Interview, a farcical story of tabloid journalists hired by the CIA to assassinate Kim Jong Un. It stars Rogen and Franco as the two television reporters who turn assassin after landing an interview with Kim in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Stepping into role: In the film  American born Korean actor Randall Park plays Kim Jong-un . The North Korean Foreign Ministry had . previously warned the U.S. of 'stern' and 'merciless' retaliation if it . fails to block the release of the film, which is out on October 14. Now, . in a letter addressed to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, North . Korea's UN envoy Ja Song-Nam says allowing the film to be made and seen . constitutes 'the most undisguised sponsoring of terrorism as well as a . war action.' 'The US . authorities should take immediate and appropriate action to ban the . production and distribution of the film, otherwise it will be fully . responsible for encouraging and sponsoring terrorism,' the letter says. North . Korea asked that the letter be circulated as an official document to . members of the UN General Assembly and Security Council for their . consideration. International incident: James Franco and Seth Rogen's latest feature, The Interview, depicts the pair trying to kill the country's Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un - and North Korea is not amused .

In . a statement carried by North Korea's official KCNA news agency, a . foreign ministry spokesman said the film was the work of 'gangster . moviemakers' and should never be shown. The . 'reckless U.S. provocative insanity' is triggering 'a gust of hatred . and rage' among North Korean people, the spokesman said, adding that its . release would be considered an 'act of war that we will never . tolerate'. Rogen poked fun . at the threat on Twitter, writing: 'People don't usually wanna kill me . for one of my movies until after they've paid 12 bucks for it.' In . the film's trailer, a secret agent played by Lizzy Caplan says Kim must . be stopped as his people believe anything he says including 'that he . speaks to dolphins and doesn't pee or poo.' Special access: James and Seth play talk show host and producer that have been chosen to interview the leader . Kim .

'There is a special irony in this storyline as it shows the desperation of the US government and American society,' he said. 'A . film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the U.S. has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Foreign companies will be hit with huge fines if they break promises to protect British jobs. Vince Cable said assurances made during takeover talks must be honoured, or companies would face the consequences. The Business Secretary said he wanted to tighten the law so there is ‘no wiggle-room’ to hold businesses to account. Business Secretary Vince Cable said he wanted to tighten the law so there is ‘no wiggle-room’ to hold businesses to account . The move follows controversy over the ultimately failed takeover bid by US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer for British-based AstraZeneca. While the takeover looked like it might still happen, the government insisted it was working to protect jobs and investment in research in the UK. But critics said that once a company takes control of a British firm, there is little that can be done to ensure they stick to their promises. Now tougher laws are being looked at to bolster the 'national interest test' following concerns about the acquisition of major UK firms. Pledges made during negotiations should be legally binding with penalties for breaking them running into millions of pounds, Mr Cable said. He told BBC One’s Andrew Marr show: ‘'We’re probably going to get other big takeovers coming down the track. ‘I think where we now have to strengthen that is to make sure that any commitments made, there’s no wiggle-room. ‘And we’re talking to the Takeover Panel about how to do that and we may well get into the area of having financial penalties in order to make sure that those commitments are binding.’ He said new laws were in the pipeline, and suggested the Lib Dems could go further and demanded a tougher public interest test introduced on foreign takeovers. Mr Cable added: ‘Supposing the company don’t want to negotiate, or they’re not willing to give the assurances you need, what do you do then? ‘And I think you then need some fallback powers, you need the last resort where the Government can intervene, can invoke the public interest under the existing legislation. ‘What I would argue – and the Liberal Democrats’ view within the Coalition – is we need to do this, as it were, with a laser missile rather than a cluster bomb... 'We are going to need a last resort power such that if there is something that is very clearly against the national interest – and the loss of our R&D in pharmaceuticals is a very good example – the Government can in those circumstances intervene. I made it very clear when the original takeover was taking place that we were reserving all our options.' The move follows controversy over the ultimately failed takeover bid by US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer for British-based AstraZeneca (pictured) At the time of AstraZeneca deal, Labour called for the Government to strengthen the public interest test for takeovers so any potential buyout would be subject to an assessment of how it impacted on Britain's strategic research and science base. Today shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said: ‘Labour has led calls for a strengthened public interest test to apply to proposed takeovers and mergers in order to protect Britain’s R&D and science base, which the Business Secretary - three months on - now appears to be coming round to. 'Vince Cable says he wants commitments given by the bidders of target British companies to have more teeth, a move which Labour would welcome. My offer to work with Vince Cable to achieve these aims, on a cross-party basis, remains open.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady welcomed the move, which she said was evidence of the Government tackling living standards rather than 'union-bashing'. She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: 'I think it's definitely a step in the right direction. 'This is the kind of thing that the Government should be concentrating on - how do we make sure that we get real investment for the future and we start tackling living standards instead of having a bit of old-fashioned union bashing.'","Vince Cable says he wants 'no wriggleroom' when promises are made .

United States goalkeeper Hope Solo, right, makes a save on a shot by France during the second half of a women's friendly soccer match on Saturday, June 14, 2014, in Tampa, Florida. In her career, she was won two Olympic gold medals playing for the US women's national team . Solo's sister has not been identified, but according to the soccer star's memoir she has a half-sister named Terry. Pictured above at a U.S. women's soccer match against Australia on October 20, 2013 . Kirkland police Lt. Mike Murray said there was 'a big party going on at her house'. 'It was an out-of-control situation' Lt. Murray told The Times. Solo was booked into jail for investigation of two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence assault. Her next court appearance is scheduled for August 11. The sister was not identified by police, but in her memoir, Solo writes that she has a half sister named Terry. Solo's late father, Jeffrey Solo, had two children, Terry and David, before divorcing his wife.He then remarried and had Hope and her brother, Marcus. Solo has won two Olympic gold medals for the US women's national team. She also plays with the Seattle Reign of the National Women's Soccer League. 'We are aware of the situation with Hope and are now gathering information,' the Reign posted on the team's Twitter feed. In 2012, she married former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens. This isn't the first altercation Solo has had with police. Reports show police were called to a disturbance at her Kirkland home in the early hours on November 12, 2012, with her then-boyfriend Jerramy Stevens (pictured with Solo in 2013) arrested pending domestic violence charges. Stevens was released and the couple were married the following day . He was arrested just before their wedding for investigation of assault after a disturbance involving her, but he was not charged. Maybrown represented Stevens in that case. Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy. 'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said then. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.' In her last appearance for the US, Solo recorded her 71st career shutout, a 1-0 victory over France on June 14 in Tampa, Florida. She sat out the team's game against France on Thursday night in Connecticut.","The U.S. women's national soccer team goalie was arrested Saturday after allegedly beating up her sister and nephew at their Kirkland, Washington home .

"By . Darren Boyle . Almost 500 children are being hospitalised each week to have teeth removed new figures have revealed. It is estimated that one in four primary school children are suffering tooth decay as a result of drinking too much fruit juice or soft drinks. The research by the Health and Social Care Information Centre for NHS England found the level of admissions had increased over the past 12 months. Almost 500 children a week require surgery to remove rotten teeth according to new research, file picture . In 2010/11, 22,752 were hospitalised in order to have one or more teeth removed. That figure increased to to 25,812. In some extreme cases, dental surgeons were forced to remove all of  their milk teeth because of excessive decay. Kathryn Harley, consultant in paediatric dentistry at the Royal College told The Sunday Times: 'We have children who require all 20 of their baby teeth extracted. 'It beggars belief that their diets could produce such a drastic effect. 'They are going into hospital because they are either presenting with acute problems with pain, or because the stage of dental disease, the number of teeth with decay, is such that they need a general anaesthetic. A major survey of five-year-old children discovered that more than a quarter were suffering from tooth decay. The high level of extractions is being blamed on children consuming too many sweets and soft drinks . According to the survey: 'The results reveal wide variation in the prevalence and severity of dental decay. The areas with poorer oral health tend to be in the north and in the more deprived local authority.' The figures show that more than half of children in Leicester, 53 per cent, compared with just 12.5 per cent in Brighton and Hove. Children in Rochdale have on average five decayed teeth compared with 1.88 in South Gloucestershire. More than eight per cent of children aged five in Blackpool have been hospitalised at least once to have a tooth removed. The researchers claimed: 'This report highlights the wide variation in the levels of dental decay experienced by five-year-old children living in different parts of the country and in different life circumstances. 'The cause of dental decay is well understood and is related to the frequent exposure of teeth to fermentable carbohydrates. Provisional figures for the the period 2013-14 show that 25,812 children aged between five and nine  have been admitted to hospital to have multiple tooth extractions, up from 22,574 three years previously. Some dentists observe how decay progresses in baby teeth because there is uncertainty about the effectiveness of fillings, said Professor Jimmy Steele of Newcastle University. 'A lot of dentists are unhappy about taking out teeth generally. They certainly don't like to take kids' teeth out.' The number of children aged from zero to four admitted to hospital to have teeth out has also increased, from 8,060 in 2010-11 to a provisional figure of 8,758 in 2013-2014. Other key findings for children being hospitalised show that one in 20  of girls aged from 15 to 19 being treated by a consultant was as a result of intentional self-harm, while boys were more likely than girls to have been injured in an assault, two per cent. . Similar differences were also apparent for 10 to 14-year-olds, but they were more pronounced for the older age group. There were more similarities in children up to the age of nine. There were a total of 2.5 million Finished Consultant Episodes (FCEs) in the 12 month period from July 2012 to June last year for children aged up to 19, a very small increase of 0.1 per cent on the previous 12 months.","Researchers found that more than 25,000 children needed teeth extracted .

Singer Cilla Black has criticised the club that made her famous, blaming it for damaging her hearing so badly that she has had a hearing aid surgically implanted. The pop star turned presenter is in her 70s, but as a teenager in the 1960s she was a coat check girl in Liverpool's Cavern Club, working for tickets to watch bands like The Beatles perform. Cilla told The Mail on Sunday: 'I blame the Cavern. All those years in a place with no proper acoustics, I think it may have done some damage.

"By . Sean Poulter . A three-year-old girl was turned away from a holiday hotel children’s club because she suffers from a form of dwarfism. The incident has been condemned by the girl’s mother and campaigners as evidence of the prejudice that people born with the condition have to overcome. Young Eva Moissard was on holiday with her mum, Heidi, and two older sisters, Noa, aged 17, and Anna, 14, at the Club Magic Life Penelope Beach, in Djerba, Tunisia. Heidi Mosissard with her daughters Noa, 17, right, Anna, 14, and Eva, three. Young Eva, who suffers from a form of dwarfism, was told by staff at a Thompson hotel she was not welcome to join the Children's Club . The mother says she rang the holiday company before the family travelled to their destination to inform them of Eva's condition. She says the company assured her her daughter would be welcomed by the play group . Before going away Mrs Moissard contacted the holiday company, Thomson, to explain that Eva had a form of dwarfism – achondroplasia – and had limited mobility because of her age and size. She specifically wanted to know that the children’s club at the hotel would accept Eva and was given and assurance that it would. However, when the family arrived at the hotel, staff working in the club made clear that they saw Eva as a burden and that she would not be welcome to join in the fun and games. Mrs Moissard said the experience had been heart breaking, particularly when set against the achievements of people in the public eye who have dwarfism, such as the celebrated Paralympic swimmer, Ellie Simmonds, and the actor, Warwick Davis. Mr Davis is co-founder of the campaigning group Little People UK, which support families where children are born with the condition. A spokesman for the group said: ‘It is disheartening that in the 21st century, people with dwarfism are still being judged on what other people perceive they can't do, or by how they look. ‘Bodies come in all shapes and sizes. There are over 200 different types of dwarfism, making up a population of over 6,000 people with the condition in the UK today. Little People UK, a charity founded by Warwick Davis, pictured, called the action 'disheartening' today . ‘These individuals wish to be able to live happy and successful lives without facing the preconceptions of people who cannot see beyond their height. It is unfortunate that many little people are teased and stared at throughout their lives because their bodies look different, to that of an average sized person. ‘Eighty percent of people with dwarfism have average height parents and siblings. Some types of dwarfism are simply a genetic change at conception, which happens to have very visible results.’ Mrs Moissard, a 43-year-old single mum, from Bedfordshire, said her family had been looking forward to the holiday at the end of May. ‘It is quite tough for us. We had not been on holiday together as a family for a very long time and the girls were really keen to go away,’ she said. ‘We spend a lot of time looking after Eva and we wanted a holiday where there was a kids club that would take three year olds to give her and everyone a break. After searching on the internet, we found this particular holiday and hotel with Thomson. ‘Eva is small and one aspect of her condition is that her muscle tone is not as well developed as other three year olds, which means she can walk a little but is not running around.’ Mrs Moissard, who gave up a plan to retrain as French teacher to look after Eva, said: ‘I called Thomson to make sure that the hotel and kids club would accept her. ‘I explained Eva had a form of dwarfism and had limited mobility. They assured me the hotel would have to accept Eva at the children’s club and would make sure that they did. Based on that assurance, I went ahead and booked.’ But Mrs Moissard said: ‘When we got there and went to kids club with Eva in her buggy, the lady who was in charge said she can’t come in because she can’t walk. ‘She said she would not be able to do any of the activities, such as going for a picnic or to the beach. They said they did not have the staff to push Eva in her buggy. ‘Naturally, I got quite upset and emotional on Eva’s behalf, particularly as I have been assured they would take her.’ She explained that Eva goes to a nursery two days a week when she is at home and is used to spending time with other children and adults outside the immediate family. Eventually, the staff relented and said she could attend some morning sessions, providing the family remained close by. The Club Magic Life Penelope Beach, in Djerba, Tunisia - where Children's Club staff made clear Eva was not welcome to join in with activities . The mother says staff at the hotel (pictured) said Eva couldn't join in as she couldn't walk - despite the mother notifying them of her abilities before arrival . ‘We did go back , but the staff were immediately giving each other very funny looks and made it clear Eva was not welcome. The people were not taking much care of the children, so we just took her out.’ The situation was raised with the hotel’s entertainments manager, who showed no concern or sympathy. ‘He was really rude to me in front of everybody. He said they could not accept a child like that, pointing at Eva, and said she would not be able to take part in any of the activities. ‘He said if Thomson had bothered to call them he would have made clear they could not accept her. ‘This was all in front of Eva and she understands what is going on and she was going to be excluded. It was just horrid, and so upsetting. I really can’t understand why they would discriminate against a child like this. It was heart breaking.’ She complained to the Thomson rep and again when the family returned home. Initially, Thomson claimed that Mrs Moissard did not fully explain Eva’s condition, which she says is untrue and has added insult to injury. At first the travel company offered a good will gesture of £200 by way of an apology, but it later offered a full refund. ‘I feel very badly let down by Thomson. I explained the situation to them and I would not have booked unless I was given a clear assurance that Eva would be welcome,’ she said . The holiday company have now apologised to the family - and said they will review their booking systems . Thomson apologised and promised to review how it processes bookings. A spokesman said: ‘Thomson is sorry to hear about Mrs Moissard’s disappointment with the kids’ club at Club Magic Life Penelope Beach, Djerba, Tunisia. 'Club Magic Life welcomes children with disabilities at all of its hotel-run kids’ clubs. It plans its staffing levels very carefully to ensure that the correct ratio of children to staff is maintained at all times. A child with mobility issues will require one-to-one support, and therefore the kids’ club must be informed in advance that the child wishes to attend. 'When booking, Mrs Moissard advised us of her daughter’s condition, but the agent did not appreciate that this can result in mobility issues. 'Had the agent been aware of this, she would have contacted the hotel to ensure they were prepared and adequately staffed to welcome her daughter. Whilst Thomson extensively trains its staff on how to take bookings from customers with special requirements, it is important that customers share as much information as possible so that we are able to provide the best holiday experience for them. 'The team in resort did their utmost to ensure that Mrs Moissard’s daughter was able to join in all appropriate activities, and as a result she attended part of the sessions every day that it operated during her holiday. 'We sincerely apologise to Mrs Moissard and her family for the inconvenience caused, and have offered her a full refund which she has accepted.  Club Magic Life welcomes thousands of children to its kids’ clubs every year, with the vast majority of customers rating the staff as good or excellent.'","Eva Moissard suffers from a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia .

"By . Valerie Elliott . Mementoes: Possessions of the late Clarissa Dickson Wright are being sold to clear her debts . A lifetime of quirky mementoes collected by celebrity cook and bombastic pro-hunting campaigner Clarissa Dickson Wright are going under the hammer this week to clear her debts. Items to be auctioned off include unusual antique kitchen gadgets, her cherished collections of ceramic pigs – and even a scrawled bomb threat from an anti-bloodsport extremist. Thursday’s sale is expected to raise more than £30,000 – more than enough to cover an outstanding £17,000 tax and funeral bill. Clarissa, half of TV’s Two Fat Ladies, left just £8,000 when she died aged 66 in March. Among the antique books, countryside paintings and personal items are her scruffy size seven walking boots, expected to raise about £40, an unusual citrus peel slicer (£40), a Victorian ham boiler (£25) and a silver marrow scoop (£80) used to eat bone marrow. Country pursuit items include a stirrup cup shaped with a hare’s head (£40) a hunting knife (£70) and a print of flying pigs named after Clarissa’s pet hates, Defra [the Department for Rural Affairs], Tony [Blair’s] Promises and Supermarkets, £10 to £20. Clarissa inherited a fortune but became an alcoholic and was three times bankrupt. Her friend David Morris said: ‘Clarissa was extraordinarily generous and I wasn’t surprised she left very little. But she wished her debts to be settled and the best option was a sale. You will see from the items Clarissa lived a humble life.’ The items are being sold by Carlisle-based Thomson, Roddick & Medcalf.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A teenager physically and emotionally hurt in the Boston Marathon bombings says she was forced to leave a New Hampshire store because she had her service dog with her. Sydney Corcoran, who has post-traumatic stress disorder, had been shopping at a Nashua branch of TJ Maxx when staff said the dog - Koda - needed to be put in a cart or taken outside. The service dog has been a crucial companion for 19-year-old Sydney, as she struggles to come to terms with the terror attack in which her mother, Celeste, lost both legs. Distressing: Sydney Corcoran, pictured with her mom Celeste who lost her legs in the bombing, says a store manager confronted her about service dog Koda . Lifeline: Sydney says service dog Koda, pictured, has been vital in helping her come to terms with the attack . Sydney, who was hit by shrapnel during the explosions in April last year, describes the certified service dog as 'my little cheerleader'. She told WCVB that when the pair were in the store Koda was wearing his working-dog vest to prove he wasn't just a regular pet. The teenager claimed that the store manager approached her as she shopped and said the store's policy meant the dog would have to go in the shopping cart or leave. Sydney tried to explain Koda was a working dog and wouldn't comfortably go in the cart, but said she became upset and embarrassed, and left the store close to tears. Trauma: Celeste Corcoran, center, and Sydney, right, complete the Boston Marathon one year after they suffered physical and emotional injuries in the blast . Apology: A TJ Maxx spokesman has apologized after Sydney was told by staff at the store above that she had to put her service dog in a cart or leave . Her mom rushed to the store to try to intervene on her daughter's behalf. Ms Corcoran said she told the manager sorry wasn't good enough and that 'you just made someone with an emotional disorder so much worse.' Since the bombings Sydney has suffered with stress and was finding it hard to sleep, but Koda had started to help her heal. 'It's knowing that I have this little . support system that's all my own ... Honestly, I sleep better now,' she said of her constant companion. TJ Maxx issued a statement saying it was taking the matter seriously and regretted how the situation was treated. 'Customers . with disabilities who are accompanied by their service animals are . welcome in our stores at any time,' the statement said. Ms Corcoran told WCVB she hoped her daughter's experience would make more businesses aware of the laws about service dogs, and the animals' abilities to help those suffering with post traumatic stress.","Sydney Corcoran has post traumatic stress disorder after being caught in the blast .

"By . Steve Nolan . Research into three bird flu victims in China has raised grim fears that the 11 deaths so far are just the tip of the iceberg. Scientists found that the vicious new strain has the potential to pass more easily into humans and remain undetected until it is at an advanced stage. The research into three people, all of whom died, showed the disease causes pneumonia, septic shock, brain damage and multi-organ failure. It came as officials in a region of China culled chickens in a bid to stop the spread of a new strain of bird flu which claimed its tenth victim in the country yesterday. Prevention: A city management officer kills a chicken as his colleagues stand by in a residential neighbourhood of Jiaxing, Zhejiang province . A group of city management force conducted a two-day campaign, capturing and slaughtering poultry raised in local residential areas of Jiaxing . A city management officer holds a chicken as a boy rides past in a residential neighbourhood yesterday . City management officers in the . Jiaxing area of Zhejiang province undertook a two day campaign which saw . chickens captured and reared in residential areas were captured and . killed to try and prevent the H7N9 virus from spreading. The . campaign came as a 74-year-old Shanghai man became the tenth person in . the country to die from the mutated form of the virus. Chinese researchers warned yesterday that the sudden emergence of this strain of flu 'may pose a serious human health risk' and said 'appropriate counter measures were urgently required.' Hong Kong authorities also announced plans to test all poultry brought in from the mainland. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has said that the cases of infection of the virus in China are the first in the world. The source of the virus has not yet been identified and the WHO say that there is no evidence as yet of human to human transmission. The organisation has called for good hygiene practices to be adhered to as a precaution. To date, China has seen 38 confirmed cases of the disease including cases in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai. Of those cases, 19 are said to be severe cases and nine are described as mild. More than 750 close contacts of those affected are currently undergoing tests for the virus. Urban management officers wear masks as they catch chickens close to a block of houses yesterday . Tourists wear masks as a precaution walk in Tiananmen Square . A group of scientists writing in the New England Journal of Medicine said the virus, which has been traced to a reassortment of genes from wild birds in east Asia and chickens in east China, 'raises many urgent questions and global public health concerns'. The reports chronicle the early days of an outbreak of a new influenza A virus, H7N9, never before been seen in humans. It has infected at least 40 people in four Chinese provinces and killed 11 in the past two months, Chinese authorities said. Scientists studied three patients included two men, ages 87 and 27, both from Shanghai, and a 35-year-old woman from Anhui. Dr. Timothy Uyeki and Dr. Nancy Cox, both of the influenza division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wrote: 'It is possible that these severely ill patients represent the tip of the iceberg.' They said it is particularly concerning because the virus has genetic characteristics that suggest that it might be better adapted than other bird flu strains to infect mammals -- including humans -- and people have no resistance to it. Because the virus doesn’t make birds sick, so it may spread widely and remain undetected until people become ill. A health worker sprays disinfectant at bird area of Shanghai Zoo . Health workers take a blood sample from a chicken in Hong Kong yesterday. Hong Kong is testing batches of chickens imported from mainland China . The latest victim was one of three new infection cases diagnosed in Shanghai according to Chinese news agency Xinhua. The other two new cases - an 83-year-old woman and a 68-year-old man - are said to be in a stable condition in hospital. Chinese authorities have been attempting to prevent the spread of the disease since it emerged in February. Hundreds of thousands of birds have been culled at bird farms and poultry markets across Shanghai and the Jiangsu province. Sales . of racing pigeons - a popular pastime in China - have also been banned. Almost two million carrier pigeons have also been grounded. The outbreak of the H7N9 virus has already affected business in China. Just yesterday, the owner of the Chinese arm of the fast food chain KFC reported that its profits had been hit by the virus. US scientists meanwhile have made a start on creating a vaccine for the new strain despite a sample from China only arriving yesterday. Government-backed researchers begun testing a 'seed' strain of the virus using a genetic code posted online. The new faster approach - born in the aftermath of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 - has seen weeks shaved off the vaccine making process. But it could still take five to six months before one is available. Robin Robinson, director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority or BARDA, said: 'We'll take it, if the virus turns out to be a tough one, that head start could be very important.' The Hong Kong government started enhanced measures to prevent a new strain of bird flu from entering the city . Officials from the Centre for Food Safety take chickens out from cages on a truck from mainland China at a border checkpoint in Hong Kong . As a test drive for the new flu . technology, in 2011 the government gave its partners the genetic . sequence for a North American strain of H7N9, a similar virus to the one . making people sick in China. In less than two weeks, scientists were ready to make virus seed. The next year, they sequenced an H5N1 virus and produced a synthetic virus in six days. Then came a live test. The United . States asked its partners to make a real vaccine for a variant of swine . flu known as H3N2 that had been infecting children in the U.S. Midwest . last year. Once again, they produced virus seed in less than a week. So, when Chinese health authorities . released the genetic sequence for the H7N9 bird flu on March 30, U.S. health officials decided to try the new technique. Novartis and Venter's company, . Synthetic Genomics Vaccines Inc, went to work and by April 4, they had . synthetic DNA ready and had started to grow the virus in cells, long . before samples of the actual virus arrived from China yesterday. PETA has called for British authorities to ban cross-Channel pigeon racing because of the new strain of bird flu. A chicken is seen inside a cage on a truck from mainland China at a border checkpoint in Hong Kong . The animal rights group has been monitoring the outbreak in China and has warned that an epidemic could spread to Britain. They are concerned pigeons released from France and Spain may have been exposed to diseases if they land on foreign farms, drank contaminated water or have come into contact with other infected birds. Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi, of PETA UK, said: 'Aside from risking the pigeons' lives pigeon fanciers may be putting human health at risk by taking British pigeons across the Channel.' 'We hope the government will take action now rather than wait and see if people get sick.' The release of pigeons from international locations is subject to compliance with import rules set out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). However, PETA  claim a recent undercover investigation has revealed widespread non-compliance with these requirements. A spokesperson said: 'Thousands of pigeons are crammed into filthy, congested cages and transported to and from continental Europe for up to seven days. 'They are then released to return to Britain without the required checks and certification, in apparent violation of UK law.' Bird flu is caused by a flu virus that is closely related to human flu viruses. It is spread through bird droppings, water, feed and equipment. As of January 2012 the WHO has confirmed there have been 583 cases of H5N1 in humans leading to 344 deaths. These have occurred in Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Djibouti, Egypt, Indonesia, Iraq, Laos, Myanmar, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam.","Officials in an area of Zhejiang province have begun culling chickens .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Eileen Metcalfe claimed David Hughes - who died suddenly aged 26 in 2009 - was behind the wheel of her car when she was caught doing 36mph in a 30 zone . A grandmother attempted to get out of a speeding ticket by claiming a dead man had been behind the wheel. Eileen Metcalfe, 55, from Hartlepool, County Durham, was caught driving 36mph in a 30mph zone near to her home in May last year. The grandmother, who already had nine points on her licence, claimed David Hughes - who died suddenly aged 26 in 2009 - was behind the wheel at the time. Correspondence was sent to Mr Hughes - but was then returned by the new tenant of his former home. Following an inquiry, it was discovered the information submitted by Metcalfe could not be true and bought her in for questioning. There, Metcalfe told probation workers she thought Mr Hughes' family would 'find it funny', Teesside Crown Court heard. She later claimed she was filling in the . speeding form at the same time as ordering a commemorative urn for Mr . Hughes and got mixed up. Metcalfe was due to deny the charge of perverting the course of justice and was facing a trial last month when she changed her plea. The judge, Recorder Graeme Cook, gave . the grandmother an indication last month that she would not be locked up . if she pleaded guilty. However, Metcalfe was given an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, with supervision. After reading a report from . the Probation Service following an interview they had with her, he said . he felt like changing his mind. During the session, Metcalfe showed no remorse, had no understanding how her crime had caused heartache, and found it humorous. The judge said: 'I believe you deliberately went out to avoid any points on your licence. 'Your explanation, which I saw in your defence statement, I find that nonsensical, and I do not accept it for one second. 'The . person whose details you gave had been dead for some four years. One . can only imagine what the family of Mr Hughes went through. Teeside Crown Court (pictured) heard how the grandmother claimed she'd accidentally entered Mr Hughes's name into speeding forms as she was ordering a commemorative urn for him at the same time . 'Had I known a lot of this from the pre-sentence report about you, I may well have had a different view about immediate custody. 'You . seem to have a total lack of conscience, a total lack of regard for the . offending you carried out and the effect it might have on the . deceased's family, and you say they might have found it funny.' Ian Mullarkey, mitigating, told the court Metcalfe had 'a number of challenges' and is the carer for two of her 11 grandchildren. After the hearing,Metcalfe still maintained it had been a mix-up. 'I had a form for the urn and the speeding form on the table, it's a madhouse in here at times, and I put the wrong name in,' she said. After the case, Mr Hughes's distraught mother, Evelyn, said: 'I can't believe she could do this - how she could be so cruel.' 'It's devastating, . it's disgusting, more so because she was a friend of David's. I don't . know how she thought we'd find it funny.'","Eileen Metcalfe, 55, caught doing 36mph in a 30 zone in Hartlepool .

"By . Ian Drury . The number of concerned holidaymakers paying to fast-track their passport application has surged because of the backlog crisis. Thousands upgraded to the £128 premium four-hour service, fearing their passports would not arrive in time for their holiday. There were just six upgrades in January, before the Mail exposed the chaos at UK passport offices, which saw staff struggling to cope with a surge in passport applications. Delays: As a result of the backlog, revealed by the Mail, thousands upgraded to the £128 premium four-hour service, fearing their passports would not arrive in time for their holiday . But in the three months to May, 2,137 people paid for the upgrade, with 1,024 in May alone – a 170-fold increase. A standard passport costs £72.50, meaning the Passport Office has made an extra £55.50 for each person who upgraded. Passport Office chief executive Paul Pugh has admitted the agency is set to make £50million in profit this year. Shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: ‘The Government needs to sort out this mess. ‘It is just plain wrong the Government expects to pocket an extra £50million this year from the Passport Office ... and [it] needs to reimburse people for the upgrade charges they were forced to pay just to get a basic service.’ But passports minister James Brokenshire said: ‘There are no plans to reimburse customers who choose to use the four-hour premium service.’ Lucrative: Despite the problems, the Passport Office is set to make £50 million in profit this year .","Many upgraded to the £128 premium service assuring they would arrive .
