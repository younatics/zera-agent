"Prosecutors have agreed a secret plea deal with a babysitter who admitted killing a three-year-old child after the toddler refused to take off her coat. Iowa's Attorney General's Office and the Sioux County attorney agreed the deal with Rochelle Sapp, 34, of Orange City who killed Autumn Elgersma in October 2013. Judge Edward Jacobson agreed to a request by the attorney general to seal details of the plea agreement until Sapp is sentenced on Thursday. Rochelle Sapp, left, will be sentenced on Thursday after she agreed a plea deal with prosecutors following the death of three-year-old Autumn Elgersma, right, who died after Sapp threw the toddler against the floor . Sapp was charged with the first-degree murder of the toddler after investigators discovered she slammed the three-year-old girl into the floor causing significant head injuries. Autumn died two days after the incident. Sapp’s charged with first-degree murder in the October 2013 death of three-year-old Autumn Elgersma. Investigators say she slammed the toddler to the floor, causing head injuries that killed her days later. The incident happened at Sapp's home in eastern Orange City where she ran a daycare centre. Sapp initially told police that Autumn had falled down some stairs and banged her head, but later admitted to throwing her against the ground after the little girl 'refused to take her coat off'. Sapp rang Autumn's mother who came immediately and took the child to hospital. The girl was airlifted to the Sanford Children's Hospital in Sioux Falls in North Dakota where doctors discovered the child suffered a fractured skull and brain trauma. Autumn received the fatal injuries while staying in Sapp's home in Orange City, Iowa, pictured . Sapp had initially been charged with Willful Injury and Child Endangerment Resulting in Serious Bodily Injury. Sioux County Attorney Coleman McAllister said: 'In this case the initial charges were based on the medical evidence and opinion available to the state at that time. 'Upon Autumn's death, the circumstances changed. 'The medical examiner's office in Des Moines took time to make sure they did a thorough and complete examination and we like everybody else was waiting for them to render an opinion for us to evaluate so we could move forward with charges.' Devastated parents Philip and Jennifer Elgersma dropped their child at daycare on the morning she was killed .","Rochelle Sapp threw Autumn Elgersma against the floor in her home in 2013 .

"A long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece that the Renaissance master had with him when he died has been discovered in a private collection, a leading expert on the artist has claimed. Mary Magdalen in Ecstasy has been copied at least eight times since its completion in 1606, shortly after the baroque master escaped from Rome following his conviction for murder. But Caravaggio scholar, Mina Gregori, said she was certain she had found the original after studying the variations in light and colour on Mary's hands and face. Caravaggio's 1606 masterpiece, Mary Magdalen in Ecstasy, is believed to have been discovered in a private collection in Europe, an expert has claimed . The discovery of a handwritten note attached to the back of the painting, attributing it to Caravaggio, was further proof. She told The Telegraph: 'It's magnificent. I knew it right away as soon as I saw it,' 'I had an immediate, instinctive reaction. They laid it down on the floor, I got down on my knees, and when I saw her hands, I said, 'yes, that's it. It's her.' The emeritus professor at the University of Florence said key characteristics of the painting left no doubts in her mind regarding its provenance. 'The creation of a body with varying tones, the intensity of the face. The strong wrists, crossed fingers and beautiful hair... the wonderful variations in light and colour - all show that it is Caravaggio,' she said. Caravaggio (left), portrait by Ottavio Leoni, was a prolific painter and his early work included 'Boy with a Basket of Fruit' (right), 'The Young Bacchus' and 'The Music Party' Caravaggio scholar, Mina Gregori, said she was certain she had found the original after studying the variations in light and colour  seen in his other works, such as St Jerome (pictured) Other important clues were the Vatican customs stamp on the canvas that was only used in the 17th century and the note which said: 'the reclined Magdalene of Caravaggio'. Professor Gregori did not name the owners of the 100cm by 90cm canvas, saying they did not want publicity. 'I don't know if they will exhibit it,' she said. 'I think they will keep it in their home and enjoy it. After all, if it is sitting in a bank somewhere, no one gets to enjoy it.' She called the find a 'marvellous addition' to the art world and said gazing upon  the original was a career highlight. David with Head of Goliath, 1607, is one of Caravaggio's best-known paintings and exemplifies his fiery style . The existence of a version known as the 'Klein Magdalena' in Rome, which some experts have described as authentic, is likely to spark further controversy. Ms Gregori told The Independent she was pressing the owners of the version she authenticated to make it available for some sort of public display. 'Even by Caravaggio's standards this is a beautiful and revolutionary painting,' she said. 'The ultimate goal is that everyone should have the opportunity to see it. But for now all I can say is that it's in Europe.' John Gash, a senior lecturer on art history at the University of Aberdeen, who is also an expert on the Italian painter, suggested exercising extreme caution. Caravaggio's violence finally erupted with force in 1606, when he killed a well-known Roman pimp named Ranuccio Tomassoni, pictured is one segment from artist's Seven Works of Mercy . Michelangelo Merisi de Caravaggio is believed to have had his Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy with him when he died in 1610, pictured is another segment from his Seven Works of Mercy . 'There are many versions of a presumed lost original of this subject by Caravaggio, none of which so far qualify as autograph,' he wrote in an email. 'This might be it, but without seeing the original painting, I would suggest extreme caution.' The painting refers to the legend in which Mary of Magdala moved to southern France, where she lived as a hermit in a cave at Sainte-Baume near Aix-en-Provence. There she was transported seven times a day by angels into the presence of God, 'where she heard, with her bodily ears, the delightful harmonies of the celestial choirs'. Michelangelo Merisi de Caravaggio is believed to have had his Mary Magdalene in Ecstasy with him in the Tuscan town of Porto Ercole where he died in 1610. The painting is thought to have been subsequently transported to Naples, where a Flemish artist, Louis Finson, made a copy of it which is now in the French city of Marseille. The Martyrdom of St Matthew, by Michelangelo Merisi known as Caravaggio, thought to have been painted around 1599 . Italian artist Caravaggio was born Michelangelo Merisi in Milan around 1571. He was orphaned at the age 11 and trained as a painter under Simone Peterzano who had been taught by Titian. In his twenties Caravaggio moved to Rome and his work became popular for the tenebrism technique he used, which used shadow to emphasise lighter areas. He was awarded the commission for the decoration of the Contarelli Chapel in the Church of San Luigi dei Francesi in 1597. It was an important and daunting assignment, charging the 26-year-old painter with the task of creating three large paintings depicting separate scenes from St. Matthew's life. After this he never lacked commissions or patrons, but he became increasingly unstable. He was jailed on several occasions, vandalised his own apartment, and ultimately had a death warrant issued for him by the Pope. A prolific painter, Caravaggio was known to work quickly, often starting and completing a painting in just two weeks. By the time he had come under the influence of del Monte, Caravaggio already had 40 works to his name, including 'Boy with a Basket of Fruit', 'The Young Bacchus' and 'The Music Party'. His fiery masterpieces, 'The Death of the Virgin' and 'David with the Head of Goliath', inspired a generation of artists. Caravaggio's violence finally erupted with force in 1606, when he killed a well-known Roman pimp named Ranuccio Tomassoni. He was thought to have painted the Magdalen in 1606, shortly after fleeing Rome following his conviction for murder. It was during his return to the city in search of a papal pardon, carrying with him the painting, that he was believed to have become ill with fever, and died in Tuscany in 1610.","Caravaggio's Mary Magdalen in Ecstasy is believed to have been discovered .

"More than a million workers got a pay rise today – after the minimum wage was increased by 19p £6.50 an hour. It means those on the lowest legal wage are set to see their pay rise by as much as £355 a year. Today’s pay rise it the first real terms cash increase since 2008, following recommendations from the Low Pay Commission which sets the rate. More than a millions workers will today see their pay increase by 19p to £6.50 an hour - a £355 boost over the year . It comes amid growing political concern over Britain’s army of low-paid workers with both Labour and the Tories setting out plans to increase low wages. Ed Miliband last week promised to increase the minimum wage to £8 an hour by 2019. Chancellor George Osborne said he wanted the legal minimum to increase to £7. The number of people on the National Minimum Wage has doubled since it was introduced 15 years ago and is now the pay rate for one in 20 workers, according to the think-tank the Resolution Foundation. Around 1.2 million employees earn the legal minimum wage compared with just over 600,000 in 1999. A further 1.3m workers are clustered close to the minimum wage - earning within 50p of the minimum level. It means one in ten workers are poorly paid. Despite the 3 per cent increase today, years of below-inflation increases mean it really worth the same level as it was in 2005. The minimum wage level was also increased for workers under 21 and apprentices. Those aged between 18 and 20 can no longer be paid less than £.5.13 – an increase from £5.03. Business Secretary Vince Cable has called for the minimum wage to increased at a faster rate . The minimum wage level for 16 and 17-year-olds, meanwhile, has increased from £3.72 to £3.79 per hour, while the apprentice rate is up 5p to £2.73 per hour. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: ‘The National Minimum Wage provides a vital safety net for the lowest paid, ensuring they get a fair wage whilst not costing jobs. This year’s rise will mean that they will enjoy the biggest cash increase in their take home pay since the banking crisis, benefiting over one million people in total. ‘I believe it is vital that the Low Pay Commission’s recommendations - not political considerations - should set national minimum wage rates. ‘As signs of a stronger economy start to emerge, we need to do more to make sure that the benefits of growth are shared fairly across the board. The Low Pay Commission will continue to advise Government on future wage rises and ensure the minimum wage keeps pace with inflation’. Earlier this year the Business Secretary asked the low pay commission to look at ways to increase the minimum wage more quickly than it has done previously. Chuka Umunna, Labour’s Shadow Business Secretary, said today’s wage increase was ‘welcome’ but said: ‘We must go further.’ Mr Umunna said: ‘Labour has announced plans which will see a minimum wage of £8 in the next Parliament by setting a more ambitious target to ensure a fair day’s pay, alongside tougher enforcement action. ‘The Tory-led government has failed to match our plans to make work pay again and boost living standards. And to add insult to injury, George Osborne misled working people by claiming he wanted to see a £7 minimum wage then failing to deliver or set out plans for reaching this figure.’","Today's rise is first real terms increase to the minimum wage since 2008 .

'He's very depressed, very scared, and ... concerned that he's not going to get out,' Mr Carter said. 'He's pretty much lost all hope.' Mr Carter maintains that his son's comment was a joke - albeit a poorly-timed, terrible joke.

"A group of suspected illegal immigrants have been arrested after arriving into Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry which was carrying a dozen luxury jet skis worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. The stowaways, who are aged 33 and 22 and are believed to be Albanian nationals, hid in the back of the truck containing 12 jet skis worth £15,000 each as it made its way from Ibiza to the UK. It is understood the three men hid in the back of the 44ft lorry after climbing into it during the ferry crossing from Spain to Portsmouth Harbour. Scroll down for video . Three illegal immigrants have been found on board a lorry carrying jet skis from Ibiza to the UK . Police were called to Watercraft World in Fareham, Hampshire, after workers spotted the men in the lorry as they unloaded the luxury jet skis. It is thought they climbed onto the lorry during the ferry crossing from Spain . Staff at Watercraft World in Fareham, Hampshire, only discovered the men, who were in good health, as they began unloading the luxury jet skis at the depot on Friday. They alerted police who arrived soon after in three police cars and two vans to take the men away. Nigel Kershaw, who runs Watercraft World, said the men carried Albanian passports, driving licences and £2,000 in cash. He said: 'At first I thought it was one of our guys and then another head appeared and we panicked. 'All we could do was surround the vehicle and tell them to stay where they were until the police arrived. 'I think everyone here is a bit shocked. It's one of those situations you see on the news as you see what's going on in Calais and other places. 'It doesn't seem real until a day like this and it's a big wake-up call for us all. 'I felt desperately sorry for the lorry drivers. With everything going on on the continent they are so aware of the issues. 'When they arrived in Spain from Ibiza they drove straight to Bilbao, not even stopping for coffee, so there was never any chance of having people climb in.' The men were detained  after the lorry parked in Fareham having crossed from Spain to Portsmouth Harbour . The jet skis  were being transported from Ibiza where they were being used by riders at a water sports festival . He also urged authorities to tighten up controls, adding: 'I know they are up against it and immigration is on a huge scale but the whole thing needs looking at.' The jet skis - all privately owned - were being transported from Ibiza where they were being used by riders at the Jet Bou Ibiza water sports festival. The watercraft arrived in Bilbao following a 400-mile overland trip from Valencia where they had travelled from the island by another boat. It is thought the men managed to gain access to the back of the lorry from another vehicle on the way over from Spain and had been travelling for up to three days. Paul Hughes, director of festival organisers Xtreme Action, which organised the shipment of the jet skis, said: 'I don't know why they weren't picked up but they should have more cameras on lorries going through.' He stressed the watercraft were undamaged during the incident and said he was working to book more secure trailers for next year's trip. A Portsmouth Harbour spokesman refused to comment and said the UK Border Force is responsible for checking vehicles entering the port. A UK Border Force spokesman said: 'We work closely with the police to tackle illegal immigration and continue to strengthen the security of our border to stop those who have no right to enter the UK.' The discovery comes just days after UK Border Force officials started tightening controls on vessels sailing from West Africa amid the Ebola crisis. Police were called to the M20 in Kent after four suspected  illegal immigrants were seen sitting on top of a lorry . The men found on the M20 in Kent were detained by police before being handed over to immigration authorities . It is the latest in a string of similar incidents, where suspected illegal immigrants have tried to gain access to Britain by hiding in the back of a lorry. Yesterday, four men suspected of being illegal immigrants were detained after reportedly hanging on to the top of a lorry as it drove along the London-bound carriageway of the M20 in Kent. It is understood the driver pulled over after seeing an arm hanging down from the roof of his lorry as he drove along the motorway. Police were notified and the lorry parked up on the hard shoulder to await their arrival. Last month, 13 suspected illegal immigrants, believed to be from Ethiopia, were detained after being spotted running from the back of a lorry on between junctions 12 and 13 of the M25. And just four days earlier, a man was arrested for alleged 'facilitation offences' after 24 Eritrean nationals were discovered in the rear of an HGV in Whitfield, near Dover, Kent. The latest discovery comes just days after riot police were called to the French port of Calais as more than 400 immigrants tried to storm lorries bound for the UK. French police used tear gas and batons to disperse the crowd but chiefs admitted some illegal immigrants may have got onto lorries during the disturbance.

'If people have a genuine need of protection they should claim asylum in the first safe country they reach. 'If they are just seeking to evade immigration control they need to know that they are risking their lives and that they will get caught.

"Rape charges against former AFL footballer Stephen Milne have been dropped and he has pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of indecent assault. The former St Kilda player was facing three charges of raping a 19-year-old woman at a teammate's house after a drunken night out in 2004. The 34-year-old was scheduled to face a 10-day trial in the Victorian County Court later this month. Milne pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting the woman in a darkened room, with former teammate Leigh Montagna and another woman nearby. Scroll down for video . Stephen Milne, who was joined in court with his wife Melissa, was cleared of three rape charges . Prosecutor Mark Rochford SC said the victim believed Milne was Mr Montagna. 'The accused was reckless as to whether the complainant was consenting or not to the relevant act,' he told the court. Milne arrived at court on Thursday with his wife Melissa. He was also supported in court by St Kilda captain Nick Riewoldt and recently retired Saints midfielder Lenny Hayes. Milne pleaded guilty to the charge after the Office of Public Prosecution dropped the three rape charges. Mr Rochford said the maximum penalty for indecent assault was 10 years' jail. 'All sentencing options are open,' he said. Milne's barrister Philip Dunn QC asked Judge Michael Bourke to hand Milne a fine without conviction. Milne was also supported in court by former Saints teammates Nick Riewoldt and Lenny Hayes . Milne retired last year after playing more than 250 game for St Kilda . He said the offence was more than 10 years old and Milne had not offended since. Mr Dunn described the offending as 'unplanned, spontaneous and momentary'. He said it occurred in the context of alcohol consumption and in a dark room. But Mr Dunn acknowledged Milne had offended after the victim had been clear in saying 'no'.

"Sales of homes worth £1million or more have soared to a record high, with more sold in one English town than the whole of Scotland. There were 6,143 £1million-plus house sales in Britain in the first half of 2014 – an incredible 33 a day or more than one an hour. It is a huge increase on five years ago when there were 1,382 in the first half of 2009. More £1million-plus homes were sold in St Albans, Hertfordshire (pictured) in the first half of this year than in the whole of Scotland, figures show . Seven out of 10 of the recent seven-figure deals were in London while another 16 per cent were in the affluent South East of England, according to the figures published today. Some 66 £1million-plus homes exchanged hands in St Albans in Hertfordshire in the first half of 2014 compared with 43 in the whole of Scotland. The report from Lloyds Bank shows there were 46 per cent more homes sold for at least £1million in the first half of 2014 than in the same period last year. There were 772 houses sold for £1million or more in Kensington and Chelsea in the half-year and another 633 in Westminster. In contrast, there were seven sold in Wales, 15 in the North East, 21 in Yorkshire and The Humber, 36 in the East Midlands and 43 in Scotland. Outside southern England, Cheshire East – which includes the market towns of Nantwich, Knutsford and Sandbach – and Edinburgh were hotspots, with 31 and 20 £1million-plus sales respectively. Sarah Deaves, director of private banking at Lloyds, said: ‘Property values in prime locations have been boosted by growing demand from wealthy, and often cash-rich buyers from the UK and overseas, as well as limited supply of such properties. ‘Although demand has grown across all regions of Britain in 2014, the greatest concentration is in London, particularly the boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster.’ There were 6,143 £1million-plus house sales in Britain in the first half of 2014, compared with the first half of 2009 when it was 1,382 . It marks a stunning turnaround from the depths of the financial crisis and recession. The number of million pound house sales slumped to 1,382 in the first half of 2009 – the lowest point in the past decade. But there are signs that the housing market is cooling, however. A report by Nationwide yesterday showed the average house price in the UK rose by 0.5 per cent in October to £189,333. The annual rate of house price inflation fell for a second month running, from 9.4 per cent in September to 9 per cent in October. But there are signs that the housing market is cooling, according to Nationwide . The report came a day after figures from the Bank of England showed mortgage lending has tumbled to its lowest level for 14 months and is down 20 per cent since January. ‘The annual pace of house price growth continued to moderate in October,’ said a Nationwide spokesman. ‘The market has lost momentum. Activity may soften further in the near term, especially in London.’ Meanwhile, the number of house-hunters in the UK has hit a 10-year high as people rush to take advantage of the ‘mortgage war’ between lenders, new figures show. Rock-bottom interest rates on mortgages has sparked a stampede of buyers hoping to buy a home before the offers disappear, according to The National Association of Estate Agents. Estate agents reported that an average of 406 house hunters had visited their branches in September – the highest monthly record since October 2004, when it hit 511 prospective buyers. It follows a campaign by lenders to attract business, with many slashing rates in recent weeks. HSBC cut its cheapest deal to a record low of 0.99 per cent this month, while rivals including Leeds Building Society, Halifax and Nationwide also cut their rates. Banks and building societies had raised their rates over the summer in anticipation that interest rates were about to rise. But the Bank of England indicated more recently that subdued wage growth meant it was unlikely the base rate would rise from its historic low of 0.5 per cent before the general election in May. Lenders responded by slashing their mortgage rates in a bid to attract customers and return to business as usual after months of financial uncertainty. A separate report yesterday suggested that tougher mortgage lending rules could be deterring those on smaller salaries from stepping on to the property ladder. According to new data, the average combined salary of people searching for mortgages on price comparison and broker sites has risen by £10,000 in a year to £56,000. The Mortgage Advice Bureau, a broker which collate 250,000 monthly online searches, the average combined salary of applicants was up by a fifth on the year, rising from £46,905 to £56,559 between July and September 2014.

"Police are blasting five people a day with 50,000-volt Taser guns as use of the controversial weapons has soared. New figures show the stun-guns – which deliver a powerful electric shock to incapacitate the target – were drawn, aimed or fired a record number of times in the last year. Home Office data showed Tasers were used 10,488 times in the 12 months to the end of June – a 13 per cent increase compared with the 9,289 on the previous year. Police have blasted five people a day with controversial 50,000 volt Taser guns, new figures have revealed . Over that period, police zapped 1693 people with Tasers – equivalent to shooting five people every day. A detailed breakdown shows that between January and June this year, 826 people were shot with the supposedly non-lethal weapons. Police used Tasers on 5,107 occasions over the six-month span. This was up one-third – 32 per cent – on the same period in 2012 and use has quadrupled since they were initially deployed 1,267 times in the first half of 2009. Senior officers insist Tasers are used as a weapon of last resort, when there is such a severe threat of violence that force is needed to protect the public, police or a culprit. But critics have accused the police of using them as a ‘compliance tool’ – and claim this is proved by the relentless rise in their use. Concern is mounting that ten people have died after being Tasered since the controversial guns were introduced a decade ago. Last week the Mail told how five police officers involved in an incident in which an innocent man was shot dead with a Taser have demanded their identities are kept secret at his inquest. Ice cream factory worker Jordan Begley, 23, from Gorton, Manchester, had a suspected heart attack after being hit with the stun gun outside his terraced house after a disturbance with his neighbours in July last year. An unknown man being Tasered and then arrested by officers in Upper Parliament Street, in Nottingham . In March, a policeman was ordered to apologise to a blind man after he shot him with a Taser in Chorley, Lancashire, in 2012. The officer said he thought the victim’s white stick was a samurai sword. And the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating the use of the stun guns on three boys with severe learning difficulties, aged 14 and 15, after reports of a violent incident at a school near Plymouth last year. The IPCC has admitted it has ‘serious reservations’ about when officers are using the weapons. Complaints from the public have soared amid suspicion the police are often using Tasers without proper justification. Jordan Begley, 23, from Gorton, Manchester, had a suspected heart attack after being hit with the stun gun outside his terraced house after a disturbance with his neighbours in July last year . A Taser is recorded as ‘used’ when an officer draws it from its holster. In the first six months of the year, Tasers were used in their ‘red dot’ mode –when a laser beam illuminated a target – on 2,636 occasions, or 52 per cent. Tasers were also used to stun a target – like an electric cattle prod – on 123 occasions in England and Wales. Oliver Sprague, of Amnesty International UK, said: ‘What these figures don’t tell you is when and why police officers have drawn these highly dangerous electro-shock weapons more than 10,000 times in the past 12 months. ‘We’re not against Tasers if used by specially-trained police officers trying to prevent a death or a serious injury, but we simply don’t know the circumstances in which people are being fired at with these potentially lethal weapons.’ A police officer demonstrates how to use a taser gun - the  weapon was used on 1.693 people in 12 months . But Commander Neil Basu, the Taser spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: ‘Officers who are selected to carry Taser have a proven track record of policing. ‘Taser is not a panacea to all occasions when police officers need to use force and will only be used in situations where officers face violence or the threat of violence. Tasers were introduced to give officers an option between firearms and other weapons such as batons and CS gas. They have been discharged in more than 6,200 confrontations across England and Wales since they were introduced in 2004. Police use a U.S. manufactured £500 X26 model which fires a 50,000-volt charge into the victim via two barbs attached to thin metal wiresIt has a range of 21ft and causes muscles to twitch uncontrollably. ‘While this is a vital weapon for police to have at their disposal for incidents which pose a risk to the public, police or the alleged perpetrator, it is not something that we use lightly and the incidence of a full discharge remains very low.’ He said Tasers were used on fewer than one per cent of those arrested. ACPO said Tasers posed ‘significantly less risk’ than other methods used by the police such as metal batons, police dogs or CS spray. Police say the rise in the use of Tasers mirrors the increase in the number of the weapons available to forces – more than 5,500 – and more trained officers. But the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has fuelled alarm by suggesting every single policeman or woman, around 130,000, should have a Taser.","Home Office data showed Tasers were  used 10,488 times in 12 months .

"An inspirational seven-year-old has overcome having both of her legs amputated by learning to skateboard and has even mastered skating tricks. Rosie Davies was born with Spinal Segmental Dysgenesis (SSD), a life-threatening spinal condition, which meant her legs had been stuck in a cross-legged position. The rare condition meant that her vital organs, including her kidneys, were being slowly crushed and that a double amputation was her only option. Scroll down for video . Seven-year-old Rosie Davies, who despite having to have both legs amputated, has learned how to skateboard . Rosie with her mother Mandy Collett. Ms Collett says her daughter has learned to push herself along and has even mastered tricks . Rosie was born with Spinal Segemental Dygenesis, which meant she had to have both of her legs amputated . Rosie, of Walsall in the West Midlands, underwent pioneering surgery lasting 13 hours two years ago, which resulted in both of her legs being removed. But despite the operation, which took place at the Royal Orthopedic Hospital in Birmingham, the seven-year-old has learned to skateboard, mastering tricks. Proud mother Mandy Collett said: 'Since the surgery, Rosie has changed dramatically. 'She can now stand up on her skateboard, pushing herself along, and even does tricks. Rosie pictured shortly after having her legs amputated at the Royal Orthopedic Hospital in Birmingham . During the surgery both of her legs were removed and a section of bone was then used to help bridge the gap in her spine . 'I called her my little Buddha because of the way her legs were. 'When she was born I was told she would be stick on a bean bag all her life, but she has proved everyone wrong.' Spinal Segemental Dysgenesis is a rare developmental malformation, which occurs duirng pregnancy or at birth. It causes a malformation in the spinal cord and can be discovered during pre-natal screening. Babies who are born with the condition like Rosie usually have a gap in their backbone, causing mobility problems. In Rosie's case the gap in her spine meant her legs were contorted up against her stomach and she was running out of space in her chest. Without the surgery, her internal organs would have been crushed which could have proved fatal. After being diagnosed with SSD, doctors discovered that five of the bones that make up part of the spine were missing, causing a 10cm gap in her backbone. During the operation, which has only been carried out on three people worldwide, Rosie's legs were amputated below the knee. A section of bone was then taken to bridge the gap in her spine and two metal rods were then bolted to the upper spine and the hips to provide extra support. Ms Collett, 47, added: 'The doctors are really pleased with Rosie's progress. 'They were worried her back wouldn't be strong enough, but it is better than it was before. 'At the moment they don't think her hips would be strong enough for her to have prosthetic limbs. 'But she doesn't let anything stop her and her amazing upper body strength has come from her doing the things she wants to do with her skateboard. 'She's taught herself to walk on her hands and do cartwheels.' On top of her skateboarding, active Rosie is keen on football and volleyball, and her family is hoping to raise £1000 for a specialised bike. Her mother explained: 'What she really wants now is a bike for Christmas, but it has to be specially made for her. When Rosie was born, her condition meant that her legs were stuck in the crossed-leg position . Her mother Mandy says that due to the way her legs were, she nicknamed her 'My little Buddha' 'It would be one where she can use her hands to peddle, something like the Paralympians use.' Spine surgeon, David Marks, who performed the operation, said: ""Because of her rare condition, Rosie was only the third person in the world to have this type of operation and we are so pleased with how well she's doing. ""Rosie's always been a very cheerful and positive little girl and I know she has a bright and happy future ahead.""","Rosie Davies was born with the condition Spinal Segemental Dysgenesis .

"A killer cannibal who ate his victim alive went crazy after going on a massive drugs binge when released from prison it has emerged. Eye-witnesses claim that Matthew Williams, 34, took a huge cocktail of mind-bending drugs including miaow miaow just before the savage attack. Williams told friends he was hearing voices and hallucinating before attacking Cerys Yemm, 22, biting off parts of her face. Following Thursday's murder, the Ministry of Justice has announced that they will launch an investigation into the murder. Scroll down for video . Matthew Williams, right, injected himself with Miaow-Miaow before killing Cerys Yemm, left on Thursday . Williams had earlier complained of suffering hallucinations and seeing everything in negative due to his drugs binge before he invited Ms Yemm back to his room in the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in  Caerphilly, south Wales . Williams visited a house along with a friend and his victim where it is claimed he drank heavily, smoked cannabis and injected Mkat. Williams then started showing signs of psychotic behaviour saying everything looked like a negative photograph. But the man, a key police witness, has told investigating officers he had no reason to believe Williams would kill Ms Yemm in his room at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel in the village of Argoed, near Blackwood, South Wales. Williams had previous convictions for violence and drugs and Ms Yemm's heartbroken family are demanding to know why he wasn't being properly supervised. The key witness said: 'Williams had just met Cerys and we all went to a friend's house for the evening. Miss Yemm (pictured left with a friend) met her alleged killer just hours prior to the horrific incident yesterday . Ms Yemm (left) was described by neighbours 'as a lovely, smart and attractive girl from a very good family' The witness said: 'He had an ounce of miaow miaow on him and at some stage during the night he injected himself. 'He was also taking large quantities of prescription beta blockers given to him to help overcome his drugs habit. 'He said they were given to him when he was released from prison a couple of weeks ago. 'He seemed ok but he said he'd been hearing voices and seeing things like they were in negative. 'We were in the house until 11.30 - Cerys was there the whole time but she wasn't involved in any of the drug taking. 'They left together and Williams said he would take her back to his hotel where he would call a taxi to get her home.' But Williams, who had convictions for violence, enticed her into his room at the nine-bedroomed hotel even though he was banned from having woman guests. Friends of the shopworker said she was chatted up in a pub by Williams before he invited her back to the hotel . Ms Yemm was heard screaming in the early hours and security staff at the hotel which operates as a bail hostel for offenders, burst into the room. They saw Williams eating her face in what was described as a 'Hannibal Lecter' style act of cannibalism and police were called. A lone woman police officer was yesterday hailed a heroine for stopping the cannibal killer by shooting him with a Taser. The female officer was first on the scene and found Williams crouched over Ms Yemm's bloodied body eating her face. She ordered him to step away from his victim - when he refused she discharged the high voltage stun gun bringing the attack to an end. Williams was arrested but died minutes later and his victim was also declared dead the the scene. The brave unnamed woman officer has been relived of her duties and is getting special counselling because of the scene she witnessed. A police insider said: 'She was the nearest officer to the crime scene when the 999 call came through. 'She was first on the scene and followed her training by warning the suspect her was about to be tasered. 'Other officers were there within minutes but she had to face an incredibly gruesome scene and then respond in a professional way. 'She is getting all the support she needs from the force.' A post-mortem is being carried out to discover if Williams died of the electric shock from the Taser or if there were other factors. Gwent Police have searched the house in Blackwood where Ms Yemm spent her final few hours before the attack. Miss Yemm, 22, nickamed 'Yummy Yemmy' (pictured left with two friends), worked as a shop assistant at Next . Williams had not been subject to a Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangement which is used to manage violent offenders when they are freed. He had previously been released from prison after serving half of his sentence but he was sent back to jail after breaching the conditions of his licence. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'If a further offence is committed within a 30 day period from the sentence end date, a serious further offence review will take place.' Gwent Police are currently conducting a murder investigation while the Independent Police Complaints Commission are probing Williams death. Post-mortems are currently being carried out on Williams and his victim in order to determine how they died. Miss Yemm's family were grieving at the family home today (pictured) following the horrific attack . Friends in the nearby town of Blackwood said Williams was a known drug user and often injected drugs after drinking excessive alcohol and taking pills. He had been living at the Sirhowy Arms Hotel serves as a temporary home for offenders who have recently been released from prison. Gwent AM William Graham said: 'Reports around the recent release of Williams from prison - and an apparent lack of monitoring - are hugely worrying. 'If true, a wider inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his release is urgently required. 'It is now clear that Mr Williams posed a risk to the public and I am extremely concerned that monitoring appears to have been deemed unnecessary. 'Questions must be answered by authorities and a full explanation provided on the decisions taken in this extremely tragic case."" Ms Yemm was a student at Coleg Gwent between 2008 and April 2009, studying a First Diploma in health and social care, and staff were saddened to hear the news of her death. Principal Jim Bennett said: 'Cerys left the college five years ago. It is always an extremely upsetting experience to learn of the loss of a former student. We would like to send our deepest sympathy and condolences to Cerys' family, friends and loved ones.' She used to work at father Dean's pub in Abercarn, the New Inn and then worked at the Next clothing store in Newport Retail Park where she was described as 'a very popular member of her team'. Shelly Davies, a friend of Miss Yemm, said: 'I just keep thinking of how frightening and painful it would have been for her . 'I feel sick to my stomach, it's horrific to think that one person can inflict some much brutality onto another. 'I had bad dreams all night and I feel exhausted.' Another friend, Kathy Young, said: 'My thoughts are with her family. 'No one should have to go through this, this is horror movie stuff. Not happening in your hometown.' Miss Yemm had been a pupil at Oakdale Comprehensive School and had studied Health and Social Care at Crosskeys College. One businessman in the former mining village of Oakdale said: 'Everyone here knew Cerys - we watched her growing up. 'She was a lovely girl, smart, attractive and brought up by a very good family who she was extremely close to. 'They're nice people - they must be going through hell.' A neighbour added: 'I can't bring myself to think about what happened to her, she was so nice, she would always say hello.' Miss Yemm had seen her own former boyfriend Mathew Hayman jailed after breaking up with him in October last year. Hayman, then 27, tried to kill himself after they split by setting his house on fire. He lit up his bathroom before turning on the gas cooker - and it was 'pure chance' his house in Abertillery did not explode. Hayman admitted arson when he appeared at Newport Crown Court and was jailed for three and a half years.","Matthew Williams, 34, was allegedly found eating his 22-year-old victim's face .

"A Polish veterinary student who stitched the words 'I Love You' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on Facebook to impress his girlfriend is under investigation by university staff. The fourth year student from the University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn - a city in north east Poland - is believed to have been involved an operation on the dog, before using a large number of unnecessary stitches to spell out a message to his girlfriend on the animal's stomach. The university opened an investigation into the incident after the student's friends reported him for 'grotesque' and 'unethical' behaviour. 'Grotesque': The Polish veterinary student stitched the words 'I Love You' onto the skin of a dog and then posted the image on Facebook in order to impress his girlfriend. He is under investigation by university staff . The student's message was written in English and required a large number of stitches - most of them totally unnecessary as the incision from the animal's operation was elsewhere on its stomach. Having carried out the grisly task, the student took photographs of his message before posting them on Facebook and tagging his girlfriend. Within minutes the couple's friends began criticising the photograph, branding the student unethical and describing the photograph as 'grotesque'. One person quick to come to his defence, however, was the student's girlfriend, who asked: 'What's so unethical about it? He's learnt to sew in order to help and is just showing his skill.' Anger: Within minutes of the student posting the message on Facebook, his friends began criticising the photograph - branding the young man unethical and describing the photograph as 'grotesque' Location: The University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn (pictured) is now investigating the incident .

"A British man could be facing a prison sentence after being charged over death of a newlywed friend on his honeymoon in a freak jet ski accident on the Greek island of Santorini . Pete Hudson, 27, was arrested as he tried to board a flight to Crete, where his friend Jeremy Hope had been taken after the jet ski crash. Mr Hope, 39, was fatally injured in the collision when he is believed to have been rammed by Hudson's jet ski just two days into his honeymoon. Hudson has been ordered to stand trial in Greece on charges of negligence leading to manslaughter - but the court allowed him to return to England on condition that he return for a formal hearing early next year. Jeremy Hope (right) is described as 'a lovely, generous man who was very much in love' with wife Sarah (left) Emmanuel Vasalakis, the harbour master of Santorini island, said Naxos prosecutor Mrs Ioanna Lampa cross-examined Pete Hudson this morning and then levelled 'preliminary charges' against him on two counts. The charges are for negligence leading to the death of Jeremy Hope and driving a jet ski without a permit. Although the death occurred on the highly popular island of Santorini, the trial is taking place on nearby Naxos island because it is the regional administrative and legal centre of the Cyclades group of Greek islands. Vasalakis said the charges against the Briton were 'preliminary' because the investigation has not yet been completed. The Greek rentals manager at Kamari resort where the jet skis were hired, George  Kostopoulos, was formally and fully charged on three counts. Firstly because one of the jet skis did not have a permit for use by tourists, secondly because he rented them to tourists who had no permits to drive jet skis, and thirdly because he did not notify police about the ultimately fatal crash. Estate agent Jeremy hope is understood to have been a partner at Saxon Kings, in Kingston-upon-Thames . Local Greek prosecutor Mrs. Ioanna Lampa ordered the two accused men to appear before a court of First Instance on Friday. It was this court which accepted their lawyer’s request to have a regular hearing before a Civil Court early next year, for the better preparation of their defence. The exact date of the trial has not yet been announced. The court said that Mr. Hudson was free to return to England without bail, pending the formal trial next year. Mr Hope is understood to have been a partner at Saxon Kings estate agency, in Kingston-upon-Thames, south London, where staff were too upset to speak. My Hope (right) had been married to new wife Sarah (left) just two days at the time of the accident . A friend has described him as 'a lovely, generous man who was very much in love'. A friend of Mr Hope, who works nearby the estate agency he is understood to co-own with his wife Sarah Greaves, said he was stunned at hearing news of his death. He said: 'He was a lovely fellow and Sarah's a beautiful lady. 'We're all really upset about it. 'They were just really lovely people. He was a hard worker, a gym fanatic, a sports fanatic. 'They were a good couple, great together, and they had everything to look forward to. Mr Hope was on his honeymoon on the island, having married just two days before he died . 'I'm only just coming to terms with it myself. Everyone at the estate agents are too upset to speak and we're the same. 'I used to see them (the couple) on a daily basis. 'We went to the opening of the estate agency two years ago. They were very generous people. 'He and Sarah were partners in the estate agency I believe. Jeremy Hope, 39, was on honeymoon on the Greek island of Santorini at the time of the accident . 'They had been together for years. They were very much in love. 'I was just staggered when I heard. He's a good guy and he will be badly missed. 'I know they were due to get married, but I don't know if they were on honeymoon. I was under the impression it was just a holiday.' Mr Hope is believed to have collided with another British jet skier - his friend Pete Hudson, 27, who had been a guest at his Greek island wedding on Monday. It is thought that Mr Hope went back to sunbathe with his new wife, Sarah, 30, after the crash on Kamari Beach. They are believed to have been staying at the four-star Antinea Hotel, a short walk from the beach. But paramedics decided to air lift Mr Hope to a hospital in Crete after suspecting he may have been bleeding internally. Mr Hope died on board the helicopter. A spokesman for the local Greek coastguard claimed the two men were seen 'showing off' before they crashed. Hudson detained at Athens International Airport, and was believed to have been attempting to fly to Crete. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We are aware of the death of a British National in Greece on 17th September. 'We are providing consular assistance to his family at this sad time. 'We are aware of the arrest of a British national in Greece and are providing consular assistance.' The island of Santorini in the southern Aegean Sea a popular destination for British holidaymakers, who are drawn to its historic towns, clear waters and black sand beaches. The accident occurred off the coast of the Greek island of Santorini which is popular with British tourists . Mr Hope was picked up by coast guard crews, who ordered an emergency airlift to hospital on the nearby island of Crete .

"Zeeyarat Khan, 27, has been jailed for 18 years after attacking colleague Samera Suleman, 32, because she rejected his advances . A Poundland worker who became 'obsessed' with his female colleague beat her with a claw hammer after she rejected him, leaving her with a brain injury. Zeeyarat Khan, 27, spoke of marrying co-worker Samera Suleman but when she turned him down, he threatened to kill her. Miss Suleman, 32, a single mother, tried to quit her job at a branch of Poundland in Birmingham, but as she went to hand in her notice, Khan launched an attack. Running out from behind his till, he grabbed a claw hammer from one of the selves, then used it to beat Miss Suleman in broad daylight. Birmingham Crown Court heard Khan struck her twice over the head before launching a 'determined and sustained' assault, witnessed by a mum with three young children. Miss Suleman was left with skull fractures, a brain injury and a fractured finger after the attack. Jailing Khan for 18 years, Judge James Burbidge QC told him: 'You wanted the relationship to be more permanent but she gently rebuffed you. 'You rushed out of the store and pursued her, attacking her in the most public of places. You rained blows on her fast and furious. 'She is very fortunate to have survived the brain injury but it will change her life for ever.' Khan, 27, of no fixed address, had previously admitted a charge of attempted murder. Miss Suleman, a teaching assistant, worked part-time at Poundland’s St Andrews Retail Park branch. Hugh O’Brien Quinn, prosecuting, told Birmingham Crown Court: 'Although they were friendly they seldom socialised outside work. 'It seems the defendant became obsessed with Miss Suleman. It became known among other staff he was attracted to her. 'He told Miss Suleman he had feelings for her and wanted to marry her. She told the defendant she did not have feelings for him.' Khan attacked Miss Suleman, a single mother, outside this branch of Poundland in Birmingham as she went to hand in her notice because he had threatened to kill her . The court heard she tried to avoid Khan as his mental health declined. But Mr O’Brien Quinn said the defendant repeatedly threatened to kill her. He lashed out when she arrived to hand in her notice on October 9 last year, leaving her with several skull fractures and a similar finger injury. Mr O’Brien Quinn said: 'He ran from his position at the till and selected a claw hammer from one of the aisles. He then ran after her.' Mr O’Brien Quinn said Khan was seen by police officers in Digbeth ten minutes later - still holding the bloodstained weapon. He said Miss Suleman had been severely affected by the attack and was still receiving counselling. Graham Henson, defending, said Khan felt he had been rebuffed and it had been an 'explosion' of spontaneous anger.","Zeeyarat Khan, 27, threatened to kill Samera Suleman after she rejected him .

"This is a mystery every bit as fiendish as any of those solved by the great detective himself, and it is baffling the ten million armchair sleuths who watch TV’s Sherlock. How did the world’s most famous private investigator fake his own death at the end of the last series? Now it seems that the case might have been solved by a rival master of deduction with a knack for explaining the seemingly impossible — fellow fictional sleuth Jonathan Creek. In the final episode of last year’s series of Sherlock, the world’s most famous detective had been lured to the roof of St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London by his arch-nemesis, the deranged Professor Moriarty. Sherlock . There he was told that several of his close friends would be assassinated if he failed to commit suicide. After issuing this warning, Moriarty shot himself in the mouth and appeared to die. Holmes then had a brief mobile phone conversation with Watson, before stepping off the building. Viewers saw Holmes fall several storeys, before lying in a bloodied heap on the pavement, with bloodtrickling from his head. As Watson rushed to the scene, he was . knocked over by a bicycle. By the time he arrived, the bloodied Holmes, . who seemed to have no pulse, was being whisked away by paramedics. Yet just a few scenes later, as Watson visits the grave of his best friend, viewers see that Holmes is in fact alive and well. So how did he do it? The question sparked months of frenzied speculation, across Twitter, Facebook, and the endless websites devoted to both the BBC show and author Arthur Conan Doyle’s original novels and short stories. The show’s creators have been tight-lipped as to how the death was faked, saying only that all will be revealed in the show’s third series, which airs later this year. But this week, as Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays the show’s protagonist, was seen filming the opening episode of the next series in Bristol, an intriguing new theory emerged. Actor Alan Davies, star of TV drama Jonathan Creek, in which a magician detective solves outlandish mysteries, claimed to have discovered that the makers of Sherlock had borrowed a plot twist from a ‘similar’ episode of his own show, aired more than a decade ago, ‘when someone jumped off the roof of a party’. Does his explanation stack up? Or are others more credible? Or did he he use... The Jonathan Creek theoryIn a 1998 episode of Jonathan Creek, The Problem At Gallows Gate, a man faked his own death by leaping from a second-floor balcony onto a grass-covered trapdoor, with a secret crash net hidden beneath. He was helped by an accomplice, who removed the trapdoor before he jumped, and then quickly replaced it. Onlookers, who saw the man jump and then glimpsed his body lying prone on the ground, had no idea that he was actually unharmed. Alan Davies reckons the creators of Sherlock used a similar dramatic device, noting that — during the detective’s notorious rooftop fall — viewers never actually saw the impact. ‘Nobody saw him land,’ he said. ‘There was a gap of seven or eight seconds, which is when they did the clever bit.’ Closer examination of the scene gives at least some clues as to what this alleged “clever bit” may have been. A camera shot, taken from above, shortly after the fall, appears to show a large white rectangle on the surface of the pavement. If Davies is correct, this would have been some sort of removable panel, covering a safety net, which was manned by an assistant. ‘He [Holmes] needed at least two accomplices: one up top, one below,’ the actor said. ‘Leaping off a second-floor balcony’s no big deal if there’s something to catch you at the bottom, if you’ve dug yourself a big hole with a tightly sprung net inside [and] rigged up a camouflage frame — which slides across.’ All very clever. But would Holmes have been able to build a similar trapdoor in the pavement of a busy London street? And would Sherlock’s creators lower themselves to stealing a decade-old plot twist? Not everyone is convinced and the rival theories all have their supporters.","It seems the case may have been solved by rival master of deduction with a knack for explaining the impossible .

"A British man has been raped at Munich's world famous Oktoberfest beer festival, while he was relieving himself behind a bush. The 24-year-old man, who has not been named, was attacked by two men when he went to some bushes away from the crowds at the edge of the festival area. A man approached him and said he wanted to have sex with him, according to Munich police. The 24-year-old, who is believed to come from Leeds, rejected his advance. But he was then attacked from behind and forced to the ground. One man held him down while another man raped him. A 24-year-old man was raped at Oktoberfest while he was urinating behind a bush on the edge of the festival . The two assailants then fled, and police are still searching for clues as to their identity. The incident took place at the edges of the Theresienwiese, a large open space on the outskirts of Munich where Oktoberfest is held each year. Most of the area is taken up with brightly lit beer tents and huge crowds of festival-goers, but there are dark and quiet areas around the edges. The festival takes place in Theresienwiese, a large area on the outskirts of Munich, and runs until October 5 . Oktoberfest was opened on Saturday with the annual Bavarian beer festival set to run until October 5. Some 6.4 million people are expected at the 2014 festivities that have inspired imitations around the world. The festival brings hundreds of millions to the local economy, with an estimated £252m flowing at the venues themselves. Over the 16 days, the festival is expected to attract 6.4 million revellers. The first Oktoberfest was held in 1810, in honor of the Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig's marriage to Princess Therese von Sachsen-Hildburghausen. Toilets are a frequent issue, with large quantities of beer being consumed, and in 2004 queues became so long police had to be called in to control them. It is not unusual for festival-goers to try to find a secluded spot to relieve themselves. The attack on the Briton comes just days after a woman on her way home from the festival was assaulted by a 16-year-old boy, who tore some of her clothes and attempted to molest her. Passers by heard her cries for help and came to her aid before he could rape her. Elsewhere, a 27-year-old Italian was held after trying to attack a 20-year-old man with a bread knife. An American soldier was also taken into custody for rampaging through one of the marquees. On his way to the Oktoberfest's temporary police station he started screaming 'Nazis' at the security guards. He then bit a police officer on the left arm. Keeping order: Overall there have been 659 crimes reported in the first week of Oktoberfest . Despite the incidents, Munich police say crime, including sexual assaults, is down at this year's Oktoberfest compared to previous years. So far there have been seven sexual assaults this year, including two rapes, compared to twelve last year. Overall there have been 659 crimes reported in the first week of Oktoberfest, compared to 831 last year. As of Saturday night, 3.3million people have visited the Oktoberfest so far this year.","The 24-year-old man, who has not been named, was attacked by two men .

"To her listeners, she sounds utterly composed as she asks guests to tell her their Desert Island Discs. But when host Kirsty Young found herself face to face with Tom Jones, she became a little… flustered. The host of Radio 4’s long-running interview programme has revealed she was overcome by the singer’s ‘animal magnetism’ – and imagined that he must be a ‘killer in the sack’. Flustered: Kirsty Young (left), the host of Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, has revealed she was overcome by the 'animal magnetism' of singer Tom Jones (right) and imagined that he must be a 'killer in the sack' Couple: Lanarkshire-born Miss Young (right), 45, is married to businessman Nick Jones (left), with whom she has two daughters and two stepchildren . Lanarkshire-born Miss Young said the singer ‘pulsates sexuality’ and hinted that she might have been unable to keep her hands off him in his younger days. Sir Tom, 74, appeared on Desert Island Discs in 2010. Miss Young, 45, revealed he was one of her ‘favourite customers’ in ten years of fronting the programme, and said she would take Sir Tom’s music to a desert island. She told the Radio Festival in Salford: ‘I was grateful that I was interviewing him in the autumn of his years, because God knows if he had walked into my studio 30 years ago I would not have been responsible for my actions. ‘He pulsates sexuality. It is unfair. He has an animal magnetism and he is very at home with himself. I can only imagine he is a killer in the sack.’ Miss Young, 45, took over Desert Island Discs – which first aired in 1942 – from Sue Lawley in 2004. In each episode, she plays music chosen by her guests while interviewing them about their lives. At the end, they must choose which single track they would take to a desert island, along with a book and a luxury item. Thoughts: Miss Young also revealed she felt Ed Miliband’s Desert Island Disc was a 'compromised' choice. The Labour leader (above) was ridiculed  after he named Angels by Robbie Williams as his favourite piece of music . Sir Tom chose Jerry Lee Lewis’ single A Whole Lotta Shakin’ Going On as the track he would save as a castaway, and a bucket and spade as his luxury item. During the interview, he admitted he had ‘over-indulged’ in his sex life, and had been ‘weak-minded’ over temptation during his marriage. Asked about his sexual image, he told Miss Young: ‘I did feel like that. Sex Bomb, you can’t get away from that title. 'When you do things, sometimes you create a monster without actually realising. Sometimes I should rein myself in a little bit.’ Miss Young, who is married to businessman Nick Jones, with whom she has two daughters and two stepchildren, said one of the celebrities she most wanted to interview was US comedian Joan Rivers, who died last month. She also revealed that she felt Ed Miliband’s Desert Island Disc was a ‘compromised’ choice because it was not really his favourite track. The Labour leader was ridiculed last year after he named the song Angels by Robbie Williams as his favourite piece of music on the Radio 4 show. Miss Young added her voice to the sceptics who felt it may have been chosen by his spin doctors in an attempt to appeal to voters. She told the Radio Festival: ‘Isn’t it a coincidence that it was the best selling track in the country? My overall impression was his list probably was compromised in places, but fair enough.’ The Scottish presenter said she remembers Mr Miliband failed to meet her eye during their interview, making it harder for her to tell if his choices were genuine.","Kirsty Young reveals she was overcome by singer's 'animal magnetism'

"A convicted killer accused of clubbing his mother to death two days after he had finished serving a 30-year prison sentence sobbed as he entered a guilty plea in a New Jersey courtroom Tuesday. Appearing before a judge without a lawyer by his side, an emotional Steven Pratt proclaimed: 'I don't want a trial. I'm guilty.' The 45-year-old ex-convict was arrested Sunday after he allegedly killed his mother, Gwendolyn Pratt, at her home in Atlantic City after celebrating his release from prison with his family. Tearful confession: Steven Pratt weeps in court while answering questions from Superior Court Judge Michael Donio during his arraignment Tuesday, which culminated with a guilty plea . Standing in an empty courtroom wearing an orange jumpsuit and a pair of handcuffs, Pratt broke down in tears after Judge Michael Donio read the charges against him, Philly.com reported. The judge advised the suspect not to say anything without an attorney present but Pratt brushed it off and continued speaking through sobs . 'I have no lawyer,' he said. 'I have nobody.' Upon learning that his bail has been set at $1million in cash, Pratt told the judge that it made no difference to him. 'I have nothing,' he said, his head bowed. Before he was led away from the courtroom, the hulking former inmate murmured: 'I have failed.' According to prosecutors, Pratt beat to death his 64-year-old mother, Gwendolyn Pratt, during an argument that broke out at her home in Atlantic City Sunday. Matricide: Pratt, 45, surrendered to police Sunday after he allegedly clubbed his mother, Gwendolyn Pratt, 64 (right), to death following a party at her house celebrating his release form prison . Police found Mrs Pratt dead from blunt force trauma to the head at 6.30am Sunday. Just two days earlier, the victim had picked up her son from prison. Just before Gwendolyn Pratt's killing, the family held a welcome-back party to celebrate the end of Steven Pratt's 30-year sentence for killing a neighbor with a handgun, the Press of Atlantic City reported. Ruan Tilghman Pugh, who lives next door, told the paper: 'It's so devastating. You just never know what people are going through.' He said that before the attack, he had overheard Mr Pratt on the phone to a cousin asking to stay with him in the wake of an argument with his aunt. Police arrested Pratt at the scene and charged him with murder. Pratt had served a 30-year sentence for the murder of Michael Anderson, a neighbor in Atlantic City whom he shot dead in 1984. Killing: Police found Gwendolyn Pratt, 64, dead from massive head injuries at the home on the right in Atlantic City, New Jersey . Pratt, then aged 15, was hanging around in an apartment hallway when he got into a dispute with Mr Anderson, court records show. During the altercation, Pratt attacked Anderson with a lead pipe, but the neighbor managed to disarmed him and hit him back. Pratt took off and then came back with a borrowed handgun, which he used to kill Anderson. He was tried as an adult. Gwendolyn Pratt's brother told Philly.com that his sister, who worked at Resorts Casino Hotel since 1989, had been excited about her son's long-awaited release. On Friday, she picked Pratt up from Bayside State Prison and took him out to IHOP. A few months prior to his release, the 45-year-old inmate had reportedly turned down an offer to move into a halfway house ahead of his release, according to Press of Atlantic City. .","Steven Pratt entered a guilty plea and told a New Jersey judge he did not want a trial .

"Fewer children are walking to school than a decade ago, despite schemes to encourage families to reduce their reliance on cars. Campaigners have described the decline as a ‘national scandal’ as the rate of obesity among children rises. An analysis of the latest Government figures shows just 41 per cent of children in England walked to school last year compared with 44 per cent ten years earlier – a total drop of 300,000 pupils. National scandal: Fewer children are walking to school than ten years ago, as obesity rates soar among young . Pupils were least likely to walk to school in London, where just 36 per cent of children went on foot, followed by 39 per cent in the South East. Campaigners said parents were still worried about their children’s safety on busy and congested roads. Joe Irvin, chief executive for Living Streets, a charity supporting pedestrians, said: ‘It’s a national scandal that fewer than half of our children now walk to school. ‘Traffic congestion is a major deterrent to parents allowing their children to walk to school so many choose to drive their children, adding to the problem of stressful, congested areas around schools and unwittingly becoming part of the rising issue of safety outside the school gates. ‘We need to prioritise our children not traffic and we’re calling on the Government to develop a coherent action plan for sustainable school travel which would enable our children to walk to school safely and easily. Precious ones: Campaigners said parents were still worried about their children’s safety on busy roads . ‘Over the next 10 years, pupil numbers are going to explode and without action now, our streets are will grind to a halt and children’s health will be put at risk. ‘Making our streets safer for children not only benefits their health today, but safeguards their wellbeing in the future. The time has come for the Government to commit to putting pupils first.’ Pupils instead tend to travel to school in the car or on buses. In most areas, just one per cent of pupils cycle to lessons.","300,000 fewer pupils are walking to school than ten years ago, figures show .

"Britain is now the party drugs capital of the world, a new United Nations report has revealed. One in 40 Scots use cocaine - the highest in the world - and just under one in 50 people in England and Wales. Overall, Scotland sits top of the world cocaine league table, ahead of Spain, the US, Australia and Uruguay. England and Wales sit sixth in the global list of cocaine users. Scroll down for interactive map . Ecstasy use in the UK is among the highest in the world, according to the UN report. Only Australia and New Zealand use the banned drug more often . The UN report reveals that Scotland is the cocaine capital of the world, with the rest of Britain not far behind . Scotland is third in the table of ecstasy users, behind only Australia and New Zealand. The Dutch are the fourth biggest ecstasy takers in the world, with England and Wales sitting fifth. In total, one in 59 Scots take ecstasy and one in 75 people in England and Wales. The shock report comes after celebrities including Russell Brand, Sir Richard Branson and Sting called on the Government to end its 'war on drugs', . In an open letter to David Cameron, more than 80 campaigners urged the Prime Minister to launch a review of Britain's drugs policy. The letter said more than 1.5 million people have been criminalised in the UK for drugs possession over the last 15 years. It said evidence from Australia, the Czech Republic and Portugal that health problems linked to drugs are 'dramatically' reduced when users are given medical support and advice rather than being prosecuted. Edward Fox from the drugs charity Release said the figures exposed the futility of the Government's war on drugs. He said: 'With recent statistics showing that cocaine and ecstasy use in the UK remains among the highest in Europe, it reveals that the government’s approach of strict criminalisation is failing to have an impact on levels of use. 'By its own estimates, the government spends £1.5-£2.5 billion annually on law enforcement against supply and possession offenses, yet the UK still has one of the highest overall rates of drug use in Western Europe. 'Over 90 percent of people who use drugs in this country do so recreationally, many of them are young and the greatest risk they face is criminalisation. 'Additionally the cost of police and prosecuting this activity is an expensive waste of tax payers money. 'It is time that the UK government looks at removing unnecessary criminal sanctions for drug possession to prevent any further waste of state resources and to end the lost opportunities for young people created by criminal records.' One in 59 Scots take ecstasy, the UN report found. The drug is best known as a party drug used in nightclubs . Simon Antrobus, Chief Executive of the addiction charity Addaction, added: 'We treat some 4,000 people every year whose health, jobs and relationships have been wrecked by cocaine addiction, so the findings of the UN World Drug Report are not that surprising. ‘Cocaine might once have been a drug used only by the wealthy but it’s been getting cheaper and cheaper since the mid-90s and is now easily accessible in most towns and cities. ‘That’s why Addaction provides education for young people alongside our treatment work so that they understand the potentially very serious risks involved and develop the resilience to make responsible, informed decisions around drugs.’ In Scotland 2.4 per cent of the population take cocaine - the highest figure in the world. Some 1.7 out of 100 meanwhile take ecstasy. The English and Welsh are also among the highest party drug users in the world, according to the UN . A Scottish Government spokesman dismissed the report's claim that Cocaine use is rife north of the border. The spokesman told MainOnline: 'We do not accept the international comparisons made in this report due to considerable concerns about the amount and quality of the information available in different countries – concerns regularly raised with the UN by Scotland’s Chief Statistician. 'The Scottish Crime and Justice Survey information on drug use for 2012-13, published two weeks ago, showed that self-reported drug misuse is decreasing among both the adult population and younger people (16-24) and that drug use was falling for class A and B drugs, including cocaine and ecstasy, as well as well as cannabis. 'Indeed, it is likely that other countries are under-reporting their drugs use - artificially elevating Scotland (and other UK countries) relative position. 'Here in Scotland, we are recognised as having some of the most robust information available in the world and despite what this report says, our national statistics, drawn from a range of sources and independently analysed and assessed by the UK Statistics Authority, show that drug use in Scotland is falling among the general adult population and young people.'","Cocaine use in Scotland is higher than anywhere else in the world, according to the UN's 'World Drug Report' 2014 .

"Waiting lists for potentially tests which can detect cancer have doubled in a year and are at a six year high, new figures show. Crucial procedures such as colonoscopy - used to detect bowel and stomach cancers - and MRI and CT scans used to find tumours, are supposed to be undertaken within six weeks of a GP referral. But the latest figures show in May this year alone more than 18,000 patients waited longer than that - more than double the number at this point last year. Crucial procedures such as colonoscopy and MRI and CT scans are supposed to be undertaken within six weeks of a GP referral . It is five times higher than the number of patients forced to wait longer than six weeks back in 2010. Experts said the delays - which are partly blamed on rising number of patients and the ageing population - would alarm those potentially at risk.   Yesterday Mark Flannagan, Chief Executive of the charity Beating Bowel Cancer, said the delays were ‘unacceptable’ given the huge risks of late diagnosis. He said: ‘When cancers are diagnosed early they are treatable and outcomes improve significantly. With bowel cancer more than 90pc of people diagnosed at an early stage survive for at least five years compared to less than 7pc of those diagnosed at a late stage. ‘The period between being told you may have cancer and finding out whether you have or not is an extraordinarily worrying time for patients. To wait any time for a diagnosis is hard enough but to wait for more than 6 weeks is not something anyone should be expected to go through. 'These waiting times must be improved in order to ensure that patients’ health and well-being is paramount.’ The figures from NHS England show 18,664 people waited longer than six weeks for diagnostic tests in May 2014, compared with 6,899 in May 2013, and 3,495 in May 2010. The figures from NHS England show 18,664 people waited longer than six weeks for diagnostic tests . These tests can detect life-threatening illnesses such as cancer and heart disease at an early stage and save lives. In just one month 3,870 patients waited over six weeks for tests for bowel and stomach cancers such as colonoscopy, cystoscopy – a telescope into the bladder - and gastroscopy, 1,611 waited too long for a CT scan, 6,839 for an ultrasound not related to pregnancy, up from just 1,181 last year, and 1,960 saw delays for an MRI scan. Andy Burnham MP, Labour’s Shadow Health Secretary (pls keep) who unearthed the figures, said: ‘Patients are waiting longer for crucial tests – causing stress and real anguish for worried families. ‘Last month, the NHS missed the cancer treatment target for the first time ever and these delays have clearly played a part in that. All the progress made on cancer care in the last decade is now at risk.’ Duleep Allirajah, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said it was ‘alarming’ that the proportion of people who face delays in receiving vital tests which can diagnose cancer has doubled since this time last year. He said: ‘The NHS is under strain and cancer risks being overlooked and not given the focus it needs.  Each individual hospital has a responsibility to meet these targets, or they risk putting a patient’s best chance of survival at risk.’ The Department of Health say only 2.3pc of people wait more than six weeks. The NHS is carrying out an extra 10,000 diagnostic tests a day – or 350,000 a month -  compared with 2010. It is understood five trusts are responsible for 25pc of all the overlong waiting times – Royal Berkshire Foundation Trust, Croydon Health Services NHS Trust, North Cumbria University Hospitals, Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust and Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust. A spokesperson said: ‘We know parts of the NHS are under pressure because of unprecedented demand – the service is performing nearly 10,000 extra tests every day compared to 2009/10, and there are recovery plans in place to deal with any local dips in performance. ‘We’re also providing extra support for more operations, doctors, nurses and beds, and  investing £750 million to support early diagnosis of cancer and better access to treatment.’","Crucial procedures such as colonoscopy and MRI and CT scans are supposed to be undertaken within six weeks of a GP referral .

"They are the faces of Britain’s lost children, with 140,000 youngsters going missing across the country each year. And today, the Missing People charity has launched a campaign to help find them - encouraging the public to retweet a different missing child’s appeal it posts on Twitter every 30 minutes for 24 hours. Celebrities including presenter Phillip Schofield, former rugby player Matt Dawson and model Jodie Marsh are all supporting The Big Tweet campaign, which marks International Missing Children’s Day. Appeals: Lucy Browne (left), 15, of Guildford, Surrey, went missing on May 6, and Craig Cole (right), 16, of Thornton Heath, south London, vanished on March 14 . Among the missing children highlighted by MailOnline today are Lucy Browne, 15, of Guildford, Surrey, who vanished on May 6, and Craig Cole, 16, of Thornton Heath, south London, on March 14. Evelina Mazaliauskaite, 16, of Barking, east London, has not been seen since May 14, while David Kerrigan, 13, of Margate, Kent, has been missing since February 24. Also missing is Paige Chivers, 15, of Blackpool, Lancashire, who has not been seen for seven years since August 2007. She is 5ft 5in, of slim build, and a distinctive 'Playboy Bunny' tattoo on her neck. Police believe Paige was killed and her body disposed of, but nobody has ever been arrested - and detectives are carrying out forensic tests on almost 2,000 items seized during their investigation. And probably the most famous missing child on the website is Madeleine McCann, originally from Rothley, Leicestershire, who vanished aged three from Praia da Luz in Portugal on May 3, 2007. Disappeared: Jade Young (left), 15, of Hounslow, south-west London, went missing on May 4, while David Kerrigan (right), 13, of Margate, Kent, has not been seen since February 24 . Missing People staff said the aim of the appeal today was to reach followers that may have information leading to a child being reunited with their family. 'I was so impressed by how the world of Twitter responded last year – an incredible 58,000 retweets in one day. The result? Two missing children were found. Invaluable' Stephen Fry, Missing People patron . Last year the online event generated 58,000 retweets of appeals throughout the day, and two of the children featured were found. The charity’s patron Stephen Fry said: ‘It is a very simple concept and there is simply no excuse not to get involved. 'Every half hour for 24 hours throughout International Missing Children’s Day, the charity will be posting Twitter appeals with the aim of finding missing children. 'By retweeting these appeals, we can all help extend the platform that might bring those children home. Teenagers: Evelina Mazaliauskaite (left), 16, of Barking, east London, has not been seen since May 14, while Paige Chivers (right), 15, of Blackpool, Lancashire, has not been seen for seven years since August 2007 . ‘Circulating the details of these children through the social media site is such a simple, yet incredibly effective way to give the appeals as much coverage as possible.

'I was so impressed by how the world of Twitter responded last year – an incredible 58,000 retweets in one day. The result? Two missing children were found. Invaluable.’ The Big Tweet will also encourage people public to sign up to a new Child Rescue Alert system, which will issue alerts via email and text messages when a child has disappeared and their life is at risk. Jo Youle, Missing People chief executive, said: ‘Every year, we’re blown away by the support of the general public and the number of high profile celebrities re-tweeting our appeals, sharing messages that can help us find missing children. ‘Any one of those tweets can help us save a child’s life, so we’re urging the public to get stuck in, follow @MissingPeople, use #TheBigTweet and help us save lives on International Missing Children’s Day.’ Some 250,000 people go missing each year according to Home Office figures. And 100,000 children under 16 years old run away overnight from home or care each year in the UK. In 2010/11, 91 per cent of missing incidents reported to the police were closed within 48 hours, with 99 per cent of all missing cases solved within one year. Among adults, those aged 24 to 30 were the most likely to be reported missing, followed by adults aged 18 to 23. But people in the 15 to 17 age group went missing most often.","Missing People posting appeal on Twitter every 30 minutes for 24 hours .

"Flat-pack giant Ikea has had a forestry stewardship certificate suspended after it was revealed the furniture chain has been felling 600-year-old trees from protected woodlands. The Forest Stewardship Council, which promotes the responsible management of the world's woodlands, says the wood Ikea cuts from forests in Karelia, Russia, isn't being harvested sustainably. Swedwood, the Swedish firm's forestry subsidiary, has been refused certification by the international not for-profit organisation for its Karelia operation until action is taken. Furniture giant Ikea has had its Forestry Stewardship Council certificate for Karelia, Russia, suspended . It comes after the FSC investigated Swedwood's operations in north Karelia, near the Russian-Finnish border. The region is home to one of Europe's last great forests and Swedwood has leases to log 700,000 acres provided it avoids old trees and does not clear steep slopes, which erode without tree cover. However, an audit found a number of 'major deviations' from the rules, including the harvesting of 'key biotopes', or older trees, The Sunday Times reported. Simon Counsell, executive director of Rainforest Foundation UK, said ancient trees would have ended up in flat-pack Ikea furniture. Ikea, which made global profits of £2.7billion last year, is believed to use around one per cent of the world's wood supply. And, at the same time it promotes the sustainability of its wood. Ikea, which made global profits of £2.7billion last year, is believed to use around one per cent of the world's wood supply. Pictured here is an aerial shot of the Ikea superstore near Leeds . Linda Ellegaard Nordstrom, a director of the campaign group Protect the Forest Sweden, told The Sunday Times: 'The report raises several deficiencies, but does not describe the main problem, which is fragmenting the forest.' In a statement, it said: 'A majority of the deviations have already been corrected and our full focus is now on correcting the remaining deviations and reinstating the FSC certificate urgently. 'Whilst disappointed we also believe that the certificate suspension shows that the FSC system is working. We take our responsibility for the forests and the people who work there very seriously.' An IKEA spokeswoman told MailOnline: 'Wood is one of our most important materials and it is used in many of our products. 'For us it is important to offer home furnishing products of good quality to low prices. However, a low price must never be at the expense of quality of production conditions. 'Our FSC certificate for Karelia has been suspended. We see the suspension of the certificate as highly temporary. 'The deviations mainly cover issues related to facilities and equipment for our co-workers, forestry management as well as training of our forestry co-workers. 'A majority of the deviations have already been corrected and our full focus is now on correcting the remaining deviations and reinstating the FSC certificate urgently. And whilst disappointed we also believe that the certificate suspension shows that the FSC system working. 'We take our responsibility for the forests and the people who work there very seriously and we appreciate that correcting the deviations will improve the way we manage the forest in Karelia. 'While operating in Karelia, we have worked together with NGOs and authorities to improve forestry management in the region, for example set aside forest land and to leave trees standing on the logging sites. 'IKEA is committed to responsible forest management and to the principles of the FSC. Our lease in Karelia has been FSC certified since 2006 and we believe that a reinstated FSC certificate will continue to be the best protection for natural values in the logging areas. 'Once we have transitioned our operations, we will continue to support the development of responsible forest management in Russia, which will also have positive impact on the Karelia region. We will do this through organisations such as the FSC.'","The Forest Stewardship Council has slammed Swedish furniture giant .

"This is the shocking moment a bus driver brawled with two passengers in the street during rush hour over a £2 fare. David Newstead was driving the number 89 bus in Bexley, south London, in March when Tyler Belgrave-Breeds and Sean Dickson began twisting his wing-mirrors after getting off when Newstead rejected one of the pair's out-of-date passes. Instead of driving off, the 44-year-old goes out into the busy street and starts fighting the pair, both 23. David Newstead was driving the number 89 bus when two 23-year-old's began 'goading' him into a fight. The 44-year-old jumped from his seat and began brawling with the pair in Bexley, south London . The driver fixes his wing mirror as the two young men watch on before charging at them in the street . The father-of-ten admitted affray and was handed a six-month conditional discharge. He also lost his job as a driver for Go Ahead. Belgrave-Breeds and Dickson were found guilty of affray at Bromley Magistrates Court following the brawl. Magistrates' heard how the pair began 'goading' the driver and threw a can of drink over his back before the scuffle. Now the driver, whose nine children live with him, says he will not be able to make ends meet after losing his job. 'I feel very angry as they have cost me my livelihood. 'What was the point? A £2 bus fare is all this is about. 'They have got no worries and no cares while every week I’m thinking ""oh god, how am I going to pay the bills?""' He added he felt let down by company Go Ahead. 'I was twice spat upon by different passengers in incidents prior to this then when it happened they just turned their back on me. 'They have just abandoned me.' Retired magician Brian Buzzing, 78, was on the number 89 bus at the time of the incident and gave evidence at the trial of Belgrave-Breeds and Dickson. After allegedly twisting his wing mirrors back-to-front, the two young men then 'threw a drink' at Newstead before the fight ensued . Lying on the ground Newstead and one of the men fight before the other walks over and becomes involved . He told magistrates: 'They were really goading the driver into responding, into a fight. 'Both the accused attacked the driver, there was no question about that.' Mitigating on behalf of Belgrave-Breeds, David Prosser said: 'It is not enough to be antagonistic, it is not enough to goad, only to threaten to use violence and I would suggest at no point does my client do that. 'The only time he used violence was when he was attacked by Mr Newstead.' A Go Ahead spokesman said: 'Decisions of internal hearings are a matter for the company and employee concerned and we are not at liberty to comment on such issues.'","David Newstead was driving the number 89 bus in Bexley, south London .

"Actress Anna Friel has hit back at an oil company which accused her of 'deliberately distorting the facts' in a charity appeal about plans to test for oil in Africa's oldest national park. The Rochdale-born star, who repeatedly refers to the park as 'this place' in the three-minute plea, said she would have 'loved' to cross the border into the drilling site - but was not allowed to due to the 'armed conflict'. She added that she used the phrase 'Behind me is Virunga National Park' - deeming the accusations 'pathetic' and 'paltry'. Friel, who was filmed sat high on a mountain against a backdrop of thick jungle and glimmering lakes, told viewers that it is 'absolutely crazy' to contemplate 'exploring for oil right there'. Scroll down for video . Anna Friel's appeal to save Africa's oldest national park, Virunga in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been branded 'misleading' by the oil firm at the heart of plans to test for the natural resource . The actress and her daughter Gracie, eight, visited Uganda to film a three-minute plea on behalf of WWF. The 37-year-old said is it 'absolutely crazy' to contemplate exploring for oil at the World Heritage Site . But Soco, the London-based company set to . start tests early next year in Virunga National Park, in the Democratic . Republic of Congo, said the appeal was filmed 25 miles away from the . drilling site. The production, directed by Stephen Poliakoff, is being shown as one of the main trailers before films in more than 100 cinemas across the UK. Friel's repetition of 'this place' throughout the film could suggest to viewers the 37-year-old is standing among the endangered habitat, Soco claims. However, the actress has hit back at the oil firm - saying: 'I am astonished at this paltry attempt to use semantics to divert attention from the real issue. The plea was directed by Stephen Poliakoff, pictured with Anna Friel at the screening of the production in London on October 14 . 'I am delighted to have used the specific words ""Behind me is Virunga National Park"", and to be in the fortunate position of never having used any expression which may have indicated that I was other than where I was when filming. 'I would have loved to have been able to cross the border into the park but we were not allowed to due to the armed conflict. 'This is a pathetic attempt by Soco stop people focusing on the fact they are looking to explore for oil in a World Heritage site.' Wildlife charity WWF claims the planned oil tests could 'devastate the fragile ecosystem', of the 3,000 sq m World Heritage Site, threatening the park's critically endangered mountain gorillas, the Times reported. Friel did not visit Virunga because it lies inside the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against travelling there. Instead, the film was shot 25 miles away, on a mountain top in neighbouring Uganda. From her vantage point the actress could see part of the sprawling site. 'Behind me is Virunga. I think it's one of the most beautiful places on our planet and they are about to start exploring for oil right there,' she tells viewers. 'It seems absolutely crazy. It is the last place on Earth we should think about doing such a thing.' Soco said the area they plan to explore for oil, Block V, contains no gorillas. The firm told the Times, Friel visited sites in Uganda, areas which bear little resemblance to the site in Virguna where seismic testing is scheduled to start early next year. The company said: 'The clever use of animals and lush jungle shots depicted in the film that are simply not in the area of interest in Block V is misleading. Wildlife charity WWF claim plans to explore parts of Virunga National Park for oil will threaten the critically endangered mountain gorilla population . 'WWF must be aware of this and thus we can only conclude that the WWF is deliberately distorting the facts.' He . said the press release accompanying the film made it clear that Friel . had travelled to Uganda, and added that care was taken to ensure the . script was factually correct. The team spent five days on the edge of the park and viewed reels of footage to learn more about the area at risk. 'It would have been great to take her there and if there had been any way of doing it safely we would have done so,' he added. Roger Cagle, Soco's deputy chief executive criticised the WWF campaign for telling the DRC, the world's poorest nation, that it should not exploit its natural resources. He rejected claims made by the charity that a road due to be built to allow for the company's plans could encourage hunting and poaching. He the firm aims to reduce the risk by creating jobs for local people, who might otherwise be tempted to kill rare animals for commerical gain. He told the paper Soco had invited Friel and WWF to visit Block V to see for themselves the poverty of the area.","WWF appeal aims to stop oil drilling in Virunga National Park .

"On his 1974 re-election as Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam declared Bowman Hall in Sydney's Western suburb of Blacktown as his 'Temple of Victories'. It was from here, two years earlier, that he delivered the famous 'It's Time' election campaign speech that brought the Australian Labor party to power after 23 years. Now, the City of Blacktown wants to honour his legacy with a new suburb and railway station called Whitlam. 'Without doubt Blacktown City is a better place thanks to Mr Whitlam, and we will forever honour him here,' said Blacktown mayor Stephen Bali. 'It's time!' Gough Whitlam made his winning Labour election campaign speech from the stage of Blacktown's Bowman Hall in November 1972. The Australian Electoral Commission announced a new suburb would be named in Whitlam's honour  following his recent death on October 21 at the age of 98. Cr Bali has written to NSW Premier Mike Baird and Opposition Leader John Robertson for support for a new 'Whitlam' suburb in Blacktown's North West Growth Centre and a station on the north-west rail link, Fairfax Media reports. Whitlam lived in the region and 'he understood the needs of it's people,' Cr Bali said. 'Gough Whitlam is a hero of mine: a man with an enormous vision for Australia as a place where cultures and ideas are embraced. On a very practical local level, of course he made a difference to so many people’s live,' he said. As well as education and public health reforms, it was Whitlam who was responsible for funding a new public hospital at Westmead and for linking the homes of Western Sydney with sewerage. 'It wasn't until 40 years ago under Gough that western Sydney came into the 20th century,' says Mayor Bali. 'Nothing will save the Governor-General:' Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was famously dismissed from office on Remembrance Day, 1975 on the steps of Old Government House . 'One of the brightest stars': Whitlam has been described as a 'reformist' and 'modernising' Prime Minister who 'left an indelible mark on Australian history'. He is also credited with putting Western Sydney 'on the map' Whitlam, dubbed 'The Young Brolga' when he entered parliament in 1952 for his height (194 cm) and 'imperious bearing' was remembered as a 'transformative' leader and a 'giant.' In 1972, he led the Labor Party back to power after 23 years with a slogan for change: 'It's time'. The upcoming election was 'a choice between the past and the future,' he told Australians from the stage at Blacktown's Bowman Hall, promising to end military conscription and Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, to provide free university education and a national health scheme. He set about transforming the nation: Abolishing remnants of the White Australia Policy and recognising Indigenous land rights, recognising Papua New Guinea's Independence and establishing diplomatic relations with China. Whitlam pours soil into the hands of traditional landowner Vincent Lingiari in 1975, in a famous image that marked changes to Indigenous land rights under his leadership . Whitlam, pictured with his former arch-rival Malcolm Fraser, was a vocal member of the 1999 Yes! campaign for a republic following his dismissal by the Governor-General . Whitlam was dismissed by Governor-General John Kerr on November 11, 1975 when his government failed to pass its budget in the Senate. 'Well, we may say ""God Save The Queen"", but nothing will save the Governor-General,' Whitlam famously responded on the steps of what is now Old Parliament House. Former Liberal prime minister  Malcolm Fraser said his predecessor, and later good friend, 'had aspirations probably too large for our immediate resources.' 'But aspirations that I think touched the hearts and minds of a great many Australians. He certainly left an indelible mark on Australian history.' And a special one on Western Sydney's.  For Cr Bali, Blacktown City 'embodies' Gough's Australian ideals of multi-culturalism and 'the importance of working to enable all Australians to realise their potential.'","The City of Blacktown in  Sydney's West wants to name a new suburb and train station in Whitlam's honour .

"A shocked traveller who was quoted a price of £23.7billion for a flight to Portugal has been offered a €40 (£31.30) voucher and an apology as a goodwill gesture from comparison website eDreams. Marion Sessions had searched for flights from Birmingham to Faro in the Algarve region when eDreams returned the cheapest prices she could find for flights with Ryanair and Monarch. But having gone through to process of booking her flights 'without a hitch', Sessions got a rude shock when the final price of £23,659,382,125.95 was offered. Scroll down for video . That'll be £23,659,382,125.95 thanks! The price quoted by eDreams to Marion Sessions for a flight to Faro . 'It all went swimmingly until I entered this extra piece of luggage for the return journey and I all but clicked ""Purchase"",' Sessions posted on a blog. 'What would have happened if I had? Neither of us has £23.7 billion to spare … What would have happened to my credit rating?!! We might have had to up our rates for our holiday cottages by several million.' When Sessions called eDreams she couldn't leave a message but her email query did get an automated response. 'Quickly an email appeared, urging me ""Don’t miss out on your dream flight deal to Faro (FAO)! We’ve saved the flight to Faro you were searching for on eDreams. A second one reassured us, ""We hope you find everything you’re looking for on eDreams"".' eDreams has since made contact with Sessions and attempted to make amends with the baffled customer, who runs two romantic holiday cottages in the Peak District village of Parwich, taking it all in good spirit. Folk dancers perform in the square in Faro, Portugal, where Sessions aimed to fly from Portugal . 'We have now received an apology of sorts from eDreams, who assure us in what looks horribly like an automated email that the ""price issue detected has been solved"". One would hope so, too!' she said in a subsequent blog post. 'They have offered us an ""eDreams Voucher for the value of €40 as a commercial gesture"" against our next flight, but I don’t think we’ll bother trying again! €40 does seem quite modest compared with £23.7bn but we appreciate the gesture. 'The whole episode – after the initial shock – has provided everyone with a lot of harmless fun!'

"Cuba's biggest producer of natural products has come up with a pair of colognes for the discerning supporter of international socialism who wants something more than just the iconic 'Che' T-shirt. A woodsy and refreshing citric scent with notes of talcum powder called 'Ernesto' honors guerrilla leader Ernesto 'Che' Guevara. For those seeking something softer and fruitier, there's a blend with hints of mango and papaya called 'Hugo,' for the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Che Guevara (left) has a new cologne named after him that smells 'woodsy and citric,' while the late Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez (right) has a scent that features notes of mango and papaya . 'They will be very attractive colognes, but the names also mean a lot to us,' said Isbel Gonzalez, vice president for research and development for Labiofam, which produces homeopathic medicines, cleaning products and dietary supplements. Formulated by a French company and produced in Cuba, the men's colognes are being presented this week at a Labiofam convention in Havana. The two scents so far have generic bottles and simple printed labels bearing only their names. But Labiofam is developing more attractive bottles and labels with hopes of putting the colognes on sale in Cuba and internationally, Gonzalez said. She declined to provide a timeline. Labiofam officials said they and French firm Robertet worked for more than 1 1/2 years to produce the colognes. The Cuban company polled 122 visitors to other pharmaceutical conventions to determine what names people preferred from a pre-selected list of options. 'It was a great challenge,' said Cuban biochemist Mario Valdes, who led the scent design team. Che Guevara's scent (left) is called 'Ernesto', while the perfume in honour of Hugo Chavez has been called Hugo . The French company did not respond to a request for comment. Labiofam is also producing a pair of women's perfumes called 'Amalia' and 'Alba.' While ALBA is the Spanish acronym for the leftist Latin America regional alliance founded by Chavez, Gonzalez did not provide details about whether the perfumes' names also had political connotations. Celebrity endorsements are a vital part of the perfume and cologne business, but scents inspired by political figures are rarer. Portaits of Che Guevara are prominent throughout Cuba - this picture stands in Revolution Square in Havana . One example is that associated with ousted Philippines President Joseph Estrada, a former movie action star and heartthrob who was forced out in a 2001 'people power' revolt. Estrada, now mayor of the Philippines capital of Manila, was known for using a distinctively scented body powder, and at one point during his presidency packages described as Estrada's body powder were put on sale for his followers. Guevara's image has long been appropriated for products as diverse as clothing and automobiles, often running into objections from the survivors of the Argentine-born revolutionary who helped Fidel and Raul Castro's rebels overthrow Cuban President Fulgencio Batista in 1959. Chavez became the Castros' greatest ally since the breakup of the Soviet Union, frequently visiting and supplying Cuba with millions of barrels of discounted oil that provided vital support for the island's struggling economy. Both Ernesto and Hugo are produced in fairly plain bottles at present, but there are plans to design new packaging for both . Labiofam's director is a nephew of the Castros, and Valdes said the families of Guevara and Chavez had been consulted and approved the use of the names. Cubans are enthusiastic consumers of perfumes and colognes. State cosmetics company Suchel-Camacho produces 'Alicia,' a scent named for Cuban National Ballet founder Alicia Alonso, which has been popular among both tourists and Cuban women since the 1980s. At the Labiofam convention, visitors' reactions to the revolutionary scents were largely positive. 'I'd probably be more likely to buy `Ernesto' because the scent is a little more striking,' said Reymundo Miranda, an expert in traditional medicine. Valdes said the colognes had no intention of trivializing the two men's legacies. 'We didn't want to create propaganda, but rather pay homage to them and help their names endure,' he said.","Cuban company has also launched cologne in honour of Hugo Chavez .

They claim they receive worse service in shops and hospitals, and are treated discourteously, patronised and even harassed simply for being older. The figure for the over-65s is even higher, at 37 per cent. One in three over 50s say they receive worse services in shops and hospitals because of their age . The study, by University College London, found that well-qualified, retired men in their seventies were most likely to feel victimised. Researchers pooled data on 7,800 men and women aged 52 and above from across the country and in different walks of life. They were asked whether they had to put up with one or more of five types of age discrimination in their daily lives, including harassment, being talked down to, being disrespected, discrimination in medical services and discrimination in restaurants and shops. A little over 2,600 – a third – said they had encountered prejudice  of some sort, with the proportion rising to 37 per cent among over-65s. For those still working, the figure was 28 per cent. A lack of respect or courtesy was experienced by 18 per cent, while 11 per cent said they felt talked down to because people assumed they were not clever. The study, by University College London, found that well-qualified, retired men in their seventies were most likely to feel victimised . Around one in ten believed they receive worse treatment in doctors’ surgeries, hospitals, restaurants and shops, and 5 per cent think they suffer harassment purely because of their age. The report – published in the journal . Age And Ageing – states: ‘These findings highlight the scale of the . challenge of age discrimination for older adults. The population . continues to age due to a decrease in fertility coupled with an . increased life expectancy. With people living longer, age discrimination . is likely to gain greater prominence. ‘A . key aspect that separates age discrimination from other forms of unfair . treatment is that everyone is potentially at risk of experiencing it at . some point in their lives.’ Paul . Green, of the Saga lifestyle group for the over-50s, said: . ‘Discrimination is a nasty trait – but against older people it is also . pretty self-defeating. Older people have 80 per cent of the nation’s . wealth, they are savvy consumers who know how they should be treated and . their life experience makes them wise and good company. ‘Some in the private and public sector need to lift their game when dealing with an ageing society.’ Caroline . Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘Sadly, age discrimination is all too . prevalent today. Whilst there is legislation making it illegal, this . needs to be accompanied by a seismic shift in societal attitudes towards . older people and ageing.’","One third say they have been patronised or harassed for being older .

'I was always thinking about the right time to turn professional, but I always put my amateur goals first and with the guidance of my close family and friends, I think my time with amateur boxing is coming to an end,’ Moala said. ‘After leaving Glasgow, it has made me rethink my decisions on amateur boxing and strategically, I would make a stronger and more dominate impact in the professional ranks with the style of boxing I have. I know I can make more of a positive mark on my own with the support of my followers.’ The light welterweight boxer, who attended Cabramatta High School in Sydney's southwest, didn't end up fighting at the games because he was 600 grams over the 64kg weigh limit before the games. 'I weighed 100kg three months out from the Games, and went into a strict training regime to get myself back in shape. 'I always believed that I would make the weight cut off as I've made them previously. I trained up until the weigh in and didn’t eat or drink for three days to make sure I would drop the last kilo. But the morning of the weigh in, I was 64.6kg. ‘I know some would think how could 600 grams not be dropped? But after spending some time in a sauna and training all morning, I knew my body was in some dangerously dehydrated state. ‘Although I didn’t make the weight, I am more humbled by the experience and I have learnt more about myself and my body than I ever did,' he said.

"Britain is an ‘El Dorado’ for thousands of migrants flocking to Calais because of generous handouts, the French port’s mayor has told MPs. Blaming the UK for the crisis, Natacha Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel. She said illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado. Scroll down for video . Telling it straight: Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart (left) said Britain was an El Dorado for migrants, while Theresa May is coming under increasing pressure over the immigration crisis . The Mayor of Calais was invited to give evidence to Parliament over the mounting immigration crisis in the northern French town . Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, she said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain. ‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives. ‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. People who have got through call and say, “ … this is El Dorado and we’re staying here”.’ Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, questioned why there was such a severe immigration problem in Calais . Mrs Bouchart was joined by Philippe Mignonet, Deputy Mayor of Calais (right) and Emmanuel Aguis, First Deputy to the Mayor (left) to give evidence to Parliament . Mrs Bouchart (centre) was the centre of attention outside Portcullis House in Westminster this afternoon after giving evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee about the immigration crisis in Calais . She added: ‘There has not been a message from the British government saying, “This is not El Dorado”. If it is not true you need to be saying it very loudly and clearly in our country and across and throughout Europe.’ Mrs Bouchart said Britain was a ‘soft touch’, telling MPs to ‘take responsibility’ and that ‘if you have conditions that are attractive to migrants you need to be thinking about changing those’. She said the lure of the UK had drawn 2,500 migrants to Calais, which was suffering increasing violence and being targeted by organised crime gangs. She said UK border controls should be returned from Calais to Dover. They were moved to French soil more than a decade ago as part of an earlier attempt to tackle the problem. Mrs Bouchart said the UK was seen as an Eldorado among immigrants. She said: 'What Britain is offering is understood around the world' French police used tear gas on crowds of migrants last week in Calais when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the Channel . But Michael Ellis, a Tory MP on the committee, said France had been ‘leading proponents’ of the Schengen agreement, which abolished internal border controls within the mainland EU. He added: ‘You only have yourselves to blame.’ Lorraine Fullbrook, another Tory MP, said: ‘You can’t expect us to disadvantage our people because France can’t police its borders.’ Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson said: ‘It is not good enough for the mayor of Calais to seek to wash her hands of this problem and seek to simply move the border to Dover.’ Mrs Bouchart fuelled fears of another Sangatte, the now-closed Red Cross centre that housed thousands of migrants near the port, by backing plans for a new centre in Calais. Hopes: Immigrants trying to make there way across the English channel into the UK risk their lives attempting to jump into lorries as they line up at Calais . Riot: French police used tear gas on crowds of migrants last week in Calais when around 300 attempted to storm lorries heading for the Channel Tunnel . French authorities will offer medical and legal advice to thousands of migrants seeking asylum in the UK at the centre if it is opened . Intended as a humanitarian response to the growing number of people living rough in the area, it would offer mainly medical facilities. But critics said it would serve as a hotspot for those seeking to cross the Channel. Britain has given £12million to the French to enhance security measures, as clashes between migrants have grown more violent. Last week riot police used tear gas on 400 illegal migrants who tried to storm lorries heading for Britain. A 16-year-old Ethiopian girl was killed as she crossed the Channel Tunnel approach road. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘One of the things we’ve done is … to bolster security and infrastructure in Calais.’ The Government has also provided Calais with security fencing used at the Nato summit in Wales. But Mrs Bouchart said: ‘The fence makes everybody laugh.’ Ukip said Britain needs to make clear ‘its streets are not paved with gold’. A day centre, normally used as a summer school (pictured)  is the proposed site of a centre for migrants in Calais .

"Glamorous in a black lace gown and a sparkling diamond tiara, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for a state dinner in Madrid last night. The event, which was held to honour Michelle Bachelet, the visiting President of Chile, took place in the Zarzuela Palace. Ms Bachelet, who was elected in March, also chose a glamorous lace get-up, albeit in elegant grey rather than dramatic black. Scroll down for video . Dramatic: Both Queen Letizia and Chile's President Michelle Bachelet chose glamorous lace for the event . Looking good: Letizia looked wonderful in her striking black lace gown and diamond tiara . Sumptuous: The Spanish royal couple were hosting a state dinner held in honour of Chile's Michelle Bachelet . Earlier, Letizia, 42, and husband King Felipe, 46, had welcomed the Chilean president in a lavish ceremony that included taking a salute from a guard of honour outside the El Pardo Palace. The encounter with the Spanish couple is not, however, Ms Bachelet's first brush with a royal since taking the helm. In June, Ms Bachelet, a socialist, was left beaming after Prince Harry made a state visit to the country and met with her at the Palacio de La Moneda in Santiago. This time around, the president, who seems to be at risk of becoming a monarchist, was left smiling after a chat with King Felipe during the ceremony and was seen beaming broadly later on during the state dinner. Ms Bachelet is in Spain for high level talks aimed at boosting trade relations between her South American nation and the EU. Enjoying her stay: Ms Bachelet, although a socialist, appeared entirely at ease in the royals' company . Visit: The Chilean president is on a two-day visit aimed at boosting trade between Chile and Spain . Glamorous: Letizia chose unusually dramatic make-up, including a red lip, for the event . Letizia, meanwhile, is fresh from a successful trip to Austria where she made a speech at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. The speech, which was made partly in German and in English, was to art fans during the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the Spanish artist, Diego Velázquez. Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum. The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe. Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood. Lovely to see you again: The couple looked thrilled to see a glamorous-looking Ms Bachelet at dinner . In danger: Ms Bachelet, who seems to be in danger of becoming a monarchist, was all smiles during dinner . First visit: Prince Harry, pictured here in Santiago, was the first royal to shake the hand of the Chilean president . Pomp: The welcome ceremony at the El Pardo Palace saw the royals take a salute from an honour guard . The look of love: King Felipe and Queen Letizia exchanged glances as they waited for President Bachelet . Delighted: Ms Bachelet appeared almost as delighted to meet King Felipe as she was to meet Prince Harry . All smiles: President Bachelet waved to photographers as she was escorted into the El Pardo by Queen Letizia . Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita. Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, last week, joined King Felipe for the launch of a new Spanish language dictionary. Much of her time has also been spent travelling, with successful visits to the UN in New York and to King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in the Hague alongside King Felipe, among her most recent trips. Dramatic: The smartly uniformed honour guard formed a dramatic backdrop for the welcome ceremony . Esteem: Unusually, the ceremony was held at the grand El Pardo Palace instead of the Zarzuela . All smiles: After bowing his head for the National Anthem, Felipe beamed broadly at the soldiers on parade . Stylish: As is her wont, Queen Letizia cut a glamorous figure as she made her way down the El Pardo's steps .","Letizia was hosting a dinner in Madrid for Chile's Michelle Bachelet .

"A lesbian couple is taking an Vermont town to court claiming they have faced ten years of harassment, including anonymous bullying, unjust fines and dead animals being dumped on their lawn. The couple, Barbara Ernst and Barbara Supeno, from Addison, are suing for what they allege is more than a decade of discrimination. Their lawyer, David Bond, says the town has tried to push couple out since they moved there in 2004. Barbara Ernst and Barbara Supeno, who are suing the Vermont town of Addison after what they claim is decades of discrimination . Bond said: 'It's entirely based on their sexual orientation. 'Neighbours insulted them, made obscene gestures to them. 'There were dead animals left on their property.' The couple are seeking both peace, and damages for their suffering, and they don't want to have to move to get it. According to WPTZ, among some of the alleged grievances is the incidence of the . women’s property, which is next to Lake Champlain, being the topic of . discussion at two zoning meetings, with their lawyer claiming they were . never informed. The complaint also said the couple filed numerous issues with the town . regarding neighbors and zoning regulation, but that the town purposely . refused to respond. Graffiti in the town that the couple claim was discriminatory and directed at them, for which they are suing for damages . After the women, who have been partners for 21 years, had been receiving regular threats, they put up a . fence in 2008, which their Lawyer claimed fit in with the town's requirements, . but two meetings were held about the fence without Ernst or Supeno's . knowing. Another issue . occurred when the town refused to allow a handicap ramp to be set up at . the home for Supeno's mother, with clerks saying she had to accept the . town's judgement or face a $100 fine. Mr . Bond also said that his clients had been intimidated by anonymous . bullying, after a letter circulated through the town in 2011 saying that . they were con artists. The . letter was titled 'The truth about The Barbaras' and read: 'It has been . over 6 years that the Subject two women have been passing themselves . off as involved citizens and very concerns about the town direction and . in particular with Zoning, the school and the environment. 'Beware: This is a totally phony perception that they have fabricated is a front to cover their devious and vicious behavior.' A . year later, a Middlebury lawyer received a letter purportedly from . Ernst and Supeno claiming the couple would not pay him for his services.The . letter read: 'We just thought we would give you a heads up as to our . past games with previous attorneys in the state of VT and also lawyers . in Middlebury. 'We love to play head games with them and give them a run for their money. The case filed against senior members of the town, who the couple have named and shamed as people involved in a pattern of discrimination due to their sexuality . Ernst and Supeno have denied that they ever sent the letter. After . that, a homophobic slur was spray-painted outside of the town offices, . and Ernst and Supeno believe it was directed towards them. The lawsuit was filed by Ernst and Supeno last week, naming the head of their local zoning committee and Baptist minister, Jeff Kaufmann, as a co-defendant in the case. The lawsuit also includes two neighbours as co-defendants, and outlines six grievances, including defamation and discrimination based on sexual orientation. Gay marriage is currently legal in Vermont, which has meant that the claims have come as a shock to many onlookers, as it is seen as a progressive state. The statute took effect in 2009, allowing same-sex couples to wed in the northeastern state, which was also the first to allow civil unions in the U.S. back in 2000. Bond said: 'Their hope is this lawsuit will change things. 'Civil rights laws are very favorable in recognizing in that there shouldn't be discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation and they never expected they would be moving into this hotbed of hatred.' The six counts named in the complaint are defamation, false light . invasion of privacy, tortuous interference with prospective business . relations, sexual orientation discrimination, common law retaliation and . violations of common benefits clause.

"Parents have complained that a Wisconsin elementary school is promoting homosexuality through its 'Gender Bender' theme day. As part of the Milwaukee school's 'Spirit Week' pupils from kindergarten to eighth grade were encouraged to dress like the opposite sex. But parents described the voluntary event as 'ridiculous' and 'creepy', fearing it would encourage homosexuality among children. Outrage: Parents at Tippecanoe school say 'Gender Bender Day' is confusing for their children . Sam Ward, who has a child at the school, told Fox News 6: 'I think it’s just teaching them the . wrong lesson about gender. If you’re a boy, stay a boy. You shouldn’t . have something like that at school.' Other parents chose to keep their children at home rather then send to Tippecanoe School for the Arts and Humanities on the theme day last Friday. One mother, who asked not to be named, said she had no problem with teenagers having a fun day dressing like the opposite sex, but her seven-year-old son had been confused by the event. The voluntary theme day, which features at other schools too, came in the same week as Boy Scouts of America overturned a ban on gay members. Deidri Hernandez, who was so incensed about 'Gender Bender Day' she complained to principal Jeffrey Krupar, said: 'Having students dress as ""transvestites"" will distract from the learning process.' Ms Hernandez also said the event would promote the acceptance of homosexuality, according to the Huffington Post. In effort to appease parents, the school changed the name to 'Switch It Up Day' but Ms Hernandez said: 'They might as well call it ""Transgender Day"".' Changes: The school swapped the name of Gender Bender Day to Switch It Up Day after parents complained . Choices: Tippecanoe school council chose the gender swap day as part of its 'Spirit' theme week . A member of the school board however, hit back at the parents' criticism, saying they were 'using the kids for political purposes', according to National Review Online. Board member Terence Falk added: 'This is nothing new. I don’t think they kids were thinking about sexual orientation.' The voluntary theme day was selected by members of the school council and the school says it was intended to be a fun event, but a spokesman for Milwaukee Public schools noted that it had caused concern among parents and pupils. Confusing: Sam Ward, whose child goes to the school, says the theme is teaching pupils the wrong lesson . Ms Hernandez, who says she had never complained about a school event before, said: 'Every time something’s bothering a liberal or an atheist, they come forward to complain. And somebody always has a problem with Easter or Christmas.'","Children kept at home in protest at Milwaukee school's theme day .

"Hundreds of well-wishers gathered tonight to pay tribute to murdered British hostage Alan Henning and to remember him as 'a local, national and world hero'. His widow, Barbara, and their children children Adam, 15, and Lucy, 17, together with other family members, attended the ceremony at the British Muslim Heritage Centre in Whalley Range, Manchester. The tribute, entitled 'His Life and Legacy Remembered', included speeches from friends of the popular 47-year-old taxi driver and also faith and political leaders.

Grief: Alan Henning's wife (right) is hugged as she arrives at an interdenominational memorial service in memory ofher husband, who was murdered by ISIS fanatics in Syria . The tribute entitled 'His Life and Legacy Remembered' included speeches from friends of the popular 47-year-old taxi driver and also faith and political leaders . Opening the service, Dr Usman Choudhry said: 'In short we are here to remember a hero. A local hero, a national hero and we will also say a world hero. 'A hero who left the comfort of his own home for no other reason than to help the destitute and needy refugees of Syria. 'A hero who put the needs of others before his own and that hero is Alan Henning.' A light in the darkness: A woman lights a candle  before the start of the memorial service . Soft toys and collection buckets at the British Muslim Heritage Centre in Manchester. A video tribute was played to the audience in which several Syrian children who Mr Henning helped spoke of how much they missed 'Uncle Gadget' - the aid worker's nickname . Mr Henning, from Eccles, was captured while delivering food and supplies on an aid convoy to refugees . Loss: The tribute, entitled 'His Life and Legacy Remembered', included speeches from friends of the popular 47-year-old taxi driver and also faith and political leaders. He added that the service, organised by friends and humanitarian aid colleagues of Mr Henning, also served to support 'those willing to stand up for the rights of humanity and the poor and the repressed, and are prepared to work and not just talk about what they believe in'. Majid Freeman, from Leicester, who travelled to Syria on two convoys with Mr Henning - including his fateful last one in December - told those gathered: ""Alan was a beautiful genuine human being, inside and out. 'He went to Syria to help at a time when the whole international community had abandoned them. 'The international community leaders were paying mere lip service while Alan and many other aid workers were actually feeding these people, sheltering them, giving them aid, taking nappies for the babies, ambulances and generators for the hospitals, sweets and toys for the children and so much more.' Selfless: The taxi driver was so moved by the plight of Syrian refugees he gave devoted his time to alleviating their suffering . He said his friend had watched a television news item on Syrian children dying in hospital and rather than switching over the channel and getting on with his life he had chosen to raise funds to buy a generator for a Syrian hospital which would hopefully save lives. Mr Freeman recalled how on their December visit the convoy had stopped off late at night en route in Venice. Many of the convoy members decided to catch up on sleep in a hotel but Mr Henning opted to remain in his ambulance. He said: 'I asked Alan why and he said ""I'm going to stay in my ambulance, I'm going to save that money and give that money to the people in Syria"". That is the kind of person Alan was.' His friend and fellow aid worker, Dr Shameela Islam-Fulfiqar, said: 'Alan Henning did what most of us just think about. He sacrificed his time, his energy, his home comforts to help people who were suffering and he paid the ultimate price for this. 'His jolly nature, his warm smile and his caring aura were something that radiated to all that were around him. 'His ability to engage with with anybody and everybody made all who had met him feel they had known him for a lifetime.' Imam Asim Hussain of Manchester Central Mosque said: 'He put others before himself. Alan was an individual who embodies more Islamic values than the entire Isis put together, that's what makes him our hero. 'He was an example for all of us. He was a man who put others before himself. It takes a man to do that. Not everyone is capable of doing that. 'He went out there and put others before himself. For that, we stand up and salute Alan Henning. That's what made him special and why we celebrate him.'

"Footballing legend Diego Maradona has been labelled a psychopath after a video emerged appearing to show him assaulting his on-off girlfriend. In the video, Maradona can be seen getting up from his sofa and approaching his girlfriend Rocio Oliva to have a go at her for using her mobile. Ms Oliva filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone.' She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting.' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand. Scroll down for video . In the video, Maradona can be seen getting up from the sofa and approaching his girlfriend . He is then alleged to have hit her, although he later claimed he had only knocked the phone from her hand . Last night Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, tried to ride out the storm by insisting he had only knocked the phone out of her hands. He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there. 'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.' Maradona was put on the defensive after the 30-second video, secretly recorded by his former fiancee, was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme yesterday. It is thought to have been recorded at the retired footballer's apartment near Buenos Aires when he returned to Argentina earlier this month after his dad was rushed to hospital. He is now back at his home in Dubai without either Ms Oliva or former girlfriend Veronica Ojeda, who he has also been romantically linked to in recent months despite dumping her when she was four months pregnant with their child Diego Fernando. Last night Ms Oliva's aunt branded him a 'psychopath and woman beater'. Maradona pictured with 24-year-old Rocio Oliva in June last year. It's believed she secretly recorded the video at his Buenos Aires apartment earlier this month . It is not the first time Maradona has been accused of falling out with the 24-year-old, who he started dating at the beginning of last year after breaking up with Ojeda, 34. In May last year he allegedly had a row with her on a plane. Passengers on board the jet told how the pair exchanged insults and business class travellers including a politician's wife and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down. The incident happened as he went to meet his baby son by Veronica Ojeda for the first time. This summer he was also filmed slapping a male journalist he accused of winking at his former girlfriend.","Diego Maradona allegedly hit his girlfriend because she was using her phone .

"It claims to be one of Los Angeles' trendiest clubs, where 'unrivalled hospitality never goes out of style' - but 1 Oak's hospitality didn't extend to V. Stiviano, who was denied entry last night. The Hollywood nightclub is one of LA’s most popular destinations for celebrities, boasting visits from the likes of Bono, Sean Combs - aka Puffy Daddy - and Robert Pattinson. Stiviano, 31, was pictured outside the club last night in a low-cut red dress and managed a smile for the paparazzi, despite not being allowed to go in. Scroll down for video . V. Stiviano was reportedly denied entry to trendy Los Angeles night-spot 1 Oak - but still managed a grin for the waiting paparazzi . Stiviano gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Donald Sterling . A burly bouncer refused to grant her access, so Stiviano resorted to pacing up and down the sidewalk while photographers snapped away. At one point she phoned a friend, but that didn't help, with security politely asking her to step away from the entrance. Last week there was speculation that the model was back with her ex, the disgraced former NBA owner Donald Sterling. It surfaced after his ex wife Shelly reportedly called the police when she learned that Stiviano was at his Beverly Hills mansion. The tryst prompted her to claim to the police that Stiviano had broken into the property. However, police were told by Donald that the model was an ‘invited guest’, according to TMZ and she stayed in the property after they left. In August Stiviano claimed that the former L.A. Clippers owner is gay and that she spent three years acting as his 'beard' so no one would suspect his true sexuality. Stiviano, who gained national notoriety earlier this year due to her alleged sexual relationship with Sterling, made the bombshell allegation in documents filed at the Los Angeles Superior Court in answer to a prior lawsuit filed by Sterling’s wife, Shelly. In her original lawsuit, Shelly had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling Family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills in exchange for sexual favors. Donald Sterling’s wife Shelly reportedly called the police when she learned that V.Stiviano (right, with Sterling) was at his Beverly Hills mansion . Shelly (left) had accused Stiviano of taking gifts from the Sterling family including a Ferrari, $240,000 in cash and a $1.8 million house on the outskirts of Beverly Hills . Stiviano denies those allegations and even claims that Shelly Sterling was well aware of the exact nature of the relationship between Donald Sterling and Stiviano. ‘V.S. was D.T.S’s beard for three years prior to the filing of suit,’ the answer claimed. ‘V.S. is informed and believes that (Sterling) is a homosexual and enjoys sexual acts and or sexual congress with males.’ The answer said that Shelly Sterling was ‘acutely aware of his orientation and condoned’ his behavior, including his decision to give ‘gifts, money and other properties’ to Stiviano for her public companionship, reports the Daily News. Stiviano also says that she ‘was not ever a sexual partner’ of Donald Sterling. She also states that the gifts are considered separate property, not 'marital or community property,' because they were purchased with funds earned by Donald after separation or 'estrangement' from her wife. Stiviano also filed a $10 million defamation lawsuit against the Sterlings on Thursday. She claims they slandered her in the media by calling her a thief and saying she embezzled money and property from Donald. 'She’s delusional,’ Sterling’s lawyer, Max Blecher, told The Daily News. The drama began in April when a recording surfaced of Donald Sterling berating Stiviano for bringing black men to Clippers games. The audio spurred the NBA to ban Sterling for life and fine him $2.5 million. Shelly, his wife of 58 years, then took control of a family trust and negotiated a record $2 billion sale of the team to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Shelly Sterling said she was initially given her husband's blessing to sell the team and he praised the deal she reached. When it came time to sign it at the end of May, however, Sterling said he would not sell and would sue the league. Ballmer officially became the new owner of the Los Angeles Clippers at the end of August.","V. Stiviano reportedly denied entry to trendy LA club 1 Oak .

"A major investigation by competition watchdogs will challenge the stranglehold of Britain’s big four banks on the finances of families and small businesses. Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and HSBC are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip-off deals. The Competition & Markets Authority says not enough customers are shifting to lenders with high levels of service – reducing choice in the market. It is expected tomorrow to announce a formal investigation into the personal current account sector, which is worth some £8billion a year to the big banks. Lloyds, pictured, has been named as one of the four banks, which also include RBS, Barclays and HSBC as offering poor service and rip off deals . Investigators fear competition has diminished since the financial crash of 2007-8 because brands like the Halifax have been swallowed up by Lloyds, while others have disappeared completely. Efforts to encourage new small lenders to enter the market have had limited success, with only a few – including Metro Bank, Tesco Bank and TSB – making any real impact. There is also damning evidence that the banks continue to fail small businesses by failing to offer loans. It was hoped that a system to help people switch bank within seven working days would boost competition, improve service and reduce fees. However, relatively few people have done so. Richard Lloyd of Which? said: ‘Quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition. It is clear that the big banks’ stranglehold on the market continues and that quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition or trust in banking. ‘The Competition & Markets Authority must expose what’s at the heart of the problems in this market and propose reform so that it works better for consumers.’ He said the public need access to clear information on the running costs of current accounts so they can decide whether to switch. Official surveys show that satisfaction levels with the big four banks are less than 60 per cent yet their market shares have remained stable. There are concerns that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £20 in return for perks of little value (file picture) Customers find it very difficult to make comparisons between them, reducing competition and driving up charges, particularly on overdrafts. The greatest evidence of the failure of competition came with the fiasco surrounding the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. The big four banks have had to set aside around £22billion in compensation, but only after they were forced. And for many years, the banks routinely rejected many customer complaints about PPI and other issues, forcing people to turn to the Financial Ombudsman Service. According to recent figures, up to eight in ten complaints about the mis-sold PPI cover received by the ombudsman were first unfairly thrown out by the bank concerned. The FOS is now beginning to see a growing number of complaints about paid-for packaged current accounts. There are concerns that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £20 in return for perks of little value, such as travel policies, breakdown cover and mobile phone insurance – which have led to a 248 per cent increase in complaints. If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider. Mail Online's award-winning money section This is Money has a regularly updated guide to the best offers carefully chosen by its expert writers at Five of the best Current Accounts. We round up some of the best deals on offer below: . Free money and incentives . Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit. First Direct pays £100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 months. The Co-op, too, has introduced a £100 cash incentive for new customers. It will also donate £25 to charity on your behalf. If you switch your main current account to one of the Post Office’s Standard, Packaged or Control current accounts the bank will give you a £100 gift card. M&S Bank offers a £125 gift card to new customers signing up to its Current Account. The bank account offers an automatic £500 overdraft with the first £100 interest-free. Interest-paying current accounts . Lloyds Bank is tempting desperate savers with its Club Lloyds current account - offering up to 4 per cent for balances between £4,000 and £5,000. But you will have to pay in at least £1,500. TSB has also recently launched the interest-paying Plus Account, which pays 5 per cent on balances up to £2,000 and only requires a minimum monthly deposit of £500. Santander's 123 current account pays interest on in-credit balances - 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between £2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000. Nationwide FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers free travel insurance. It also operates a Refer a Friend scheme, whereby both parties will receive £50 if an existing customers successfully recommends friends or family to the bank. Tesco Bank's Current Account gives customers 3 per cent interest on balances of up to £3,000.

"A young British footballer has died after collapsing in his college apartment in the United States from a suspected heart attack. Peter McAvoy, 22, a student at Herkimer College in New York State who was America's reigning Junior College Player of the Year, died on Saturday evening. He was pronounced dead in hospital despite attempts by Campus safety officers and medics to revive him. His father said the former Craigiebarns . Primary and Craigie High school pupil just 'keeled over' without . warning while sitting on his settee. Tragedy: British footballer Peter McAvoy (pictured) has died at the age of 22 after collapsing in his college apartment in the United States . Peter McAvoy Snr paid . tribute to his son at the family home in Craigie as he tried to make . sense of his son's sudden death. The . head of education at Perth and Kinross Council said: 'Peter went with . some friends to watch the softball team play and went back to his . apartment afterwards when he died. 'He was sitting on the settee and just keeled over at about tea-time. 'His flatmate called for the campus security and they fried to resuscitate him. 'He was taken to hospital where they spent another hour trying to bring him back to life, but weren't able to. 'The medics believe he had a massive heart attack. It's just hard to believe, he was a fit young man.' Shock: Mr McAvoy (pictured, centre, with teammates) is believed to have suffered a heart attack . Mr McAvoy, from Dundee, . who was captain of the college soccer team, was taken to nearby Little . Falls Hospital where he was pronounced dead. His father, who rushed back from holiday in Gran Canaria after he heard . the news on Saturday, recalled the last time he spoke to his son. He . said: 'I spoke him recently and he was telling me they were having a . ceremony next week because the team had won the league and the cup this . season. 'He told me he would be speaking at the ceremony and he was really looking forward to it. I just can't believe it. 'We have no heart attack history in the family, neither my side or his mother's. 'He had so much potential. He went to America two years ago and won the championships in both seasons. Sudden: Mr McAvoy, from Dundee, was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead . 'I've been overwhelmed by the expressions of sympathy from both America and Dundee.' The former Arbroath SC and Tayport FC . defender went to the United States in 2012 where he played for New York . State's Herkimer Generals and was America's reigning Junior College . Player of the Year. Dean of students Matthew Hawes said: 'Our deepest condolences are with Peter's family as they grieve this tragic loss. 'Our thoughts are also with his team-mates, coaches, friends, faculty and staff during this difficult time.' Talented: The former Arbroath SC defender moved to the States in 2012, where he played for New York State's Herkimer Generals and was America's reigning Junior College Player of the Year . Craig . Brown, co-manager of East Craigis FC, who played with Peter at Arbroath . SC, added: 'He was just a gentleman, a really nice guy. Nobody can get . their head around it. 'It's . a tragedy He was an absolute legend of a guy - he would do anything for . you - and on the football pitch he was a superb player.' The cause of his death is not known and a post-mortem examination will be carried out, the college said. Mr McAvoy was named national player of the year last year by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America. The college is holding a candlelit vigil in his memory at its Wehrum Stadium this evening. The cause of Peter McAvoy's death has not yet been established, but his father says medics believe it was a heart attack. If that proves to be the case, it would be another incident of heart conditions hitting seemingly healthy young footballers in recent years. Fabrice Muamba, 25, was forced to retire from the game after collapsing on the pitch from a cardiac arrest in March 2012 at Tottenham's White Hart Lane ground. The former England Under-21 midfielder was effectively dead for 78 minutes when his heart stopped beating during an FA Cup match for Bolton at Tottenham. Victims of heart disease: Former Premier League footballer Fabrice Muamba (left) collapsed - but survived - and ex-Birmingham City player Christian Benitez (right) died after suffering cardiac arrests at a young age . Just a month later an Italian footballer collapsed on the pitch and died from a heart attack in front of horrified teammates and supporters. Former under-21 international Piermario Morosini, 25, who played for Livorno, was seen to tremble before falling to his knees and never regained consciousness. In July last year, former Birmingham City striker Christian Benitez died from respiratory failure after a cardiac arrest at the age of 27. The Ecuador international's death came just a few weeks after his £10million switch to Qatari side El Jaish from Mexican team Club America. There are a number of congenital heart defects that can hit sportsmen. The one which most commonly kills young athletes is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. A genetic defect, it causes part of the heart muscle to thicken in about one in 500 people. It is most serious in the young and is exacerbated by exercise. In some countries, such as Italy, screening for this condition is mandatory for footballers and sufferers are not allowed to play. But in Britain it is up to individual clubs. Other, less common possible causes of sudden cardiac arrest include ARVD, another disorder of the heart muscle which causes part of it to turn to fat; faults with the heart’s electrical impulses; irregular rhythms; or defective heart valves.","Peter McAvoy was captain of Herkimer College football team in New York .

"A federal judge on Monday sentenced a man who pleaded guilty to slapping a crying toddler on an Atlanta-bound flight to serve eight months in federal prison. Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, was accused of using a racial slur to refer to the 19-month-old boy, who's black, and hitting him under the eye as the flight from Minneapolis descended to the Atlanta airport last February. He pleaded guilty in October to simple assault after reaching a plea agreement with prosecutors. Prosecutors had recommended a sentence of six months in prison, and Hundley reserved his right to argue for a lower sentence. U.S. Magistrate Judge Alan Baverman said he imposed a higher sentence in part because of Hundley's criminal history, which includes a prior assault. Punishment: Joe Rickey Hundley, 60 . (left), has been sentenced to eight months for hitting Jonah Bennett . (right) after he started crying on a flight . Victim: Jonah Bennett's mother says that the boy began crying because he was feeling 'the pressure in his ears' as the plane began to land . Hundley's lawyer, Marcia Shein, objected . to the deviation from the recommendation in the plea agreement and said . after the hearing that she believes the sentence is disproportionate. Before . he was sentenced, Hundley told the judge he took full responsibility . for his actions and turned to apologize in person to Jessica Bennett, . the toddler's mother, who was in the courtroom. Hundley, who . lived in Idaho at the time, was on a Delta flight from Minneapolis to . Atlanta on February 8 and was seated in a window seat next to Bennett, who . was sitting in the aisle seat and had her 19-month-old son on her lap, . according to court filings. As the plane descended into Atlanta, . the child started crying. Hundley leaned over to Bennett and 'told her . to shut that (N-word) baby up,' according to a sworn statement from an . FBI agent who investigated the incident. Bennett asked Hundley what he . had said, and he leaned in with his face next to hers and said it again, . prosecutors have said. Speaking out: Jessica Bennett, pictured with her husband, was shocked when she said Joe Rickey Hundley demanded that she 'shut that (n-word) baby up' Hundley then slapped the child's face, leaving a scratch below his right eye, the FBI agent's statement says. 'When I looked at Jonah’s face, his eye was swollen... and it was bleeding. I was just scared to death,' Bennett said. She says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has become 'apprehensive to strangers' since. Hundley's . only son was in a coma in Atlanta after an insulin overdose that was . the result of a suspected suicide attempt, Shein has said. Hundley had . spent the prior day talking to his ex-wife and doctors after his son was . declared brain dead, Shein said, and he booked a last-minute flight to . Atlanta so he and his ex-wife could take their son off life support. 'I made the most terrible day in my life much worse for me and for others,' Hundley told the judge. Trauma: Mrs Bennett says Jonah was traumatized by the incident, and has since become 'apprehensive to strangers' Bennett has said Hundley became increasingly obnoxious and appeared intoxicated during the flight. Hundley . has been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings every day since March, . is undergoing 15 hours of counseling a week and has been helping others . deal with alcohol problems, Shein said. Hundley told the judge that he . shouldn't have had any alcohol the day of the incident. Shein . argued that Hundley has taken positive steps to address his alcohol and . anger issues and would be better served by house arrest or a halfway . house. Baverman said the case was difficult and emotional for . everyone involved. He said he understands the grief Hundley was . experienced and applauded the steps he's taken, but called the previous . assault and probation for an alcohol-related offense troubling. Outrage: Mrs Bennett, pictured with Jonah, said that Hundley also informed her that her child was too big to be a 'lap baby' 'You . cannot assault another individual, regardless of how sad or upset, or . even how intoxicated or sick, you are,' Baverman said. Fired: Hundley was an executive at AGC Aerospace & Defense before he was fired after the incident for what his company called disturbing allegations . In . addition to the prison sentence, Baverman ordered Hundley to pay Bennett . restitution of $105 and to pay a fine of $2,500 to the government. Baverman also ordered Hundley to serve a year of supervised release, . undergo alcohol abuse treatment and anger management counseling, and . perform 120 hours of community service, preferably in a homeless . shelter. Hundley was not immediately taken into custody and will . be allowed to report to prison once he gets an assignment. Shein said it . was too early to decide whether to appeal. Bennett gave an . emotional statement to the court before sentencing, saying her son . immediately changed from a bright and curious child to one who was . guarded and scared. For her part, she suffered fear, anxiety and . depression as a result of the attack, she said. Bennett said after the hearing that she was satisfied by the sentence and didn't believe Hundley's apology was genuine. 'It is my belief . that Mr. Hundley is a bully,' Bennett told the judge. 'He saw an easy . mark in a woman with a young child to unleash his bigotry.' Hundley . was fired from his executive position at AGC Aerospace & Defense in . the aftermath of the media firestorm spark by the altercation, his . attorney said. Injuries: Mrs Bennett said she was 'scared to death' when she saw that Jonah's eye was swollen . Situation: The incident occurred on a Delta flight on February 8, 2013 . The Oklahoma City-based military technology company issued a statement describing the executive's behavior as 'offensive and disturbing.' Lawyers for Hundley had said in court filings that the amount of media coverage his case received was highly unusual for a misdemeanor charge and added that 'it is impossible to avoid the reality that the national media has painted Mr. Hundley as a villain.' Hundley's son, whose age was not given, died the day after the flight, Shein said. Hundley 'has paid a terrible price for his hurtful words,' his lawyer said. He previously pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault in a Virginia court in 2007 after he was arrested following a fight with his girlfriend.","Joe Rickey Hundley, 60, has been sentenced to eight months jail .

"Cardinal Vincent Nichols made the comments just a week after Kieran Conry, the Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, resigned after a succession of affairs . Promiscuity is wrecking the chances of young people having happy marriages in later life, Britain’s most senior Roman Catholic said yesterday. Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, said that ‘casual relationships’ were wrong because they potentially involved sexual intercourse with a person’s future spouse. They helped to destroy the concept of marriage as a ‘permanent faithful commitment’, the Cardinal said, making it harder for couples to stick together through the bad times as well as the good. ‘I don’t doubt that most young people aspire to having their own family,’ said Cardinal Nichols, who is in Rome for the Extraordinary Synod on the family, convened by Pope Francis to discuss the growing challenges to marriage and family life. Young people, he continued, seek to have their own family ‘within the context of a stable relationship between husband and wife, having the family with a sense of permanence and a permanent faithful commitment’. But such aspirations were thwarted by the onset of premature sexual activity, such as casual sex and cohabitation, the Cardinal argued, suggesting that such practices were a direct cause of marital infidelity in later life. ‘Nobody wants a wife or a husband who is unfaithful,’ he said, ‘so what we have to get across to people is that casual relationships before marriage is actually being casual with somebody’s future husband or wife.’ The comments of Cardinal Nichols, the leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, were made during an interview with Catholic News Service, a U.S.-based news agency which was filmed and later posted on YouTube. But they come at an embarrassing time for the Catholic Church in Britain as they were made just a week after the Pope accepted the resignation of Kieran Conry, the Bishop of Arundel and Brighton, after a succession of affairs, including one allegedly with a married mother-of-two. The woman’s husband, who hired a private detective to spy on the couple, is threatening to sue the Church because he claims it must have known about the bishop’s affairs but did not act to stop him. The Cardinal’s views are supported however by sociological studies which found that many people who embark on a colourful sexual career were often unable to either find a spouse or sustain a marriage for life. They include research from The Marriage Foundation which revealed earlier this year that 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry. Research from The Marriage Foundation which revealed earlier this year that 47 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men aged 20 will never marry . The findings showed a contemporary generational shift away from marriage as couples increasingly cohabit without ever taking the decision to commit. Cohabitees, however, account for just 19 per cent of parents but 50 per cent of all family breakdown, with just seven per cent of cohabiting couples staying together until a child reaches 15 years. Such trends reflect a dramatic change in lifestyles compared to the baby-boomer generation, which has seen 87 per cent of men and 92 per cent of women having married at some stage. In 1970, the peak year for marriage, 564,818 men and women aged 25 got married. In 2010, just 56,598 tied the knot, a fall of 90 per cent. Patricia Morgan, the sociologist who coined the phrase ‘marriage lite’ for cohabitation, said Cardinal Nichols was right in his analysis. She said that studies from America have repeatedly shown that people who postpone sexual activity until maturity, or until they at least know their partner well, were more capable of a lasting relationship than those who did not. She blamed the propensity to plunge ‘straight into sex’ on contraceptive-based sex education and that in the ‘long run’ such relationships were comparatively unsuccessful. ‘We have abandoned courtship,’ she continued. ‘Sex education tells us that it’s the children’s choice when they become “active”, like a volcano blowing up. We have got rid of the rules, all of the rules.’ Dr Morgan said it would be better to encourage restraint and said it was also vital that young people were taught about the many distinctions between marriage and cohabitation. ‘People increasingly have a series “shack-ups”,’ she said, which were unstable, meaning that women in particular were increasingly leaving it too late to have children. ‘Some are very upset about it,’ she added. Louise Kirk, author of Sexuality Explained: A Guide for Parents and Children, said that the views of Cardinal Nichols were increasingly supported by science. She said: ‘The social and medical sciences can now quantify some of the ways in which pre-marital sexual experiences detract from later marriage. ‘Through brain scan technology, for instance, we know that sexual experience is such a powerful thing that it alters the physical makeup of the brain for life. This is designed to “glue” us to our partner.’ Research by Patrick Fagan of the U.S. Heritage Foundation put this into perspective, she said. ‘A woman who has only ever had one sexual partner has an 80 per cent chance of a successful marriage,’ said Mrs Kirk. ‘Add in one extra partner, and it falls to 54 per cent, add a second and it drops to 44 per cent.’ She added: ‘One also of course runs the risk of damage to fertility from STDs and the use of contraception.’","Cardinal said casual sex meant sleeping with a person's future spouse .

"The BBC has refused to apologise to the Argentinian ambassador following the Jeremy Clarkson licence plate controversy . The BBC has refused to apologise to the Argentinian ambassador after Jeremy Clarkson drove through the country with a number plate which was thought to reference the Falklands War. The Top Gear cast and crew had to flee the South American country after they were attacked by an angry mob, which Clarkson described as 'the most terrifying thing I've ever been involved in.' Alicia Castro, the Argentinian ambassador to the UK, demanded an apology from BBC head of television Danny Cohen during a meeting this month - which the corporation has now refused to give. Clarkson, who has been widely criticised in the past for making  insensitive jokes, was pictured in a Porsche with the licence plate 'H982 FKL' - thought by some to refer to the war of 1982. In a letter to Ms Castro, Mr Cohen said the BBC would also go ahead and broadcast the programme. He said: 'We will ensure that these programmes are a fair representation of what took place throughout their stay.' He added: 'I am very aware that some have questioned whether the number plates were in some way a prank. 'I would like to reassure you again that nothing we have seen or read since the team returned supports the view that this was a deliberate act.' Cohen said 'the BBC was disturbed by the violence the team faced during their visit'. Top Gear executive producer Andy Wilman previously denied the number plate was a 'stunt' and presenter Jeremy Clarkson said he was 'shocked' when someone pointed out the link between the number plate and the Falklands War days into filming. Scroll down for video . Clarkson and the Top Gear team were forced to flee Argentina this summer after the outspoken presenter was spotted driving around the country with a number plate believed to reference the Falklands War of 1982 . Ms Castro is not the first diplomat to be upset by the long-running motoring show. In 2011, the BBC had to apologise to the Mexican ambassador over comments made by Clarkson and co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond. May described Mexican food as 'like sick with cheese on it' and Clarkson predicted they would not get any complaints about the show because 'at the Mexican embassy, the ambassador is going to be sitting there with a remote control like this (snores). They won’t complain, it’s fine.' In fact the Mexican ambassador, His Excellency Eduardo Medina-Mora Icaza, did complain complain about the 'outrageous, vulgar and inexcusable insults' and the BBC was forced to say sorry.

"The New York City Council has passed a bill lowering the maximum speed limit from 30mph to 25 mph. The change is part of Mayor Bill de Blasio's effort to cut down on pedestrian deaths, which have rocketed up by 15 per cent in recent years. It will come into effect  on November 7, applying to all streets where a maximum speed is not posted, which amounts to around 90 per cent of the city. Slowing down: Bill de Blasio announced that 90 per cent of New York City's streets will have a 25mph limit . De Blasio's 'Vision Zero' initiative aims to eliminate traffic fatalities with 63 proposed law changes. Pedestrians have double the chance of survival if hit by a car going just five miles per hour slower than the current speed limit, studies claim. Flanked by tearful families of car crash victims, de Blasio said: 'Families and children will be safer because of what we're doing here today. 'Lowering the speed limit will save lives. 'This is a major step toward achieving Vision Zero, and it depends on every New Yorker taking personal responsibility and putting the lives of their neighbors first.' Emotional: The mayor was flanked by tearful families of crash victims as he signed the bill on Monday . The council vote, with 44 for the motion, came on Tuesday. It is the first time in more than 50 years the council has voted to drop the speed limit. Backing the campaign, Meera Joshi, chair of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said: 'The 25 mph speed limit will benefit taxi and other for-hire drivers in a number of ways. 'First, it will create a safer work environment for them all, but it will also help both passengers and drivers understand our shared responsibility of putting an end to traffic deaths and injuries.' She added: 'Passengers - please tip for safety and not speed!'

"A top climate change expert at the Environmental Protection Agency has admitted to defrauding the government out of more than $900,000 by claiming he was an undercover CIA agent so he didn't have to show up for work for months at a time. John C. Beale, 65, was the agency's highest paid employee and reported directly to EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy during most of the 13 years he ran the scam. NBC News reports that no one at the agency questioned or looked into his claims that he was working undercover for the CIA. He left the office for weeks or months - claiming he was at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, or in Pakistan working on covert missions. Really, he was home reading, riding his bicycle or doing housework. Sometimes he escaped to his vacation home on Cape Cod, prosecutors say. Fraud: John C. Beale (pictured on December 16 in court) admitted to defrauding the government out of $900,000 by not showing up to work . He billed taxpayers for 33 plane flights between 2003 and 2011, including personal trips to London and California, which he flew first class. He stayed in five-star hotels and billed the government for expensive meals and limo rides. The total cost: more than $266,000. He also publicly 'retired,' but managed to continue drawing his $206,000 salary for 18 months - despite brazenly throwing a retirement party for himself that was attended by McCarthy. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy was Beale's boss during most of the 13 years he allegedly committed fraud . He even lied and said he had contracted malaria while serving in the Vietnam War in order to get a handicapped parking spot. He neither had malaria nor served in Vietnam, according to prosecutors. EPA Assistant Inspector General Patrick Sullivan told NBC that Beale perpetrated a 'crime of massive proportions.' In October, Beale admitted to the shocking fraud. Prosecutors are asking for a 30-month prison sentence, but defense lawyers say the judge should give him leniency because he suffered from a 'highly self-destructive and dysfunctional need to engage in excessively reckless, risky behavior.' Sullivan, who investigated Beale, said he believes the culture of the EPA made it ripe for this sort of fraud. 'There’s a certain culture here at the EPA where the mission is the most important thing,' he told NBC. 'They don’t think like criminal investigators. They tend to be very trusting and accepting.' Beale is a Princeton-educated 'senior policy adviser' who worked as one of the EPA's top climate change experts. He . helped rewrite the Clean Air Act in 1990, led EPA delegations at . climate change conferences in 2000 and 2001, and helped negotiate carbon . emissions agreements with India and China. Sometime along his career, his work stopped being enough. He was caught only after McCarthy, who was appointed EPA administrator in July, discovered that he was still on the payroll in March 2012 - nearly six months after his retirement party. She called for an investigation, which led to the criminal charges. Beale didn't actually retire until this April. Beale is married to Nancy Kete, who President Barack Obama appointed the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. She is currently managing director of the Rockafeller Foundation. The couple own a $872,000 townhouse in Arlington, Virginia, and a $626,000 vacation home on Cape Cod.","John C.

"Back pay: John Zelepos, owner of Mystic Pizza, is being forced to pay back wages to 110 employees . A Connecticut restaurant owner will pay a total of more than $105,000 in back pay to 110 employees after cheating them out of wages for more than two years. The State of Connecticut Department of Labor began investigating Mystic Pizza  owner John Zelepos after receiving three individual complaints from mis- or unpaid employees, NBC Connecticut reports. The investigation found that Zelepos reportedly has more than 150 minimum wage and overtime violations where employees received less than minimum wage or did not receive required overtime pay. The DOL reports that Zelepos paid employees working as hosts, cooks, and dishwashers as little as $5.69 an hour. Others received $7.40 an hour, but, at the time, Connecticut state minimum wage was set at $8.70. From May 2012 to May 2014, Zelepos reportedly failed to pay employees properly for their overtime work, paid employees in cash, and worked employees more than 93 hours per week. NBC reports that Zelepos is being ordered by the DOL to pay a total of $105,165.94 in back pay as well as $23,400 in civil penalties. Overtime: Officials say some employees worked 93 hours per week and Zelepos failed to properly pay and document their overtime hours . Zelepos is providing the DOL with payroll checks of the 110 employees ranging from $30 to more than $15,000, according to NBC. Gary K. Pechie, Wage and Workplace Standards director, said in a statement that similar situations occur 'far too often.' Fired: NBC reports that the Connecticut Department of Labor  is now investigating a claim that one employee was fired after trying to report wage violations to the DOL . Pechi stated: 'Every employee deserves to be paid the required amount for the work that they do, and this is a flagrant example of an employer taking advantage of their workforce. 'We encourage any individual who believes they have not been paid properly for hours worked to file a complaint with the Labor Department.' NBC reports that the DOL is now investigating a claim that one employee was fired after trying to report wage violations to the DOL. Mystic Pizza, located in Connecticut, has been open since 1973, but became popularized by the 1988 film 'Mystic Pizza' starring Julia Roberts and Annabeth Gish. The film was named after the Connecticut restaurant caught the eye of the film's screenwriter, Amy Holden Jones.","John Zelepos is being ordered by the Department of Labor to pay a total of $105,000 in back pay to 110 Mystic Pizza employees .

"Schumacher is 'showing small signs of progress' his spokeswoman said on Sunday . Michael Schumacher is 'showing small signs of progress' as he continues to slowly recover from devastating brain injuries suffered in a ski accident, his spokeswoman said today. Speaking on live television, the driver's manager Sabine Kehm spoke of the F1 legend's recovery and how his 'little bit of progress makes us very happy.' Miss Kehm told German broadcaster ARD: 'There are short moments of consciousness and he is showing small signs of progress. 'There are moments when he is awake and moments when he is conscious. 'Of course I am not a doctor, but medically, there is a distinction between being awake and being conscious, the latter meaning there is an ability to interact with his surroundings. 'I don't want to disclose details out of respect for the family, but we have no doubt at all in the abilities of the doctors treating Michael, they are experts in their field.' Doctors put Schumacher . into a medically induced coma after he hit his head on a rock while . skiing at the French resort of Meribel on December 29. Miss Kehm . insisted Schumacher will be brought out of the coma - but did not indicate how long the process would take. She added that . if and when Schumacher is moved to a rehabilitation clinic - to begin . the long recovery process of learning to speak and move again - his . state of health will become a 'private matter' and no more news will be . forthcoming. She said: 'Michael Schumacher is in a coma and can not . decide what is reported about him. We of course know how he deals with . such things and try in his interest to handle these matters for him.' Sabine Kehm, Schumacher's manager, speaks on TV panel talk show 'Guenther Jauch' this evening where she discussed the driver's health and recovery . Her words this evening come just hours after International Automobile Federation president Jean Todt said the driver was still 'fighting' for his life and his future remains uncertain. 'I . see him very often and he's still fighting. He's fighting and we can . only hope and pray that it will improve over the future,' Todt told . journalists on the sidelines of World Touring Car Championship race in . Marrakech. 'It has been a tragedy this accident. A tragedy for Michael, a tragedy for his family. 'Michael is in very good hands with fantastic dedicated doctors in the hospital in Grenoble. 'Obviously, I'm very close to him, to the family,' Todt added. Manager: Sabine Kehm said that charges would be pressed against anyone buying the documents . Tonight, Miss Kehm told interviewer Guenther Jauch of the extreme lengths some fans have gone in order to get . close to the driver in hospital. She . said one man was stopped by security before he got on to Schumacher's . intensive care ward at the University of Grenoble Hospital posing as his . father Rolf. In . another instance two people who wanted to take a photo of the . 45-year-old racing driver on mobile phones were halted by bodyguards in . the hospital lobby. Schumacher suffered severe brain injuries . in a low-speed ski run on the slopes of the French resort and had to be airlifted to hospital where he underwent two . emergency operations.

"A natural drug found in the soil of Easter Island could help people live longer and improve their memory in old age, scientists claim. In tests in mice, the rapamycin drug halted the decline in brain function as the rodents aged, and offered hope that it could also treat depression. Now scientists are planning to trial the 'holy grail of anti-ageing' in pet dogs, which they say will provide a more realistic test environment to predict how it would work on humans. Scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle are planning to trial the drug in pet dogs, which they say will provide a more realistic test environment to predict how it would work on humans . The drug, rapamycin, is a bacterial by-product discovered in the shadows of the island's famous statues and is named after Rapa Nui, the Polynesian name for Easter Island. It is already used in transplant patients to prevent organ rejection and several years ago, scientists in the journal Neuroscience, said it can improve learning and help treat cognitive decline. In mice, it has been shown to extend the lives of mice by 13 per cent in females and nine per cent in males. Due to the high costs, the compound's effect on lifespan has not yet been tested in people, according to a report by Erika Check Hayden in Nature.

The existing version of the drug also increases the risk of cancer and would need to be modified before using in human trials. However, researchers believe further research will lead them to similar - but less harmful - anti-therapies. 'Any compound has side effects of some sort; the question is what kind of side effects one can live with,' says Randy Strong, a gerontologist at the Barshop Institute told Nature. Matthew Kaeberlein and Daniel Promislow at the University of Washington in Seattle propose to give low doses of rapamycin to dogs. The researchers today invited experts in canine health and the biology to a meeting to discuss how to structure such a trial. An initial trial would involve about 30 dogs, half of which would receive the drug. They hope to test the drug in large dogs that typically live for eight to ten years, and will start giving rapamycin to the animals aged six to nine. According to Nature, the trial could be completed in as little as three years, but researchers will know within months whether rapamycin proves effective.

Mrs Brooks, of Tonyrefail, near Pontypridd, said she had no choice to keep sending him to school, due to strict guidelines imposed over absence  in South Wales. She also accused schools of being more concerned with absence statistics than a child's well-being. Writing on Facebook, she said:  'Simon was forced to go to school despite what he was enduring. He is now dead after taking his own life.' She added: 'I used to physically wring my hands as Simon left for school. I'd stand in the hallway and say to myself ""what can I do?"". 'It was horrible and I felt helpless because I was damned if I sent him to school and damned if I didn't - it was so frustrating.' Mrs Brooks made the comments amid publication of a controversial booklet, handed out across South Wales earlier this week, which sets out guidelines for parents in relation to absence. She said the leaflet - which says children should not take any time off even if they contract some contagious illnesses - shows that schools are more concerned only with attendance statistics than a child's well-being. She said: 'This booklet emphasises that fact and makes what I was feeling at the time very tangible. 'This booklet is all about making schools look good and not about the child's well-being.' Mrs Brooks has criticised this controversial booklet, handed out in schools across South Wales last week, which set guidelines for parents to follow in relation to absence . Simon, who attended Y Pant Comprehensive School, had experienced bullying for most of his life. He died at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, four days after taking an overdose. At the time of his death, Mrs Brooks told how Simon had been bullied at  his current school and at his previous school in Treorchy, South Wales, where he was allegedly assaulted on a train on the way to school. But she said Simon did not want to press charges or complain to the school authorities, because he felt it would only make things worse. She said: 'He was being pushed about, having his bag grabbed and subjected to verbal abuse. 'He loved the lessons and had a lovely group of friends, but he wasn't being left alone at break times and lunchtimes. 'Every Sunday night he would beg me not to send him to school. During the school holidays he would count the days and hours until he had to go back. 'He was so brave he used to go every day and try to stick up for himself.' The guide to 'managing sickness absence from school' claims to only offer 'guidance' for parents and urges them to consult the NHS Direct website and their local GPs for further advice . Although it does not refer to bullying specifically, the two-page booklet recommends pupils take no time off school if they contract a range of conditions including conjunctivitis and glandular fever . Mrs Brooks said Simon had also been punished for taking wine into school nine months before his death to 'numb the pain of the bullies'. After his death, Mrs Brooks and husband David wanted lessons to be learned. They met with the school's headteacher Mark Powell to discuss what had happened. She said Mr Powell and his staff had been 'trying very hard' but schools were under pressure from government and were 'under the microscope'. In the leaflet, which sparked Mrs Brooks' comments, the two-page booklet recommends pupils take no time off school if they contract a range of conditions including conjunctivitis and glandular fever. Among the illnesses listed on the booklet as not needing time off school are head lice, threadworm and hand foot and mouth disease. The latter is a viral infection described on the NHS DIrect website as a 'contagious' and 'unpleasant condition'. Glandular fever brings out symptoms including loss of appetite, extreme tiredness and swollen glands in the neck, armpits and groin areas. Mrs Brooks said she felt 'helpless' sending her son to school and the new booklet makes what she was feeling at the time very 'tangible' The guide  to 'managing sickness absence from school' claims to only offer 'guidance' for parents and urges them to consult the NHS Direct website and their local GPs for further advice. Mrs Brooks added: 'It's targeting all the wrong things in all the wrong ways. 'I'm hoping the combination of things will get the booklet discontinued - it's complete nonsense. 'If a child gets tonsillitis they're sick and if a parent takes them to school, the school will only ring the parents to get them to collect the child. 'To say I'm angry is an understatement. It's about allowing the school to decide if your child is ill or not and the booklet has not been given any thought.' The guide was published by a working group, consisting of members from the Central South Consortium and five county councils: Cardiff, Vale of Glamorgan, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Merthyr. Local authorities are said to be under pressure from the Welsh education watchdog Estyn to improve attendance levels across the region. A spokesman for the Central South Consortium said: 'The medical advice printed has been obtained directly from the Health Protection Agency in England in conjunction with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. 'Consultation was carried out with Cwm Taf, Cardiff and the Vale and Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Boards and Public Health Wales who all approved the content of the advice table.'

"High-energy particles called cosmic rays that smash into Earth's atmosphere could be detected by a global network of smartphones. That's according to researchers who have developed an app that can detect incoming particles from elsewhere in the universe. This could help scientists detect and track rare cosmic ray events, and it may help to work out exactly where they are going from. Scroll down for video . University of California scientists have created an app to track cosmic rays. A giant detector could be made by combining smartphones around the world. These could then alert scientists when cosmic rays (illustrated) hit our planet. Sensors in the camera of smartphones can detect incoming particles . The app was devised by scientists at the University of California, Irvine. Called Crayfis (Cosmic Rays Found in Smartphones), the app collects data in the background when the phone is not being used. It will be available to uses on both iOS and Android, although it is currently only in limited beta mode. To detect cosmic rays the app makes use of the silicon-based sensors in smartphone cameras. A long-standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high-energy particles from space that hit Earth. Called cosmic rays, they're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at Cern's Large Hadron Collider. They strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles, mostly muons, electrons and photons, over a wide area. Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated. It's thought that some come from supernovas, but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well. The digital sensors in a smartphone are sensitive to particles in a cosmic ray shower, and they can also provide location information thanks to GPS. 'Most importantly, there are 1.5 billion active smartphones spread across the planet,' the researchers write on their website. 'Essentially, this detector has already been deployed; all that is missing is the app to collect the data.' As a side benefit, the same data can be used to calculate local levels of radiation from radon or other sources and function as an alarm system. The network of phones could provide a real-time radiation weather map, following the movement of plumes, for instance. With regards to cosmic rays this is the first attempt to demonstrate that a global network of devices can rival or exceed the scientific capabilities of huge, dedicated cosmic ray experiment sites such as the Auger Experiment in South America. 'Whole square kilometers can be drenched in these particles for a few milliseconds,' said UC Irvine physicist Dr Daniel Whiteson, who created the app with colleague Dr Michael Mulhearn. 'The mystery is nobody knows where these crazy, high-energy particles are coming from or what's making them so energetic. But they can be captured by technology in smartphones' cameras.' People can now sign up for email alerts on the official website to find out when the app will be available to use. The app use a phone's camera sensors to detect high-energy cosmic rays. Anyone will be able to download the app and join the network (stock image shown). It's hoped the project may reveal the origins of cosmic rays. These high-energy particles originate elsewhere in the universe and hit Earth .","University of California scientists create app to track cosmic rays .

"Sitting outside his mud-brick home in the tiny village of Meliandou, Guinea, Etienne Ouamouno holds a crumpled picture in which he cradles his newborn son, Emile. Etienne explains that Emile was a playful toddler, and used to like playing outside the house with his ball and listening to the radio. But in December last year, the two-year-old got sick. The toddler came down with a sky-high fever, began vomiting, and passing black stools. At the time, Etienne had no idea what was wrong, but experts now believe that Emile was Ebola 'patient zero' - the first person to contract the virus, starting the current outbreak. Scroll down for video . Etienne Ouamouno (centre) has spoken about his son, Emile (left, as a baby) who is believed to be the first person to have died in the latest Ebola outbreak. The virus also killed Etienne's wife (right) Etienne said his son used to play ball outside his house, and liked listening to the radio (right). Etienne also lost his daughter and mother-in-law to the disease, which killed 14 in his village . It took Emile just four days to die, passing away on December 6. His sister, Philomène, fell sick on Christmas Day and was dead before New Year. Their mother followed, along with their grandmother. Etienne told UNICEF: 'Before my children Emile and Philomène died, they loved to play with a ball. My wife liked to carry the baby on her back.' Now all he has to remember his loved ones by are a few crumpled photographs. Nobody knows how exactly Emile caught the deadly virus, though it is likely that he somehow came into contact with the dead body of an infected animal - a fruit bat, chimpanzee or porcupine. Jim Yong Kim, the head of the World Bank, has appealed for 5,000 more doctors to help fight Ebola in Africa. Speaking in Ethiopia, Mr Kim said the spread of the disease was outstripping international efforts to stop it. He said he was 'worried' about where the extra medical staff would come from, and suggested travel bans would help contain the virus. The village of Meliandou sits in Guéckédou province, along the borders with both Sierra Leone and Liberia, where the disease now runs rampant. Medics studying how Ebola first spread believe two mourners were infected at the grandmother's funeral. Somehow the village midwife also became infected, and before she died on February 2, gave the virus to one of her relatives. It wasn't until March that the mystery sickness was recognised as Ebola and, by that time, dozens of people had died in eight communities in Guinea and suspected cases were emerging in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Nearly a year on from the death of Emile Ouamouno, more than 5,000 people have died as far afield as America in the midst of the worst Ebola outbreak in history. Etienne's village is now free of Ebola, but his family has been torn apart by the illness. Emile Ouamouno is listed as the first to die in his village from a then-unknown disease - which experts now believe was the first case in the current Ebola outbreak . The virus has since left Etienne's village, with no confirmed cases since April, but his family life is in tatters - and all he has to remember them by are crumpled pictures . Etienne is now facing financial hardship, as his tiny community - which survived almost exclusively by selling crops to neighbouring communities - has been shunned . Worse still, the impoverished community has been ostracized by the rest of Guinea. Its main source of income was selling bananas and rice to nearby villages, but they no longer want to trade. Villagers fearful of catching the deadly virus also burned their clothes and mattresses, but now cannot replace them. Elsewhere, in Sierra Leone, medical workers have been shunned by their own families as they struggle to treat the sick in makeshift treatment centers. The workers say they have been left with nowhere to go as landlords evict them as soon as they discover where they are working. Added to that misery, the medics have not been paid for the last two weeks as the government struggles to keep up with the spread of the virus. By the time the illness had been identified as Ebola and treatment centres set up in Guéckédou province, where Etienne and his family live, it had already spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia . Brelesse Ouamouno and his daughter stand next to the shallow grave where his wife was buried after dying from Ebola in February this year . Across Guinea children have been orphaned after their parents died from Ebola (pictured). While tradition means they would have been adopted by neighbours, fears over the virus have left them on the streets . Unsurprisingly, medical staff make up a significant proportion of fatalities, with an estimated 57 per cent of medics working with Ebola patients eventually succumbing to the disease, according to the World Health Organisation. In total, say the most recent reports, 377 health workers across West Africa have succumbed to the virus, with 216 now dead. Today the head of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim appealed for more medical staff to travel to West Africa to help fight the infection, saying the disease is outstripping efforts to stop it. Speaking on a visit to Ethiopia, Mr Kim said at least 5,000 more staff were needed to bring the situation under control. Mali has become the sixth African country to report a case of Ebola after a toddler died last week. More than 80 people who had contact with the boy are now being monitored, according to WHO. Senegal and Nigeria had also reported cases of the disease, but managed to stop it from spreading after tracking down all possible victims and monitoring them, a feat medics hope to repeat in Mali. From Etienne's village, the disease spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia (pictured) where it has infected more than 10,000 people and killed 5,000 . Medical staff in the madly-affected African nations are struggling to deal with the outbreak, with 57 per cent of all health workers who come into contact with Ebola eventually succumbing to it . Fear and misunderstanding over the killer disease has lead many to shun those trying to treat the illness, who are often thrown out by their own families (pictured, a sign warning about Ebola is seen in Guinea) Meanwhile, in America, the disease has also wrong-footed authorities, who have been thrown into apparent chaos over how to treat those who are returning from fighting the disease in Africa. The chief of the Army, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, have all said  those returning from crisis-hit areas will be confined to their homes for 21 days. The move came after it was revealed Dr Craig Spencer, who is currently being treated in New York for the virus, roamed freely around the city for six days before he was diagnosed. Even in developed nations, such as the US, authorities have struggled to  respond to the disease. Nurse Kaci Hickox (pictured) was quarantined in a hospital car park this weekend after returning from treating the illness in Africa, despite testing negative for the virus .","Emile Ouamouno, two, is named as 'patient zero' of current Ebola outbreak .

"A beaming smile erupts across Winesi March's face as a doctor removes a bandage covering his eyes, allowing him to see his grandson for the very first time. A simple £30 operation, which took just six minutes, has restored the blind grandfather's sight. Footage shows the 69-year-old grinning and bursting into a celebratory song and dance with his entire family, as the bandages are peeled away. Winesi was overjoyed to be able to look at his wife Namaleta's face, whom he had not seen properly for 12 years because of cataracts in both his eyes. And the life-changing operation means he was able to look at his 18-month-old grandson Luka for the first time. Winesi March, 69, was able to see his 18-month-old grandson Luka for the first time ever, after being blind for two years and visually impaired for 12. He said: 'I never imagined how Luka would look. I'm so happy to see him again. I said ""ah this is how looks!""' Winesi has his bandages removed as part of a live broadcast, after doctors carried out a procedure to remove cataracts from both his eyes . Cameras caught the exact moment Winesi's was able to see. He said he hopes his story encourages other to have surgery if they need it. 'I am proud that my story will be used to inspire other people' he said . Winesi is able to see his wife Namaleta properly for the first time in 12 years. He said: 'I am meeting her twice. I am born again.' Namaleto said her husband getting his sight back is a dream come true. She said: 'I never ever dreamt of this happening to our family. There wasn’t much information in our area about eye care' Winesi underwent an operation at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, after his eyes deteriorated and he became completely blind two years ago. Previously, Winesi worked as a farmer in the small village of Kalima in Malawi. Three years ago, although his sight was deteriorating, he could still make out the path and get around, and so could help with planting and hoeing. But since he became completely blind, working has always led to painful injuries, so he was confined to sitting on a mat all day, needing assistance to go the toilet or prepare food. He was scared someone would attack him and he would be unable to defend himself. And he worried about his wife shouldering all the burden of providing for the family. But after being referred for treatment by an outreach ophthalmic clinical officer, Winesi had an operation which was livestreamed on the internet. He said: 'Now I can see I can go back to my business. I want to get back to work on my farm and start cooking again and doing everything. 'When I saw my wife today I thought to myself. I am meeting her twice. I am born again. I never imagined how Luka would look. I'm so happy to see him again. I said ""ah this is how looks!""' His wife Namaleto added: 'I never ever dreamt of this happening to our family. There wasn’t much information in our area about eye care.' The six minute procedure was carried out by Malawian eye surgeon Dr Gerald Msukwa for the charity Sightsavers, whose 'A Million Miracles' campaign aims to provide one million cataract operations in developing countries with few eye doctors. Winesi is overjoyed at being able to see, having been completely blind for the last two years . The whole family is overjoyed and bursts into a celebratory song and dance. Winesi said he is excited to start cooking and farming again . After being completely blind for two years, Winesi had never seen 18-month-old  grandson Luka before this day . They estimate that there are 20 million people in the world blind from cataracts, often unable to access the straightforward surgery . As the procedure to correct cataracts is straightforward and only costs £30, they hope to raise £30 million to pay for more operations in developing countries. The Department of International Development (DfID) has said it will match any donation given to the charity in the first three months of the campaign pound for pound. In the UK more than 50 per cent of adults over the age of 65 have cataract, a condition that causes sight to become blurred and gradually lost, the charity estimates. Dr Msukwa said: 'The challenges are enormous. At the moment in Malawi there are only eight surgeons [for a population of more than 14 million people], so one issue is the number of doctors versus the patient need. 'Another is that in a poorly-resourced country people don't seek help. They are stuck somewhere and the doctor is somewhere else – until you link the two: that is when you start to make an impact.'

"An Islamic cleric has visited the family home of slain terrorist Numan Haider where he said relatives of the 18-year-old are coming to terms with their grief. Sheikh Abu Ayman, the director of the Muslim-based Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jama'ah Association of Australia - said members of Haider's family wept on his shoulder as he spent time consoling mourning relatives at their Endeavour Hills home, south east of Melbourne, on Thursday. Mr Abu Ayman said the 18-year-old's parents were being supported by 'Allah' to help them cope with his death two days after he was fatally shot by police officers outside a Victorian police station. 'When you lose your youngest son, it's not a simple thing - especially when you only have three sons,' he said. Scroll down for video . Shiekh Abu Ayman visits the house of Numan Haider in Melbourne where he said the family is relying on 'Allah' to cope with its loss . Mourners have been coming and going from the home since the 18-year-old's death on Tuesday . Like the death of any close relative he said the Haider family are feeling a deep sorrow for the loss of Numan. 'I would say Allah give them so much patience to cope with tragedy. 'They cry on my shoulder.' Sheikh Abu Ayman's words come as distraught relatives have been seen coming and going from the family's home in Melbourne's outer suburbs ever since Haider's death on Tuesday. Police fatally shot Numan Haider outside the Endeavour Hills police station where it was arranged they would meet the 18-year-old  after conducting raids on his home Tuesday morning. It was agreed that Haider would greet a Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night, however police allege he had other ideas. Seconds after meeting the 18-year-old he took out a weapon and repeatedly stabbed both officers. He was then killed by a single shot. Sheikh Ayman said on Thursday that he never met Naider but was present at the home to support the family and pay his respects. He said he felt 'sadness' for both the family of Haider and the officers injured in Tuesday's violent attack. 'With all the sadness in my heart about what happened from either side and I am in the middle,' he said. 'I look at my right I see the sorrow of the two police families being hit in that way. 'I look to me left and see this family losing a young man of theirs, of ours, of Australia.' Sheikh Ayman said Haider's loss was being felt across the entire Muslim community . Sheikh Ayman said Haider's death was reverberating through the  entire Muslim community. 'As my feeling exactly, sad and sorrow, full of questions without answers.' Sheikh Ayman also asked the Australian community to band together at this time. 'I hope the media...[is] just in their reports something that unites us and brings us together as Australians,' he said. 'There enough troubles around us [in the world]...we don't have to bring the trouble home.' Two other women, also strangers of the 18-year-old, said the family were left asking why this had happened Haider. They said they were there because they were of the same nationality and religion as the slain teenager. 'We came here as a human. If it happens for anyone, we feel sorry for them,' one of the female mourners said. Two women, who identified as being of the same religious background and nationality of Numan Haider, said they 'felt sorry' for the family . 'They're [the family] crying, they're crying and saying ""How is it possible my son do it like this?""' The pair of women also had questions for the authorities. 'He's 18, he's a teenager,' the other woman said. 'I was 18 years old and I did not know a thing. If someone make a mistake you don't shoot him. 'I feel let down because either they're [the police] lying to me for what they're making up or they've really been attacked by an 18-year-old. 'How long have you been trained, you've been trained to protect yourself. If you can't do that - how can I feel safe, how can you feel safe?' It is understood Haider had been under investigation by authorities for at least three months, However police acted when they had become concerned about some of his recent activities and rhetoric.","Islamic Sheikh Abu Ayman said the family of Numan Haider is relying on 'Allah' to cope with their loss .

"An elderly pensioner has died after being accidentally run over by her own husband twice on their driveway, it has been claimed. Witnesses have said that Jennifer Robinson, 81, had been collecting bags from the boot of the car when her husband inadvertently put the Golf into reverse. Despite being hit at a 'low speed' outside the block of converted flats in the market town of Caistor, Lincolnshire, Mrs Robinson died of her injuries. Emergency services were called to the scene at around midday on Sunday, and Lincolnshire Police confirmed a 76-year-old man was spoken to and was helping police with their inquiries. Officers are not treating the pensioner's death as suspicious and believe it to be a tragic accident. An elderly pensioner has died after being accidentally run over by her own husband twice on their driveway in Caistor, Lincolnshire . Detectives are still urging witnesses who saw anything to come forward and get in touch with them. A force spokeswoman said: 'Police are appealing for witnesses to a collision in Caistor on Sunday October 5 in which an 81-year-old female pedestrian died. 'The incident happened around midday and involved a silver Volkswagen Golf. 'A 76-year-old man who was also involved in the incident was not injured and is assisting police with inquiries. 'Officers have conducted a number of inquiries in the area and are keen to hear from anyone who witnessed the incident.' Residents living in the picturesque village have been left shocked by the death of the popular pensioner. Witnesses have said that Jennifer Robinson, 81, had been collecting the bags from the boot of the car when her husband inadvertently put his Golf car into reverse . A local resident, who did not wish to be named, said she had been collecting the bags from the boot of the car when her husband inadvertently put the vehicle into reverse. He added: 'They had come back from Tesco's having done their weekly shop and she went to get the shopping out of the boot. 'Her husband has then put the car into reverse by accident and ran over her, she went beneath the wheels. 'Tragically, he's then panicked and put it into first and ran over her again. 'He must be feeling absolutely terrible, it is so sad. 'They are new to the area but I believe they lived elsewhere in the village before moving here, so they are well known in town. 'It just doesn't bear thinking about what her husband must be going through right now and what he has seen.' Mrs Robinson was said to be a very well-liked woman in the community of Caistor (stock picture) A spokeswoman for East Midlands Ambulance Service said: 'We received a call at 11.55am on Sunday to Caistor, Market Rasen, reporting a female in her 80s who had been hit by a car and was suffering serious injuries. 'Our LIVES-community first responders, and Fast Response Vehicle were first on scene. 'Fire Service were called to assist because the patient was badly trapped. 'Despite best effort of those involved, the patient sadly was pronounced dead on scene.' Fred Cockerton, 77, added: 'We've been told her husband accidentally drove into her, not at great speed but at her age she was obviously quite frail . 'She was a very popular woman in the community, although I did not know her personally I've heard she was a lovely lady. 'They were a doting couple too by all accounts and you've got to really feel for the old chap too, you can't imagine how he must be feeling at the moment.' Another local, who wished to remain anonymous, added: 'What a shame though, it sounds utterly tragic.'

"Sex could keep the Ebola epidemic . alive even after the World Health Organization (WHO) declares an . area free of the disease, one of the discoverers of the deadly . virus said on Tuesday. The WHO is hoping to announce later this week that Nigeria . and Senegal are free of Ebola after 42 days with no infections. The 42 days is the standard period for declaring an outbreak over, twice the . maximum 21-day incubation period of the virus. Scroll down for video . The World Health Organization is warning people in West Africa, including Liberia (pictured), to avoid unprotected sex, as the Ebola virus can live in semen for months after infection . Rescue workers like this one in Liberia continue to fight against the spread of the disease. But WHO has some positive news: they are getting closer to declaring Nigeria and Senegal free of Ebola, after 42 days without any new infections . However, it appears the disease can last much longer in . semen. 'In a convalescent male, the virus can persist in semen for . at least 70 days; one study suggests persistence for more than . 90 days,' the WHO said in an information note on Monday. 'Certainly, the advice has to be for survivors to use a . condom, to not have unprotected sex, for 90 days,' said Peter . Piot, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical . Medicine and a discoverer of Ebola in 1976. 'If we would apply the rule for double the time, that would . be 180 days — six months,' he told reporters in Geneva. 'I think it (90 days) is probably a . compromise, for practicality.' Ebola spreads via bodily fluids such as blood and saliva, . but it has also been detected in breast milk and urine, as well . as semen, the WHO says. The whole live virus has never been . isolated from sweat, however. More than 3,400 people are already known to have died in the . world's worst Ebola outbreak on record, the vast majority of . them in three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra . Leone. Meanwhile, WHO says Europe will almost inevitably see more cases of the deadly Ebola virus within its borders — but the continent is well prepared to control the disease. Speaking just hours after Europe's first local case of Ebola infection was confirmed in a nurse in Spain, the WHO's European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said further such events were 'unavoidable.' Spanish health officials said four people had been hospitalised to try and stem any further spread of Ebola there after the nurse became the first person in the world known to have contracted the virus outside of Africa. A Liberian Ministry of Health worker, dressed in an anti-contamination suit, speaks to Banu, 4, in a holding center for suspected Ebola patients at Redemption Hospital  in Monrovia . 'Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely,' Jakabsaid. 'It is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.' Several countries in the WHO's European region, including France, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Norway and Spain, have treated patients repatriated after contracting the disease in West Africa, where Ebola has been raging through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since March. Ebola has infected some 7,200 people in West Africa, killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Cases have also been imported into Nigeria, Senegal and the United States. Jakab said that within Europe, health workers caring for repatriated Ebola patients, as well as their families and close contacts, were most at risk of becoming infected. 'But the most important thing...is that Europe is still at low risk and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola.' Health experts also warn that Europe will almost inevitably see more cases of Ebola, such as the one of Manuel Garcia Viejo (pictured), a Spanish priest who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone .","Ebola expert warns that the virus could remain alive in semen for up to 90 days, increasing the danger of contamination via unprotected sex .

"A 14-year-old stabbed a fellow pupil in the back with a kitchen knife after hearing voices in his head and watching documentaries about American school massacres, a court heard. The teenager attacked the boy without warning or provocation at his school and then mentioned to police the gun killings at Columbine and Virginia Tech. The boy said he had heard voices telling him to 'hurt people', Plymouth Crown Court in Devon heard. The teenager also told police he was going to 'seek out' students who had bullied him. But he handed over the knife and burst into tears after stabbing the first pupil - who was never involved in any bullying. Scroll down for watch video . The boy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was hearing voices telling him to 'hurt people', Plymouth Crown Court (pictured) heard . A judge passed a hospital order which means the boy will be held at a medium-security psychiatric unit until doctors determine he is safe for release. The court heard he had been diagnosed with a treatable mental disorder in atypical autism. The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to maliciously wounding the 15-year-old on December 9 last year. Kelly Scrivener, for the Crown Prosecution Service, said that the boy stabbed his victim in the back as he waited in class for school to start. He needed six stitches to a two-inch deep wound between his shoulder blades. Miss Scrivener said the attack was witnessed by five students, all aged between 11 and 15, who became 'extremely distressed'. She added the boy ran from the room before handing over the knife in reception and collapsing in tears. Miss Scrivener added: 'He explained to the school staff and then to police that he brought the knife from home and made reference to two American schools where pupils had committed violent offences, in fact murders, against other students.' The student had become obsessed with documentaries about the Columbine school massacre. Pictured are police officers responding to the 1999 school shooting . She said that later in interview he said he had become interested in documentaries on school massacres at Columbine and Virginia Tech. Miss Scrivener added: 'Before the stabbing, he watched documentaries, then he formed a plan to go to school the next day. 'He was asked by police why he could not go ""through with it"" and he said he became so distressed that he could not go on.' She added that he reported hearing voices 'ordering him to hurt people' but he had not formally reported the problem. Miss Scrivener said he and his family had complained to the school about bullying, though he said he hardly knew the victim, whom he described as 'nice'. The 14-year-old also told police he had watched films about the Virginia Tech Massacre (pictured), in which 32 people were killed and another 17 injured by a lone gunman on campus . The court heard that police found there was no wider knife culture at the school, which cannot be identified for legal reasons. David Evans, for the defendant, said he had been diagnosed with 'atypical autism'. He added he was supported by his family and had been at a medium secure psychiatric unit since December. Mr Evans said the family had been concerned about bullying 'for some time'. The court heard he had made good progress since then. Judge Paul Darlow passed a hospital order under the Mental Health Act, which means the boy will be detained for treatment for an unspecified time until he is deemed safe for release. The teenager, who appeared over a videolink from a court in Birmingham, had denied an alternative charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a kitchen knife on school premises. The pleas were accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service. A student at Virginia tech shot dead 32 people and injured 17 others in April, 2007. Two students at Columbine High School in Colorado murdered 12 colleagues and one teacher, and injured a further 21 people, in 1999. Columbine High School Massacre, April 20, 1999: 15 dead, 24 injured . On the morning of Tuesday, April 20 in 1999 two students from Columbine High School, in Colorado, carried out a spree shooting in which they shot dead 15 people and injured another 21. The highly organised attack was carried out by senior students Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17. The two, armed with an arsenal of guns and explosives, stalked the school campus firing indiscriminately at teachers and students. Columbine High School students Dylan Klebold (left) and Eric Harris (right) pictured in a 1999 yearbook . The shooting lasted just under one hour. Although police had responded, the two shooters are thought to have committed suicide simultaneously by shooting themselves. Because the two killed themselves there remained a wide range of speculation about their motivation. The killers' interests of music and video games was scrutinised, as were concerns the two had been victims of bullies and were suffering from mental health issues. Columbine High School security camera footage shows the two killers in the cafeteria . It also sparked an intense public debate on the issue of gun control in the U.S. with campaigners calling for stronger gun control measures. The crime has become one of the most notorious shootings in modern U.S. history. At the time it was considered one of the country's worst in terms of total death toll - but this has been surpassed by more heinous shootings in recent years. It was also the subject of a 2002 Michael Moore documentary - in which the director explored the context of the massacre with regards to U.S. gun control laws and violence in society. Virginia Tech Massacre, April 16, 2007: 32 dead, 23 injured . This incident remains one of the worst shooting atrocities ever committed in the U.S. In this case, lone gunman Seung-Hui Cho, 23, carried out two attacks at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in which he killed 32 people then turned the gun on himself. Cho Seung-Hui, pictured in an image of himself he sent to NBC News during a lull in the shooting . Police officers pictured responding to reports of the shooting taking place at Virginia Tech in 2007 . Cho first killed several students in a hall of residence. He then stopped for almost two hours before returning to the campus' engineering hall where the majority of killings took place after he chained the doors shut. Like the Columbine massacre, the killer - armed with firearms - shot dozens of students and staff in a two-hour period. And like Columbine, the shooting re-ignited widespread debate, and heavy criticism, of U.S. gun laws. Many gun advocates suggested laws should be relaxed to allow gun owners to carry weapons more freely - the idea being a member of the public could stop a potential shooter. Others called for a tightening of gun buying restrictions, saying it was far too easy for an individual to get access to powerful weapons. Following the incident, Cho was found to have been suffering from severe mental health and social issues - including severe anxiety and depression.","14-year-old student stabbed fellow pupil in the back with a kitchen knife .

"A former US nurse who searched for suicidal people online and encouraged them to kill themselves has been sentenced to 178 days in prison. William Melchert-Dinkel was convicted in September of one count of assisting a suicide and one count of attempting to assist a suicide in the deaths of an English man and a Canadian woman. The 52-year-old was sentenced to three years in prison, but he will not have to serve the prison term if he complies with conditions of probation that include the jail time. William Melchert-Dinkel (pictured in 2011 with his wife Joyce) was convicted in September of one count of assisting a suicide and one count of attempting to assist a suicide in the deaths of an English man and a Canadian woman . Prosecutors said William Melchert-Dinkel, was obsessed with suicide and got a thrill from preying on people in their most desperate hours. They said he posed as a suicidal female nurse to win his victims' trust, then entered false suicide pacts and offered detailed instructions on how people could take their own lives. The convictions came after the Minnesota Supreme Court narrowed the state's assisted-suicide law and reversed earlier convictions. Nadia Kajouji, pictured, 18, of Brampton, Ontario, who jumped into a frozen river in 2008 . In September, Rice County District Judge Thomas Neuville ruled that Melchert-Dinkel, pictured, had assisted in the suicide of Mark Drybrough, 32, of Coventry, England . Prosecutors say Melchert-Dinkel, of Fairbault, Minnesota was obsessed with suicide and hanging and sought out potential victims on the internet. When he found them, prosecutors say, he posed in chat rooms and in e-mails as a woman, using such names as ‘Li dao’ or ‘Cami’, playing the role of a compassionate friend, and offering step-by-step instructions on how they could take their lives. According to court documents, Mr Drybrough posted a message in a chat room, asking if anyone had instructions on how to hang oneself without access to something high. He began receiving e-mails from ‘Li dao’ containing detailed instructions. The prosecutor in 2011 said that Mr Drybrough died by the hanging methods described by ‘Li dao.’ He said that in Mr Dryborough's last communication with Melchert-Dinkel he said he was scared and 'holding on to the hope that things might change'. In the Canada case, evidence shows Miss Kajouji went online saying she wanted to commit suicide but was afraid of failing. Five days later, she participated in online chats with ‘Cami’ - who prosecutors say was actually Melchert-Dinkel, claiming to be a 31-year-old emergency room nurse. During the chats, Miss Kajouji said she planned to jump into a river the following Sunday, and Cami said if that didn’t work, they would hang themselves together that Monday. ‘We are together in this,’ Miss Kajouji wrote. ‘Yes I promise, Monday will be my day,’ Cami replied. In September, Rice County District Judge Thomas Neuville ruled that Melchert-Dinkel had assisted in the suicide of Mark Drybrough, 32, of Coventry, England. But he found the state had failed to prove he had done the same in the death of Nadia Kajouji, 18, of Brampton, Ontario, instead convicting Melchert-Dinkel of a lesser charge of attempting to help her take her life. 'I am sorry ... for my actions and what I have done,' Melchert-Dinkel said in court before he was sentenced.  'I have repented.' It was the second time Melchert-Dinkel was tried in the deaths. In 2011 he was convicted under a law that made it illegal to 'advise' or 'encourage' suicides. Melchert-Dinkel told police in  interviews that he did it for the 'thrill of the chase.' Prosecutors said he acknowledged participating in online chats about suicide with up to 20 people and entering into fake suicide pacts with about 10 people, five of whom he believed killed themselves. The judge in Minnesota at the time said he showed a minimal level of remorse despite admitting his deeds were 'dark' and 'disgusting'. But in March 2014, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled the law amounted to an unconstitutional restriction on speech, reports the BBC. Melchert-Dinkel remained free on appeal. The state tried him again, this time under a separate part of the law making it crime to 'assist' in a suicide if the speech is targeted at one person and provides someone with advice needed to kill him or herself. 'When Nadia died, the best parts of me died with her,' her mother, Deborah Chevalier, said during an emotional statement in court in 2011. 'What William Melchert-Dinkel did was vile, offensive and most importantly, illegal. 'He knowingly chose to mastermind the deaths of some and destroy the lives of many.' Rice County Attorney Paul Beaumaster, (left) and defense attorney Terry Watkins (right) speak with the media outside the Rice County Courthouse . Kajouji's family talked of a bright woman who wanted to become a lawyer and mother, and had only become depressed after she went away to college. Six months after starting, she disappeared. Some family members at first thought she had been kidnapped, and told the court of the horror of searching for her for six weeks until her body was found. After Drybrough's death, police scanned his computer and discovered he sought advice online. They later realised the person giving advice on how he should hang himself was Melchert-Dinkel, according to prosecutor. Melchert-Dinkel must report to jail October 24.

"A young man who brutally bashed and stomped on IT consultant Michael McEwen in Bondi last year will remain behind bars until at least 2019. Sentencing 20-year-old David Hona in the Sydney District Court on Friday, Judge Penelope Hock described his attack on Mr McEwen last year as a 'completely gratuitous act of violence' against a young man who did not want to fight. Hona pleaded guilty to recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in June. He has been sentenced to a minimum four years and nine months behind bars over the attack, with a maximum jail term of six years and nine months. Scroll down for video . It consultant Michael McEwen was attacked in Bondi last year and was left in a coma for eight days . Louise and Robert McEwen, the parents of bashing victim Michael McEwen, were at the Downing Centre Courts with two of their children in Sydney, on Friday, for Hona's sentencing . Hona sat in the dock with his head bowed as Judge Hock described how he had pursued Mr McEwen on a street in the beachside suburb of Bondi after a long night of drinking. 'The offender approached Mr McEwen who was facing him with his arms held out and palms open,' she said. She told how Hona punched Mr McEwen, 24, to the ground, and threw another punch as the young man fell, before finally moving in on the unconscious Mr McEwen and stomping hard on his chest. The vicious and unprovoked assault left Mr McEwen in an induced coma for eight days, and doctors had to remove a part of his skull to save his life. 'The offender deliberately sought out another young man, in that he crossed the road to attack him,' Judge Hock said. 'He did so when Mr McEwen was by his stance demonstrating he did not want to engage in any sort of confrontation ... Then to stomp on him as he lay prone, unresponsive and defenceless on the ground is a particularly despicable and cowardly act.' Judge Hock described how Hona had pursued Mr McEwen (left) on a street after a long night of drinking . Michael McEwen was not in court to see his attacker jailed, but his father welcomed the tough sentence. 'It makes no difference (to us) whether he gets four years, six years - we just hope we don't hear of him again,' Robert McEwen said. 'To punch Michael who was defenceless, not an aggressive sort of a guy, half his size, no threat at all - it was completely unnecessary. 'And then to stomp on him after he was on the ground unconscious is just malicious, taking it to another level, and I think he's paid the price for that.' Hona, who is already serving time in relation to other matters, will not be eligible for release until March 2019. Mr McEwan told 60 Minutes in February he had no memory of the attack, and has had trouble getting his head around what happened. 'At first I just didn’t believe it,' he said. 'It really sank in when they had the TV on and it was the news, I think, and my face was on it and it was like, ""Bondi bashing victim awakes from coma"",' he said.","IT consultant Michael McEwen  was brutally bashed and stomped on outside a Sydney beachside kebab store on December 14, 2013 .

"The question of who may be buried in an enormous and mysterious tomb in northern Greece has titillated archaeologists for months. But now, at a well-known burial just 100 miles (161km) away from the Amphipolis site, experts have confirmed that a grave unearthed decades ago, belongs to Alexander the Great’s father. A team of researchers have confirmed that bones found in a two-chambered royal tomb at Vergina, belong to Macedonian King Philip II. Scroll down for video . Experts have confirmed that a grave unearthed decades ago, does belong to Alexander the Great’s father, as experts have previously guessed. A team of researchers have confirmed that bones found in a two-chambered royal tomb at Vergina, belong to Macedonian King Philip II (shown on this coin) A total of 350 bones and fragments found in two caskets in the tomb were examined, Discovery reported. Researchers found trauma on some of the bones, which helped them decide they belonged to the ancient  king of Macedon. They also found bones belonging to a female warrior, thought to be the daughter of the Skythian King Athea. A collection of photographs, X-rays and other evidence is expected to be released on Friday at the Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki, to settle the debate about the tomb’s occupants once and for all. A total of 350 bones and fragments found in two caskets in the tomb (pictured) were examined. Researchers found trauma on some of the bones, which helped them decide they belong to the ancient Macedonian king . The two-chambered royal tomb at Vergina (marked on the map) lies in the north of Greece, some 100 miles away from Amphipolis (also marked), which is the site of a mysterious ancient tomb. Archaeologists are working hard to establish who it belongs to . The bones were first recovered in 1977 by Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos when he was excavating the mound, known as the Great Tumulus. Debate over whether the tomb really belonged to Philip II has raged ever since. Three tombs were found in the mound. The first, known as Tomb I, had been looted, but a wall painting of the Rape of Persephone remained, along with bones. Tomb II was found untouched and Mr Andronikos found the cremated remains of a male skeleton in the main chamber, along with the cremated remains of a woman in the antechamber. Philip II was king of the Greek kingdom of Macedon from 359 BC until his assassination in 336 BC. He was the father of Alexander the Great and Philip III. He is reported to have come up with the maxim 'divide and conquer'. The warrior king gained control of Greece and other lands along the Balkan peninsular using a mixture of warfare, diplomacy and marriage alliances. He laid the foundations for his son's impressive military feats, who went on to conquer many more lands stretching east from Greece and Egypt to India. It has been popularly claimed for decades that the tomb in Vergina belongs to Philip II, but now the new research has settled the debate. Analysis of the king's cremated remains reveal that he sustained many injuries in battle, including a laceration to his hand and rode a horse frequently. Gold wreaths, silver and bronze vessels, weapons, amour and gold caskets, hinted that the tomb belonged to a member of a royal family. Experts were unsure, whether the remains in Tomb II were Philip II and one of his wives, or Philip III Arrhidaeus, who was Alexander the Great’s half-brother. Phillip III took the throne after Alexander's death and the female could have been his wife, Eurydice. To come to their conclusion, the researchers, led by Theodore Antikas, scoured the bones for peculiarities that might give them clues. They found that the man suffered from  frontal and maxillary sinusitis - inflammation of the lining of the sinuses - which was probably caused by an injury to the face. This could have been the result of an arrow that hit Phillip II in the right eye and blinded him at the siege of Methone in 354 BC. Experts found others signs of wear and tear consistent with a warrior, such as trauma to the ribs and a wound on his left hand, which was likely caused by a weapon. Lesions also led them to conclude that the bones are of a middle-aged man who rode a horse. The female remains also helped to shed light on the remains of Philip II.The female was between 30 and 34 when she died, meaning that she could not be Arrhidaeus’, wife, who was under 25. By studying the bones, anthropologists discovered that the woman was also a keen rider, was cremated soon after her death and had a slightly shorter left leg. All eyes are on a mysterious tomb (pictured) some 100 miles from Vergina, where archaeologists seem close to revealing another secret of the ancient royal family. ‘This leads to the conclusion that the pair of mismatched greaves [shin armour] - the left is shorter - the Scynthian gorytus and weaponry found in the antechamber belonged to her,’ Mr Antikas said. The researchers believe that the remains and armour belong to an unknown daughter of the Scythian king Ateas, who was defeated by Philip in 339 BC. ‘No Macedonian King other than Philip is known to have had ""relations"" with a Scythian,’ Antikas said. His team picked through over 100 never-studied bone fragments from Tomb I to find that it was where seven people were laid to rest – a man, woman, child, four babies and a foetus. The find disproves previous theories that the looted chamber contained the remains of Phillip II and his family. The largest antique tomb ever found in Greece was unearthed in August in Amphipolis, not far from the newly confirmed tomb belonging to King Philip II. Since then, archaeologists have debated who it may belong to, with candidates including Alexander the Great, his mother Olympias, his wife Roxana or an important general. Now an intricate mosaic has been uncovered in the tomb, which lies around 100 miles (161km) from Vergina and Philip II's confirmed grave. The mosaic measures 15 feet (4.5 metres) by 10 feet (3 metres) and covers the whole floor of a room, which is thought to be the ante chamber to the main burial room at Amphipolis. It shows a chariot drawn by two white horses, driven by a bearded man wearing a crown of laurel leaves. Hermes - the messenger of the gods in ancient Greece - stands in front of the chariot, according to experts from the Greek Culture Ministry. A number of scholars believe that the presence of female figures, known as caryatids, show that the tomb belongs to a female. Experts have previously suggested that the tomb belongs to one of the king’s officials. A broken marble door and large sculptures such as caryatids made marble that support an inner entrance into the tomb, have been found. A pair of sphinxes guarding the grave's main entrance beneath a large arch, a painted lintel and other frescoes have also been discovered. It was feared that the tomb was completely looted, but the discovery of the treasures has given experts hope that they may finally find remains and solve the mystery of the unknown tomb.

The find in Amphipolis in northern Macedonia adds weight to archaeologists’ suspicions that the burial mound could hold the remains of a family member of Alexander the Great - perhaps his mother .","Tomb was discovered in 1977 and experts suspected it belongs to Philip II .

Ms Cramblett, 36, is suing Chicago-based Midwest Sperm Bank for allegedly sending her the wrong sperm samples after a receptionist transposed a number on the pape rwork. Donor 380, the sperm donor Ms Cramblett and Ms Zinkon had picked to father their child, was a blonde-haired, blue-eyed white man. She was sent vials of sperm from donor 330, a black man.

Ms Cramblett (left) says she and her partner Amanda Zinkon (right) love their daughter Payton, now two years old, but that they have to leave their hometown to find a more diverse city for their biracial daughter . 'I am happy that I have a healthy child,' Cramblett told NBC News through tears. 'But I'm not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.' She added: 'We had to take this into our hands because I will not let this happen again. I'm not going to sit back and let this happen to anyone ever again.' Ms Cramblett told NBC that she and her partner had specifically picked a blonde-haired, blue-eyed donor so that the baby would look like her partner, Ms Zinkon. Despite the lawsuit, Ms Cramblett says she and her partner love Payton dearly. 'You can't just go, ""Well you got a baby. You got a baby so you should be happy. Lesbian couple can't get a baby anyway. You should be happy that you have a healthy child."" 'I am happy that I have a healthy child. We love her more... to this day, she's made us the people that we are. Never trade it for the world,' she said, her eyes welling with tears. 'But I'm not going to let them get away with not being held accountable.' In a lawsuit filed this week in Cook County, Illinois, Ms Cramblett says Midwest Sperm Bank sent her several vials of a black man's sperm by mistake because the clinic keeps paper records and accidentally transposed numbers on her order. Midwest Sperm Bank charged $400 per vial of semen and Ms Cramblett and her partner received six vials of the wrong semen. Jennifer Cramblett (right) and her partner Amanda Zinkon (left) picked out a white sperm donor from Midwest Sperm Bank, but were instead sent a black man's sperm, they allege . The lawsuit says the clinic later sent Ms Cramblett an apology note and a refund for the six vials - though charged her for the vials of the correct semen she received. Ms Cramblett she has 'limited cultural competency relative to African-Americans' and worries that her daughter Payton will not be accepted in her hometown of Uniontown. 'Jennifer lives each day with fears, anxieties and uncertainty about her future and Payton's future,' according to the lawsuit. Ms Cramblett, the assistant manager of an AT&T store, said she and her partner Amanda Zinkon love their daughter, who is now two years old, but say they must now consider moving to a more diverse community. Ms Cramblett says her family is racist and has not fully accepted her sexuality. Having a mixed-race daughter makes it even harder, she claims in her lawsuit . Ms Cramblett says she's thankful she had a healthy daughter, but she says even simple tasks like getting Payton's hair cut can be dau . Ms Cramblett says in her lawsuit that much of her family is racist and that one uncle openly makes racist comments. Even simple tasks have become more complicated because Payton is mixed-race, the lawsuit says. 'Payton has hair typical of an African American girl. To get a decent cut, Jennifer must travel to a black neighborhood, far from where she lives, where she is obviously different in appearance, and not overtly welcome,' according to the lawsuit. Ms Cramblett says she grew up in Scio, Ohio - population 762 - and didn't meet a black person until she attended college. She currently lives in Uniontown, population 2,802, and fears Payton will be the only non-white child in class when the time comes for her to attend school. Ms Cramblett says her family has difficulty accepting the fact that she is gay and encourage her to hide her sexual orientation when she is around them. She says no matter what she does, Payton cannot hide her race - nor should she have to. Ms Cramblett is alleging breach of warranty and wrongful birth.

"While Australians may have earned a reputation as avid travellers, staggering figures show we are a nation of hard workers with millions of accrued annual leave days. As a result, this impacts mental health of employees which costs Australian workplaces nearly $11 billion every year. The Happiness Institute CEO Dr Timothy Sharp, or as he likes to call himself - 'the chief happiness officer', says not taking frequent holidays can have serious negative consequences on one's overall well-being. Research released by Fiji Airways revealed half a million Australians haven't left the country in recent years while 10 million don't even own a passport . 'The bottom line is that we need to rest,' Dr Sharp told Daily Mail Australia. 'Otherwise we will burn out which in technical terms can cause depression, exhaustion or anxiety - that's in a worse case scenario. 'Taking a break can be a powerful source of happiness.' Research released by Fiji Airways suggests that Australians are not taking the time to simply 'switch off'. Consequently, the yearly impact of untreated depression in the workplace includes over 6 million working days in Australia and 12 million days of reduced productivity. The effect of not addressing mental health in the workplace is costing $4.7 billion in absenteeism, $6.1 billion in presenteeism and $145.9 million in compensation claims. This is a total of $10.9 billion a year. Research also found about 470,000 Australians choose to stay home instead of exploring the wonders of the world while Australian workers have 128 million days of annual built up and 10 million people don't have passports. Among those Australians include 23-year-old Jordan Pedron, who's never left the country. The Newcastle resident, northeast of Sydney, was only 19 when she boarded her first domestic flight. Jordon Pedro, 23, has never left Australia and only boarded her first domestic flight at the age of 19 . The Happiness Institute's CEO Dr Timothy Sharp says it's important that we take frequent breaks from work . Ms Pedron says she'd love to travel but she just hasn't had the time and money for it. 'Mum was a single parent and always drummed into me and my two older sisters that family was important,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'So family has always been priority for me and the last few years I've used my holidays to visit them for weddings, birthdays or other important events. 'That's why I guess I put everything on the back pedal, including travelling overseas.' CEO of The Happiness Institute Dr Timothy Sharp says the key to a happy life is to maintain quality, deep and meaningful relationships. 'Undoubtedly, at any age of life it is important that we maintain good relationships that will help enhance long jeopardy and health,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm not talking about have hundreds of Facebook friends or hundreds of Instagram followers. It's about keeping in touch with our loved ones and having quality relationships that's worth putting time and effort into. 'This will give us a meaning and purpose to our life.' Other ways to keep a happy life-style include: . Ms Pedron, who's originally from Dubbo - northwest of Sydney, doesn't regret spending time with her family but she hopes to take some time for herself sooner rather than later. 'I haven't been able to go away for ages so I'd love to be on an island, or even experience running with the bulls or a white Christmas,' she said. 'But I'll have to save for that and hope that one day it happens.' While Dr Sharp acknowledges that money can't buy happiness, he says it's important that Australians invest in positive experiences which will help create long-term happiness. 'Of course it depends on person to person but leaving the country will help refresh us, break the routine which will stimulate our minds,' he said. 'It's also important to take regular short breaks throughout the year instead of taking a good long break at once a year.'

"There are certain events in my life that I know never would have happened if I’d been born ugly. Real life-changing events to which I entirely owe my looks. I am not being conceited or boastful; it’s a simple fact that had I not been quite so lucky in the great DNA lottery many doors would have remained shut to me. The first example is winning my first column on a newspaper in 2003 — which in turn led to my first book. Scroll down for video . 'Had I not been quite so lucky in the great DNA lottery many doors would have remained shut to me' says Helena who, at 45, says she sees good bone structure and skin that has only a sprinkling of fine lines, a figure that has remained the size it was at university and good, thick hair . ‘We have to give her a column,’ said the editor to his section head after our meeting. ‘She’s so pretty.’ This proclamation was given to the team out of my earshot, I should say, but relayed to me by one of them over lunch afterwards. It left me torn between being offended that I didn’t get the job because of my ability to write and thrilled to have a column. But in the cut-throat world of journalism there is no room for the feminist moral high ground. A column is a column, whatever it takes to get it. I should think acting is even more competitive. So I was rather surprised to read recently that Keira Knightley laments the fact that she misses out on roles because she is too pretty. I would wager she has won many more roles than she’s lost due to her good looks. Keira Knightley laments the fact that she misses out on roles because she is too pretty. 'I would wager she has won many more roles than she's lost due to her good looks,' says Helena . And would you rather be cast as Beauty or the Beast? Do you hear George Clooney moaning about the fact that he could have become an accountant if he hadn’t been so darned handsome? I am not doing a Samantha Brick. She famously triggered a storm of abuse in April 2012 for saying how gorgeous she was, and that other women hated her because she was so beautiful. I don’t think I’m so stunning other women loathe me en masse. And I’m not so pleased with myself that every time I look in the mirror I think ‘yippee’. Quite the contrary. I used to loathe the way I looked. My legs were so thin when I was a teenager I used to wear two pairs of trousers to make them look more shapely. I was so flat-chested I was nick-named ‘the plank’. But now I am thankful for those legs and, at least, I don’t have droopy boobs. At 45, I see good bone structure and skin that has only a sprinkling of fine lines thanks to rigorous application of suncream. My figure has remained the size it was at university thanks to yoga and tennis and a disciplined attitude to food, and I still have a head of thick dark hair, though that I owe to my mother. When I look in the mirror, I see a woman who has aged relatively well, in part due to the effort I’ve put into staying fit and healthy. One of the things my chic Italian aunt taught me was that taking care of your appearance is good manners and shows respect for those around you, as opposed to something to be ashamed of, which is the usual attitude in Britain. Here, the prevailing view is that if you spend time on yourself, you’re vain and superficial. Vain and superficial? Possibly. But also smart. Because good looks work and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is lying. Keira’s argument is that she wants to be treated as a serious actress and not a sex symbol. Which is fair enough. But I don’t agree with her that beauty and gravitas are mutually exclusive. She is a great example of a woman who has achieved both. On the whole, you’re better off being nice-looking than not. I think Keira is being disingenuous if she says the disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Helena argues that while Keira's good looks will undoubtedly have opened doors for her in the industry, it's her talent that has kept them open . I can’t see how good looks are in any way a barrier to a career. They’re rarely a barrier to anything as far as I can tell. I probably wouldn’t have a driving licence if I hadn’t worn a mini-skirt to my test. Yes, you read that correctly. I was at Durham University. I had failed my test five times. Finally, a friend said he would buy me an intensive driving course, two lessons a day for a week in Harrogate at the end of which I would take my test. My test was a disaster. I rolled backwards on the hill start and went the wrong way down a one-way street, almost crashing the car in the process. At the end, we pulled over and I prepared myself for the usual ‘I’m sorry to say Miss Frith Powell, you have failed.’ Incredibly the dour Yorkshire-man next to me told me I had passed. ‘Really?’ I exclaimed. ‘Well,’ he said, glancing at my legs. ‘Only just.’ For living proof that good looks help your job prospects, you only have to compare the careers of Paul Scholes (left) and David Beckham(right), says Helena. Both were very talented football players but only one of them looked good in underwear . My husband only hired me because he thought I was pretty. We met when he interviewed me for a job on Trade Finance magazine. I knew less than nothing about trade finance, but I got the job. Years later, he admitted his hiring policy. ‘Interviews are such a lottery,’ he told me. ‘So you may as well hire the pretty one.’ I am not saying that looks alone will keep you in a job (I did eventually get fired from that magazine, thank God. I was hopeless at it, a stark fact no number of charming smiles could disguise) but they will present you with opportunities to get in the door, spoken to and remembered. I suspect Keira might have got her first role in Pirates Of The Caribbean in part because she is such a stunner, but they wouldn’t have cast her again and again if she’d been useless. Her looks will undoubtedly have opened doors for her in the industry, but her talent has kept them open. My daughters are now 13 and 15. I, of course, think they are stunning. ‘Have you any idea what an advantage you have already, before you’ve even said or done anything at all?’ I keep telling them. Helena says her figure has remained the size it was at university thanks to yoga and tennis and a disciplined attitude to food, and she still has a head of thick dark hair, though that she owes to my mother . It may be unfair and it may not be right, but the truth is that if you walk into a situation as a pretty girl, 9.9 times out of ten, your looks will work in your favour. According to a study carried out by the University of Luneburg, Germany, in 2011, good looks are the single most important factor for a successful career. The study found that being beautiful is as important as having a degree. Beautiful women — and men — will come up against some people (usually ugly ones) who discriminate against them because they don’t want nice-looking people around them. But on the whole, if you look good, you’re going to be more successful in life. For living proof that good looks help your job prospects, you only have to compare the careers of Paul Scholes and David Beckham. Helena says her husband only hired her on his trade magazine because he thought she was pretty . Both were very talented football players. In fact, some say Scholes was the more talented of the two. But only one of them looked good in underwear. I predict that Scholes could wander down the King’s Road unmolested (even in his underwear) and no one would give him a second glance. Becks would be mobbed before he took his jacket off. Daniel Hamermesh the U.S. economist has coined the term the ‘beauty premium’, which means that attractive CEOs benefit their companies in various ways. For example, the share price rises when they have made a television appearance. Of course, especially for women, looks can determine what paths our lives take. As the writer Nora Ephron once said: ‘I honestly believe that if I’d had bigger breasts my life would have been different.’ Though it’s fair to say her achievements as a writer and director hardly make her one of life’s under-achievers. Maybe the point Keira is trying to get across is that if you look like Marilyn Monroe you are unlikely to become a tax inspector. Or even get to play one in a film. Some women do rebel against their lot. For example, Brigitte Bardot, who was once the most beautiful woman in the world, decided to give up on looking after herself and look after donkeys instead. And then she ended up looking like one. I guess if Keira is seriously disgruntled about being too pretty she could follow Brigitte’s lead and opt out. But, somehow, I doubt she will. Because being beautiful is not something any woman will give up on easily. There are too many advantages to be gained.

"Australia's response to Ebola has been a shambles, says the head of the country's medical association who's calling on the government to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the crisis. Apparently 16 health care workers have been trained to go to west Africa and do 'dangerous work' with Ebola patients, Australian Medical Association president Associate Professor Brian Owler said. But neither the AMA nor the Chief Medical Officer know who the people are, what sort of training they've had and whether they're properly prepared. Australian Medical Association president Associate Professor Brian Owler is calling on the government to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the crisis . The World Health Organisation last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, affecting potentially 1.4 million west Africans . 'It's not the AUSMAT (Australian Medical Assistance) teams that you would expect would be trained to do this work,' Assoc Prof Owler told reporters in Sydney. 'Who are these people? If anything is going to be irresponsible it would be a last minute announcement about people who are ill-equipped or ill-trained to go and do this dangerous work'. He's called on the government to announce what it is going to do to help tackle the 'humanitarian crisis' overseas and what the plans are if a potentially infected person arrives in Australian. And Assoc Prof Owler has 'big questions' about mandatory quarantines at airports for people returning from affected areas, like those to be set up in the US. He said the nurse in Cairns, who had quarantined herself after showing signs of fever, had followed the right procedures by avoiding contact with others and alerting authorities. Marie-Paule Kieny, Assistant Director General for Health Systems and Innovations of the World Health Organisation (WHO), speaks during a press conference about the information session on Ebola candidate vaccines . The British are sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone while the US has dispatched more than 3,000 to Liberia . 'People should be reassured that the risk of transmission of that infection is very, very, low, but obviously it is a concern,' he said. Opposition leader Bill Shorten has also accused Prime Minister Tony Abbott of not doing 'enough to deal with this crisis'. 'Logic dictates that you're better off dealing with the outbreak of a deadly and serious contagion closer to the source than waiting until it comes to Australia or comes to Papua New Guinea,"" he said. 'If you want to deal with a contagion and a disease which is deadly and spreads very rapidly, you're better off dealing with it early.' The US and UK asked for assistance from Australia a month ago, Assoc Prof Owler said. The British are sending 750 people to help in Sierra Leone while the US has dispatched more than 3,000 to Liberia. 'While we drag our feet on this issue, while the government continues to roll out the tired old excuses about why we can't respond, unfortunately people are going to continue to die,' he said. The World Health Organisation last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, affecting potentially 1.4 million west Africans.

"A tunnel is set to be built under Stonehenge to relieve one of Britain’s most traffic-congested roads. Chancellor George Osborne is expected to commit hundreds of millions of pounds to give the long delayed project the go-ahead. It would end years of debate over the infamous bottleneck on the A303, which runs right past the World Heritage Site in Wiltshire. Historic: The World Heritage site was recently visited by U.S. President Barack Obama during a NATO summit . It is expected that the new scheme will be along the lines of earlier plans considered for the site . It will also provoke furious opposition from campaigners, who fear a tunnel could damage the hugely important 5,000-year-old site, visited only last month by US President Barack Obama. Traffic jams on the A303, one of the main routes into the South West, have plagued motorists for decades – prompting a local MP to brand it the ‘devil’s highway’. Plans to tunnel under the monument were ditched by the last Labour Government in 2007 when . the cost of the proposed 1.3-mile subterranean passage reached £540 million. However, government insiders last night signalled that Mr Osborne will use his autumn financial statement to commit money to reviving the scheme. Improving the road to make a real alternative to using the M4 and M5 would be hugely popular with motorists heading to and from the South West – a key battleground for the Conservatives at next year’s General Election. The National Trust wants the longest tunnel possible to take as many cars and trucks away from the site . Chancellor George Osborne is expected to announce the A303 upgrade plan in his Autumn Statement . A source stressed that no final decision had yet been made but suggested the move would be part of several major road improvement schemes set to get the go-ahead. ‘Because we’ve got a grip on the public finances, we can make investments in important infrastructure all over the country as part of our long-term economic plan,’ he said. The expected go-ahead comes after reports yesterday that the National Trust was now ready to support the idea of a tunnel up to 1.8 miles long under Stonehenge. It also follows Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin’s decision earlier this year to order a feasibility study into improving the A303, including tunnelling under Stonehenge or moving a section of the road to the north. But sources indicated last night that the tunnel option was the likeliest to proceed. Three weeks ago, Mr McLoughlin told the Tory Party conference in Birmingham that he wanted to improve ‘vital congested roads like the A303’ soon. Five other major road projects, including extending sections of dual-carriageway on the A1 in Northumberland and improving the A27 along the South Coast, are also under consideration. Stonehenge, pictured, has been a major bottleneck on the A303 providing access to the south west . Last night, Salisbury MP John Glen, whose constituency includes Stonehenge, welcomed the prospect of an end to the bottleneck. But he said: ‘Both the people of South Wiltshire and anybody who uses the road to go to the South West in the summer need a solution that will be deliverable in a believable time-frame – not a vague aspiration that falls at the first hurdle.’ Tom Fort, author of the book A303, Highway To The Sun, cast doubt on whether the tunnel would be built. He said: ‘I’ll believe it when I see it, and I do not expect to see it. It is about as likely as Lord Nelson getting his eye back. ‘And if they do build it, it would deprive hard-working, tax-paying motorists of the pleasure of a free view of the most famous prehistoric monument in Europe.’ The National Trust was unavailable for comment.","Chancellor George Osborne will announce the tunnel plan in December .

"This is the moment a pit bull owner whose dogs fatally mauled a 63-year-old grandmother was sentenced to at least fifteen years in prison on murder charges. Alex Jackson, 31, cast his eyes to the floor in despair as he was handed a the sentence - which could extend to life in prison - after being convicted of second-degree murder for his dogs' attack on Pamela Devitt. Mrs Devitt was taking a morning stroll in  Littlerock, California, when four of Jackson's dogs leaped over a fence and attacked her in the street, biting her 200 times. Despair: Alex Jackson, right, reacts to the sentence while his defense attorney, Al Kim, covers his face . Jailed: Dog owner Alex Jackson, 31, (left) has been jailed for at least fifteen years after being convicted of the murder of Pamela Devitt, 63 (right) She was alone, didn't have a phone and no one was nearby. By the time help arrived, she had been bitten from head to toe and an arm was severed. She died from blood loss. Sentencing Jackson to 15 years in jail, Deputy District Attorney Ryan Williams said: 'His actions in this case show that he has a nearly psychopathic disregard for the lives and well-being of others.' Jackson was initially arrested when deputies searching for the dogs discovered a marijuana-growing operation in his house. Emotional: Ben Devitt, the husband of Mrs Devitt, spoke out today during the sentencing in a California court . Sentence: Judge Lisa Chung speaks during the sentencing of Alex Jackson . He was later charged with murder when Devitt's DNA was found on his dogs' bloody fur. Prosecutors in Los Angeles County Superior Court sought a term of 24 years to life in prison for the murder and convictions on weapon and drug charges. The dogs guarded Jackson's pot-growing operation and he knew the animals were dangerous, Williams said. Brutal: The court heard Jackson had done nothing to contain his dogs (one pictured) despite complaints . And records showed neighbors had complained that his dogs were vicious or dangerous and that the he didn't do enough to control the animals. A murder conviction for a killing by dogs is rare. The mauling of Diane Whipple in the hallway outside her San Francisco apartment in 2001 led to her neighbor's second-degree murder conviction. A Michigan couple is facing trial on second-degree murder charges for the mauling death of a jogger in July by two cane corsos, an Italian mastiff-type breed, near their home about 45 miles outside Detroit. To be convicted, it must be proven the accused did something so reckless they had to know it was dangerous enough to kill someone — even without intending harm. Distraught: Pamela's grieving husband Ben Devitt holds a picture of his wife of 43 years . Nine witnesses, including several horse riders and a postal worker, testified about seven frightening encounters. One equestrian had offered to provide free fencing and help Jackson put it up to keep the dogs on his property, but Jackson did not accept the help. According to Jackson's defense lawyer, Al Kim, the 'nail in the coffin' was that the number of other incidents made it hard to argue that he wasn't aware of the danger the dogs posed. At trial, Kim conceded Jackson was a drug dealer, but also said he was a dog lover who took in strays that reproduced. While he should have kept closer watch of them, he never intended to hurt someone. 'He's not the evil dude he's being made out to be,' Kim said. 'He feels horrible about this. He's contrite.'","Alex Jackson, 31, was found guilty last month of murder .

"David Gregory has signed up to appear on Yahoo! next month, it was announced Tuesday, just over two months after he was unloaded from NBC's much more high-profile Meet the Press amid historically dismal ratings. Gregory, 44, will join his fellow major network cast-off and former NBC co-worker Katie Couric for a midterm election night coverage show for the internet company.

Scroll down for video... Back in the game? David Gregory will appear on a streaming Yahoo midterm elections special with Katie Couric on November 4--just over two months since his sudden departure from NBC . Surprise! Couric, who is also a major network cast-off, originally described her special guests on the Yahoo News Midterm Election Mixer as 'surprise' but her former NBC co-worker Gregory's name has since been revealed . The so-called 'Yahoo News Midterm Election Mixer' will kick off November 4 at 5pm and features other guests including 'Grover Norquist, Politico’s Mike Allen, CPAC’s Neera Tanden, strategist Jamal Simmons, David Swerdlick from The Root,' according to the website. Gregory left NBC in August after 20 years at the network and the move stunned many, if not for its ceremoniousness, then for Gregory's reported severance pay. According to The New York Post, Gregory walked away from his moderator job with $4 million and the promise he'd never bad mouth the network. His boss at the time said his ouster simply came down to ratings. 'The time had come for this to happen,' NBC News president Deborah Turness, told the New York Times. '[the] numbers just didn’t move.' 'Looking forward to it!': The old co-workers tweeted at each other in anticipation of the November 4 event . He'll join on election night a fellow television journalist who's also accustomed to less-than-savory departures from banner-name outlets. Katie Couric, who's hosted shows on all big three networks with varying degrees of success over the years, tweeted at Gregory on Tuesday to welcome him to her group of special guests and to remind viewers to 'Save the date.' Gregory tweeted back: 'Looking forward to it!'

Turnbull, who is married with three children, then continued in the light-hearted tone as he asked Ms Kirkwood when they would see her appear on Strictly Come Dancing. She quickly responded that this would not be happening soon, and said she has 'two left feet.' Turnbull said this would not make her the first, referring to his own appearance on the show in 2005. The exchange on Tuesday morning led to a number of comments on Twitter, praising the weather presenter's appearance. Others also noted the  innuendo-ridden conversation between the pair. The BBC declined to comment on the exchange between the two presenters. Bill Turnbull pictured in 2005 with his dance partner Karen Hardy for Strictly Come Dancing . Ms Kirkwood and Turnbull are no stranger to descending into laughter during her live broadcasts. In February she informed viewers that temperatures of 99 degrees were on the way, with her map annotated with 'Town name.' As she attempted to stand in front of the offending map to shield the error from viewers, Turnbull joked: 'I've heard of scorchio, but that's ridiculous.' Both Turnbull and his former co-presenter Susanna Reid descended into laughter and Ms Kirkwood later admitted she had 'clicked her clicker' too many times. In June Ms Kirkwood was forced to admit that she had been 'upstaged by a dog' as a labrador crept into the back of the shot, where she was presenting live from a beach in Sussex, and went to the toilet in the sea behind her. Bill Turnbull teased Ms Kirkwood when she accidentally tapped her clicker, causing the screen to display temperatures of 99 degrees in 'Town name'. Susanna Reid and Turnbull were left giggling on the sofa . Ms Kirkwood was presenting the weather live from West Wittering in Sussex when a labrador snuck in behind the shot and went to the toilet . Turnbull previously presented the BBC show with Susanna Reid,whose celebrity soared after she appeared on Strictly Come Dancing. She moved to ITV earlier this year to front Good Morning Britain. Reid also drew attention for a wardrobe malfunction as she presented with Turnbull. During a BBC Breakfast slot with Turnbull she moved and showed her underwear beneath her dress. Last year she also engaged in a flirtatious interview with Alex Turner, frontman of Arctic Monkeys, as she asked him if he would consider appearing on Strictly Come Dancing, leading to a number of comments from viewers. Susanna Reid interviewed Alex Turner on BBC Breakfast in 2013, leading viewers to comment on Twitter that the pair appeared to be flirting .","Turnbull tells female presenter there has been lots of 'interest in your isobars'

"Investors looking to make an easy buck out of the housing market could be running out of time. Australia's financial regulators are in talks to tighten the process for investors trying to obtain a mortgage, saying the market has become 'unbalanced'. Tougher rules could be in before the end of the year. The Reserve Bank of Australia flagged its concerns in last week's financial stability review, prompting the Senate's economics committee to call an impromptu public hearing for Thursday. Scroll down for video . Australia's financial regulators are in talks about tightening the process for investors trying to obtain a mortgage due to an 'unbalanced' market . RBA assistant governor Malcolm Edey stressed to the hearing regulators weren't trying to kill the investor market, just address imbalances compared to the rest of the housing sector. Over the past couple of years, housing prices have risen strongly, and more recently faster than incomes because of the growth in investor activity. The RBA couldn't ignore this activity with mortgages to investors accounting close to 50 per cent of new housing loan approvals, and rising by 90 per cent in NSW over the past two years. However, Dr Edey was reluctant to be specific as to what tools might be used, refusing to 'rule anything in or out'. The Reserve Bank of Australia flagged its concerns in last week's financial stability review, leading to a public hearing on Thursday . Targeted measures would be determined by the banking watchdog, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. APRA's tools may consider incentives to make banks restrain the growth in lending, while considering lending practices in some areas of the housing market more generally. APRA has already tightened the prudential framework for banks in the past year. 'I see what they are talking about now is very much turning up the dial of that,' Dr Edey said. RBA head of financial stability Luci Ellis told the senate hearing the main worry was the booming Sydney and Melbourne markets, and price rises elsewhere weren't enough to cause concern. 'We are worried about what the downside of that house price cycle would look like,' she said. The housing market is set to the backbone of economic activity as the mining investment boom rapidly unwinds. Data on Thursday showed building approvals rose by a further three per cent in August to be 14.5 per cent over the year. ANZ economists expect the elevated level of building approvals will fuel a solid pipeline of planned housing construction, particularly for high-rise apartments in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.","Australia's financial regulators are in talks about tightening the process for investors trying to obtain a mortgage .

"A former Serb general convicted of war crimes who had his neck slashed open by prisoners in a British jail has launched a £120,000 lawsuit against the Government. Radislav Krstic, serving a 35-year sentence after being convicted of Europe's worst massacre since the Second World War, said he has been left physically and mentally scarred after the 2010 attack. He claims that the Government failed to protect him from the razor attack, carried out by three Muslim inmates at top security Wakefield Prison. Radislav Krstic was assaulted while serving a 35-year sentence in a British prison for war crimes. The Bosnian criminal is now suing the Government claiming he has suffered flashbacks and has facial scarring . The Serbs were the deadly enemies of Bosnian Muslims during the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s. At least one of Krstic's attackers is said to be a Bosnian Muslim. He said that he has been haunted by recurring flashbacks since the incident and is seeking damages for his injuries and for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. When Krstic, an amputee, was moved to Woodhill Prison following the attack, he claims he was assaulted by a Muslim inmate who 'kicked him in his remaining leg'. His barrister, Adam Sandell, told a judge that 'no one has ever apologised to Mr Krstic', who has since been transferred to serve out his jail term in Poland. Krstic, 66, who watched the court proceedings today via video link, claims the authorities at Wakefield Prison negligently failed to take 'all reasonable steps' to protect him. That was despite the fact that the jail is a 'high security prison housing some of the UK's most dangerous male lifers', said Mr Sandell. Lawyers for the Ministry of Justice are defending the case, insisting that prison staff did what they could to protect the war criminal. Krstic was attacked as he served a 35-year sentence in Wakefield Prison (pictured). He was moved to a different facility following the incident . The war criminal was moved to Woodhill Prison where he claims he was attacked again by a Muslim inmate . They say he was at no greater risk in the prison system than a paedophile would be. Government barrister, Oliver Sanders, also suggested that Krstic had 'exaggerated the consequences of the attack in terms of his PTSD'. Krstic was convicted for his part in the massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys who had been rounded up in the UN's supposedly safe haven of Srebrenica in July 1995. At the time he was one of the most powerful men in the Bosnian Serb army, second only to General Ratko Mladic, who is still on the run from war crimes investigators. He was arrested in a daring joint SAS and U.S. Navy SEAL snatch in Bosnia in December 1998. In 2001 he became the first man to be convicted of genocide by the War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague and was sentenced to 46 years in prison. This was overturned on appeal and replaced by a 35-year sentence for aiding and abetting genocide. Mr Sandell said his client was in his cell when three Muslim attackers stormed in and slashed at him with a 'razor-blade attached to a toothbrush handle'. He said: 'They held Mr Krstic down and cut his head and neck with their weapon, he understood that the prisoners were trying to kill him. 'The three prisoners then left, saying, ""he's finished"", meaning that they believed he would die from the injuries they had inflicted on him.' Krstic had lost part of his right leg in a mine blast during the Bosnian war and was less able to defend himself, he added. But Mr Sandell said that nothing he had experienced in the war zone compared with the mental torment left by the prison attack. Krstic was convicted for his part in the massacre of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys who had been rounded up in the UN's supposedly safe haven of Srebrenica in July 1995 . He said: 'He has a poor prognosis; it is unlikely that there will be anything other than a modest improvement in his disorder with the further passage of time.' He added that the ex-general was lucky to escape with his life and was marked with 'severe facial scarring'. His three attackers were tried and convicted of wounding with intent over the razor attack in February 2011. Mr Sandell said there had been a 'glaring' risk of an attack occurring at Wakefield Prison - given Krstic's high-profile status and the wide publicity surrounding his case. There were also numerous 'red flag incidents' in the months before the attack which should have triggered heightened vigilance by prison staff, said the barrister. He added: 'His offences were exceptional and they put him at risk from certain other prisoners. 'But this risk was not exceptional and was in fact no different from the risk from other prisoners faced by numerous sex offenders and prisoners who have committed violent or sexual offences against children'. Judge Antonio Bueno QC, sitting at Central London County Court, has now reserved judgment and will rule on the case at a later date.","Radislav Krstic is serving 35-year sentence for aiding and abetting genocide .

"'Radicalised': Yusra Hussien, 15, who is believed to have travelled to Syria after talking online with young British women already in the country . The 15-year-old girl from Bristol believed to have travelled to Syria to marry an Islamic State militant may have been recruited by British women already in the country. Police believe Yusra Hussien from Bristol was communicating online with a British woman in Syria just weeks before she and a 17-year-old friend from London left the UK. One message posted online said: 'I yearn to be the wife of a mujahid and support him and khilafa (the Islamic caliphate) all the way.' As many as 70 women and girls are among the hundreds of British Muslims thought to have travelled to fight alongside Islamic State in Syria. Some, the Sunday Times reports, have joined an all-female religious police unit in Raqqa, the de facto capital of IS's self-declared caliphate, called the al-Khanssaa brigade. This unit enforces a strict interpretation of religious morality on local women, dishing out beatings to those caught breaking the Islamic dress code, smoking, or otherwise transgressing the law. One member, with the alias 'Umm Ubaydah', uses Tumblr, the social networking and blogging site, to communicate with Muslims thinking of travelling to Syria. The Sunday Times claims that she is an 18-year-old from London of Somali heritage, although she denies being British in a post on her Tumblr blog. Among posts advising on whether it is possible to get hair straighteners in the caliphate and what kind of smartphone apps will be useful, she advised what the Sunday Times says is a 15-year-old from Britain. The anonymous questioner asked: 'I so badly want to go to raqqah and live under the shariah and live in the land of khilafa but as a young muslimah in the uk it's rly difficult and my family would be completely against it. 'I want to escape the fitna of the kuffar land please make dua Allah allows me to make hijra to the lands of khilafa, it hurts my heart to live here. 'I yearn to be the wife of a mujahid and support him and khilafa all the way.' Umm Ubaydah told her: 'It is a beautiful feeling being married to a mujahid... My advice to you is hasten, because I’ve seen people who wanted to make hijrah for so long and delayed it (for no legit reason) untill [sic] the punishment of Allāh came upon them and they remained in Dar al kufr [land of the unbelievers].' Al Khanssaa Brigade women: This picture, taken from the Twitter account of a woman who has travelled to join Islamic State, is understood to show Umm Ubaydah alongside two friends, Umm Layth and Umm Haritha . Detectives at the South East Counter Terrorism Unit were examining the exchanges, according to the Sunday Times. Yusra 15-year-old has not been seen since she left her family home in Easton, Bristol, for school on September 24. Police believe she took a coach from Bristol to Heathrow, where she met a 17-year-old girl from Lambeth, South London. The pair then flew to Istanbul, Turkey, before presumably heading for the Syrian border. Last week Yusra's mother, Safiya Hussien, made a desperate appeal for the schoolgirl to return home, as hopes of finding her before she crossed the border appeared to fade. She wept as she begged the schoolgirl to return to Britain in an emotional press conference. 'Yusra, I am your mum, I love you,' Mrs Hussien, supported by Yusra's aunts Sucdi Ali and Ikram Mohamed, said. 'Please, please, please, we miss you, come back. 'I love you so much. All your brothers and your sister miss you so, so much. The house is not the same.' Umm Ubaydah's Tumblr blog: She gave advice to a 15-year-old girl on whether to travel to Syria against her parents wishes. It seems likely this was Yusra, who disappeared a little over a month after the messages . 'Please, please, please, we miss you, come back': Yusra's mother Safiya Hussien weeps at a press conference . Family friends previously said they believed Yusra, who wears a hijab as part of her faith, had become radicalised on chat rooms and forums online. It is not yet clear how she met the 17-year-old. But Yusra's parents have stressed that nothing has been proven about their daughter's beliefs. In a statement her mother and father Mohammed Hussien said: 'There have been many assumptions and speculations claiming that Yusra is travelling to Syria, that she maybe an extremist, or that she is planning to become a jihadist bride all of which have not as of yet been proved with any concrete evidence.' The family also echoed calls for action over the role of border officials in preventing children from flying abroad without their parents. The girls' disappearance follows that of twins Zahra and Salma Halane, 16, from Manchester, who are thought to have travelled to Syria in July. More than 500 British extremists are thought to have travelled to the war torn country, around half of whom are said to be from London.","Schoolgirl thought to have been talking online with Brits already in Syria .

"Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant pictured together in the 1999 film Notting Hill . He prefers to remain tight-lipped about the women in his private life. But when it comes to his on-screen leading ladies, Hugh Grant is not so discreet. Describing the time he ‘got off’ with Julia Roberts when they starred together in 1999 film Notting Hill, he remarked: ‘It’s a big mouth. I was aware of a faint echo when I was kissing her.’ In the film, Grant plays bookshop owner William Thacker, who meets Hollywood superstar Anna Scott (Miss Roberts) when she comes in to buy a book. The film follows their rendezvous as they fall in love. Renee Zellweger, Grant’s co-star in the Bridget Jones’s Diary films, fares better in his critique: Miss Zellweger, he says, is a ‘top snogger’. The 54-year-old actor claimed he engaged in ‘competitive snogging’ to try to beat Colin Firth, who played his love rival in both films, adding: ‘You will have to ask Renee who she preferred. I think Colin tried too hard.’ In comments that could be seen to reflect the caddish attitude of his Bridget Jones character Daniel Cleaver, Grant added: ‘I can’t think of a leading lady that I have not fancied. ‘You have got to fancy them as otherwise it is no fun. What is the point of doing a film?’ Appearing on Alan Carr’s Chatty Man show last night as he promoted his latest film The Rewrite, Grant revealed: ‘I am very queeny about who I play opposite.

"The man charged with funding terrorism after Tuesday's early morning raids came to the defence of the Islamic State on Facebook and branded the decapitation of American journalist James Foley as 'lies'. Hassan El Sabsabi was arrested at his home in Seabrook, Melbourne after AFP officers were tipped off by their FBI counterparts that he was allegedly sending money to an American fighter in Syria. He had been under observation for eight months. The 23-year-old appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon charged with six counts of intentionally making funds available to a terrorist organisation. Scroll down for video . Pictured: Hassan El Sabsabi, age 23. The man was arrested in Seabrook on Tuesday morning following terror raids across five suburbs in Melbourne - Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows . The 23-year-old Seabrook man appeared at the the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon . Around 25,000 pages from social media accounts and 500 telephone calls and messages will have to be analysed as part of the case against the accused, the court heard. Police said earlier that about $12,000 had allegedly been provided to a man in the United States, allowing him to join terrorist militants in Syria some months ago, where he continues to fight there. Prosecutor Andrew Doyle was granted more time to prepare his brief of evidence against El Sabsabi because of the volume of material, a lot of which needs to be transcribed and in some cases translated. 'A substantial amount of material will be sourced from overseas,' Mr Doyle told the court. El Sabsabi's lawyer Trieu Huynh asked for his client to be transferred from the Melbourne Custody Centre to the Melbourne Assessment Prison as soon as possible. He is due to reappear on February 3. 'Given the nature of the charges (and) it's his first time in custody, it's extremely onerous on him,' he said. He also asked for a doctor to examine his client as soon as possible for his medical conditions, which Mr Huynh said he would not outline in open court. In social media posts seen by Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, last month El Sabsabi leapt to the defence of the Islamic State and labelled a story reporting the beheading death of U.S. journalist James Foley as ‘lies’. ‘(You) can never judge the actions of an individual based on a whole group,’ he said. ‘Second, how do you know this wasn’t a soldier, the mujahideen are out there doing what no one has the courage to do it is them against the world.’ El Sabsabi is a Facebook fan of controversial Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, as well as a page condemning the death of a 16-year-old U.S. citizen in a drone strike in Yemen. He had posted an image which said 'Aussie and bloody proud of it!' as his cover photo last month. Federal police officers question members of the public outside a house as part of  raids in Seabrook . Federal police officers investigate a Seabrook home as members of the public look on . In a post last month, El Sabsabi also said the media was filled with ‘lied and deception… a weapon used for hate and destruction’. One neighbour, Herve Du Buisson Perrine, 71, described El Sabsabi as a ‘very friendly’ man in an interview with The Australian. ‘I speak to him almost every day,’ the newspaper quoted Mr Du Buisson Perrine saying. ‘He likes gardening. I like gardening. I’ve given him advice about his lemon trees.’ ‘He’s a very friendly, very nice guy.’ Neighbour Sandeep Singh, 32, saw the man arrested and taken away in a car. 'I've seen him but never spoken to him,' Mr Singh told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was alright, says hello and that's it.' Mr Singh said it was 'a bit scary' to see counter terrorism activity on his street. Police said the joint Australian Federal Police and Victoria Police counter terrorism raids in Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows on Tuesday morning were not related to last week's incident in Endeavour Hills in which an alleged terror suspect was shot dead. Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police took action because they believed more money was about to be sent to the US citizen, who has been fighting in Syria for several months. 'We are of the view that further funds were about to be transferred to this person in Syria, so today was about an overt action to resolve this matter,' he said. In parliament Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australians who fund terrorists are complicit in their 'dreadful deeds'. Mr Abbott said the anti-money laundering agency Austrac had been given an extra $20 million to help track down terrorist funding. Federal cabinet has yet to give final approval for a combat mission in Iraq to fight Islamic State. But Mr Abbott said that subject to cabinet consideration 'our objective is to support governments that don't commit genocide against their own people, nor allow their territory to support terrorism against our people'. ASIO will brief state and territory attorneys-general and police ministers at a meeting in Geelong on Friday on the national security threat. Australian Federal Police officers will also brief the meeting on recent raids. A neighbour said the arrested man moved into the Seabrook residence with his wife in December . Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said  police executed  six more search warrants at residences outside Seabrook to gain evidence in relation to the charges against the man. 'There is no suggestion at this stage that those people were involved in any criminality,' he said. The searches that were conducted were done 'in a far more low-key manner' than other recent terror raids in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Graham Ashton said. 'This is a terrorism financing case, we didn't assess there being a significant community safety risk or a significant risk to our officers,' he said. The 23-year-old man was arrested on Point Cook Road opposite Seabrook Primary School. Victorian Premier Denis Napthine said he was briefed by police as Tuesday's raids started and was told they were part of a long-running and ongoing counter-terrorism operation. 'They are not about a specific threat or there is certainly no immediate concern for public safety,' Dr Napthine told 3AW. More than 100 police officers executed seven search warrants across Melbourne at 6.45am on Tuesday . There is no intelligence to indicate the man was planning a terrorist attack and police believe he acted alone . The premier also urged the community to be tolerant and come together at this time, and said law enforcement was 'ahead of the game' in combating the risk of terrorism. 'It's a sad situation that we now face, but we can have confidence in the work of ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the VicPol. They do a terrific job,' Dr Napthine said. This comes after the two police officers stabbed last week before the fatal shooting of an alleged terrorist at Endeavour Hills  released a statement. 'We would like to thank our family, friends, colleagues and everyone who has helped and supported us through this difficult time,' they said. 'We are both holding up well and appreciate everyone's kind thoughts and well wishes. We ask that our privacy is respected while we continue to recover.' Police fatally shot Numan Haider outside the Endeavour Hills police station where it was arranged they would meet the 18-year-old after conducting raids on his home Tuesday morning. It was agreed that Haider would greet a Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night. Seconds after meeting the 18-year-old he took out a weapon and repeatedly stabbed both officers. He was then killed by a single shot. On Tuesday, Deputy Commissioner Ashton said Haider's family received death threats in the days after his death, which was concerning. He stressed Haider's family had nothing to do with the incident involving the 18-year-old. 'Family, particularly the parents of the young man, received death threats over the weekend,' he told reporters. This is an innocent family. 'I think the fact they received those deaths threats last week is very disappointing.'

"Shrimps' eyes are now being used to help fight the war against cancer after researchers discovered they could detect cancer cells through unique polarised vision. Researchers from the University of Queensland are now duplicating the shrimps' eyes to cameras that will help diagnose cancer by detecting polarised light. Professor Justin Marshall from University of Queensland's Queensland Brain Institute said the finding could provide diagnostic benefits since cancerous tissue reflects polarised light differently to healthy tissue. Shrimps' eyes are now being used to help fight the war against cancer after researchers discovered their vision could detect cancer cells . 'What we can do is use that to specifically design cameras to look for polarisation contrasts and it turns out that one of the things that do contrast in polarisation is cancerous cells'. He said the new camera will focus on polarised light, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Professor Marshall insists humans and animals both have different ways of viewing the world and believes it is important to 'get in the head of another animal'. He said this type of work will provide researchers  information that can only be seen by certain species and said it was like 'seeing the invisible'. Researchers from the University of Queensland are now duplicating the shrimps' eyes to diagnostic cameras, in the hope to better detect polarised light . 'We're a colour-vision animal and we look at things in colour, so we notice a red apple in a green tree for instance. 'Other animals actually do this, but in polarisation'. This polarisation, which was particularly found in shrimps,  also offers a new perspective in image brain activity and nerve cells. Professor Marshall said the findings challenges  evolution and highlights the vast amount of information that have not been discovered. The technology is being developed by researchers from Washington University, the University of Maryland Baltimore County and the University of Bristol.

"The parents of a 14-year-old boy are furious after their son was excluded from school for spending two minutes too long in the toilet. McCauley Timmins, a year 10 pupil at Outwood Academy Valley in Worksop,  was sent home because he spent seven minutes in the toilet instead of the school's regulation of five. His father, Stewart, 56, was disgusted by the decision on Monday and said it was a 'form of bullying' as his son was feeling unwell. Year 10 pupil McCauley Timmins (pictured) spent seven minutes in the toilet and so was excluded from school . He said: 'They only allow five minutes to go to the toilet and McCauley was seven minutes. He was only that long because he wasn't feeling well. 'We knew he wasn't well and we nearly didn't send him to school but we thought he should give it a try. 'He had a second exclusion the same week, because on Wednesday he asked to go to the toilet while he was was in isolation and they are only allowed to go three times a day. 'Even in normal school time toilet breaks are limited. 'He pleaded with them, they wouldn't let him go, so he went anyway because he was going to wet himself, and the excluded him for that as well. 'I believe it is a form of bullying. I have looked into it and they shouldn't be allowed to do it.' An automatic exclusion means the pupil is excluded from the rest of the day's school and sent home. The next day is spent in isolation, separate from the rest of his class. This is finally followed by detention at the end of the day. His mother, Emma, 38, said the issue with the toilet breaks was 'ruining his education' at school . His father, Stewart, 56, complained that the school (pictured) were unwilling to discuss the problem with him . Mr Timmins, a regional sales manager, added: 'You cannot speak to that school, they refuse point blank to discuss things with you. 'We want the school to start being reasonable with the punishments they dish out, the punishment should fit the crime. 'There is no leeway with them, it is very draconian. 'I don't mind them being strict but they should be reasonable.' His wife Emma, 38, said: 'He is doing really well at school but it is ruining his education.' The couple, of Worksop, have two other children, Morgen, 15, and Elliot, five. The school was unavailable for comment when contacted by MailOnline.","McCauley Timmins was sent home from Outwood Academy Valley, Worksop .

"She has so far kept mum on reports she is pregnant with her first child. But Jersey Shore star Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi added fuel to the rumours today when she stepped out sporting what appeared to be an engagement ring. The reality star showed off the diamond as she took her dog for a walk in Jersey City along with her co-star Jennifer 'JWoww' Farley. Engaged?: Snooki stepped out in Jersey City with a diamond on her ring finger . A telling accessory: The ring suggests Snooki is engaged to boyfriend Jionni LaVille . The rock suggests that the 24-year-old has become engaged to her boyfriend Jionni LaVille. She seemed quite happy to flash the bling as she held a neon yellow and black and white patterned bag up on one arm and held her dog's leash on the other. Perhaps appropriately, she sported a black T-shirt emblazoned with a gold sequinned heart. She looked calm, despite  the news that her ex-boyfriend Emilio Masella made a shocking statement that he hopes she has a miscarriage. Masella, who split from Jersey Shore star Snooki in April 2010, made the horrifying admission to TMZ.com. He told the website: 'I hope for her sake ... not to be rude or anything ... but I hope she has a miscarriage.' Masella . also said that he thinks it would be a good idea for Snooki's boyfriend . Jionni LaValle to get a paternity test to confirm that he is in fact . the father of the baby. Keeping mum: Snooki has so far remained tight-lipped amid rumours she is pregnant with her first child . Supportive: Snooki was joimed by her co-star Jennifer 'JWoww' Farley as they took their dogs for a walk in Jersey City . He said: 'I would def recommend her to get . pregnancy test to see who the father is because I’m sure there are other . subjects.' Masella then added: 'Vinny could easily be the father.' However he may find himself in hot water after it was reported that he received a legal warning from Snooki's lawyers last month. Wrapped up warm: Snooki wore jeans, a black leather jacket and a black T-shirt for her walk today . Wheels on fire: JWoww looked delighted today as she was delivered a brand new BMW SUV at the house in Jersey City . TMZ has reported that after Masella . insinuated he could be the father of Snooki's baby, her lawyers issued a . cease and desist letter, threatening to sue if he continued with the . accusations. The document, . issued on February 1, apparently said: 'Demand is hereby made that you . cease and desist from making any additional public statements regarding . Ms. Polizzi that could in any way be taken to be offensive by her.' However, fans of Jersey Shore will know . Snooki and Vinny have always had a close relationship, and ended up . sleeping together on several occasions in the last series of the show. 'I hope you have a miscarriage': Snooki's ex-boyfriend Emilio Masella made this shocking admission to TMZ.com . Moving in: The pair were seen loading things into Snooki's Jersey City apartment over the weekend . In last week's episode of the current series of the MTV show, Vinny was even seen telling viewers that he and Snooki are like the 'Ross and Rachel of Jersey Shore' after they enjoyed a flirty afternoon together. While Snooki has yet to confirm whether or not she is pregnant, it is thought that she is around three months along with her first child. However, Masella added to TMZ.com that Snooki had always been flippant about the prospect of having a family. Who's the daddy? Emilio also suggested that Snooki's Jersey Shore castmate Vinny might be the father of her baby, after their various hook-ups on the show . He said: 'When I was with her, she said she wanted twins. She would always say ""Let’s have twins.""' Masella predicted that Snooki and Jionni will marry after the baby's birth, but that reality star Snooki would 'pull a Kim Kardashian' by 'having the baby and break up with him right after.' Meanwhile, there was better news for jWoww today, when she took delivery of a brand new BMW SUV car at their home in Jersey City.

"Bizarre note: Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver, awaiting trial on the attempted murder of his ex girlfriend, wrote that he 'forgives' his alleged victim . The MMA-fighter accused of brutally assaulting his porn star ex-girlfriend penned a bizarre suicide note before attempting to take his own life in a Las Vegas jail cell, where he paints himself as the victim. Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver, 32, denies 32 felony charges, including attempted murder and rape, following the assault of porn superstar Christy Mack and her male friend. In the letter, Koppenhaver writes that he 'forgives' 23-year-old Mack, who was beaten within an inch of her life in the attack in August, and accuses the district attorney of 'scaring her into telling painful lies' about him. Koppenhaver, who legally changed his name to War Machine in 2008, was found unresponsive about 9:30pm Tuesday by a corrections officer walking by his cell at Clark County jail. Rushing to help, the prison guard was able to call for help and medical aid was administered to the martial artist. In the note, sent to a friend the day before his attempted suicide and obtained by TMZ, Koppenhaver addresses Mack directly, writing: 'I forgive you, please forgive me, I love you. 'In hard times, know that I am there to lean on. Later he adds: 'I still don’t understand how I got into this mess, I don’t know why this had to happen. 'It is one thing to catch a case when you set out to commit a crime, but catching a case when you have nothing but good intentions in your heart is just so hard to accept.’ He then goes on calling some of the 32 charges, including rape, attempted murder and kidnapping, 'B.S. fantasy charges'. He writes that everyone who knows him, 'especially Christy' knows he is a good person with a 'huge heart' and strangely adding that 'I'm not gonna watch the woman I love go on the stand and tell painful lies about me.' He goes on to accuse Mack's agent of forcing her to press charges against him for publicity and money, as well as the district attorney of pressuring and ‘scaring’ Mack into testifying against him. The 32-year-old MMA fighter was arrested in a hotel room in a Los Angeles suburb on August 15, one week after allegedly beating his former girlfriend, Christy Mack, so severely she feared for her life. Mack, 23, told police that the 'War Machine' on August 8 showed up unannounced at her house where she and friend, Corey Thomas, were sleeping. She said Koppenhaver began beating Thomas, before sending him away with the threat that he would have friends kill him if he reported the assault. Attacked: Porn star Christy Mack, 23, says that attack left her with 18 broken bones around her eyes, a nose broken in two places, and hair sawed off by a knife . Victim: Mack, seen here in a self portrait she posted on Instagram, told police she had no idea how many times she was hit . Authorities issued an arrest warrant for Koppenhaver after Mack posted the graphic photos of her injuries online on August 11 . Mack told Las Vegas police that the fighter then turned his attention to her and started attacking her, as he scrolled through her text messages. According to police reports, Koppenhaver punched and kicked Mack and she was treated for extensive facial bruises, fractures, lost teeth and internal injuries, including a lacerated liver. Mack said she escaped, naked, out of a back door when the fighter went to the kitchen, where she thought he was fetching a knife. She later posted a statement online that she feared for her life when Koppenhaver allegedly sawed off her hair with a dull knife. She wrote: 'About 2 a.m. Friday morning (August 8), Jon Koppenhaver arrived unannounced to my home in Las Vegas, NV, after he broke up with me in May he moved out of my house and back to San Diego. 'When he arrived, he found myself and one other fully clothed and unarmed in the house. Without a single word spoken, he began beating my friend; once he was finished, he sent my friend away and turned his attention to me. 'He made me undress and shower in front of him, then dragged me out and beat my face. I have no recollection of how many times I was hit, I just know my injuries that resulted from my beating. 'My injuries include 18 broken bones around my eyes, my nose is broken in two places, I am missing teeth and several more are broken.' Moving on: The 23-year-old porn star posted this image on her Instagram last week, where she is detailing her road to recovery after the brutal assault, writing that she is set to get new teeth put in . Mack went on to write that she was unable to see from her left eye or chew or speak clearly because of her damaged teeth. She also said she could not walk on her own, and had a fractured rib and ruptured liver from a kick to her side. 'I also attained several lesions from a knife he got from my kitchen,' she wrote. 'He pushed the knife into me in some areas such as my hand, ear, and head. He also sawed much of my hair off with this dull knife. 'After some time, the knife broke off of the handle and continued to threaten me with the blade. I believed I was going to die. 'He has beaten me many times before, but never this badly. He took my phone and cancelled all of my plans for the following week to make sure no one would worry about my whereabouts. ' Mack said her ex-boyfriend threatened to rape her. 'He told me he was going to rape me, but was disappointed in himself when he could not get hard. 'After another hit or two, he left me on the floor bleeding and shaking, holding my side from the pain of my rib.' Koppenhaver, who pleaded not guilty tot he 32 charges, is being held without bail and is currently on suicide watch while he awaits trial in Las Vegas . Mack writes that she made her escape when Koppenhaver went into her kitchen where she assumed he was searching for a new knife. 'I ran out my back door, shutting it behind me so the dogs didn't run inside to tip him off. I hoped the fence to the golf course behind my house and ran to a neighboring house. 'Naked and afraid he would catch me, I kept running through the neighborhood knocking on doors. Finally one answered and I was brought to the hospital and treated for my injuries.' Attempt: Jonathan Koppenhaver sent a suicide note the day before he attempted to kill himself . Mack concluded that she had been living in fear of Koppenhaver for months, and that the pair had an abusive relationship in which she dealt with beatings and infidelity in the past. After she put the graphic images online on August 11, the authorities issued a warrant for Koppenhaver and he became the subject of a manhunt. Koppenhaver pleaded not guilty in September to 32 felony charges including attempted murder during his first appearance in a Las Vegas courtroom. Prosecutors, who originally charged Jonathan Koppenhaver with nine felony counts in connection with the beating of his ex-girlfriend, added about two dozen more charges that stretch back to May 2013. The new charges include allegations of burglary, first-degree kidnapping, coercion and sexual assault. Justice of the Peace Melanie Tobiasson ordered Koppenhaver held without bail and he remains in medical isolation while on suicide watch, according to TMZ. The welterweight fighter made his Ultimate Fighting Championship debut in 2007. He legally changed his name in 2008. He lost his only pay-per-view bout that same year. He fought out of San Diego for a variety of promotions and had a 14-5 record as a welterweight. He lost his last fight, in Iowa, last October.","Jonathan 'War Machine' Koppenhaver attempted suicide in jail .

"A bronze sculpture by Turner Prize-winning artist Gillian Wearing  unveiled outside the Library of Birmingham on Thursday was 'hijacked' by a furious New Fathers For Justice campaigner over the weekend. 'A Real Birmingham Family' depicts a heavily pregnant Emma Jones, 27, and her sister Roma, 29, hand-in-hand with their children Kyan, four, and Shaye, five - but has drawn  criticism because of the lack of any adult male or father figure. But Bobby Smith, 32, stuck photos of himself and his two young daughters Ellie, seven, and Mollie, 10, onto the artwork and threw a sheet over the other mother. Scroll down for video . New Fathers for Justice campaigner Bobby Smith, 21, says the 'A Real Birmingham Family' statue outside the Library of Birmingham suggests fathers are not an important part of family life . 'A Real Birmingham Family' depicts a heavily pregnant Emma Jones, 27, and her sister Roma, 29, hand-in-hand with their children Kyan, four, and Shaye, five . The father-of-two spent all of Saturday and today at the statue and said the £100,000 sculpture suggests fathers are not an important part of family life. Mr Smith, who travelled from his home in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, for the protest, is a member of New Fathers For Justice, which campaigns for greater rights for fathers when parents split. It is not associated with Fathers4Justice or its founder Matt O'Connor. He said: 'They've depicted the normal family with no fathers. 'There's nothing wrong with single mothers but this statue is saying one person can do both jobs, and I believe kids are always better off with both parents in their lives. Anger: Mr Smith, who travelled from his home in Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire, for the protest, said: 'They've depicted the normal family with no fathers . 'This is a statue that is potentially going to be around for hundreds of years and it's not a great thing to show young people. 'I thought I was going to get a lot of verbal abuse but people have been so supportive - especially women. 'We engaged with hundreds of people, there were crowds of people listening to my speeches during the day. 'It has sparked a lot of debate and a lot of women came up to me to say they were against it. 'The people of Birmingham told me they felt they had been cheated. 'Birmingham is such a brilliant mixed-ethnicity area and I met so many couples with children who should have been on that statue instead.' Mr Smith, who is carrying out his two-day protest with fellow campaigner, Carole Wheeler, 43, said their actions even gained support from the statue's commissioner. The HGV driver added: 'The police arrived and I thought they weren't going to let me put the pictures on but they said it was fine. 'I told them it was just tape and I had done research about the statue material and made sure it isn't going to do any damage. 'We only had to call the police back once when a woman tried to trip the pictures off but other than that there was no trouble. 'A bloke came out of the library and said he was the one who commissioned it and said he was glad I had come to show my interpretation of the statue.' Birmingham Yardley MP John Hemming has slammed the statue, saying: 'There's absolutely nothing wrong with single parent families but I always find it sad when fathers are not involved in the lives of their children.' Craig Pickering, from the charity Families Need Fathers, added: 'Everybody knows that families can come in all sorts of shapes and sizes but this interpretation of a family seems most bizarre. 'It is factually inaccurate and totally out of step.' Sisters Emma and Roma Jones and their three children were chosen from nearly 400 'real' families as the models for the statue. The campaigner said there were crowds of people listening to his speeches during the day . The HGV driver said: 'The police arrived and I thought they weren't going to let me put the pictures on but they said it was fine' He added: 'There's nothing wrong with single mothers but this statue is saying one person can do both jobs, and I believe kids are always better off with both parents in their lives' But at the unveiling on Thursday, the pair refused to reveal details of their unique family set-up which made a panel of judges pick them as representing the city in the 21st Century. Charity outreach worker Roma, mother to four-year-old Kyan, said: 'We were interested in representing women, representing single parents and also mixed race people, which are such a part of Birmingham. 'Because there isn't an adult male, we thought that would be an issue and that's why possibly we wouldn't be chosen.' Roma and Emma, mother to Shaye, five, and eight-month-old Isaac, were raised by their single mother Karen Jones in a council house in Birmingham. The sculpture was unveiled in Birmingham's Centenary Square. (Left to right) sculptor Gillian Wearing, Roma Jones (29) and Emma Jones (27) and baby Issac (eight months) The sisters, who have two brothers Robin, 25, and Jay, 23, were described as 'polite and well-brought up' by neighbours. Birmingham-born artist Gillian Wearing's previous statue of a family stands in Trento, Italy, and shows a mother, father and their two children. Her new sculpture, which was commissioned by Birmingham's Ikon gallery, was made in China and financed by a mixture of public money and private donations. Miss Wearing, who won the Turner Prize in 1997, said: 'A nuclear family is one reality but it is one of many and this work celebrates the idea that what constitutes a family should not be fixed.'","Bobby Smith, 32, stuck photos of his two young daughters onto the artwork .

"Auction website eBay is on alert to stop people making a profit by re-selling poppies from the Tower of London installation. The ceramic poppies created for the 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' art project have been so popular that all 888,246 of them have sold in advance for £25 each - raising money for armed forces charities in the process. But it has emerged that some of the ceramic poppies are being sold online for profit. Scroll down for video . One unscrupulous seller (pictured) has already tried to sell the £25 charity poppy for a substantial mark up on its original price . Some of the 888,246 ceramic poppies created for the 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' art project . One seller has listed two ceramic poppies on eBay for £49.99 and £65 - more than double the price. The seller known as '2250leanne' said in the description: 'Please note delivery of this item is due late January, early February 2015'. To add further insult the trader asked up £9.99 for postage - double the official website price. Luckily website bosses spotted the dubious listings and removed them immediately. They have now put a system in place to automatically remove any such listings in the future. eBay bosses have put a system in place to prevent people from selling the ceramic poppies on the website . An eBay spokesman said: 'We are not permitting resale of the limited edition Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red ceramic poppies on eBay. 'Any listings attempting to sell these items will be cancelled before any sale takes place. 'Our marketplace is not an appropriate venue for the limited edition ceramic poppies in view of the significance of each individual poppy as a memorial to an individual British military fatality.' He also said 'pre-sale' listings are not permitted on the site so the listings would have been removed in due course anyway. Millions of people have flocked to see artist Paul Cummins' remarkable installation at the Tower of London to mark the centenary of Britain's involvement in the First World War. There will be 888,246 in place by November 11. The number represents each British military fatality during the Great War. The poppies have been sold for £25 each, plus £5.95 for postage, and 10 per cent from each plus all net profits will be divided between six service charities; The Royal British Legion, SSAFA, Combat Stress, Help for Heroes, Coming Home and Cobseo. The poppies first appeared in August and were sold out by October 17. Yeoman Serjeant Bob Loughlin walks through a mass of ceramic poppies which form part of the art installation . A spokesman for the Royal British Legion said: 'The Royal British Legion works closely with eBay and have a dedicated eBay shop selling official poppy products. 'We urge all members of the public using eBay to buy their poppy items, to do so directly from our store. 'We strongly encourage anyone re-selling poppy items to donate to the Legion and advise buyers on eBay to look for the 'eBay for charity' ribbon which identifies listings where a percentage of the sale will be donated to charity. 'In this instance we are grateful that eBay have taken this decision to remove the listings and prevent people profiteering from charity campaigns.'

Mr Ashby, who says he hopes to make it onto Big Brother next, beat more than 1,000 hopefuls to make it into the final of the competition, along with 49 others. In his entry Mr Ashby described his most manliest achievement as 'I once helped an old lady who had fallen down on the street.' His hobbies were listed as singing, modelling and science fiction. An online poll will now decide who brings home the title from the tournament held by grooming brand, The Bluebeards Revenge, men’s cancer charity Orchid and Men’s Fitness magazine. Last month, Mr Ashby made headlines when it was revealed that he was suffering from Couvade Syndrome, in which men develop symptoms similar to those of morning sickness. The name Couvade syndrome (also known as male sympathetic pregnancy) comes from the French 'couver', which means 'to hatch'. It is not a medically recognised condition, although a 2007 study showed that 11 out of 282 expectant fathers surveyed had gone to their GP with symptoms similar to those of their pregnant partners. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weight gain, food cravings, tiredness, depression, fainting and toothache. In more extreme cases, men may develop breasts and a pregnant-looking stomach. Some sufferers said their symptoms subsided as the pregnancy went on, while others said lasted up to and during the labour. Now back at work, Mr Ashby added: 'I think people should back me because I’ve been working hard for 10 years and it would be great to win the title. Finding fame: Mr Ashby and his fiancee Charlotte also appeared on This Morning to tell their story . Uncomfortable: Mr Ashby's 'morning sickness' has seen him pile on the pounds and suffer from nausea . 'I want to branch out and get on Big Brother - that’s one of my main aims to make some money and a name for myself. I’ve put so much work into this. 'Life’s hard and I don’t mind working but at the same time I’m a big dreamer.” Jacob Anthony Lott, aged 21 and also from Birmingham, and Solihull businessman RS, aged 24, also appear in the shortlist. Describing the title as 'life changing' organiser Nick Gibbens said: 'We don’t define what’s manly - we’ll let you decide on that one. 'But we do know that these guys look the part, with their chiselled jawlines, rugged good looks and masculine physiques. 'Of course, there’s more to it than looks alone, and this is something that we feel should be given careful consideration.' The winner will bag a one year modelling contract and work to encourage other men to check themselves for testicular, penile and prostate cancer.","Harry Ashby, 29, was signed off work with morning sickness last month .

"A University of Delaware graduate has come forward to tell the story of how a professor offered to give her an 'A' grade in exchange for oral sex. The recent graduate, who has remained unidentified, spoke out to NBC Washington and shared the email she received from sociology professor Eric Tranby, reportedly asking 'will you blow me for an a?' That professor has since resigned, but the graduate says the university has been uncommunicative about their investigation and she wants more answers. Scroll down for video . Grades: Former University of Delaware Professor Eric Tranby (pictured) has been accused of asking a student for sex in exchange for an 'A' grade . The woman first accused Tranby, who was also her advisor, last May. 'He told me what specific sexual acts he wanted to perform with me,' she said. She says he even bragged about having sex with other students in his office, after hours. 'He said, ""Oh well, you know, we just cover up the webcam and pull the blinds down.""' The student declined, and that's when Tranby got scared. He sent another email back apologizing for the comment, writing that he knew it was wrong 'as soon as I typed it'. He then allegedly begged her not to tell school administrators, saying it would ruin his career and he would give her a top grade anyway. While Tranby denied the allegations in two interviews, he eventually went on administrative leave and resigned at the end of the school year. Issues: Some 300 students gathered last term after Tranby resigned, demanding more transparency from the school administration . The student in question says her experience reporting the incident to the school has been a nightmare, and that it seemed like officials were trying to cover it up. 'You realize that they are not doing anything for me,' she said. 'Or if they are I don’t know about it. I don’t know what’s taking place. It needs to stop. Somebody needs to do something and it needs to stop.' Tranby's resignation sparked a protest last semester, with about 300 students gathering to demand more transparency from the school. A spokesman for the school told NBC that they are not allowed to comment on the specifics of the case, but say the incident was 'handled promptly and properly with sensitivity to the complainant and clear communication with all parties involved.' MailOnline's calls to Tranby were not returned Thursday.","Recent graduate claims Professor Eric Tranby sent her an email asking 'will you blow me for an a?'

"AC Milan bounced back from their disappointing defeat to Genoa with a 2-0  win against Napoli at the San Siro. But there was no place in the squad for Fernando Torres - who could be heading for a January exit despite being just six months into a two-year loan deal - after the club revealed he was suffering from flu-like symptoms.

"A man who casually spat his chewing gum on to the pavement has been ordered to pay £845 for littering the streets . Niklas Kotlar, 26, ignored an on-the-spot-fine imposed by a litter patrol officer who caught him spitting out his gum. He was told he could pay a £50 on-the-spot fine or argue his case in court before magistrates. But when he failed to turn up at court on the appointed date Kotlar was hit with a £600 fine and ordered to pay £245 in costs. Councils say the cost of cleaning chewing gum from the pavements and roads costs around £150m a year . He is the latest person to be hit with a big fine as councils across the UK get tough on people who casually discard rubbish on the streets. Fixed penalty notices are regularly handed out to those people who throw away sweet papers, fast food wrappers and cigarette butts in the street. But chewing gum has become the scourge of councils because it is so difficult to remove and local authorities have to bring in specialist cleaning equipment to vaporise it from the pavements. Councils say the annual cost of removing it from the pavements, roads and street furniture across the UK is around £150m a year and rising. It has become such a widespread menace that a Chewing Gum Action Group (CGAG) has been formed with the backing of major chewing gum producers. It has the support of Defra, the Keep Britain Tidy campaign, the Local Government Association and the Chartered Institute of Wastes Management. Councils are cracking down on chewing gum . It was set up with the purpose of delivering a long-term solution to the ‘irresponsible disposal of chewing gum’ and runs tailor-made campaigns across Britain. Earlier this month the Queen advertised for a Royal chewing gum remover to keep her palaces and residences free of the sticky stuff. An official advert for a cleaner at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh states the successful applicant must ‘arrange for the removal of chewing gum from Historic and State Apartments’. The £16,000-per-year job listed on the British Monarchy website will require the staff member to pick sticky gum off furniture for four hours a day. Bolton Council is the latest local authority to get tough on litterbugs with an anti-litter campaign that netted a handful of offenders. Two other people were prosecuted at the same court for dropping cigarette butts and another for throwing a receipt on to the ground. Marwan Alsamdai,19, pleaded guilty to dropping a cigarette outside Bolton College on May 20 but became aggressive with enforcement officers, swore, and left without accepting the fixed penalty notice. He was fined £400 landed with court costs of £240. Jackaleen Howcroft, 17, dropped a cigarette butt in the town centre in February 6, did not pick it up, refused to pay the £50 fine and was hit with a fine for £600 and £260 court costs.. Andras Karaszi, 18, dropped a till receipt and was given a fixed penalty notice for littering. But he failed to pay the original fine and did not appear in court. He was handed £600 fine by magistrates and ordered to pay £334 in court costs. Cllr Nick Peel, of Bolton Council, said: ‘All of them could have paid the fixed penalty notice of £50 if they had paid it within 10 days. Why they did not pay it I don’t know. ‘If you are caught throwing rubbish on the ground, you will be prosecuted. We are pleased the court is backing the council in taking a robust view on this sort of behaviour.’ Cleaners in Coventry street in London are pictured trying to remove chewing gum from the pavement .","Niklas Kotlar must pay £845 after he spat chewing gum on the street .

"Harley-Joe Steele (pictured) left college in the hope of joining the Royal Navy - but was turned down because he wears braces . A teenager who left college to join the Royal Navy has been turned down - because he wears braces. Harley-Joe Steele, 17, had reached the last stages of the application process but fell at the final hurdle because of the metal braces he has worn for the last year. Despite attending interviews and assessments over the last six months after giving up his school education for the service, it is only now that he has been turned down - just weeks before he was due to start training. The Royal Navy has admitted that the braces were not mentioned in its own list of medical conditions which could temporarily prevent recruitment. The teenager, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, said: 'I was devastated when they told me I had failed the medical because of the braces as I wasn't fit for training. 'I first applied about six months ago when I was still at school, and have gone through the process of four different interviews and tests, but no-one said anything about my braces. 'I've had them for a year and don't know how much longer I need to wear them for but I wouldn't have left school then if they had told me about this earlier. 'Why didn't they say anything before? I've given up school because I thought I would be joining the Navy this year and now all of a sudden I've got nothing. 'I will have to try and find a job and then apply again when I get the braces off.' His father Simon Akeroyd said the youngster had been through 'weeks and weeks' of interviews and tests as well as face-to-face interviews without anyone mentioning the braces. 'There are going to be loads of kids going through this, Mr Akeroyd said. 'I can't understand why there wasn't anything on the application form, if this is a rule. 'He left school because this was going to be his career, and now he's just sitting around the house with nothing to do until his braces come off. 'Some kids don't want braces, but he was happy to have them to sort his teeth out. 'This has been such a knock-back.' The youngster, who applied to be a weapons engineer, has simply been advised to apply again after the braces have been removed. When he initially had them fitted a year ago, he was told they needed to stay on for two years. A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'The briefing material given to potential recruits does mention temporary medical conditions that would bar them from entering the Service, however braces is not specifically listed. Harley-Joe Steele (pictured) said he was 'devastated' after going through weeks of interviews with the Royal Navy only to fall at the final hurdle because of the metal braces he has worn for the last year . 'The Service does provide emergency dental and medical cover, but there is no time in an already packed schedule for new recruits to be released to attend orthodontic appointments at home. 'Once the braces are removed, there is no reason that the individual cannot reapply (unless it is within 12 months, then they do not have to re-apply), providing, of course, they pass the rest of the medical.' But the family's MP David Ward said: 'This sends out a poor message on the competence of the Royal Navy. 'Needing your teeth straightening isn't a medical condition, you'd hardly call a brace a medical aid - it's a cosmetic aid. 'It's almost beyond belief that no-one at any point has pointed it out to him right until the very end. 'I will see what I can do to help, If necessary I will contact the Royal Navy on his behalf.'","Harley-Joe Steele reached last stages of application process for Royal Navy .

"Parents are deluding themselves if they think television programmes such as Peppa Pig and Thomas the Tank Engine are educational, an academic claims. ‘According to some, these shows are great for learning numbers, words, even new languages,’ said Dr Trina Hinkley in an article for the teachers’ journal TES. ‘Unfortunately none of this is true.’ Studies among children from birth to four find that TV viewing can be ‘harmful to children’s physical and mental health’, said Dr Hinkley after reviewing international research. An academic has claimed shows like Peppa Pig do not help children with literacy or numeracy skills . She added: ‘Children who watch more TV tend to have a higher risk of being overweight or obese and to have poorer cognitive development for their age, including language development and the ability to pay attention, both of which are key to school readiness.’ Parents should keep a diary recording to the minute their children’s screen time, said Dr Hinkley, a researcher at Deakin University in Australia. ‘Many find that their children are spending about twice as much time using electronic media as they thought.’ She said parents may need to endure a ‘few unpleasant tantrums’ as their children’s viewing is reduced, but that schools also have a role to play in educating parents about the possible damaging effects of too much television.","Studies among children from birth to four find that TV viewing can be ‘harmful to children’s physical and mental health’, an academic says .

"Prosecutors have called for the death penalty in the horrific case of the Muslim ex-convict accused of beheading a female coworker at the processing plant where they were employed. Alton Nolen, from Moore, Oklahoma, was formally charged with first-degree murder and assault on Tuesday after he was released from hospital. He stands accused of cutting off the head of his former colleague in a bloody rampage hours after he was dismissed from his job at Vaughan Foods for racial comments. He pleaded not guilty in court to both charges and was ordered held without bond. Scroll down for video . New mugshot: Alton Nolen (above) took a new mugshot today after he was released from the hospital . 'Appropriate': District Attorney Greg Mashburn met with the victim's family before deciding to seek the penalty . Victims: Nolen allegedly tried to behead coworker Traci Johnson (left) after co-worker Colleen Hufford (right) The Cleveland County District Attorney Greg Mashburn said he waited to discuss the decision with the family of killed worker Traci Johnson before he sought the death penalty. 'I let them know it was my ultimate decision, but I wanted to know their feelings,' he told The Oklahoman. He said the family felt it would be appropriate, and the paperwork has now been submitted. Authorities say the attack, which happened last Thursday, appears to have been an act of revenge for a complaint made by Ms Johnson that got him suspended earlier in the day. According to reports, Ms Johnson complained to human resources at the Vaughan Foods plant after the two allegedly had a fight 'about him not liking white people.' After being sent home, Nolen reportedly got a knife, hiding it in his shoe when he returned to the plant. He then entered the administrative office, where he allegedly beheaded 54-year-old grandmother Colleen Hufford. Sent away: Nolen (above) was held without bond after pleading not guilty to assault and first-degree murder . Investigation: The FBI is investigating the attack, given Nolen's interest in beheadings . He then turned his attention to Johnson, and 'cut her across the throat and left side of her face.' DA Mashburn said he sought the death penalty on the grounds that the victim’s death was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel. He said he also will allege Nolen is a continuing threat to society, and he put more than one person at great risk of death. The fourth 'aggravating circumstance' in Mashburn's report reminds that Nolen has been previously convicted of a felony involving violence against a person. An affidavit states that he later told police he was trying to behead her as well. The company's chief operating officer, Mark Vaughan, a reserve sheriff's deputy in Oklahoma City, then leveled a rifle at Nolen and fired, striking him once and stopping the attack. Nolen had been hospitalized from the wounds he suffered during this shooting until earlier today. The FBI is also investigating the attack, given Nolen's interest in beheadings and a recent surge in Middle East violence. Oklahoma prison records show Nolen was released from prison in March 2013 after serving two years of a six-year sentence on charges that included assaulting a police officer and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.","District Attorney has sought the death penalty for Alton Nolen .

"Pleaded guilty: PC Helen Jones, 31, is said to have posed as an on-duty officer in Merseyside. When this photograph was taken, Helen Jones was a PCSO with Cheshire Constabulary . A police officer has pleaded guilty to falsely obtaining CCTV video of an alleged street dispute involving footballer Steven Gerrard. PCSO Helen Jones, 31, is said to have pretended she was on-duty in order to get the footage from a bank near the footballer’s home in Formby, Merseyside. It is alleged to show a dispute involving the former England captain, his wife Alex and another man that has led to a legal battle in the High Court. Jones, who had previously pleaded not guilty to a misconduct charge, changed her plea as she was due to face trial today at Preston Crown Court in Lancashire. She was said to have ‘wilfully and without reasonable excuse or justification misrepresented she was an on-duty police officer and recovered CCTV.’ Richard Hough, prosecuting, told the court that the Crown did not accept the basis of her plea because it is alleged she had a ‘criminal or illegal purpose’ for obtaining the CCTV. ‘The Crown say this whole enterprise by the defendant was carried out in effect for a criminal or illegal purpose to be carried out by others,’ he said. ‘Her role was to perpetrate criminal matters or illegal matters.’ Mr Hough added that she had ‘told lies’ and been ‘deceitful’ in her statement to police following her arrest and had sought to provide an alibi. Roderick Jones, defending, said it was his client's position that she did not obtain the footage for a criminal purpose. At . the time of the incident - on August 8, 2013 - Jones was on a career . break from Merseyside Police after starting a sabbatical in March that . year.

"The set designer behind the sea of poppies was yesterday forced to defend his work after an art critic used his blog on a Left-wing newspaper’s website to claim it was ‘trite’. Tom Piper, who is acclaimed for his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company, said it was a powerful communal tribute to the vast loss of human life in the 1914-18 conflict. He said: ‘This is not an installation about war, or an illustration of its violence and barbarity; it is about loss and commemoration that has given individuals a unique way to tap into their own family history and appreciate some of the human cost.’ Criticised: Guardian art critic Jonathan Jones said the poppy installation at the Tower of London is 'too pretty to communicate the grim realities of the First World War' Mr Piper responded after Jonathan Jones, an art critic with the Guardian, derided the artwork – called Blood Swept Lands And Seas Of Red – as too pretty to communicate the grim realities of the First World War. It represented, he sneered, ‘the inward-looking mood that lets Ukip thrive’. He added: ‘In spite of the mention of blood in its title, this is a deeply aestheticised, prettified and toothless war memorial.’ His views appeared completely out of kilter with the nation, who have turned up to view it in their millions. Defence: Tom Piper, who is acclaimed for his work with the Royal Shakespeare Company, said it was a powerful communal tribute to the vast loss of human life in the 1914-18 conflict . Poignant: Yeoman Serjeant Bob Loughlin walks through a mass of ceramic poppies which form part of the art installation 'Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red' at the Tower of London . Too popular: The general public has been urged to cancel planned visits to the Tower of London to see the magnificent poppy display as the site is becoming too overcrowded . Mr Piper, 49, said: ‘I would say it is a far subtler piece of work than people might take it for. ‘We are all inured to scenes of violence on TV and film, and one thing I have learned from theatre design is not to illustrate a play with the obvious. I think it a remarkably good thing that it is so accessible. We should not be trying to create something that is difficult to understand.’ The artwork is set to raise about £10million for six military charities, including the Royal British Legion, from the sale of each ceramic poppy for £25. The poppies have been planted by volunteers since August and the installation, which has turned the moat into a sea of vermilion, has been visited by the Queen. Prime Minister David Cameron said it was a ‘stunning display and extremely poignant’. Volunteers will start to take them away the day after November 11.","Set designer of the Tower of London poppies attacked by Guardian critic .

The toxicology report also says a low level of Diazepam or Valium also was detected, but at a level so low to have a 'negligible effect' according to a release. The autopsy report finalized Friday shows the 36-year-old Bironas died of blunt force trauma after his SUV went off the road and crashed into a line of trees Sept. 20, and 911 calls described Bironas as chasing people and trying to run them off the road before losing control of his 2009 Yukon Denali near his home.

Police said in a statement after the crash that there was no evidence of alcohol or drugs at the scene, and the investigation is continuing. Family and friends said at his funeral Sept. 25 that they would remember Bironas for how he lived and not the final 30 minutes of his life. Bironas married Rachel Bradshaw in June. She's the daughter of Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback Terry Bradshaw. His wife called 911 before learning he had crashed because she thought he had gone to bed for the night and then couldn't find him in their home. From Louisville, Kentucky, Bironas played nine seasons with the Tennessee Titans, and he was the fourth most-accurate kicker in NFL history, connecting on 85.7 percent of his kicks (239 of 279). He made a franchise-record 11 winning field goals during his career before being released in March. Bironas' father, Larry said in a statement published by The Tennessean 'We appreciate the hard work of the local authorities to help us begin to answer the many questions we have had surrounding the death of our son. Successful: Bironas played nine seasons with the Tennessee Titans, and he was the fourth most-accurate kicker in NFL history . The autopsy report finalized Friday shows the 36-year-old Bironas died of blunt force trauma . Rachel Bradshaw called 911 before learning Bironas had crashed because she thought he had gone to bed for the night and then couldn't find him in their home . 'Today we learned that Rob had been drinking, and got behind the wheel. This is something he didn't do as a rule. We don't know why he made that choice this time. Rob made a mistake, and he paid the ultimate price. We appreciate the outpouring of support, care and concern showed to us by Rob's friends, the NFL, and the Nashville community. We appreciate your respect for his mother and me, his siblings, his son, and his wife as we grieve.' Before his death, Bironas allegedly targeted other drivers on the road, The Tennessean reported. The newspaper reported on a 911 call, in which a woman said 'He is dangerous, he is drunk or something. He tried to start a fight with us.' 'My husband ran down there to see what is going on. I just want to tell the police there is something wrong with him. He is dangerous, he is drunk or he is on drugs. There is something wrong with him. He gave us a mean look. We don't even know him, and he tried to run us off the road.' College student Connor Fraley told The Tennessean Bironas verbally and physically threatened him and his fellow vehicle occupants. Fraley told the newspaper 'His window was down, and we pulled up and I said, ""Hey man, just a heads up, something's burning from your exhaust. Your exhaust smells horrible, just wanted to let you know."" 'He looked over at me and said ""I'm going to kill everybody in your (expletive) vehicle. It was so random, so bizarre I was like, ""What?"" And he said the exact same thing again.' Fraley also claimed '[Bironas] tried to sideswipe the vehicle and missed us by a foot.'","Titans kicker Rob Bironas had a blood alcohol content more than twice the legal limit for driving in Tennessee when he died in a one-vehicle crash .

"If you're feeling a bit blue, it might be time to move to Utah. The state has been named the happiest in the country by a new study - while West Virginia has been named the most unhappy. After comparing 27 different factors including mental and physical health, job security, suicide rates and outlook on life, WalletHub ranked every single state by how happy its residents are. It concluded that Utah, Minnesota, North Dakota, Colorado and Nebraska are the most content states, while West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas and Kentucky are the most miserable. And if you look at a map of the states, residents in the East and the South are generally less content than their Midwest counterparts. (Hover over each state to see its happiness ranking.) WalletHub, a personal finance social network, ranked each state in three categories to come up with the final list. The first category was 'emotional and physical well-being', which was determined by 13 factors including life expectancy, obesity, the prevalence of sleep deprivation and suicide rate. Next there was 'work', which was determined by six factors including commute time, work hours, income level and unemployment. Finally, they ranked the states by 'community, environment and recreational activities', which was determined by seven factors including weather, number of attractions, safety and divorce rate. How happy is your state? The team at WalletHub came up with the list for the happiest state after finding out how each state ranked in 27 different factors, including these pictured here . Rankings: The final list was also reached by looking at income growth, divorce rate and safety . They then looked at the ranking of each state in these three categories - in Utah's case, it was first in 'community, environment and recreational activities', second in 'work' and 3rd in 'emotional and physical well-being' - to determine which states had scored highest overall. By comparison, West Virginia came 51st in 'emotional and physical well-being', 50th in 'community, environment and recreational activities' and 46th in 'work' - putting it firmly at the bottom. WalletHub also provided rankings for each of the 27 factors used to determine the results. Among them, Hawaii, California and New Jersey lead the country in lowest prevalence of depression, while Kentucky, Oregon and Maine have the highest. If you need to catch up on some sleep, results showed you might want to head to South Dakota, Wyoming or Colorado - and stay away from Kentucky, Hawaii and West Virginia. Stunning: An image of Bryce Point in Utah. The state  ranked 2nd for sports participation, 4th lowest percentage of obese residents and the lowest median of hours worked - so the landscape can be fully appreciated . Employees in Alaska and North Dakota work the most hours per week, while Utah workers have the lowest weekly median hours in the office. Utah also has the lowest divorce rate - along with North Dakota and Hawaii - while D.C., Nevada and Louisiana have the most splits. To make each ranking, the team at WalletHub used information from sources including the U.S. Census Bureau, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Gallup Healthways and Tripadvisor, among others.

"Buses may be forced to increase their loads as passengers' waistlines continue to expand at a frightening speed across Australia. Two-axle buses are feeling a serious strain from heavier commuters with an almost 20 per cent rise in overweight and obese adults, prompting the National Transport Commission to call for an extra two tonnes to be added onto the maximum limit. Experts say that although these statistics are not surprising, it is yet another sign that obesity is a growing concern in Australia. Scroll down for video . The maximum load on buses may be increased by two tonnes due to Australians gaining weight . Obesity has increased almost 20 per cent between 1989 and 2012 . Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said obesity is a very real issue across the country. 'It highlights that we as a nation really need to keep working hard at all levels to turn it around, although it's not a quick fix problem,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is important for the safety of people to have appropriate transport arrangements and obviously if that is affecting the safety of buses then they need to address that.' The NTC's annual report states that when the laws were designed in 1989 the average adult's weight was taken as 65kg. However, that was a conservative estimate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, with the average man weighing in at 77.4kg and the average woman at 62.6kg. Since then, waistlines have only continued growing. The NTC says a 2011-12 Australian Health Survey found the average male had increased to 86kg, while the average weight for a female was 71kg. The health report further found about 63 per cent of adults were now overweight or obese - up from 45 per cent in 1989. 'It is possible that buses can be technically overloaded even when within their maximum passenger operating limits,' the NTC annual report explains. The health report found about 63 per cent of adults were now overweight or obese - up from 45 per cent in 1989 . Something's got to give, argue bus operators, and the NTC has recommended that the National Vehicle Regulator develop a notice to allow an 18-tonne nationwide limit. Ms Hourigan said the obesity problem could stretch across all forms of transport. 'It's the same thing when you hope into a lift and it says this lift for 10 people and you look around and think ""well they would have to be 10 very slim people to fit in here"",' she said. 'So it is an increasing problem certainly on other forms of transport - the dilemma is there whether it be planes.' But buses are not just struggling with fatter passengers. Wheelchair access lifts, fuel-efficient engines, rollover protection devices and air-conditioning units are also adding weight to each bus. The notice to increase the limit by two tonnes is expected to be progressed over the next year, the NTC said. Ms Hourigan said society must not lose hope on improving the issue with education and prevention being the key factors. 'There are little glimmers of hope around such as in the U.S where the consumption of McDonald's and Coca Cola has been decreasing and their sales are dropping - perhaps it will be a bit of a trend that might reflect back eventually on weight loss but it takes time to see those changes,' she said. 'In Australia we know there has been a bit of improvement with children - but again it takes time to make those changes - but it means that governments need to keep investing in prevention programs and in ways of dealing with the problem.' The notice to increase the limit by two tonnes on buses is expected to be progressed over the next year .","Buses are struggling with maximum load limits due to growing obesity .

"Samuel See, 34, died of a drug overdose, a medical examiner confirmed today . A Yale University professor found dead in a prison cell overdosed on meth, the medical examiner's office said on Monday. Samuel See, 34, suffered acute methamphetamine and amphetamine intoxication with recent myocardial infarction on November 24 last year, according to courant.com. Mr See died at the Union Avenue detention . facility in Connecticut just hours after he was arrested following a . domestic dispute with his estranged husband Sunder Ganglani, 32. Mr See's death was ruled an accident . after he was found alone by police in his cell around 6am. He was . pronounced dead following attempts to revive him. The rising academic star, who taught literature, was on leave from the Ivy League school at the time of his death. Police are now investigating Mr See's death. On the evening of November 23, Mr See was arrested at his home in New Haven, Connecticut after the professor's sister called the police. According . to detectives, Mr See's estranged husband Mr Ganglani had dropped by to pick up his belongings and stayed there for . more than two hours in violation of an order of protection. Sudden death: The English professor was found unresponsive in a cell at the Union Avenue Detention Facility in New Haven in November last year . When Mr See asked police to remove his spouse from his residence, officers told him that Mr Ganglani also had an order of protection against . him. Police said Mr See then 'became enraged,' yelling that he should not be arrested because it was his house. See allegedly put up a fight as the officers tried to handcuff him. As . he was being led to the police cruiser waiting outside, See allegedly screamed at one of the cops: 'I will kill you... I will destroy . you.’ Mr Ganglani was also arrested. The Yale professor was taken to a hospital to be treated for a cut above his eye. He was taken to the Union Avenue facility about 9pm and charged with . violating a protective order, interfering with police and threatening. Young intellectuals: See had met his husband in Yale, where Ganglani (pictured) worked as a teaching assistant and artistic producer at The Foundry Theater . The young educator had previously had run-ins with police. On September 18, See and Ganglani - who married last May after meeting at Yale - were . arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace and third-degree assault, . in what court records indicate was a domestic dispute. The two were . issued orders of protection by the court, ordering the couple to avoid . close contact. See, who obtained his PhD from . UCLA in 2009, was an assistant professor of English and American . studies at Yale.  His work centered around themes of sexual orientation in modern literature. ‘The University community is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Samuel See. Our condolences go out to his family, faculty colleagues, and students, and his friends at Yale and elsewhere,’ the administration of Yale said in a statement. Shortly after his tragic death, it emerged that See's personal details were posted on various male escort websites. New Haven Register . reported that the website Ryan Cochran Escort Services included See's . phone number which was listed on an order of protection filed against . him in September. A profile photo on the same site allegedly also matches See's profile photograph on a LinkedIn account.

"With a wealth of personal connections to the country and a sense of Italian identity ‘rooted' in her psyche, Alex Polizzi's latest series for Channel 5 was always going to be an emotional affair. In a touching scene from the first episode of Alex Polizzi’s Secret Italy, the presenter is shown sampling some frittelle - a type of Venetian doughnut, which her late grandmother often used to make. One bite is enough to transport her back to her nonna’s kitchen and tears well up in her eyes. ‘She was an amazing cook and I’m really sad that I didn’t take more advantage at the time. Coming back here has reminded me just how much this city means to me’, she says. Sail away: Polizzi reveals how visitors to Venice can escape the crowds on the city's famous waterways . Taste of the good life: Alex travelled to Bagolino to visit a famous cheese-making business . All four of Polizzi’s grandparents were Italian and she considers the show to be a homage to her family and the regions they came from. It’s a heartfelt love letter to the country - one that is littered with superlatives and will have viewers researching their next trip as soon as the credits roll. Polizzi, who is best known to viewers as The Hotel Inspector, admits that Italy is a ‘well-trodden path’ but most of the locations that feature in the programme have some sort of personal significance, including the hillside village of Monforte, which was her late grandfather’s home, and the Amalfi coast, which she visited on her honeymoon. By ‘secret’ she means the side of the country that tourists usually don’t get to see, including lace-making on the island of Burano, a family cheese-making business in Bagolino and a women’s prison that makes toiletries for luxury hotels. Going back to her roots: The presenter has a strong connection with Venice and has visited more than 40 times . Her grand tour starts on Friday with a visit to Venice, which is ‘achingly, achingly beautiful’ and gives her ‘shivers to be back’. The city, she asserts, is one of the wonders of the world and stirs up further emotion: ‘I feel tearful of the beauty of it, it takes my breath away. It’s places like Venice that marks us out as a civilised world and it makes me sad because I don’t think we’re creating anything these days that is as impressive.’ It’s a city that Polizzi knows well: her grandmother, who died five years ago, was Venetian and her mother’s best friend still lives there. She has visited at least 40 times but admits that, while there’s much to love, there is one thing that detracts: the crowds of tourists. ‘Venice has become so touristy and it is so crowded, it can be really off-putting’, she says. ‘ Lots of people go to Venice with a kind of ‘tick box’ mentality, you know, ‘must see the Guggenheim, must go over Accademia bridge, must, must’. And actually, they are so busy doing that that they don’t really take time to look around.’ Making a splash: The crew are pictured filming on Venice's famous waterways for the new series . Escaping the crowds: Alex got up very early in the morning to avoid the tourists at Venice's Bridge of Sighs . Like many people, Polizzi is not a fan of the big cruise ships that sail into Saint Mark's Basin, which she says dwarf Venice and don’t add enough to the local economy: ‘People come off with a packed lunch and a bottle of water. They might buy a coffee but that’s all they buy and then they throng the streets like some mad, baying pack all with the same list of things to see. 'It makes it a pretty miserable experience really. I would say that between the hours of 10am and 6pm central Venice is pretty impassable.’ But, Polizzi claims, escaping the tourist hordes isn’t all that difficult: one way is to get up very early in the morning or go out late at night. In the show, she heads to Piazza San Marco in the heart of the city at day break and has only early morning joggers and sweet sweepers for company: ‘It feels as if it is a stage set, it is so beautiful.’ At a deserted Bridge of Sighs she realises it’s the first time in years that she hasn't had to fight her way through ‘six layers of tourists with cameras’. Taste of local life: In Bagolino, Polizzi met a family that had been making their famous cheese for generations . Sweet treat: The series also gave Polizzi the chance to sample some of the cakes she used to eat as a child . Another of Polizzi’s tips is to get the number one water bus - or vaporetto - which takes you all the way up the Grand Canal: ‘Instead of spending €80 for 40 minutes in a gondola you get to actually travel in comfort and see these amazing palazzi. It’s really exciting how beautiful everything is.’ Another drawback to the city is just how expensive it is. Polizzi takes the cameras into the Bauer Hotel’s opulent Royal Suite, which once hosted Charles and Camilla and costs a regal €15,000 a night. And the world got a glimpse of how extravagant life in the city could be when George Clooney married Amal Alamuddin at the seven-star Aman Canal Grande Hotel last month. ‘I know the Aman and it is unbelievably beautiful, it really is’, Polizzi says. ‘But I think what’s sad in Venice, even to stay somewhere really pretty nasty costs €250 to €300 a night. There’s not much option. You either stay on the mainland and come in very early in the morning or you come on a cruise ship. Otherwise, most people just can’t afford it. ‘Every time we go I’m just astonished at how expensive it is. It’s the only place in the world that my husband has ever refused to let me touch the mini bar. It’s €10 for 30ml of coke, it’s really ridiculous.’ Fashionable destination: Alex headed to Milan to discover what makes the city so chic . Rising to the occasion: Polizzi discovered how to make the perfect panettone in Milan . Another highlight of the series for Alex was returning to Rome, where she lived for three years in her twenties. Her father, Count Alessandro Polizzi (he was killed in a car accident when Alex was nine), was Roman and his family still live there. Polizzi lived with her boyfriend in the city’s Jewish Quarter which she says felt like a little village and boasts the best ice cream in Rome. The quarter also has one of the city’s oldest bakeries, which is known for its excellent kosher cakes and infamous customer service. Pasticceria Boccione is run by three formidable sisters and is so famous it doesn’t need a name above the door. But service comes without a smile: ‘When I lived there I visited this shop almost every day and every time it was like the first time they had ever seen me’, laughs Alex. Even in front of the camera, the ladies remain poker-faced. Her guide, Micaela Pavoncello explains: ‘They pretend they are annoyed but inside they love it.’ Alex cut her teeth as a restaurant manager working for her uncle at the city’s Hotel de Russie, which is owned by Rocco Forte Hotels (Alex’s grandfather was Lord Forte who founded the Forte Group). The hotel boasts a spectacular garden, which Polizzi describes as a ‘secret oasis of calm’ and which the artist Pablo Picasso at one time treated like his ‘own Roman living room’. ‘It’s very special. As far as I know it’s the only garden in a hotel in the whole of Rome. Anyone who is in Rome should go there for a drink just for a break from the frenetic pace of life’, Polizzi says. Alex at the Hotel de Russie whose stunning garden (right) provides an 'oasis of calm' in the centre of Rome . Keeping it in the family: Alex with her mother Olga in the Hotel de Russie's stunning garden . But her three yearsin Rome weren't a bed of roses and Polizzi describes the period as a ‘very bittersweet time’. ‘When I was growing up, I always felt very Italian when I was in England and very English when I was in Italy. I thought I was going to put that to bed when I fell madly in love and moved to Italy full time’, she explains. ‘And I realised when I was in Italy that England is an amazing place to live in just because it has order, there are rules. I found the kind of chaos of the Italian systems completely overwhelming. I was happy to move back actually.’ Famous bakery: Polizzi visited Pasticceria Boccione in Rome with her guide Micaela Pavoncello (right) Polizzi may not want to live in Italy but she returns to the country several times a year and is keen to introduce her two small children to their heritage. The show allowed her to spend more time in Naples, which she says people avoid because it is big, chaotic and associated with the mafia, but which she found to be fascinating. She also advises sunseekers to head to Sardinia if they want beautiful coastline: ‘The Amalfi coast is very scenic but it’s not the most beautiful sea in Italy by any means.’ But The Hotel Inspector reveals that even she made some bad choices when it came to accommodation: ‘I'm just like everyone else, when I was planning this trip I had to stick a pin in lots of hotels. I actually walked out of one hotel. They knew I had a one-and-a-half year old child and it had an unenclosed staircase in it. I could just see him falling to his death immediately!’ Alex Polizzi’s Secret Italy is on Fridays at 9pm on Channel 5 .","Polizzi’s latest show for Channel 5 is a heartfelt love letter to Italy .

"A study of ancient human bones has revealed how Early Europeans had difficulties digesting milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming. It took at least that long for their genes to evolve until they were no longer intolerant to lactose, the natural sugar in mammalian milk, scientists suggests. Researchers looked at ancient DNA extracted from 13 individuals buried at archaeological sites in the Great Hungarian Plain - a region known to have been at the crossroads of cultural change in European prehistory. Scroll down for video . A study of ancient human bones has revealed how Early Europeans had a problem drinking milk around 5,000 years after the introduction of farming. Pictured is a Late Bronze Age burial from the site of Ludas-Varjú-dulo, Hungary dated to about 1200 B.C. This individual revealed the onset of lactose tolerance . The samples were taken from the petrus bone, the hardest bone in the human body located on the skull protecting the inner ear. According to Professor Ron Pinhasi from the University College Dublin, the high percentage DNA yield from the petrous bones exceeded those from other bones by up to 183-fold. 'This gave us anywhere between 12 per cent and almost 90 per cent human DNA in our samples compared to somewhere between 0 per cent and 20 per cent obtained from teeth, fingers and rib bones,' he said. For the first time, these exceptionally high percentage DNA yields from ancient remains made it possible for scientists to systematically analyse a series of skeletons from the same region. The samples were dated from 5,700 BC to 800 BC, ranging across the Stone, Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages. 'Our findings show progression towards lighter skin pigmentation as hunter and gatherers and non-local farmers intermarried, but surprisingly no presence of increased lactose persistence or tolerance to lactose,' said Professor Ron Pinhasi, from University College Dublin's Earth Institute. 'This means that these ancient Europeans would have had domesticated animals like cows, goats and sheep, but they would not yet have genetically developed a tolerance for drinking large quantities of milk from mammals.' Dirty cooking pots have shown that ancient Britons swapped seafood for dairy dishes as they started farming around 6,000 years ago . Dirty cooking pots have shown that ancient Britons swapped seafood for dairy dishes as they started farming around 6,000 years ago. Scientists have been investigating when and how our ancestors made the transition from hunter gathers to farmers and conducted a large-scale investigation of British archaeological sites dating from around 4,600 BC to 1,400 AD. To do this, they examined millions of fragments of bone and analysed over 1,000 cooking pots. Professor Richard Evershed of the University of Bristol's School of Chemistry, developed new techniques in an effort to identify fish oils in the pots. His team showed that more than 99 per cent of the earliest farmer's cooking pots lacked sea food residues, indicating that they were not keen on cooking fish. The team's findings suggest that early British hunters feasted on venison and wild boar and ate large quantities of sea food, including seals and shellfish. With the introduction of domestic animals some 6,000 years ago, they quickly gave up wild foods and fishing was largely abandoned as people adopted a new diet based around dairying. Dr Lucy Cramp, lead author of the study said: ‘Amazingly, it was another 4,000 years before sea food remains appeared in pots again, during the Iron Age, and it was only with the arrival of the Vikings that fish became a significant part of our diet.’ The samples were taken from the petrus bone, the hardest bone in the human body locating on the skull protecting the inner ear . Early Europeans may have practiced dairying to make cheese rather than drink milk . The scientists also found that changes in prehistoric technology, such as the adoption of farming, were linked with a significant influx of new people. For instance, in the Neolithic or New Stone Age, ancient central Europeans had an appearance closer to Sardinians. In the Iron Age, there is another shift, with people coming into Central Europe from the East, such as the Caucasus or Asia. Researchers claim that tolerance to lactose only appeared in the Bronze Age, around 4,000 years after these people began dairying. Before then, most humans were lactose intolerant, and only later evolved the ability to break down this sugar in animal milk. The researchers suggest ancient Europeans may have practiced dairying to make cheese and yoghurt, which breaks down lactose, rather than to drink milk. Scientists are now sequencing ancient genomes dating back 13,000 years to find out about genetic diversity that existed before and after the Ice Age.

"Boris Johnson today promised to fight UKIP 'on the beaches of Clacton' in the bitter fight to stop the Eurosceptic party securing its first seat in the Commons. But the London Mayor does not seem to have gone to the trouble of learning the name of the Tory candidate - former sitcom actor Giles Watling - who has been tasked with stopping the UKIP bandwagon in its tracks. Quizzed on the radio about the Conservatives' chances in this week's by-election, Mr Johnson could only venture that the candidate was a 'superb man... Stirling? Girling? Something like that.' Scroll down for video . London Mayor Boris Johnson vowed to take on UKIP in Clacton, but then failed to name the Tory candidate in this week's by-election . Thursday's by-election was triggered by the shock defection of Douglas Carswell to UKIP, and polls suggest the former Tory MP will easily hold the seat. It would be the first time UKIP has secured an elected seat in the Commons, with leader Nigel Farage hoping to use it as a springboard to more seats in the run-up to the 2015 general election. Promising to 'fight them on the beaches of Clacton', Mr Johnson played down the impact of a UKIP win, which would see the party secure its first elected MP. It would be a 'small earthquake in Chile', he said on LBC radio, adding: 'It won't necessarily change the price of fish. 'It will be, obviously, a disappointment if we don't win for the Conservatives, but we will fight again and there's always a general election to contest it again.' But Mr Johnson was left struggling when presenter Nick Ferrari asked who the Tory candidate was. 'We've got a fantastic guy called ... superb man ... Stirling, Girling, something like that,' he said. He could not even complete Mr Watling's name when prompted that he was called Giles and he had been in the 1980s sitcom Bread. The mayor, who is set to return to Westminster at the general election, warned that votes for UKIP in May 2015 could result in a Labour government. 'No matter how strong UKIP is performing in some parts of the country, there is absolutely no way on earth they are going to get more than one seat or something like that at the general election,' he said. 'Indeed, I think it quite likely at the general election that they will be wiped out, so that any gains they make in the current crop of by-elections - and I suppose it is conceivable they might win something - they will lose. 'All they can do is take votes away from the only party, which is the Conservative Party, who are actually going to deliver a referendum.' Home Secretary Theresa May campaigned in Clacton today with Tory candidate Giles Watling, a local councillor who used to be an actor in 1980s sitcom Bread . The by-election was triggered when Tory MP Douglas Carswell (pictured today), defected to UKIP in August . UKIP leader Nigel Farage hopes to secure his first elected MP in the Commons in Clacton . Surprisingly, Mr Johnson went on to say he agreed with Mr Farage on several issues, but stressed only the Tories could win the general election. He added: 'The problem is you vote Farage, you get Miliband. That is the tragedy. In many ways there are things that I agree with that Nigel Farage says. He seems to have ... the right approach to many issues.' Mr Johnson said a 'pretty big item of agreement' with Mr Farage was on the need for a referendum on European Union membership. He added that Mr Farage is a 'low tax sort of guy and he is a small state sort of guy and that also appeals to me'. But Mr Johnson added: 'He, alas, for all the slightly interesting things that he may be saying from time to time, he isn't going to deliver the goods and all he will do is stop the Tory Party from being in a position to do that.'","London Mayor blunders on live radio ahead of crunch by-election .

"She may not have made it to the store's launch but Victoria Beckham has proven that she is no fair-weather business woman when it comes to her shop. The 40-year-old designer was spotted visiting her Dover Street store in London's Mayfair again today. Her namesake store opened it's doors four days ago to an incredibly eager crowd and since being back in the UK, Victoria has found it hard to keep away from her beloved boutique. Scroll down for video . Victoria Beckham has made her second visit to her newly opened boutique . Victoria made her first trip to the store on Saturday having flown in from America less than 24-hours before hand. After her arrival the mother-of-four, tweeted: 'So excited to visit my store today! Thank u to my wonderful team and customers I met today!! X vb .' Her store opened its doors on Thursday but on the day Victoria was unavailable to attend and David Beckham made an appearance in her place. You'd be mistaken for thinking that has been  putting her feet up. Her delayed arrival to the shop was due to  the fact that she was delivering a UN speech in New York as part of her role as a Goodwill Ambassador. Despite the rain Victoria was true to her Posh Spice style wearing her signature sunglasses and heels . Victoria seems determined to show that she will be entirely hands on with her store . Victoria seemed as though she was in a good mood as she laughed and joked with her team in the shop . Since her return Victoria has made it her business to stay on top of her business. Today in true Posh Spice style, despite the rain, she arrived at the store in suede shoe-boots and sunglasses. Her outfit choice was slightly more subtle than her first visit to the store where Victoria wore a statement leopard print skirt that came in at a hefty £4000. Today the mother-of-three wore a simple white shirt and full black skirt to demonstrate her professional attitude. Victoria seemed right at home as she wore her sunglasses while inspecting the store . Victoria's outfit today was slightly more demure than her bold leopard print pencil skirt that she wore on her first trip to the store on Saturday . While Victoria was away her family were sure to step in and keep an eye on the store. Her former footballer husband David Beckham was drawing a crowd after making a welcome appearance at her 6,000sq ft store launch. David wasn't the only family member keen to support Victoria since the launch. Her eldest son Brooklyn, 15, seemed proud of his mum as he visited the store yesterday. He appeared to be following in his mother's fashionable footsteps with his hair quiffed into a slicked up do, he topped off the look with a pair of designer shades and patterned trainers. Victoria's eldest son Brooklyn arrived in style at his mother's store yesterday . The luxury boutique – Victoria’s first foray into retail – has eschewed convention, embracing instead a minimalist look, with no cash registers, no display window and no rails. Speaking to MailOnline about the unique space shortly before its opening, Victoria said: 'It’s the first time people can see the brand through my eyes. ‘I didn’t want a traditional shop window, just a plain window, and a huge concrete sliding door. ‘The floors weren't connected, and I said, “Wouldn’t it be incredible to drill a hole through all three floors, so you could stand on the top floor and see the ground floor.”' Victoria's namesake boutique takes on a minimalist approach without any tills or elaborate window displays . Shoppers queue outside the Victoria Beckham store shortly before its launch . On entering the store shoppers are met by a display of colourful handbags . She added: ‘I didn’t think it would be possible, but it was.’ Victoria's store is not for those on a shoe-string budget with the cheapest items coming in at £150 for a keyring. And Victoria wanted the rest of her store to reflect the aspirational feel of her clothing line. She continued: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere,’ Victoria explained. ‘Payment is with an iPad, so we can go to the customer on whatever floor she’s on.’ The store is already proving popular with celebs with Ellie Goulding (right) and Amy Childs (left) making appearances at the newly opened boutique .

"In this latest of Sportsmail's reviews of the candidates for William Hill's Sports Book of the Year award for 2014, NICK METCALFE looks at Simon Inglis's Played in London. Putting it quite simply, this is a remarkable book. You don't have to be a Londoner to enjoy Played in London, though that would help. You don't even have to like sport, though if you do it will add to your enjoyment considerably. More than anything else, this is just a fascinating education. Author Simon Inglis has impressive form when it comes to presenting the history of sport, going back to his days of writing about the football grounds of Britain in the 1980s. Wembley Stadium - seen here during the 1932 FA Cup final between Arsenal and Newcastle - features in Simon Inglis's 'Played in London'. It is possibly the capital's most famous sporting venue . This latest effort - in the running to be William Hill Sports Book of the Year - is part of a 'Played in Britain' season, and is extraordinary in both its scope and levels of research. One of the beauties of this book is that you can become engrossed in certain sections and then put it down for a couple of days, before returning to enjoy more. It's a frame of reference, a treasure trove of information. Time and time again, I found myself amazed by the sheer level of detail in this book. But I suspect that, for Inglis, this is very much a labour of love. The book takes us back many centuries, to sports such as cock-fighting and bull-baiting, and also tells us the tale of many of our favourite sports of today. All the major sports have their own chapter – football fans will love the stories behind their favourite London club, rugby fans will relish the guide to the capital's many famous grounds. I'm particularly interested in the history of London's swimming pools, both outdoors and indoors, and found those sections provided an invaluable insight into the past. Most of us have heard about some of these places, like Brockwell Lido or Tooting Bec, or perhaps even visited them, but how many of us know anything about their history, their heritage? Tooting Bec Lido in south London - seen here in this 1996 picture - is one of many outdoor and indoor swimming pools to be featured in the book . There's that word - heritage. Inglis comes back to it time and time again. The author can't disguise the fact that he's a sporting romantic. He knows the value of sport in our lives. And he knows its importance in the story of the capital. Inglis tells us right at the start that no city on earth has such a rich sporting heritage. The front cover of Played in London . In most ways, London could never escape its incredible past - it's there in its churches, its parks, its stations. And it's very much there in its sport too. The author is clearly anxious that we continue to preserve it as much as we can. The disappointment comes through the pages when Inglis writes of a club being disbanded, or a pool shutting down. As you would expect, some of the most fabled sporting venues in the world feature heavily in the book, such as Wembley, Lord’s and Wimbledon. Many lesser known arenas are here too, some of them sadly gone, like Walthamstow Stadium and West Ham Stadium. There are guides to grandstands, greyhound tracks, bowling greens and billiard halls. In every sense, this guide is an extensive and exhaustive one. The book is visually delightful too; I'm pretty certain most readers will never have seen many of the wonderful pictures on show. They help to provide a quite magical snapshot into London's past, and sometimes present too. This really is a splendid effort, which helps to tell us part of the long story of the capital, and I'm certain it will still have relevance a century from now. Inglis and Jackie Spreckley, should be proud of themselves. This book not only feels special, it feels vital too. Some achievement. Look out for reviews of the other books in the running for the award thoughout this week.","Simon Inglis's 'Played in London' reviewed by Sportsmail .

"Heartbreaking new images taken inside a Turkish refugee camp today show the young lives that have been torn apart by four weeks of fighting in the besieged Syrian city of Kobane. Having been forced to flee their hometown due to the threat posed by the Islamic State, thousands of desperate families crossed the border into southern Turkey, where they will now be living in tents and basic shelters for the foreseeable future. Despite the horrific rapes and massacres carried out by the terrorists attacking their home town, the children now living in the Suruc refugee camp remain full of smiles, not yet fully aware of quite how lucky they and their families have been to avoid becoming victims of the extremist horde. Scroll down for video . Innocent: A young Kurdish boy is seen walking in Turkey's Suruc refugee camp this morning. His family was lucky enough to have fled the fighting in Kobane before having to confront the ISIS militants . Smiles: Despite the massacres carried out by ISIS terrorists in Kobane, the children now living in the Suruc refugee camp are not yet fully aware of how lucky they and their families have been to avoid becoming victims of the extremist horde . A Syrian refugee couple pass their child over a fence in Suruc this morning. The family arrived in the refugee camp from Kobane . Many of those living in the Suruc refugee camp arrived there four weeks ago, when ISIS first moved into the east Kobane suburbs and their plot to capture the largely Kurdish town emerged. Those able to do so fled to the Turkish border where ethnic Kurds on both sides of the crossing frantically cut down the barbed wire fencing that forms much of the incredibly porous 550 mile border between Turkey and Syria. Not everybody was able to leave the city before ISIS confronted them, however. Reports from inside the city at the height of the siege last week told of decapitated bodies scattered around Kobane's streets - of a savagery worse than anybody had dared to fear. Refugees who made it to Suruc tell of witnessing appalling horrors in hushed tones, as if they can barely believe it themselves. Father-of-four Amin Fajar, 38, said: 'I have seen tens, maybe hundreds, of bodies with their heads cut off. Others with just their hands or legs missing. I have seen faces with their eyes or tongues cut out – I can never forget it for as long as I live. They put the heads on display to scare us all.' Together: Kurdish children originally from Kobane smile as they gather around fire  in Turkey's Suruc refugee camp this morning . A young Syrian refugee girl washes her face outside her tent in the Suruc refugee camp earlier this morning . Family: Many of those living in the Suruc refugee camp arrived there four weeks ago, when ISIS first moved into the east Kobane suburbs and their plot to capture the largely Kurdish town emerged . Playing: A young Syrian Kurdish girl looks out from her family's tent in Turkey's Suruc refugee camp early this morning . It worked. Mr Fajar, a floor fitter from Kobane, and his wife and children aged three to 12, ran for their lives. 'The children saw the headless people. They saw them,' he said quietly, sitting cross-legged on a rug in his tent in the squalid refugee camp in Suruc. Ahmed Bakki, a farmer from a village near Kobane, said his cousin, a 48-year-old father of seven, stayed behind when the rest of the family fled. 'We phoned my cousin and IS answered his phone. They said, 'We've got his head, and we're taking it to Jarabulus (an IS stronghold)'.' He added: 'An English teacher in our village tried to reason with them, but they just called him a kaffir [non-believer] and tied him to their car and dragged him away. We heard they beheaded him later. 'My neighbour was beheaded because they said he was 'delivering vegetables to the kaffir'. They burned his farm, livestock, even his bees – they destroyed everything.' Cooking: Those able to do so fled Kobane and travelled to the Turkish border. Once there ethnic Kurds on both sides of the crossing frantically cut down the barbed wire fencing that forms much of the porous 550 mile border between Turkey and Syria . Life goes on: A Kurdish woman in Suruc refugee camp boils a pot of tea in front of her tent early in the morning . Kurds continue to arrive from Kobane, filling the refugee camps in the Turkish town of Suruc, near the borders of Syria and Turkey . Kurdish refugees talk to each other the refugee camp in Suruc. The men and their families fled Kobane when ISIS attacked the city . This 'scorched earth' policy is being waged by jihadis whose most brutal members seem to be Europeans. 'They are Chechen, they are English, they are from all over Europe. We know because we can hear their accents,' said Mr Bakki. This morning fierce street battles broke out in Kobane - the first significant fighting in the city since the majority of ISIS' militants were pushed back into the suburbs two days ago by the most intense coalition bombing raids of the past few weeks. The clashes came as desperate ISIS jihadists launched a final assault 'on all fronts' to take the town, after the militants felt the full force of American air power last night with sustained bombing raids resulting in a series of spectacular explosions in the besieged Syrian town. The radical Islamic group has been dramatically pushed back from the town in recent days, having as recently as last week looked like it was about to drive out the last of the brave Kurdish fighters defending it. As a fresh round of airstrikes rained down last night, the US also ran a series of airdrops for the Kurdish resistance, dispatching weapons and medical supplies. Pyrotechnic tracer ammunition could be seen marking out ISIS targets in the town as the U.S. bombers flew overhead.","Thousands of desperate families crossed into southern Turkey having fled the besieged Syrian city of Kobane .

"After months of tense battling between 20 publishers desperate for a big money windfall in the long run, Amanda Knox finally has a book deal. Knox, 24, of Seattle, Washington, has signed for a reported $4million with HarperCollins to write about her murder conviction and acquittal in Italy. While the deal will be respite for her family who spent $1million just dealing with her trial, it will provoke anger from her alleged victim's relatives. Deal: Amanda Knox, whose conviction and eventual acquittal of murder charges made headlines worldwide, has an agreement with HarperCollins to tell her story . The deal is expected to distress the family of . Meredith Kercher, 21, the British student who lived with Knox in . Perugia, found in a pool of blood. Knox, who was jailed for four years in Perugia, has only spoken publically once . when she arrived back in the U.S. following her release last October. Her family spent more . than $1million in legal, travel and living costs to be near her during . the murder trial in Italy - and even more on her . appeal. Knox's parents, Edda Mellas and Curt Knox, who divorced when she was aged just two, have put on a united front and took out second mortgages. ‘Knox will give a full and unflinching account of the events that led to her arrest in Perugia,’ a HarperCollins spokesman said on Thursday. He added that she will talk about her . ‘struggles with the complexities of the Italian judicial system’ and . read back journals she kept in prison. Dead: The case relates to the fatal stabbing of Meredith Kercher, 21, a British student who shared a flat with Knox in Perugia, found in a pool of blood . ‘Knox will talk about her harrowing experience at the hands of the Italian police and later prison guards and inmates,’ he said. HarperCollins is promising she will . ‘reveal never before-told details surrounding her case’ about ‘the most . challenging time of her young life’. 'Knox will give a full and unflinching account of the events that led to her arrest in Perugia and her struggles with the complexities of the Italian judicial system' HarperCollins spokesman . The book, currently untitled, is . tentatively scheduled for early 2013. The mammoth financial agreement was disclosed by the New York Times. It was negotiated by Washington . attorney Robert Barnett, who has worked for President Barack Obama and . former President George W. Bush. Some 20 publishers were interested in the book and Knox met with seven, all of whom submitted bids during a recent auction. HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham said that Knox, who studied creative writing, would work with a collaborator. The company should be able to recoup some of its investment by selling TV interview rights on the back of the book. Broadcasters are banned from paying for interviews but they routinely get around it by buying the rights to the interviewee’s book instead. Big money: The deal was negotiated by attorney Robert Barnett, who has worked for President Barack Obama, left, and former President George W. Bush, right . Her editor will be Claire Wachtel, whose other authors have included crime novelist Dennis Lehane and journalist Cokie Roberts. Publishers in recent years have shied . from controversial defendants, especially since the fiasco of O.J. Simpson's ‘If I Did It’. 'I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody. It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way' Anonymous publisher . That was a fictionalised account of . Nicole Brown Simpson's murder that was cancelled in 2006 by . HarperCollins in response to public outrage. After Casey Anthony was cleared last . year of killing her two-year-old daughter, several publishers said they . would not consider a book by her. ‘I think it’s a huge gamble for somebody,’ a publisher who had no intention of bidding on the story told the New York Times earlier this month. ‘It’s not like she has been exonerated in a clear and definitive way.’ Harrowing: The value of Knox's story has been compared to that of Jaycee Dugard, seen in 1991, who was held captive for almost two decades in California . The value of her story has been compared to that of Jaycee Dugard, who was kidnapped and held captive for almost two decades. 'Aided by journals she kept during her imprisonment, Knox will talk about her harrowing experience at the hands of the Italian police and later prison guards and inmates' HarperCollins spokesman . She had a book published last July that . has sold 1.2million copies. But while the deal is good news for Knox, . her legal issues are not over. Earlier this week, Italian prosecutors . asked the top court to reinstate the murder convictions of Knox and her . former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. Sollecito, who had reportedly been considering seeing Amanda at Christmas, has since been pictured kissing and cuddling Annie Achille. Miss Achille is an Italian volleyball player who is also his distant cousin. Together: Amanda Knox has been seen out in Seattle, Washington, with her new boyfriend, guitarist James Terrano, since she got home from Italy . Knox meanwhile has been seen hand-in-hand in Seattle with her new boyfriend, guitarist James Terrano. Prosecutor Giovanni Galati said he is ‘very convinced’ that Sollecito and Knox were responsible for  Miss Kercher's death in November 2007. But the Italian appeals court in October said the guilty verdicts against the pair were not corroborated by any evidence. It added that the court hadn't proven they were in the house when Miss Kercher was killed. A third defendant, Ivory Coast-born . drifter Rudy Guede, was convicted in a separate trial of sexually . assaulting and stabbing Miss Kercher. Continuing: Earlier this week, Italian prosecutors asked the top court to reinstate the murder convictions of Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito . His 16-year sentence, reduced in appeal from an initial 30 years, was upheld by Italy's highest court in 2010. 'She will reveal never before-told details surrounding her case, and describe how she used her inner strength and strong family ties to cope with the most challenging time of her young life' HarperCollins spokesman . Meanwhile, a lawyer for Knox recently filed an appeal of her slander conviction in Italy. The same court that overturned her . murder conviction upheld the charges for slander - for falsely accusing . bar owner Diya ‘Patrick’ Lumumba of involvement in the slaying. Lumumba was freed after two weeks in prison for lack of evidence. Knox later said she was ‘manipulated’ during her lengthy police interrogation. A judge set Knox's sentence . for slander at three years, less than the time she spent in prison. That . meant she could leave Italy and return to Seattle.","Knox, 24, met with seven of 20 publishers interested .

"A young woman who dismissed a brown mark on her arm as melted chocolate was later told it was a cancerous mole. At first, Natasha Mash, 26, tried to wipe off the brown spot, believing it was the remnants of a chocolate bar she had been eating. But concerned when it didn't go away, she visited a doctor, who reassured her it was nothing to worry about. Scroll down for video . At first, Natasha Mash thought the mark (circled) was a bit of chocolate she had accidentally wiped on her arm. When she realised it was a mole, she saw her GP - but was told there was nothing to worry . Miss Mash, 26, was eventually diagnosed with melanoma - the most deadly form of skin cancer- after a different doctor noticed her mole during an appointment for a chest infection . It was only months later that another doctor happened to notice the mole - and she was eventually diagnosed with melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. Miss Mash, a youth worker who lives in Watford, then underwent three operations to completely remove the mole and save her life. At age 22, Natasha noticed the 2cm spot in the mirror and headed straight to her doctor. She was reassured that as she was so young, the chocolate-coloured mole was nothing to worry about. But seven months later when she was at her GP surgery for a chest infection, her doctor noted the mole as a cause for concern and decided to keep an eye on it. It was only when Miss Mash returned in February for a check-up that she found out the smudge she had at first thought was a blob of melted chocolate was actually skin cancer. She underwent initial surgery a week after her diagnosis and then two further operations to make sure the cancer was completely removed. She underwent three operations to completely remove the cancer, and has now fully recovered . The following ABCD rules show some changes that might indicate a 'melanoma', the deadliest form of skin cancer. As skin cancers vary, it is important to tell a doctor about any changes to the skin, even if they are not mentioned here. Asymmetry - the two halves of the area may differ in shape . Border - the edges of the area may be irregular or blurred, and sometimes show notches . Colour - this may be uneven. Different shades of black, brown and pink may be seen . Diameter - most melanomas are at least 6mm in diameter. Report any change in size, shape or diameter to your doctor . Expert - if in doubt, check it out . If your GP is concerned about your skin, make sure you see a consultant dermatologist, the most expert person to diagnose a skin cancer. Source: British Associtation of Dermatologists . Even now she has six-monthly check-ups and diligently checks all of her moles once a week to make sure there have been no changes. Natasha was supported by the Teenage Cancer Trust who put her in touch with other young people who have also had the same type of cancer. But she is determined not to wallow, wants to share her experience to help make other young people aware of the risks. Miss Mash said: 'I mistook my mole for chocolate and so quickly realised that it was something much more serious. 'Never did I think something so small or seemingly insignificant could have such a big effect. 'One day I saw this big mark on my arm. I thought it was chocolate and tried to wipe it off. 'Then I realised that it was a mole I had always had that had changed dramatically. 'It was April, so I'd been wearing long-sleeved tops practically all of the time through the winter and not noticed it. 'I went to the doctor who shrugged it off and said it was nothing to worry about. 'You're so young that you think these kind of things don't happen to you.' The following November, she visited the GP with a chest infection and another doctor noticed the mole. She said: 'When I took my jumper off for the doctor to listen to my chest she noticed and said she wanted to keep an eye on it. 'I went back in February for some tests and a week later I had a phone call saying that the doctor wanted to have a chat. Miss Mash said talking to other young cancer sufferers through the Teenage Cancer Trust made her feel less alone . 'I didn't even think that it was anything to worry about until the doctor explained that it was melanoma and they needed to take action as quickly as possible.' Miss Mash then underwent three operations to have the cancer removed. She said: 'I had a big lump taken out of my arm at the beginning of March but I was really lucky that it was caught so early. 'At first they checked me every three months and now it's every six months . 'I am really careful in the sun now and prefer to go on holidays where it won't be too hot.' Talking to other young people suffering cancer made her feel less alone. She said: 'I spoke to a contact from the Teenage Cancer Trust at the hospital and she put me in touch with other young people who had a similar experience. 'I was able to talk about everything I was going through on the online forums which made a huge difference in helping me overcome the cancer. 'I thought I was the only person going through it but being able to speak to other people in the same position made me feel so much more normal!'","Natasha Mash, 26, found a mark on her arm and thought it was chocolate .

Hours earlier, Elliot had been showing off a dance routine for his sister's friends and cheering on his big brother Oliver, 12, at a football match. Elliot Kerslake, two, from Leeds, died in his sleep from a swelling to his brain caused by a mystery virus. Doctors have said there is 'nothing that could have saved him' His parents John and Andrea Kerslake wept as a coroner heard their written evidence about his sudden death on March 3, 2013. Mrs Kerslake, 45, said Elliot had been put down for his post-lunch nap at 2pm, and his sister found him dead three hours later. She told the coroner: 'I read him a Fireman Sam story as I put him down for an afternoon nap at 2pm just after his lunch. 'I told him I loved him and closed the curtains. Around that time John came home. I had left the door open and thirty minutes later I went back to check on him. 'He was lying on his tummy and making a little sobbing noise. I didn't think much of it as my two other children used to do the same when they were younger. 'I went in and said to him 'do you want to come down, sweetheart?', but he didn't answer.' Mrs Kerslake said she was gardening as her husband watched football on TV when their daughter Emily, now 14, screamed. They found Elliot lying 'blue and floppy' and called an ambulance to their home in Shadwell, Leeds. An operator told John how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Mr Kerslake said: 'I continued fighting for him shouting ""come on Elliot, you can do it"", although I started to feel in my mind that he was gone.' Encephalitis is an uncommon but serious condition that causes inflammation of the brain. Encephalitis usually begins with flu-like symptoms, such as a high temperature, a headache and joint pain. More serious symptoms may then develop over the next few hours or days, including: . Flu-like symptoms that rapidly get worse and affect mental state should be treated as a medical emergency. In these circumstances, dial 999 immediately and request an ambulance. Source: NHS Choices . The parents accompanied their son in the ambulance but he was pronounced dead at Leeds General Infirmary. Leeds Coroners Court heard how the energetic youngster had been playing in the garden and entertaining his sister's friends who had been on a sleepover hours before his death. Mrs Kerslake said: 'Because of the other children staying, Elliot was in our bed the night before. 'We had read bedtime stories and in the morning we had a big hug. 'We chatted about what we would do that day and I dressed him in his blue dungarees with patterned socks, so I could grab hold of him if he ran off. 'He was so excited that morning and did a little dance for his sister's friends. 'We went to Starbucks to get a coffee and he ate normally. Then later we went to see his older brother Oliver play in a football match. 'I had to wipe his runny nose quite a bit that day, but didn't think much of it. 'My husband met us at the football field at lunchtime and I remember Elliot shouting ""that's my daddy"" and ran over to him to give him a cuddle.' She added that they left to go home for lunch, where Elliot was put down for the nap from which he never woke up. Dr Richard Newton, a specialist in child neurology at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said the cause of Elliot's death was most likely encephalitis - inflammation of the brain - caused by a virus which triggered a seizure as he slept. He said: 'This was a well little boy with a cold, essentially. He went down in the afternoon for a nap which is a routine almost every family in Britain bears witness to. 'I would suggest the cause of Elliot's death to be a seizure during his nap related to encephalitis, caused by an indeterminable virus. 'There are thousands, if not millions of types of virus and it would be impossible to determine which kind.' Hours before his death, Elliot had been in a good mood. He woke up to a hug with mother Andrea, 45 (right), performed a dance for his sister Emily (left) Dr Newton added there was 'nothing that could have saved Elliot'. He said: 'The events that afternoon were common events in every household. 'He ate his lunch, had his nap and must have died within that time. 'It's part of nature's rare unkindness.' Coroner David Hinchliff said the cause of death was, on the balance of probabilities, 'inflammation of the brain caused by an indeterminable viral infection'. He recorded a verdict of natural causes. Speaking before the hearing, Mr Kerslake said: 'Elliot loved life, he relished every new experience. He gave so much love to us, his brother and sister and all that knew him. 'It's comforting to know that his short life will impact positively on others during the months and years to come.'","Elliot Kerslake, two, died in his sleep due to swelling in his brain from a virus .

"A female Silicon Valley developer was fired from her job after tweeting a picture of two computer programmers making an apparently sexist remark. Adria Richards had been working for SendGrid, developers of a cloud-based e-mail system, when she attended the PyCon Conference in Santa Clara, California last week and tweeted and blogged about what she perceived was inappropriate conduct from several of the male attendees. From Richards, the conversation the . men had concerned 'big dongles.' A dongle is actually a device that . plugs into a computer, but Richards maintains the men were using it in a . sexual manner. Adria Richards was fired from her job at tech company SendGrid after sending this tweet alleging sexual innuendos from several men at a California conference . SendGrid is a popular cloud-based e-mail company that works with Pinterest, Foursquare and Spotify (among other Silicon Valley companies) The tweet in question, which also included a photo of the men involved, garnered the attention of the conference organizers, who immediately reacted to deal with the situation. The chair of the conference, Jesse Noller, said 'We pulled all the individuals aside. We got all sides of the story. They said she was right, and they were very apologetic.' When blogging about her ordeal on her website But You're A Girl, Richards had this to say. 'Have you ever had a group of men sitting right behind you making joke that caused you to feel uncomfortable? Well, that just happened this week but instead of shrinking down in my seat, I did something about it.' It was Richards manner in dealing with the situation that led to her firing, according to SendGrid CEO Jim Franklin. Richards also blogged about the incident on her website But You're A Girl, detailing the specific encounter she had with the men at the PyCon Conference . 'Her decision to tweet the comments and photographs of the people who made the comments crossed the line,' Franklin wrote on the site for SendGrid. 'Publicly shaming the offenders - and bystanders - was not the appropriate way to handle the situation.' One of the men that Richards showed in her tweet has been fired from his company PlayHaven, a mobile game company in San Francisco. Andy Yang, the CEO of PlayHaven, did not mention the employee's name but came down hard on his actions. Richards attended the popular SXSW conference in Austin, TX earlier this month . Gender equality has become a hot-button issue in Silicon Valley, especially on the heels of Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg's 'Lean In' 'PlayHaven had an employee who was identified as making inappropriate comments at PyCon, and as a company that is dedicated to gender equality and values honorable behavior, we conducted a thorough investigation. The result of this investigation led to the unfortunate outcome of having to let this employee go.' Allegedly a second man in the photo, who works with PlayHaven, is still at the company. According to Richards, she was sparked into action by a photo of a young girl, a 'young coder,' that appeared on screen during the PyCon Conference. 'I realized I had to do something or she would never have the chance to learn and love programming because the a** clowns behind me would make it impossible for her to do so.'","Adria Richards tweeted a picture of two conference attendees who joked about a 'big dongle'

"France will ‘bring down’ the euro if it does not get to grips with austerity, one of Europe’s most influential economists has warned. Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of Germany’s Institute for Economic Research think tank, said the single currency bloc was heading for ‘decades of crisis’. He warned that France will ‘threaten the stability of the eurosystem’ if it does not cut Government spending and promote private business growth. Scroll down for video . Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of Germany’s Institute for Economic Research think tank, said the single currency bloc was heading for ‘decades of crisis’ thanks to the policies of President Hollande (pictured) In a stinging criticism of the socialist regime run by President Hollande, he said: ‘French industry has been dying for decades now. ‘The people who were set free from manufacturing, or their children, have by and large been absorbed by the government sector, which has now a quarter of the workforce, twice that of Germany. ‘Hiding the unemployed in government offices is not a healthy solution.’ He added: ‘It is as if you are sick, and need surgery but only take drugs to numb the pain.’ His comments come only days after the boss of John Lewis said that France was ‘finished’. The economist  warned that France will ‘threaten the stability of the eurosystem’ if it does not cut Government spending and promote private business growth. Andy Street described the French nation as ‘sclerotic, hopeless and downbeat,’ adding: ‘I have never been to a country more ill at ease… nothing works and worse, nobody cares about it.’ In a London speech he was later forced to apologise for, he also described Paris’ flagship train station Gare du Nord as the ‘squalor pit of Europe’. He later said he ‘went too far’ in his criticism of the nation. While Britain’s economy has been booming, France’s has ground to a halt. France has been described as the ‘sick man of Europe’ because of its bloated public sector and refusal to cut spending. Mr Hollande, whose approval ratings are now lower than those of any previous French President, has been forced to dissolve his government twice in the last year over disagreements about how to fix the economic malaise. After falling into a double dip recession, the French economy has notched up two quarters of zero growth.","Expert says single currency bloc was heading for 'decades of crisis'

Ms Thomas told Kidspot that  a man ran towards her and tried to take the pram out of her hands. 'He was so strong,' she said. 'I just remembered thinking, what am I going to do if he gets my son? How am I going to stop him?' But luckily another man behind Ms Thomas, steered his bike into the alleged attacker. The first man fled from the scene but the ordeal left Ms Thomas in tears. She regrets that she wasn't able to thank the man who helped her nor get his name. 'I was in too much shock. With everything going on in the world today, I kept thinking, what if that guy had killed me or my child? What if he was looking to steal a random off the street?'

"In the clammy midnight darkness of a jungle clearing in northern Thailand, two police officers and a woman investigator crouch beside a pile of cages containing more than 500 howling dogs. Yards away, a gang of heavily armed men move through the trees to encircle them. Terrified, outnumbered and cornered after tracking down a cargo of animals hidden in the jungle before being smuggled to neighbouring countries, the police officers appear doomed to pay the ultimate price for meddling in the brutally lucrative dog meat trade. As the tide of panic rises, one officer jumps to his feet from behind the crates and draws his revolver. Firing rapidly into the air, he runs around the clearing shouting out to imaginary colleagues to trick the smugglers into thinking more police are hidden in the undergrowth. The desperate gamble pays off, sending the gunmen into retreat and buying the cornered trio enough time for reinforcements to arrive as the gangsters melt away into the surrounding jungle. This is the frontline of the war against the dog meat trade – a bleak and perilous struggle to stop hundreds of thousands of dogs a year being snatched from the streets and then smuggled and slaughtered in horrendous conditions for their meat. Scroll down for video . Dogs captured in the Thailand jungle: Police and campaigners intercepted gangsters trying to smuggle them across the Mekong river from Thailand into Vietnam for their meat . The dogs are snatched from their owners, bound with rope and dragged behind motorbikes through the streets of Thailand before being trafficked through the jungle (above) Thousands of miles away, nearly 500,000 people have now signed an online petition calling on the Thai government to outlaw the trade after a harrowing video appeal by Ricky Gervais, Judi Dench and Downton Abbey stars went viral last week. But as a Mail Online investigation in Asia found, bringing an end to the savage trade which claims the lives of millions of dogs a year is a monumental challenge with the lives not only of dogs as stake but also those of the people dedicated to ending the slaughter. With huge profits at stake, the smuggling gangs are ruthlessly switching tactics to ward off the threat to their trade – and have started slaughtering dogs before they leave Thailand to reduce the chances of live cross-border shipments being detected. The industry is reckoned to be worth around £20 million a year in Thailand alone and is driven by highly organised criminal gangs involved not only in the dog meat business but in narcotics and human smuggling. The struggle against the dog meat trade in Thailand is being championed by British-run charity Soi Dog Foundation which commissioned the video appeal and whose chief investigator, Mrs Ha, was caught up in the jungle raid in May which nearly ended in tragedy. A diminutive married woman in her late 40s, Mrs Ha – whose real identity is being kept secret because of the risk of her being targeted by smuggling gangs – has helped in dozens of arrests and the blocking of shipments of thousands of dogs in the past year alone. Snatched for meat: These dogs have been rescued in the Thai jungle but were destined to be skinned and turned into luxury dishes that are believed to improve mens' potency . An intercepted cargo of dogs destined for the dog meat trade is unloaded at a rescue centre in northern Thailand . Her efforts are focussed in the lawless Tha Rae area of northern Thailand where stolen dogs are caged in secluded jungle areas before being smuggled across the border to Laos and then on to Vietnam where an estimated five million dogs a year are eaten. It was in the jungle near Tha Rae that Mrs Ha found herself surrounded by the armed gang. 'Of course I'm scared about what might happen to me but I can't give up and I'm going to carry on with this fight,' she told Mail Online calmly. 'The dog meat trade has deep roots in Thailand. It has been here for a long time and powerful, dangerous people run the business. It will not stop easily.' Most of the dogs rescued by Mrs Ha and her team members are much-loved pet dogs snatched at night from homes across Thailand for the equivalent of a few pounds each by thieves who drag them with ropes behind motorbikes before selling them on to dog meat gangs. Crammed together in metal cages in which many of them die, up to 1,500 dogs at a time are then taken up to hundreds of miles by lorry to jungle camps in northern Thailand where they remain in the cages in stifling heat for days waiting to be smuggled to China or Vietnam. Their ordeals finally end when they are beaten senseless with metal pipes, immersed in boiling water to loosen their fur and skinned – often still alive – before being served up in restaurants from Beijing to Hanoi where dog dishes can cost up to £30. Clubbed to death: Dogs that have already been slaughtered piled in the back of a van by smugglers in Thailand . Desperate for escape: Caged dogs transported in cramped by smugglers in Thailand - they were later intercepted and rescued . As part of a campaign that has only dented the dog smuggling trade in Thailand, giant posters paid for by overseas donors have been put up across northern Thailand offering rewards of £100 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of dog smugglers. The Soi Dog Foundation also pays bonuses to police officers who take part in operations, according to founder John Dalley – a 65-year-old former chemical engineer from Leeds who set up the charity after retiring to Phuket in Thailand with wife Gill 11 years ago and now provides shelters for some 2,500 rescued dogs. 'You might argue it's immoral to pay rewards to police officers,' he said. 'But I look on this as a war, and we have to do what we can to stop this trade. It is proving effective and it's worth the outlay if we can achieve that goal. 'This isn't a question of whether it's right or wrong to eat dogs. The reason we got involved in this is because of the inherent cruelty of the business, from start to finish.' Up to last year, an estimated 500,000 dogs a year were being smuggled across the Mekong River from Thailand to Laos and then on to Vietnam, where dog meat is a popular dish with young middle-class men who believe it makes them more potent. Pet dogs snatched from homes across Thailand at night were sold to gangs who could make tenfold profits on shipments of stolen dogs as soon as they crossed the Mekong River to Laos, with local border guards bribed to turn a blind eye. Now, thanks to an anti-rabies agreement between Thailand, Laos and Vietnam last year bringing in tougher penalties for the trans-border shipment of live dogs, there has been a sharp decrease in the cross-border smuggling of live dogs. Rescued but needing a home: Briton John Dalley with rescued dogs at the Soi Dog Foundation centre in Phuket, Thailand . In its place, however, equally brutal methods of profiting from the trade have emerged. Dogs are now slaughtered and chopped up in the jungles of northern Thailand clearings and then smuggled silently across borders in ice buckets on the back of lorries. A raid conducted by police and investigators on an illegal tannery in Sakhon Nakhon, northern Thailand, on October 17 found scores of dead dogs lying across the floor and strung up to be skinned. Meat was being sold for both domestic and overseas consumption. Sources in the dog meat trade have told investigators that another major dog meat trader in the area is breeding and slaughtering weeks-old puppies to be smuggled out of Thailand sold as single-meal delicacies for diners in Vietnam and China. Days after the raid at Sakhon Nakhon, the Soi Dog Foundation received a pitiful email from a desperate pet owner saying he believed his dog was among the animals found there. 'She is a much loved pet who was stolen at night from our home,' the pet owner wrote. 'We are just praying that she survived. We know it is a slim chance but please help us if you can.' Sadly, by the time investigators reached the scene, every single dog was dead. As the stakes are raised in the fight to end the dog meat trade and greater pressure is exerted on the gangs, Dalley knows the potential risks to himself and his investigators from the gangs behind it are escalating too. 'I do occasionally look in my rear view mirror to make sure I'm not being tailed by a motorbike,' he says with a wry smile. 'But it's not something we can afford to give too much thought to.' Buoyed by the runaway success of the online petition, the key objective of the Soi Dog Foundation and its supporters is to persuade the Thai military government to bring in laws that act as a deterrent against the snatching of dogs to be sold into the dog meat industry. Under treatment: A rescued dog is treated at the Soi Dog Foundation clinic in Phuket, Thailand after being beaten about the head by smugglers . Currently, the highest penalty for animal cruelty in Thailand is a £20 fine. Dalley and his supporters want that replaced by a tougher new law that would carry a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a fine of £400 – still low by international standards. The petition being circulated with the video appeal calls on the Thai government to clamp down on the trade by making the eating of dogs, the skinning of dogs and the trafficking of dogs illegal. It also highlights the danger to humans of the unregulated trade from dogs that may be carrying rabies and can spread diseases such as cholera and trichinellosis. 'This isn't only about animal welfare – it's about human welfare,' said Dalley. In the meantime, the war against the smuggling gangs remains in the hands of a small but determined group of people including the indomitable Mrs Ha who insists she will never give in to the gangsters behind the trade. 'It is the pain in the eyes of the dogs we rescue from the smugglers that motivates me to carry on,' she said. 'No animal should ever have to endure that kind of brutality.'

"Alex Younger  has been appointed as successor to Sir John Sawers as Britain's top spy . The former secret service chief in Afghanistan Alex Younger has become Britain's top spy after being appointed the new head of MI6. Mr Younger has taken over Sir John Sawers as 'C' of the Secret Intelligence Service - otherwise known as MI6. The former army officer, who has for last two years been overseeing MI6's global spy network, will take on the role made famous in Ian Fleming's James Bond as 'M' - most recently played by Judi Dench in Skyfall. Mr Younger, who is married with children, has had overseas postings in Europe and the Middle East and was the senior MI6 officer in Afghanistan. He has also filled a range of operational roles in London, including leading the Service's work on counter terrorism in the three years running up to the Olympic Games. Outside of SIS, the economics graduate is said to enjoy music, sailing and mountaineering. Mr Younger's appointment comes after a turbulent period for Britain's intelligence services following disclosures made by fugitive former US National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Mr Snowden's revelations triggered an unprecedented hearing of the Intelligence and Security Committee, in which the heads of MI6, the Security Service MI5 and listening post GCHQ appeared together in public for the first time. Mr Snowden supporters believe the release of top-secret documents exposed an abuse of powers among the security and intelligence services in the UK and US. But the secret services said the revelations made life easier for terrorists. Scroll down for video . Mr Younger said: ‘I am delighted and honoured to become chief of SIS and lead one of the best intelligence agencies in the world. ‘Our dedicated staff work tirelessly against an array of threats that this country faces. They do so in close partnership with both MI5 and GCHQ with whom I am looking forward to co-operating closely. ‘I would like to pay tribute to John Sawers for his lifetime's dedication to the country and particularly to his time as C. ‘He brought us into a new era, and I am determined to build on this and bring my ideas for a modern service to life.’ Mr Younger has taken over Sir John Sawers as 'C' of the Secret Intelligence Service - known in the latest James Bond film, Skyfall, as 'M' and played by Dame Judi Dench .

"Chris Moyles could face a huge tax bill after a failed appeal over a £290m tax avoidance scheme in which he was involved . Former Radio One DJ Chris Moyles could be landed with a huge tax bill after a court ruled against a £290m tax avoidance scheme in which he was involved. The breakfast show presenter - who netted a £700,000 annual salary from the BBC until he left his job in September 2012 - claimed he had incurred losses as a second-hand car dealer so he could avoid paying £1m in tax. But the self-proclaimed 'saviour of Radio 1' was challenged by the taxman and the scheme - dubbed 'Working Wheels' - was later rejected by a tribunal. Now NT ('No Tax') Advisors LLP, which promoted the scheme, has warned Working Wheels investors that HM Revenue and Customs 'will seek to collect outstanding tax and interest,' according to The Mirror. The paper said two of Moyles's fellow investors tried to appeal again the ruling, but failed. In a letter seen by the paper, the boss of NT Matthew Jenner said it was a 'disappointing result' which he believed had been 'very much affected' by press coverage about tax avoidance. He wrote: 'Clearly this is a disappointing result, made the more given our efforts to be heard by the higher Courts have been thwarted. 'We believe that the courts, especially the lower Tribunals, are being very much affected by press coverage on tax avoidance and that is a dangerous development in any judicial system.' Moyles was one of 450 celebrities, fund managers and other top earners to try to avoid tax by taking part in the scheme. It worked by allowing members of the scheme to say they had incurred huge fees while working in the second-hand car trade, which they could claim back against their tax bill. Variants of the scheme included claiming losses from dealing in other high-value items such as watches or cash receivables. Scroll down for video . On the self-assessment tax return that Moyles filed for the financial year ending in April 2008, when he was presenting the BBC Radio 1 show, he claimed he 'had engaged in self-employment as a used-car trader'. He moved his earnings around a string of banks and charitable trusts to claim that he had made the loss. But the tax tribunal ruled this was just a ruse to save tax. It found that, far from being a car dealer, Moyles had never supplied any vehicles and had 'no interest' in doing so. The 'saviour of Radio 1' pictured in January 2004, on his first day of presenting the Radio 1 Breakfast show . Chris Moyles took to Twitter after the ruling to say that he always thought the scheme was legal . Nor did he have the faintest idea how much the cars he was supposedly trading cost to buy and to sell. When HMRC rejected the scheme, Moyles and two other members appealed to a tax court. In February this year, tax judge Colin Bishopp rejected the appeal, saying it was clear he 'entered the scheme for no purpose other than to achieve a tax saving'. He said the 'scale of Mr Moyles' borrowing was driven solely by the amount of the tax loss he wanted to achieve. HMRC is said to be seeking to recoup the outstanding tax and interest from the scheme . The ruling said Moyles was 'anxious to be reassured the scheme was lawful, and that he would not have to undertake any trading himself'. After the outcome, Moyles took to Twitter to say: 'Upon advice, I signed up to a scheme which I was assured was legal. My knowledge of the dealings of the scheme were naive. I'm not a tax expert and acted on advice. This was a mistake and I accept the ruling without reservation.' But during his year-long battle with the taxman, Moyles desperately tried to keep his avoidance scheme secret. His legal team argued the tribunal should be heard behind closed doors so as not to infringe his 'right to respect for his private and family life'. His lawyer also said if his membership were exposed, 'his career might be damaged'. Judge Bishopp rejected this on the grounds there was an obvious public interest in keeping tax cases public. Many of the organisations involved in the scheme were based in low-tax and highly private jurisdictions such as Jersey, the Channel Islands and the British Virgin Islands. A HMRC spokesman said: 'We don't in general comment on individual cases. 'We are always happy to help the increasing numbers of people who want to disentangle themselves from the fruitless practice of tax avoidance.' MailOnline has contacted Mr Moyles's representatives for comment.","Moyles used 'Working wheels' tax avoidance scheme to claim back money .

"An American sailor on trial for the rape of a Darwin woman, was a friendly guy who made her and her friends laugh, a court has heard. Hugh Patrick Malone, 23, has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault, indecent assault and depriving a woman of her liberty. It is alleged that on September 4 last year he was drinking and dancing at Monsoon's bar in Darwin's CBD with a trio of local women who had gone out with some American sailors they had met earlier that week. The sailors were from the USS Denver, docked in the port. The US sailor, from the USS Denver (pictured) is on trial for the rape of a Darwin woman in September last year . It is alleged that on September 4 last year Hugh Patrick Malone was drinking and dancing at Monsoon's bar (pictured) in Darwin's CBD with a trio of local women who had gone out with some American sailors they had met earlier that week. After having sex with one woman he tried to have sexual with another despite her saying no . The court heard that Malone had sex with one woman earlier in the evening before returning to the bar and 'pestering' her friend, the complainant, for sexual favours, which she declined. He then told her he needed to pick up a bag from his hotel room to check out before curfew. She agreed to accompany him there on the way to the hotel room of the man she was seeing, another American sailor. But it is alleged that when they arrived he pulled her into the room and sexually assaulted her. ABC News reported, crown prosecutor Matthew Nathan said Malone 'picked her up, put her on the bed and digitally penetrated her, but stopped when she started to cry.' Afterwards the complainant called her friend Nina Ah-Wong, the court heard on Tuesday. In a 'jumpy voice' she told her that 'Malone just tried s*** with me', and the following day recounted the assault again in more detail, using the word 'rape' and saying that he 'tried to stick it in' and penetrated her for five to 10 seconds. Hugh Patrick Malone, 23, a US sailor, has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault, indecent assault and depriving a woman of her liberty after he allegedly tried to rape a Darwin woman in September last year .

ABC News reported that Malone apologised via Facebook and Mr Nathan read part of the exchange in court which also said. 'I thought I couldn't have you and I really want you but I just went to your friend and that was the wrong choice, you're so f***ing hot'.' There was no indication of an attraction between the complainant and Malone, Ms Ah-Wong told the court. She said although the woman was intoxicated 'she still knew what she was doing'. She told the court Malone was 'a good guy and fun to be around'. ABC News also reported Malone's defence lawyer Tom Berkley gave a brief opening submission. 'This is a case of regret, not a case of rape,' he said. The trial continues.

Rules of the game: A new survey claims there are big differences in sense of humour from region to region - while TV personalities like Geordie stand-up Sarah Millican (pictured) have boosted sales for female acts . Favourites: Lee Evans (left) was put at number one while Miranda Hart (right) was the only woman in the top ten . The most prudish, it seemed, were those from Yorkshire - as the region emerged as the only one which reacted more negatively than positively to jokes about bedroom antics. It scored minus 5 on a scale from 100 to minus 100, while the South West registered a score of 33. Some topics, including disability, race and death, were off-limits for almost everyone. Others were fair game, including family, politics, the economy, education, gender and health. Shappi Khorsandi said: 'It's great to see the surge in female comedians, stamping out the prejudice' Most comedy fans enjoyed a gentle ribbing about where they live but those in the South West and North West were particular fans, with those in the East Midlands less impressed. Toilet humour was deemed unacceptable everywhere except London and Wales - and Scotland thought scatological jokes were particularly unfunny. Despite the regional differences the State of Play: Comedy report, commissioned by the gig sales website Ticketmaster, found there was no clear north-south divide to what Britons enjoy in comedy. The wide-ranging survey also found big-name female comics such as Sarah Millican and Miranda Hart are putting women on the map - and into the box office. Shows by female comedians now account for 14 per cent of all comedy tickets sold. Despite comprising less than a seventh of all sales, the figure is a big improvement on 2009 when women were producing just 2 per cent of the industry's takings. Comedian Shappi Khorsandi said: 'It's great to see the surge in female comedians, stamping out the prejudice. 'We have still further to go though, I'd like to see more female comics enjoying the dominance that men do on the bigger stages. 'Perhaps we are not capturing the public's imagination in the same way, but it is all changing for the better and we are well on the way to enjoying equal success with our comedy brothers.' The nation's favourite comedians were still dominated by men including Lee Evans, Michael McIntyre, Peter Kay, John Bishop and Jimmy Carr. Miranda Hart was the only woman to make the top ten, squeezing into tenth place, but she came fifth in a list of comedians most likely to 'unite families' on the sofa. The poll of more than 2,000 people revealed the extent to which TV can make or break a comedian's career, as 51 per cent of the respondents - who watched live shows regularly - said they would only pay to see someone who had already appeared on-screen. Top pick: Michael McIntyre regularly crops up in the nation's list of favourite comics, and this was no exception . Britain's regions may have differences in what people find funny but comedians are drawn from every corner of the country. Pictured: Lancashire-born Peter Kay (left) and Liverpool's John Bishop (right) made the top five . And it claimed the art of heckling is disappearing, with only one in five thinking it was acceptable and just 3 per cent admitted to doing it regularly. But as any comedy-lover worth their salt will insist, few gig-goers are perfect. Even though more than four-fifths of people said whispering during a set was unacceptable, almost the same number admitted to doing it themselves.","Survey for gig sales outlet Ticketmaster examined 'unacceptable' jokes .

"Many couples jet off on holiday to revive the romance in their relationships but it appears time away together may do more harm than good. New research suggests that a third of women end up fancying their partner less after a trip abroad. And it appears the main turn-offs are peeling skin from a nasty sunburn, heat stroke and a relationship’s biggest killer: plain old boredom. New research suggests that a third of women end up fancying their partner less after a trip abroad . Too much booze: A quarter of respondents complained that their man drank too much during their holiday . Too much sun: The main turn-offs are sunburnt skin, heat stroke and boredom . The findings are based on a survey commissioned by online travel agent Sunshine.co.uk, which polled 2,364 British women who had been on holiday with their partner in the last year. Thirty-two per cent revealed that they were ‘less attracted’ to their partner once they returned to the UK. While the effects of the sun played some part, for 35 per cent it was simply spending too much time together that put them off. Another quarter (26 per cent) said their man drank too much and one in five (19 per cent) was upset because their partner was ogling other women. Sneaking a peek: One in five (19 per cent) was upset because their partner was ogling other women . Going in different direction: Thirty-five per cent said they spent too much time with their partner . Nearly a quarter (23 per cent) of all respondents admitted they would rather go on a girls’ trip than a getaway with their partner while one in six would even prefer a holiday with family members. But it’s not all bad news for men out there as 41 per cent of women said they were keener on their partner after a holiday in the sun. Most said it was because their men took better care of themselves, were nicer to be around and had shed some pounds to look good on the beach. Boredom: One in six women admitted they would prefer a holiday with family members over their partner . Chris Clarkson, managing director of Sunshine.co.uk, said: ‘If you’ve never been on holiday with a partner before it can be quite daunting known that you’re going to be with them 24/7, especially if you aren’t used to living together. ‘People are generally more relaxed on holiday, so bad habits can emerge which may be off-putting, but people should just enjoy being together and not having anything to worry about for a week or two.’ He added: ‘If, by the end of the holiday, you’re feeling more unsure about your partner than when you set off, it’s probably time to call it a day.’","Sunshine.co.uk polled 2,364 women who recently returned from couples trip .

"British business will lose £300 billion to gridlock over the next 16 years, new research has shown. A new report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts that London will be the worst-hit city . Already, across Britain, motorists are losing days of their lives in gridlock with drivers spending up to 91 hours a year stuck on some congested routes. Drivers travelling between Aldwych and Henlys roundabout in west London, waste on average 91 hours a year in gridlock. Those going just five miles between Thornton Heath and Westminster Bridge are stuck an extra 63 hours, and according to the CEBR, the situation is only going to get worse. Some London commuters already spend 91 hours a year of their journey at a complete standstill . By 2030 motorists in Britain will spend the equivalent of 18 working days a year stuck in traffic . The CEBR claims that by 2030, congestion will cost the average British family £2,000 a year. For business, the cumulative cost of delays, time lost and associated inefficiency take £300 billion out of the economy over the next 16 years. In London, congestion will cost the average family more than £4,000 a year by 2030, as the capital is expected to suffer worse gridlock than Los Angeles, Paris and New York. According to the CEBR, last year congestion cost the UK economy £13 billion. that is set to rise to more than £21 billion by 2030. By 2030, the average motorist will spend the equivalent of 18 working days a year stuck in traffic - with those in the capital spending up to 40 working days a year gridlocked. The CEBR conducted their study along with traffic experts INRIX who use in car sat-nav systems to capture traffic data. They studied the UK's 18 largest urban areas to discover the extent of traffic delays. These include Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford-Leeds, Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kingston-upon-Hull, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Portsmouth, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent. Rising congestion in London is expected to cost families in the capital on average £4,000 each by 2030 . Motorists using a three-mile stretch of the M8 outside Glasgow already lose 26 hours a year to traffic . The INRIX report concludes: ‘Between 2013 and 2030, the total cumulative cost of congestion to the UK economy is estimated to be a staggering £307billion.’ Of that £307billion - equivalent to nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of the nation’s productive wealth  last year - some £191billion is in the form of ‘direct costs ‘ such as the value of fuel and the time wasted by not being productive at work. A further £115billion is in the form of ‘indirect costs’ which relate to higher transport and freight costs and business fees from company vehicles idling in traffic, which are passed on to consumers as additional costs to household bills. The report notes that in the UK last year, almost 70 per cent of the workforce commuted to work by car during peak times, with the average British driver spending 124 hours stuck in gridlock annually. ‘This is set to rise to 136 hours in 2030, equivalent to 18 working days a year. This has both a direct and indirect economic impact on car commuting households,' the report says. And adds: ‘In London, the UK’s most congested city, drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013, which is double the UK average. This is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030, equivalent to 40 working days a year.' It says that although fewer than a third of Londoners commute to work by car, the cost of living and the value of time for the capital’s 1.4 million car commuters is at such a premium that it will cost ‘each car commuting household more than £4,000 a year by 2030.’ Matt Simmons, European director of INRIX said: ‘This study is a warning of the worsening impact of gridlock on the British economy and on household budgets. ‘We now know that congestion will continue to have serious consequences for national and city economies, businesses and citizens in the years to come. If we think this problem is bad now, we are in for a terrible shock come 2030.’","Traffic congestion will cost the average British family £2,000 a year by 2030 .

"A Utah couple and their three children who were discovered dead in their home last month were likely poisoned, it has emerged. The bodies of Benjamin Strack, 37, his wife Kristi, 36, and their children Benson, 14, Zion, 11, and 12-year-old Emery, were found in the locked master bedroom of their Springville home by their older son  in September - and much mystery has since surrounded the cause of their deaths. Police are still not revealing exactly what they believed happened on September 27 - or who could be responsible for the deaths - but it has emerged that cups were found next to each of the bodies, while empty bottles of methadone and nighttime cold medicine were found dumped in a trash can. Kristi Strack was also found with an unidentified red liquid coming out of her mouth. 'It is probable that these deaths were not accidental or natural in any way,' Detective Jeff Ellsworth wrote in the search warrant affidavit, which was obtained on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Perished: Benjamin Strack, 37, his wife Kristi, 36, and their children Benson, 14, Zion, 11, and 12-year-old Emery were found dead inside their Utah home last month. Their oldest son was not harmed . Unidentified people gather as Bob McGee, right, spokesperson for the relatives of five Utah family members found dead in their home in September, speaks with reporters during a news conference shortly afterwards . Poison: This photo shows the home where five Utah family members were found dead in Springville, Utah. The bodies were found in September about 45 miles south of Salt Lake City . Toxicology results have not determined an exact cause of death, but search warrants obtained Wednesday showed that it was likely that the family had been poisoned. Kristi Strack's mother, Valerie Sudweeks, said she couldn't believe her daughter would do this to the kids but wouldn't elaborate, police wrote. Police aren't saying who killed the family or whether one of the parents might have been involved. According to the search warrants, Benjamin and Kristi Strack were in bed, with children ages 11 through 14 lying around them, tucked in bedding up to their necks. 'Furthermore, with the placement of the bodies, it would appear somebody had to position the bodies after they were deceased,' detective Jeffery Ellsworth wrote. Investigators found several empty methadone bottles, 10 empty boxes of nighttime cold medicine and two boxes of allergy medicine in their garbage, along with a red liquid substance in Pepsi cups. They also found a pitcher of red juice, a purple bucket with yellow liquid, a bag of marijuana and other medications, including sleeping pills, inside the home. One pair of slippers with a spot of blood and a towel with a red substance on it were also removed. A community mourns: Unidentified people gather during a news conference in suburban Utah . Springville police Lieutenant Dave Caron said he couldn't comment on the search warrant or speculate about the cause of death until results of a toxicology test come back in November. 'Until I get those, I really don't have anything,' he said. 'I could come up with all sorts of theories, but it's not helpful.' The search warrant says it wasn't normal for the children to be in their parents' room because they had their own rooms. Kristi Strack was last seen alive at 6am by the older son's girlfriend, who also lives in the home. The girlfriend went back to sleep after talking with Kristi Strack, and the house was quiet when the older son, 18-year-old Janson, and his girlfriend left the house that afternoon. However, when they returned at 7pm and saw the house was still quiet even though all the cars were in the driveway, they knocked on the master bedroom door. When no one answered, the couple called Kristi Strack's mother and her friend, who helped them to force it open. Police had previously said that they showed no signs of dying violently and it had been suggested that maybe they died by carbon monoxide poisoning, although no trace of the gas was found. Idyllic childhood: Photos posted to a GoFundMe page  showed three fun, happy children. Emery (left), the page said, loved animals. The youngest, Zion (right), was 'brought everyone he came across happiness and joy' Active kids: Benson, who was 14 when he died, loved to draw dragons and practice karate . 'Valerie [Kristi Strack's mother]... said she couldn't believe ""she"" would do this to the kids,' one of the affidavits states. 'Officers tried to clarify Valerie's statement, but she only assured them it wasn't a carbon monoxide leak.' Little is known about the family. Benjamin Strack's former boss said he worked off-and-on for six to seven years at AK Masonry, a bricklaying company, and had borrowed money in the past. Court records show Benjamin and Kristi Strack pleaded guilty to misdemeanor forgery charges in 2008 and disorderly conduct the following year. Bob McGee, uncle to the Strack children including the surviving son Janson, 18, said: 'We are shocked and heartbroken by the sudden loss of so many members of our family,'Deseret reported. 'Events like this are difficult to understand, and even harder to come to terms with. And no words can adequately describe our feelings of grief and sorrow.' The Strack's community started a GoFundMe page  to help surviving family with 'overwhelming' funeral costs. The page devotes a few lines in remembrance of each family member, like father Benjamin. 'His heart was too big for this world and the love everyone felt when near him will not be forgotten,' it reads. Not so long ago: Investigators have yet to lay down publicly a definite timeline of the family's deaths. Photos from their past show a family that appeared to be nothing but happy to have each other . Loss: The first first photos emerged of Benjamin and Kristi Strack, 37 and 36, (both pictured) who were found dead at their home in Springville, Utah with their sons Benson, 14, (top right) and Zion, 11, (left) and 12-year-old daughter Emery (bottom right) Benjamin Strack and his young family in a photo in 2010. Preliminary autopsy results have ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play . The mom Kristi, the writer says, was 'charismatic, kind and loyal.' Her only daughter, Emery, loved animals. Fourteen-year-old Benson loved to draw dragons and practice karate. His younger brother Zion, the youngest, 'brought everyone he came across happiness and joy.' Heart-wrenching photos emerged of the handsome family, and the Stracks are exactly how surviving family members remember them--always smiling. Preliminary autopsy results ruled out any sort of violent assault or foul play. 'The Medical Examiner has indicated that the next step is to continue the investigation through analysis of blood samples to determine what may have caused the deaths,' the Springville DPS said in a statement. 'Preliminary autopsy results for the family of five who were found dead in their home have ruled out any sort of violent assault,' Springville police said in a statement. Photos of Benson, 14, and Zion, 11, taken when they were younger. While a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death . Only girl: Emery, 12, was found alongside her brothers and parents when the bodies were found in September . Previously, a test of air in the house by firefighters did not find any carbon monoxide, but investigators have not ruled that out as the cause of death. The front door of the house was open and the back door was cracked open before firefighters arrived, Caron said, and the gas could have ventilated before the test. The family's pets were all fine. Asked whether foul play has been ruled out, Caron said, 'I don't rule out anything ... We haven't ruled out anything except there was no violent trauma. We're going to look at everything. 'I do know when I was in there (the house) I didn't see anything that would suggest a struggle ... I saw nothing like that,' he added. A Facebook tribute page has also been set up to remember the family. One user wrote: 'I feel a part of me has been lost. My brother Ben was my best friend. A police vehicle sits outside the house this week. The duplex where the family lived is located on a road leading to a high school in the city of 30,000 located just south of Provo . 'We did everything together. He always made me happy when he was around. Emery, Benson and Zion it seems like yesterday I was helping them with home work and taking them camping. I remember Benson caught his first fish with us on the trip.' Another user wrote: ' Ben is one of my best friends. He was always like a brother to me as we grew up. I will miss him so much. His kids had the biggest smiles every time I seen them.' On the tribute page another user wrote: 'I sat in a couple parent teacher conferences with both Ben and Kristi. They were always so thrilled to talk with me about Zion, they were truly proud parents. 'I had the privilege to have their sweet, smiling, energetic, big brown eyed Zion in my second grade classroom.

"It's long been known that salamanders are capable of growing new limbs, but scientists believe they have finally discovered how the process works. Researchers at University College London (UCL) identified a biological pathway, called ERK (Extracellular signal-regulated kinases), must be . constantly active for salamander cells to regenerate - a process not seen in the same way in other mammals. Although a long way from achieving the . same feat in humans, the discovery could help researchers unlock the . ‘regenerative potential’ of cells across other animals. Scientists may have uncovered the secret of the salamander's ability to grow new limbs. Though a long way from achieving the same feat in people, the discovery could help researchers unlock the 'regenerative potential' of human cells. Pictured is a salamander known as Notophthalmus viridescens (the eastern newt) Salamanders are lizard-like amphibians famous for their capacity to replace body parts; cut a salamander’s leg off, and in time it will grow a new one. A study claims that wild salamanders in North America are getting smaller as their surroundings get warmer and drier, forcing them to burn more energy in a hotter climate. Researchers from the University of Maryland found that salamanders in the Appalachians today were nearly a tenth smaller than their ancestors in the 1950s. The changes were most marked in the Southern Appalachians and at low elevations - settings where detailed weather records showed the climate has warmed and dried out most. Scientists have predicted that some animals will get smaller in response to climate change and, the researchers sasy, this is strong confirmation of that prediction. In the same way, the creatures are able to regenerate tails, jaws, eyes, organs and even spinal cords. In adult mammalian cells, the ERK pathway is not fully active. When forced to be, cells acquire a greater potential for reprogramming and regeneration. The researchers announced their findings in the journal Stem Cell Reports. Through the ERK pathway, proteins communicate signals from a cell’s surface to the nucleus containing its genetic material. ‘While humans have limited regenerative abilities, other organisms, such as the salamander, are able to regenerate an impressive repertoire of complex structures including parts of their hearts, eyes, spinal cord, tails, and they are the only adult vertebrates able to regenerate full limbs,' said Lead scientist Dr Max Yun from UCL’s Institute of Structural and Molecular Biology. ‘We’re thrilled to have found a critical molecular pathway, the ERK pathway, that determines whether an adult cell is able to be reprogrammed and help the regeneration processes. ‘Manipulating this mechanism could contribute to therapies directed at enhancing regenerative potential of human cells.’ Further research will now focus on understanding how the important pathway is regulated during limb regeneration, and which other molecules are involved in the process.

"The two Burmese men accused of murdering two British holidaymakers on the holiday island of Koh Tao appeared in court for the first time yesterday. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, are charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery - in connection with the deaths of David Miller, 24, and 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge. A plea to postpone the start of the pre-trial hearings was rejected after defence lawyers wanted a delay to allow more time to prepare, according to the BBC. Scroll down for videos . Win Zaw Htun, left, and Zaw Lin, second right, the suspects in the killing of two British tourists, are escorted by police officers as they leave   Koh Samui Provincial Court in Surat Thani province, southern Thailand, yesterday . Hannah Witheridge (left) and David Miller (right) were murdered while backpacking in Thailand in September but the Foreign Office is concerned about the way the Thai authorities have handled the investigation . It comes after a Thai diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office amid concerns about the widely-criticised police investigation into the murders. Mark Kent, the British ambassador to Thailand, said on Twitter he had taken part in a three-hour meeting with Thai police, the Burmese ambassador and a 'delegation' on the Koh Tao murders. Foreign Minister Hugo Swire told Thai charge d'affaires Nadhavathna Krishnamra there was 'a real concern' in the UK over the way in which the deaths of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller have been dealt with. Zaw and Win, both migrant workers employed in bars on Koh Tao, were paraded in front of the cameras and forced to take part in a reconstruction of the killings after apparently making confessions. But those confessions were then apparently retracted, with a statement from a Burmese embassy lawyer claiming the suspects claimed police tortured them into incriminating themselves. Thai police denied the claims, but Amnesty International has demanded an investigation into them and further allegations of abuse made by members of the Burmese migrant worker community on Koh Tao. There are widespread rumours on social media that the real perpetrators are Thai mafia who are being protected by police. Despite the allegations, and further allegations that DNA evidence had been tampered with, Thailand's military junta rejected an offer from Britain to help with the investigation. The Foreign Office said UK police 'stood ready to assist with the investigation' into the deaths following widespread criticism of the handling of the case in Thailand. But Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha attempted to downplay growing international concern today and insisted the UK no longer had 'any more doubts' about the investigation. According to the Bangkok Post, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters: 'Anyone can come to Thailand, but don't forget that what is our business should remain ours. I consider the Koh Tao case to be reliable.' Gen Prayuth also denied that Thai diplomat, Nadhavathna Krishnamra, had been 'summoned' by the Foreign Office in London, saying yesterday's meeting was simply to provide 'clarification'. 'They do not have any more doubts about the investigation,' he told the Bangkok Post. 'They simply needed more time to understand it all because we managed to arrest suspects swiftly, even though it seemed impossible at the beginning.' Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, show how 'they killed' Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller . Mr Swire said it was crucial for the Thai authorities to investigate the killings in a 'fair and transparent way' and keep the victims' families up to date with progress. Following Mr Krishnamra's meeting with Mr Swire, the Foreign Office said in a statement: 'Mr Swire stressed that there was a real concern in the UK about how the investigation has been handled by the Thai authorities. He said that it was crucial for the investigation to be conducted in a fair and transparent way. 'Mr Swire emphasised how important it was that the UK and Hannah and David's families received regular updates on the investigation's progress. 'He also noted his concern about the way that the police had engaged with the media on the case and reiterated that the UK police stood ready to assist with the investigation and subsequent legal process.' Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds.","Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun appeared at Koh Samui Provincial Court .

'Our president (James Pallotta) has already spoken about this and he gets angry with the rumours that link (Strootman) to Manchester United,' Baldissoni told Radio Anch'io Sport in Italy. 'Our policy is that of investing in players that have quality but have room for improvement. 'Kevin is a young player with experience, and we want to build our future with players like him.' Roma have long insisted that Strootman is going nowhere, with Pallotta even claiming he would turn down a £75m bid for the player. But Strootman also has admirers at other big clubs across Europe and Roma's Champions League exit at the hands of Manchester City could push him closer to the Stadio Olimpico exit. The 24-year-old has only recently returned from a serious knee injury which kept him out of action for seven months and forced the former PSV Eindhoven star to miss the World Cup last summer.

"Breakthrough: British scientistst have successfully regenerated a thymus in a mouse. The organ is part of the immune system . British scientists have been able to fully restore an organ in a living animal for the first time - a breakthrough which may pave the way for the technique to be used in humans. The Scottish team have successfully rebuilt the thymus of 'very old' mice by reactivating a natural mechanism that gets shut down with age. The thymus is an organ central to the immune system, found in front of the heart. The regenerated thymus was not only similar in structure and genetic detail to one in a young mouse, the scientists said, but was also able to function again. After the regeneration, the treated mice also started to make more T-cells - a type of white blood cell key to fighting infections. The regenerated thymus was also more than twice the size of the aged organs in the untreated mice. ‘By targeting a single protein, we have been able to almost completely reverse age-related shrinking of the thymus,’ said Clare Blackburn from Edinburgh's Medical Research Council (MRC) Centre for Regenerative Medicine, who led the research. ‘Our results suggest that targeting the same pathway in humans may improve thymus function and therefore boost immunity in elderly patients, or those with a suppressed immune system.’ She added however, that while the treated mice were making T-cells, her research could not yet establish whether the immune systems of the older mice were strengthened. And before the technique can be tested in humans, she said, researchers will need to conduct more animal experiments to make sure the regeneration process can be tightly controlled. The thymus is the first organ to . deteriorate as people age. This shrinking is one of the main reasons the . immune system becomes less effective and we lose the ability to fight . off new infections, such as flu, as we get older. Regenerative medicine is a fast-growing . area of research, mainly focused on stem cells - the master cells that . act as a source for all types of cells and tissues in the body. One of . the central aims is to harness the body's own repair mechanisms and . manipulate them in a controlled way to treat disease. After the regeneration of the thymus, the mice also started to produce more T-cells (pictured) - a type of white blood cell key to fighting infections . Blackburn's team, whose work was published on Tuesday in the journal Development, said they targeted a part of the process by which the thymus degenerates - a protein called FOXN1 that helps control how key genes in the thymus are switched on. They used genetically modified mice to enable them to increase levels of this protein using chemical signals. By doing so, they managed to instruct immature cells in the thymus - similar to stem cells - to rebuild the organ in the older mice. Rob Buckle, the MRC's head of regenerative medicine, said this success with the mouse thymus suggests organ regeneration in mammals can be directed by manipulating a single protein - something he said could have broad implications for other areas of regenerative biology.","British scientists rebuild the thymus in a 'very old' mouse .

"With motorists and cyclists battling for space on London’s congested roads, a company is proposing a £600m ‘floating cycleway’ that would take thousands of cyclists of the streets and put them on the Thames. Proposed by the River Cycleway Consortium, the Thames Deckway would serve as a nearly eight-mile cycling route from Battersea to Canary Wharf. The first composite image released by the organisation, founded by artist Anna Hill and architect David Nixon, shows the costly path skirting the south bank in front of City Hall and slipping past HMS Belfast. Scroll down for video . 'Floating cycleway': The Thames Deckway would run along the south bank for nearly eight miles . A fit cyclist could cover the entire length of the route - from Canary Wharf to Battersea - in 30 minutes . Designed for commuter and leisure cyclists and pedestrians, the east-west cycleway could be constructed along London’s busy waterfront within two years if it is approved, according to the consortium. Without any vehicular traffic to impede them, fit cyclists could pedal the entire length in about 30 minutes. The mid-point would be the Millennium Bridge. Share the road: Thames Deckway users would be charged £1.50 per journey to cover upkeep costs . Halfway there: Millennium Bridge would be the mid-point of the path through central London . Users would be charged £1.50 per journey to cover upkeep costs, while the path’s lights and refreshment kiosks would be powered using solar, tide and wind energy. With its unique proposal, River Cycleway Consortium is challenging city planners to think outside the box to reduce congestion and pollution while encouraging more people to cycle. The group is raising money to conduct a feasibility study which will identify how many on- and off-ramps would be required and how it would avoid moorings. It plans to seek private investors if the project proceeds. This image shows a proposed segregated two-way cycle track included in London's ‘Crossrail for bikes’ plan . This is what the proposed segregated two-way cycle track would look like on Blackfriars Road . But the plan faces hurdles because of its nine-figure price tag and planning requirements. In its proposal, River Cycleway Consortium said the path would complement the ‘Crossrail for bikes’ plan unveiled by Mayor Boris Johnson last month. Under that proposal, two new urban cycleways – an 18-mile east-west route from Barking to Acton, and a three-mile north-south route from Elephant & Castle to King’s Cross – would link to other routes at a cost £47m. Scheduled to open in March 2016, both cycleways would be almost entirely separated from vehicles.

"You may think that appearing intelligent might be the key to getting a promotion at work. But people who want to rise to the top should concentrate on looking healthy, according to a new study. Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent. Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion (pictured right) is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent (bottom row). They came to their conclusion after conducting an experiment where participants chose from different faces (shown) to pick the leader of a fictional company . They discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a pay rise or for politicians seeking election. In an experiment by VU University Amsterdam, 148 candidates were asked to select a future leader of a fictional firm by choosing between two digitally manipulated photographs of the same man. One image was altered to make him look healthier and the other manipulated to make him look cleverer. The experiment revealed that seven times out of 10, the man with the healthy complexion was more appealing than the intelligent looking male. ‘Here we show that it always pays for aspiring leaders to look healthy, which explains why politicians and executives often put great effort, time, and money in their appearance,’ said Assistant Professor Brian Spisak from the Department of Management and Organisation at the university. The experts discovered that appearing intelligent is an ‘optional extra’ for workers looking for a raise (illustrated with a stock image) or for politicians looking to get elected. However, people are more likely to vote for a healthy-looking politician and choose a healthy-looking boss . Office plants help workers be more creative and productive, which could result in promotion, a University of Exeter study claims. At work, humble houseplants have been proven to aid concentration, increase productivity and boost staff wellbeing by 47 per cent, according to a study undertaken in December last year. The results showed that allowing staff to make design decisions in a workspace enhanced with office plants can increase creativity by 45 per cent and boost productivity by 38 per cent. Plants have previously been proven to have positive effects in hospitals, where patients with potted plants close by said they experienced less pain, anxiety and tiredness, while houses with plant-filled rooms contain between 50 and 60 per cent fewer bacteria than other rooms without plants. ‘If you want to be chosen for a leadership position, looking intelligent is an optional extra under context-specific situations whereas the appearance of health appears to be important in a more context-general way across a variety of situations.’ In the experiment, the participants were given a job description that specified the CEO’s main challenge each time they were asked to choose between the two images. Job descriptions involved driving aggressive competition, renegotiating a key partnership with another company, leading the company’s shift into a new market and overseeing the sustained exploitation of non-renewable energy. The participants chose more healthy-looking faces over less healthy-looking faces in 69 per cent of trials and this preference was equally strong irrespective of the future CEO’s main challenge, according to the study published in the access journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. More intelligent-looking faces were only preferred over less intelligent-looking faces for the two challenges that would require the most diplomacy and inventiveness: renegotiating the partnership and exploring the new market. The aim of the experiment was to explore people’s implicit preferences for traits of leaders, such as health, intelligence, and attractiveness. The researchers focused on facial traits because these provide a wealth of information about individuals. In women as well as men, caring and cooperative personalities are statistically more likely to have a more ‘feminine’ face, due to higher oestrogen levels, while aggressive risk-takers tend to have higher testosterone levels and a more ‘masculine’ face.","Researchers found that 70 per cent of the time, a worker with a healthy complexion is more appealing than a colleague who looks intelligent .

"As the popular ITV drama Downton Abbey is set in an era before make-up was commonplace, the ladies of the manor have to showcase a natural look. But with the glare of the on-set lights and the need to look fresh and glamorous at all times, the stars of course wear cosmetics. Now Laura Carmichael, 28, who plays Lady Edith, has revealed the tricks of the trade that are used by the show's make-up artist Magi Vaughan. Scroll down for video . Twenties-inspired: Lisa Eldridge gives actress Laura Carmichael a natural make-over, left, recreating her style from Downton Abbey series three, right . Laura shares the secrets with make-up artist Lisa Eldridge as she recreates her natural look from series three. In a video tutorial using Laura as her model, Lisa uses products widely available to buy so people without their own professorial make-up artist can get the look at home. Lisa said she wanted to recreate Lady Edith's natural style because she's 'a big fan of the show and I have made up lots of the female cast for cover shoots and red carpet events'. Downtown Abbey series three was set in 1920-21, an era when most women didn't wear make-up. Laura said: 'We were always asking for a bit more lip or blush in the make-up chair but we're not allowed. It would just look wrong.' Lisa explains: 'Women in the early 20s didn't wear make-up and it was associated with actresses and women of ill-repute.' Get the look: On the set of Downton, an air brush is used but Lisa uses make-up brushes . As a result, the Downton Abbey actresses needed to have a realistic, natural look (although in the current series set later in the twenties they can wear more make-up as it was beginning to catch on). To achieve natural look, Magi used an air brush - where make-up is sprayed on instead of applied using brushes and sponges. Laura said of getting air brushed in the make-up chair every day: 'You do get used to it but it's weird to begin with and the guys find it hilarious. But you can do a lot with it in terms of shading.' Lisa chose not to use an air brush, opting instead to use L'Oreal Infallible Foundation, applied with a make-up brush so people can more easily copy her. She also uses Laura Mercier SC1 Secret Camouflage concealer and Chanel loose powder. Lisa then applies Daniel Sandler's Water Colour Blush Cherub to Laura's cheeks. Subtle effect: Lipstick Queen Medieval is used to stain the lips . She explains: 'It's important for this look to be rosy, pretty but natural and healthy looking. Women at the time would have pinched their cheeks to create that rosy glow without make up.' For the eyes, Lisa then uses Stila In The Know Eyeshadow Palette 'rain' shade, using a brush to avoid lines, then adds the darker 'driftwood' shade along the lower and upper lash line. She defines Laura's eyebrows with Rimmel Brow This Way powder then curls her eye lashes. Laura reveals that on the show, they are often not allowed to wear mascara so instead they tint their eyelashes. When they do wear mascara for a special occasion, it's brown or clear. The true natural look: Lisa before the make-over . Voila! The actress was happy with the result . Lisa replicates this by using Chanel brown mascara then little bit of clear mascara. Finally to finish the look, Lisa adds Lipstick Queen Medieval. She explains how this gives a 'subtle berry effect like you've just eaten, so it's a natural stain.' She then uses a No7 nude lip pencil to add definition to the lip line - another trick used on the Downton set. Unveiling Laura's make-over, the actress says she's pleased with the result. 'It's perfect, natural but pretty. I love the lip colour,' she said.","Make-up wasn't worn excessively in the Twenties .

"A man and woman who died just minutes apart at two different locations in Maryland Tuesday have lost their lives as a result of a murder-suicide sparked by a workplace dispute, police revealed today. Montgomery County Police stated Wednesday that a man identified as Andrew Racca, 42, found dead inside a Mercedes-Benz that plowed into a tree in Potomac took his own life after allegedly killing the wife of his employer. Firefighters responding to a blaze inside a garage attached to a house two miles away from the scene of the car crash came upon the body of the victim, 57-year-old Carolyn Mattingly. Scroll down for video . Murder-suicide: Disgruntled charity employee Andrew Racca (left), 42, took his own life after allegedly killing Maryland realtor Carolyn Mattingly (right), 57, in her garage . Fatality: The driver of this Mercedes was found dead from an apparent gunshot wound after crashing into a tree in Potomac, Maryland . According to police, Racca had worked for the owner of the house at 12045 Great Elm Drive, Richard Mattingly, executive vice president and COO at Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. According to Mr Racca's LinkedIn page, he had been with the non-profit organization for more than eight years and only recently was promoted to director of network operations. The CFF was established in 1955 to help find a cure for the life-threatening genetic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system in children and teens. Detectives said that on Monday, Mattingly and Racca got into a dispute after the charity executive accused the 42-year-old of workplace theft and told him that the management will have to report the allegations to police. Racca failed to show up for work the following day and instead allegedly drove down to his boss' home in Potomac and slashed all four tires on a car parked in the driveway. Firefighters responded to a small blaze inside a garage attached to this sprawling home just two miles away from the scene of the crash . At around 1.13pm, Carolyn Mattingly called police to report the act of vandalism. Responding officers observed the cut tires and spoke to the woman, who told them that her husband was at work. Police filed an official report and then left the residence. Officers received another 911 call at around 2.30pm involving a Mercedes that slammed into a tree on Piney Meeting House Road in Potomac. The tree fell on top of the car, and by the time police responded to the scene of the crash the driver, Andrew Racca, has died. There was a pistol on the seat next to him, police said. Grieving spouse: The victim's husband, Richard Mattingly, is the COO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation where the suspected killer worked . About 10 minutes later, local firefighters responded to the Mattinglys' sprawling two-story house on Great Elm Drive, about two miles from the scene of the vehicular accident. First responders extinguished a small blaze raging inside the garage, and when they entered the building, they came upon Carolyn Mattingly's body. Neighbors told ABC7 News that the car involved in the crash was owned by the couple who live in the home where the fire was extinguished. 'It's a tragedy out here,' neighbor David Andrukitis said. 'We've never had anything like this.' Autopsies will be performed on the bodies to determine the causes of death. Eyewitnesses said it appears that the Mercedes drove through a white fence surrounding the house on Great Elm Street and then careened into a tree. According to the real estate site Zillow.com, the house at 12045 Great Elm Drive sitting on 2 acres of land is worth close to $1.4million. In response to a request for comment made by MailOnline, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation spokeswoman Laurie Fink sent a statement Wednesday afternoon confirming the death of Mattingly's wife. 'We are devastated by the tragic death of Carolyn Mattingly, the loving wife of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, C. Richard Mattingly. Grisly find: First responders came upon Mrs Mattingly's body inside this garage . 'We have learned from Montgomery County Police (MCP) that an employee of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Andrew Racca, was also found deceased near the Mattingly home yesterday. 'The police are investigating the two deaths as a possible murder-suicide. We are cooperating fully with the MCP as they continue their investigation. 'Our greatest concern is for the welfare of the Mattingly family, and we share our deepest sympathies with them during this extraordinarily difficult time.' Richard Mattingly has been working with the foundation since 1978, and he has been acting as the foundation’s COO for more than 20 years. His wife worked as a realtor at Long & Foster Companies, described on its website as 'the largest real estate company in the Mid-Atlantic region.' According to Mrs Mattingly's online profile, she was employed at Potomac Village Sales, specializing in investment property, new construction and rentals. Carolyn Mattingly, a native of Kentucky, graduated from Eastern Kentucky University in 1979 with a bachelor’s degree in real estate in urban development. In 2003, she was appointed by the governor to serve on the Maryland Commission for Women. The 56-year-old realtor has been heavily involved in her husband's charitable work, volunteered her time to the local Girl Scouts, coached soccer and served as president of the Winston Churchill High School Booster Club.

"A French MP has been reprimanded and fined for using allegedly sexist grammar in the Paris parliament. In a bizarre case which will be of particular interest to British people who have struggled over 'le' and 'la' during torturous French lessons, Julien Aubert called a senior colleague ‘Madame le President’. ‘Madame le President’ is technically correct, because all nouns in France have a sex, and ‘president’ is a male word. Un faux pas: Julian Aubert called Sandrine Mazetier, the Socialist president in the National Assemby, ‘Madame le President’, prompting her to fine him £1,000, even though it's grammatically correct . But Sandrine Mazetier, the Socialist president in the National Assemby, objected to the term, saying she was clearly a woman and should be ‘Madame La Presidente’, with an ‘e’ on the end. During a parliamentary session on Monday, Ms Mazetier said: ‘Mr Aubert I’m calling you to order. It’s ""Madame la Presidente"". It’s a call to order without a fine, but next time...’ But Mr Aubert, of the conservative UMP, refused to comply, pointing out that according to l'Academie Francaise, France’s language police, ‘Madame la Presidente’ would refer to the president’s wife. This prompted Ms Mezetier to issue a formal fine equivalent to just over £1,000, and he was officially reprimanded. Left wingers supported the move, with Green Party MP Cecile Duflot insisting: ‘This isn’t trivial. Many respectful UMP members don’t do this kind of thing.’ Caroline de Haas, a high profile feminist politician, tweeted: ‘A woman at the head of National Assembly seems to bother the UMP. It’s true, it’s only 2014 after all.’ But Eric Ciotti, another member of the UMP, said it was ‘a grotesque and ridiculous sanction' against Mr Aubert, adding the 'Socialists bring back the thought police'. Pierre Morel, also a UMP MP, said: ‘The sanction against Julian Aubert is dumb, Sandrine Mezetier is abusing her powers.’ The National Assembly: Left wingers supported the sanction against Mr Aubert, but his colleagues in the right-wing UMP party accused Ms Mazetier of abusing her powers . Set up to guarantee the purity of the French language, L'Académie Française has led the rearguard action against the increasing influence of what it calls the ‘Americanisation’ of French life. It has sometimes ordered censorship of films from across the Atlantic, and ensured huge subsidies for dubbing firms and the French film industry. A commission chosen from among its 40 members - known as 'The Immortals' - advises on what new words should be entered into the French dictionary, studiously guarding against foreign impurities, notably those from English. Bizarrely, the most recent addition to their number is, in fact, an Englishman. Michael Edwards, a 74-year-old professor of literature from Barnes, south-west London, was admitted in May.","Julian Aubert was technically correct, because 'president' is a male word .

Location: Johnsonville is situated in the Moodus section of East Haddamin. It includes 62 acres of land and numerous buildings . In 1972, Raymond Schmitt, the 'very eccentric' owner of aerospace part firm AGC Inc, bought the property after a lightning strike destroyed the mill. Schmitt decided to create a Victorian-era tourist attraction, so traveled around the northeast, buying up entire buildings and shipping them to the town. In addition to the vast array of properties he purchased, he also bought a paddleboat from the World's Fair in the 1960s.

Schmitt engaged designer Thomas Kronenberger to build the bridge to commemorate the American Bicentennial in 1976 . He later transported it to Johnsonville, where he hoped to use it to ferry passengers around the lake in the middle of the property. But although Schmitt allowed visitors onto the grounds, and weddings were occasionally held at the Swiss chalet-styled restaurant, the town never truly became a bustling hub for tourists and the owner died in 1998. Even the paddleboat began sinking into the lake. For the past few decades, 'No Trespassing signs' have hung off properties, warning curious travelers to stay away. Desolate: Mr Kelly said the buyer's plans for the property can not yet be disclosed.

"I saw a pillow in John Lewis the other day that cost £85 and I thought: ‘How can that aid slumber any better than a pillow costing tens of pounds less?’ I don’t know how much the pillows at the Viceroy New York cost – but I would be prepared to pay at least three figures for just one of them. They are extraordinary. Viceroy Double: Guests are cocooned in luxurious wood and treated to astonishingly comfortable beds . I’d had a scout around the hotel’s website before arriving, and didn't notice any pillow previews. They deserve their own microsite. As I lie down, the prospect of wakefulness disappears in a flash. My head sinks right into the pillow, yet it feels supported. In fact, the whole Viceroy bed is heavenly. Climbing into one is like falling into the arms of an angel. In the morning, the weariness brought on by transatlantic travel is banished. So I decide to inspect the rest of the ‘deluxe’ twin room that I’m sharing with my travelling companion - my mum. The beds are in a cocoon of rich wooden furnishings, from the bedside wardrobes to the writing table. It doesn't feel like a hotel room, more like someone’s trendy Manhattan apartment. The bathroom is a work of art, with an impossibly grand round mirror above the sink. It is complemented by a satellite shaving mirror that you can swing from side to side on a metal arm. It looks very expensive. A walk-in rain shower completes the set-up. The Viceroy New York, which opened last October, has other aces up its sleeve – one being the location. For one, it is on West 57th Street, which puts you within walking distance of a whole feast of Big Apple musts. Breakfast in style: Mother Thornhill reads up on New York's tourist attractions in the Kingside restaurant . Tasty: The Kingside restaurant's frittata with crumpets, plus a smooth cup of coffee . Central Park? Two minutes’ walk away. Rockefeller Center? Seven minutes south, by foot. Museum of Modern Art? You’ll measure the time it takes to get there in seconds. Carnegie Hall, meanwhile, is practically next door. Before you head out though, do not skip the Viceroy breakfast. It is served in the hotel’s bistro-esque Kingside restaurant - where the decor resembles that of the bedrooms, with the same tones, luxurious woods and sumptuous leather. The coffee is smooth and strong, the orange juice long and fresh, the frittata with maple bacon spot-on – and the service nothing short of exemplary. Technogym Fitness Center . Complimentary wi-fi . Beats by Dr. Dre Beatbox Portable audio sound systems in each room . Neil George spa products . Rooftop bar with amazing views . Superb dining at the Kingside restaurant . Beautifully choreographed styling . The dinner experience is similarly enticing. I’m always encouraged by menus that don’t have too many dishes on them – it’s usually a sign that quality is the priority. And that’s the case at Kingside. It is a fusion of Italian, French and American cooking, with offerings such as roasted wild king salmon with asparagus and green onion, braised pork shank with roasted shallots, certified angus 32oz cowboy rib eye and lamb chops with chickpeas and yoghurt. Me? I go for the Kingside Burger with white cheddar and giardiniera relish. It is tender and perfectly cooked, but does look a bit lonely on the big white plate. I’m surprised the hotel hasn't caught on to the hipster method of burger presentation, using a wooden chopping board, given the hotel’s love of quality wood. Mother Thornhill opts for a shaved kale salad with goat cheese and toasted almonds, which also gets the thumbs-up. I wash down the burger with a New Zealand sauvignon blanc, which is suitably fruity. The quality of the restaurant is underscored by the fact that people not staying at the hotel travel here to dine. The rooftop bar is also a destination watering hole – a magnet for trendy young professionals. Popular: The Kingside restaurant is a big draw for tourists and Manhattanites . Amazing view: The rooftop bar looks out over Central Park . Watering hole: The Viceroy rooftop bar offers drinkers an urbane environment in which to quench their thirst . But it’s the view that is the biggest draw. It almost makes me gasp. The rooftop looks out over Central Park and the whole of upper Manhattan. At 29 floors, the Viceroy is by no means the tallest building in the area, but it doesn’t need to be - because it’s higher than enough of the surrounding structures to facilitate prime cityscape gazing. The bar takes mixology seriously. House cocktails include the Espresso Martini, Mojito and Without Fear, made using Jameson Black Barrel whiskey with apricot liquer. We stay on a Monday and Tuesday, and the atmosphere is lively on both nights. There is also a bar at the front of the Kingside restaurant, at street level, which is similarly beguiling. There are a few extra snazzy garnishes at the Viceroy that raise its cool factor. I like the fact that you sign in by finger-writing your signature on an iPad at the reception desk – and that every bedroom comes with a Beats by Dr Dre beatbox - and a smartphone pre-loaded with information about the hotel, from room service to the cocktail menu. Very hip. Wi-fi, meanwhile, is free and very fast. Are there any downsides? Yes, but we’re quibbling here. Viceroy New York doesn't have a lot of girth, and some may find the standard rooms a tad compromised space-wise. But for a few nights, they are perfect. Relaxing: Ted reads up on the tourist musts in the lobby . Roomy: The Viceroy's suites have ample square-footage . There are 240 rooms in total, including some pricier suites - 43 of them - with more space for spreading out. Also, for the room price, you might expect the hotel to offer a swimming pool. This is a hotel that inflates your ego – you’ll want to boast to people that you are staying there. It has poise, finesse and beautifully choreographed suave styling that may make you feel as if you are living in an aftershave advert. Or a bed advert. Scent-sational: Staying at the Viceroy is a bit like being in an aftershave advert . Viceroy New York rooms start at $309 (£186) per night ($309).

"The mystery surrounding North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's disappearance from the spotlight deepened today when he failed to show for a Workers' Party anniversary celebration. It was the first time in three years Kim hadn't attended the event in Pyongyang, which today marked the party's 69th anniversary. But while Kim wasn't there in person, a flower basket with his name on it was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, both of whom also ruled North Korea. Scroll down for video . Kim Jong Un was absent from the Workers' Party 69th anniversary celebrations in Pyongyang today, but a flower basket baring his name was placed before statues of his father and grandfather, as were other baquets from North Koreans . North Korean military personnel march as they visit the statues of late leaders, Kim Il Sung, left, and Kim Jong Il on Mansudae, as they mark the anniversary celebrations . It was the first time in three years, Kim hadn't attended the event amid reports his sister has taken over leadership as he recovers from a leg injury . North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo-jong (left), who has already been identified as Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has reportedly taken leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury . His absence comes as speculation mounts that his sister, Kim Yo-jong, 24, who is Deputy Director of the Workers' Party, has taken over the leadership while her brother recovers from a leg injury. The 31-year-old hasn't been seen in public since September 3. He had been walking with a limp and was more overweight than usual in images that aired before that. An official documentary from late last month described him as dealing with 'discomfort', which led to international speculation that he may be ill. In Seoul, Unification Ministry spokesman Lim Byeong Cheol said that Kim appears to still be in charge of key affairs. He noted that a high-level North Korean delegation conveyed a greetings message to South Korean President Park Geun-hye during their surprise visit to South Korea last week. State media, later reported Kim was suffering from unspecified 'discomfort'. Sources have claimed the dictator had hurt his leg when he joined generals he had ordered to perform physical drills, and required 100 days to recover. North Korea has said nothing publicly about Kim's absence. But it is not the first time he has taken a break from the media spotlight - Kim wasn't seen publicly for about three weeks in 2012, South Korean officials say. He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship previously said . Because Pyongyang is publicly acknowledging Kim's 'discomfort', many analysts believe that he's unlikely to be suffering from anything particularly serious. When his father, Kim Jong Il, suffered major health problems late in his rule, state media said nothing. But each day that passes only adds to the speculation. Kim missed a meeting of the country's parliament late last month, and was absent again from a gathering this week to mark his late father's election as ruling party head. Toshimitsu Shigemura, a professor at Tokyo's Waseda University and an authority on North Korean affairs, appeared to suggest Ms Kim had taken control. He told The Telegraph: 'Kim's sister may be young, but she has taken up some of the key leadership positions in North Korea, relying on the family name and bloodline to have her instructions carried out. 'No-one can touch the Kim family and it doesn't matter that she is young, inexperienced and a woman. She is a Kim and that's enough.' According to South Korea's JoongAng Daily, Ms Kim is already in charge of her brother's daily schedule, 'as well as coordinating every detail of his fashion and hair style'. Health fear: Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011 . Prior to the emergence of the latest claims, a source with access to the secretive North's leadership insisted Kim was in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over his health and grip on power. The source said that Kim had just taken a step out of the limelight because of his leg injury. 'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. 'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon. 'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. 'He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said. Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury. He was last seen attending a concert with his wife Ri Sol-ju on September 3 but has vanished from public since . Kim has not been pictured by state media, which chronicles his whereabouts in great detail, since September 3 . 'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble. Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'. Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang. The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'. 'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia. North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye. Shots fired across border after activists urge North Korea to rise up against 'dictator' Kim . North and South Korea exchanged machinegun fire today after the Communist state took objection to balloons loaded with leaflets condemning Kim Jong Un. No casualties were reported in the exchange of fire, a sign of the tensions which sill exist between the two states. They remain legally at war and are separated by the Demilitarized Zone, known as the DMZ. North Korean defectors launched balloons from the South today to send across leaflets and DVDs condemning the regime of Kim Jong Un, as well as American dollars . The balloons carried bags of leaflets and anti-Kim DVDs underneath. But they prompted North Korean border troops to fire across the border, which led to an exchange of fire . South Korean activists had sent leaflets critical of the North Korean regime flying into the North from the town, prompting shots to be fired by the North's guards to try to bring down the balloons. South Korea's military returned fire after hearing the sound of the North's machinegun fire, the official said. Some rounds fell on the South side which then responded with high-calibre machine gun fire 'towards the North's guard posts,' a defence ministry spokesman said. There was a further exchange of fire 10 minutes later, he added. Local residents of Hwangsan-ri township in the border area of Yeoncheon were evacuated to shelters as a precaution. While naval confrontations along the Koreas' disputed maritime border occur from time to time, any military engagement across the heavily-militarised land frontier is extremely rare. In 2010, the North shelled the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, killing four people and briefly sparking fears of a full scale conflict. The balloon launch from Hapsuri was one of several planned to coincide with North Korea's celebration today of the 69th anniversary of its ruling Workers' Party. Seoul allowed the exercises to go ahead, despite prior warnings from Pyongyang of 'catastrophic' consequences. Some of the balloons carried messages denouncing North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un, who has not seen seen in public for more than a month. North Korea has reacted angrily to leaflet drops by South Korean private groups that carried messages attacking the authoritarian leadership in Pyongyang, vowing to attack them but has never taken action to follow up on the threat. 'This is the first time North Korea actually took an action against leaflets. It spilt cold water over the South-North relationship after the high-level delegation visit from North. It will strain the relations again,' said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies, said. On Tuesday, a South Korean naval ship fired warning shots after a North Korean patrol boat crossed a disputed sea border off the peninsula's west coast and fired shots back before retreating, a South Korean defence official said. There were no casualties on the South Korean side and none of the shots by either side was aimed at the other's vessel, he told Reuters. Evidence of the shots fired by North Korea could be seen on the southern side of the Demilitarized Zone which separates the two states, including this bullet hole (centre). Both sides are technically still at war .","North Korea's Kim Jong Un has been keeping a low-profile since September .

"Denied: Leslie Van Houten was denied parole for the 20th time 44 years after going to prison for the LaBianca murders . A parole panel refused an emotional bid by former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten to release her from prison 44 years after she participated in a notorious set of murders. The denial came at the 63-year-old's 20th parole hearing on Wednesday, where the panel heard from relatives of the victims who were opposed to her release. Board of Parole Hearings Commissioner Jeffrey Ferguson told Van Houten she had failed to explain how someone as intelligent and well-bred as she was could have committed the 'cruel and atrocious' murders of Leno and Rosemary La Bianca. She won't be eligible to ask for parole again for five years, but Ferguson said she could request another hearing sooner if circumstances change. 'The crimes will always be a factor,' he said. 'The question is whether the good will ever outweigh the bad. It certainly didn't today.' Van Houten was convicted of murder and conspiracy for her role in the slayings of wealthy Los Angeles grocers Leno and Rosemary La Bianca. They were stabbed to death in August 1969, one night after Manson's followers killed actress Sharon Tate and four others. Van Houten was 19 at the time. Van Houten did not participate in the Tate killings but went along the next night when the La Biancas were slain in their home. During the penalty phase of her trial she confessed to joining in stabbing Mrs. La Bianca after she was dead. 'I know I did something that is unforgiveable, but I can create a world where I make amends,' Van Houten said before the decision. Fresh-faced: Van Houten, right, enters court in 1969 with Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel . With survivors of the LaBiancas sitting behind her at the California Institution for Women, Van Houten acknowledged participating in the killings ordered by Manson. 'He could never have done what he did without people like me,' said Van Houten, who has been in custody for 44 years. 'She is living a life of amends for her crime on a daily basis,' Van Houten's attorney Michael Satris said before the hearing. 'Everything she does now is to be of service and benefit to the world.' Satris added Van Houten's value system is the complete opposite of 1969 when 'she was following the teachings of a false prophet.' Ringleader: Charles Manson led the three young women in a spate of vicious murders in 1969 . Van Houten has been commended for her work helping elderly women inmates at the prison where she and other followers of Manson women have been incarcerated. She earned two college degrees while in custody. Other members of Manson's murderous 'family' have lost multiple bids for parole. One former Manson follower, Bruce Davis, was approved for parole last year only to have California's governor Jerry Brown veto the plan in March. She was portrayed by her defense lawyers as the youngest and least culpable of those convicted with Manson, a young woman from a good family who had been a homecoming princess and showed promise until she became involved with drugs and was recruited into Manson's murderous cult. Van Houten was convicted along with Manson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkle - they were all sentenced to death, but their sentences were reduced to life in prison when the death penalty was briefly outlawed in the 1970s. Smiling: Van Houten at a previous parole hearing in May 2002; this is her 20th parole denial . Atkins died of cancer in prison. Krenwinkle has been denied parole repeatedly and Manson, now 78, has stopped coming to parole hearings, saying that prison is his home and he wants to stay there. Manson's lieutenant, Charles 'Tex' Watson, was convicted separately and has been denied parole many times. Decades ago, one of the original prosecutors in the case, Stephen Kay, said there would come a time when Van Houten would be ready for parole. But parole officials, while giving her high marks for her accomplishments in prison, have now refused her bids for freedom 20 times. Her last hearing was in 2010 at which she said, 'I apologize for the pain I caused.'","Leslie Van Houten sought release from prison 44 years after her murder trial .

"Stephen Lindop, 35, from Denton, Greater Manchester, stole from pubs and cafes and pretended his handyman father was a millionaire . A pub manager who claimed a 'struggle with his sexuality' led to him to pose as a wealthy playboy and go on giant spending sprees was jailed today after admitting theft and fraud. Stephen Lindop, 35, from Denton, Greater Manchester, stole tens of thousands of pounds in cash from a string of employers and used some of the money to fund a luxury lifestyle he could not afford, a court heard. He enjoyed stays at the Dorchester Hotel in London, handed out £100 tips to taxi drivers, went on shopping sprees and treated friends to champagne-fuelled nights at nightclubs. Today Lindop, who told people who asked that his handyman father was a millionaire, was jailed for three years after admitting theft and fraud. The fraudster, who was said to have lived in a Walter Mitty-style 'fantasy world', got his first job running a pub in Bristol in 2008 after falsifying his CV. Within four months the owner was forced to sell the pub and two other establishments after a number of 'ridiculously high' refunds were taken from the tills, many of them outside opening hours. On a day when almost £2,000 was actually taken in sales, the till records said no money had been taken at all as Lindop and a colleague carried out multiple refunds and 'void' transactions. Thousands in fees and deposits for party bookings were taken but not banked, the court was told. Staff wages were regularly paid from the till, the pub's food and drink was consumed, and numerous takeaways and complimentary meals drained its coffers. In December 2010 Lindop was sentenced to 24 months in prison, suspended for two years, and was ordered to pay £10,000 compensation for fraud. Lindop, who was said to have lived in a Walter-Mitty style 'fantasy world', admitted fraud and theft . But later that month he registered with Berkeley Scott employment agency in Manchester, saying he had no convictions. He also omitted from his CV all mention of employment at the pub in Bristol, and was taken on as manager of the Forum café in Wythenshawe in January 2011. When the café decided to install a cashpoint machine to attract extra custom Lindop, who was given access to it, stole £63,380 from it at a rate of around £2,000 a week. Prosecutor Henry Blackshaw said: 'He was the only person trusted with the keys and as such could enter the machine to replenish money cassettes which held £10 and £20 notes. Lindop spent the money he stole on stays at luxury hotels like the Dorchester, pictured, and spending sprees . The court heard concerns were not raised until the company's financial manager returned from sick leave and, during a site visit, it was found the machine only had £470. Lindop was suspended and later sacked, and subsequently admitted he used his friend as a reference. But he denied stealing and named other employees who could be responsible, which meant he was free to get another job, this time managing drink vending machines. Lindop stole £4785 from them over a four-month period between March and July 2012, the court was told. His barrister said that despite Lindop's history, he had been employed at Kellogg's as a £26,000 a year head chef for two years. Hunter Gray said: 'He is someone who has good qualifications and is good at his job but has resorted to this blatant theft and dishonesty. He is from a very good background and his parents are horrified. Work: He was taken on as manager of the Forum café in this shopping centre (above) in Wythenshawe in 2011. When the café decided to install a cashpoint machine to attract extra custom Lindop stole £63,380 from it . 'He points to his own difficulties in dealing with his sexuality throughout his 20s, becoming a person he didn't really like, lacking confidence, and he accepts he began to steal to fund a lifestyle he couldn't afford to surround himself with people who were better than him... 'Over the last two years he has finally opened up to who he is. He states his offending is behind him and how ashamed he is and deeply remorseful.' Sentencing, the judge Mr Recorder Mark Ainsworth said: 'It was two weeks after your sentence in Bristol that you put your name down with an employment agency in Manchester but failed to tell them, despite expressed requirements, that you had previous convictions. 'The degree of trust was significant.'","Stephen Lindop, 35, from Denton, Greater Manchester, stole cash from work .

"Coca-Cola is expected to launch a new green product in Australia, made from a naturally sweet plant, in a bid to target health conscious soft drink lovers. The new carbonated beverage provides a lower-calorie soft drink than Coca-Cola's traditional red can and has more natural ingredients than Diet Coke. But unlike Diet Coke, which is completely sugar free, Coke Life still has sugar. The new addition to Coke's range of 3,500 beverages, should also not be mistaken for Coke Zero, which is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men who don't like the word 'diet' and is meant to taste exactly the same as classic Coca-Cola. Scroll down for video . Rosie Huntington-Whiteley launched Coca-Cola Life - sweetened from natural sources with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - in London in September . Coke Life is roughly inbetween Diet Coke and classic Coca-Cola when it comes to calories – you will still find 27 in a can. However, it has 60 per cent less sugar than classic Coke because it uses the natural plant Stevia and sugar as sweeteners, rather than just sugar. Nutritionist Aloysa Hourigan from Nutrition Australia said that Stevia is not known to have any health risks but that doesn't necessarily mean it is healthy to drink Coke Life. 'Nutrition Australia would still say that while it's safe it's still encouraging people to want to eat sweets. 'The problem with all these artificial drinks is they still have high acidity levels and dental erosion. Coca-Cola Life (left) comes in a green can and has 60 per cent less sugar than regular Coca-Cola (right) Coca-Cola Life uses a mix of sugar and natural plant Stevia, which has been in Japan as a sweetener for over 30 years . Aspartame is a man-made sweetener used as a sugar substitute in some foods and beverages. The safety of aspartame has been the subject of several political and medical controversies. However, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in its 2013 re-evaluation that aspartame and its breakdown products are safe for human consumption at current levels of exposure. People with the genetic condition phenylketonuria are however told to avoid it. 'The other thing is there is some research that suggests that cola based colour drinks, whether sweetened naturally or artificially, are potentially impact negatively on insulin resistance meaning you are more likely to gain weight,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It is not proven or definite but there is some concern around it. No matter what, the best drink is water and that’s we’d still agree.' If you’re wondering what the need for another low-calorie Coke drink is, the global brand which is worth an estimated $74 billion US dollars reportedly wanted a product for the growing number of people who are worried about about artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, one of the most intensively scrutinised food additives. Aspartame is ingested every day by millions of people around the world in more than 6,000 well-known brands of food, drink and medicine. However, it has been the subject of a number of studies that appear to show harmful effects on human health. Coke Zero (left) is a low-calorie drink that is marketed at men because they are shown to associate 'diet' drinks with women. Unlike Diet Coke (right), which is completely sugar free, Coke Life still has sugar . One study linked diet drinks containing Aspartame to premature births, while another suggested it could cause cancer. However, in December 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) reviewed aspartame and confirmed it as safe, so Coca-Cola have continued to use it. Stevia is the name of the plant from which stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained. You can buy stevia in a powdered form as a sugar substitute that you can add to food and beverages at home – or you may find it in icecream, water-based beverages, brewed soft drinks, plain and flavoured soy beverages. It can be used in cooking and baking according to the Stevia Australia website, excepting that it does not caramelise like sugar. It has been used in Japan as the main sweetener for over 30 years and safety reviewed by both FSANZ and many other national food standard agencies in other countries e.g the EFSA and USFDA. FSANZ has concluded that the use of steviol glycosides at proposed levels does not raise any public health and safety concerns. Coca-Cola Life does not contain Aspartame so may be seen as healthier – but it does contain more sugar than Diet Coke. 'I guess with the other artificial sweeteners there is not a lot of evidence unless they are in very high doses that they are harmful. But because research hasn’t been done checking Stevia it seems to be quiet safe in those respects,’ Ms Hourigan said. Coke Life is meant to taste similar to classic Coca-Cola but some have noted a slightly aniseed taste to the beverage.

"One of Britain's most famous ships, the Cutty Sark, was damaged by a mystery fire for the second time in recent years. However, the historic vessel was saved from destruction by the rapid response of firefighters who had developed emergency contingency plans following a devastating blaze seven years ago. Scroll down for video . One of Britain's most famous ships, the Cutty Sark, was damaged by a mystery fire for the second time in recent years . Fire crews raced to the 19th Century clipper in Greenwich, south east London, yesterday morning after a blaze broke out below the deck. Flames damaged an area of the ship's hull, although a 'swift and pre-planned' response to the blaze meant firefighters were able to protect the national treasure. The ship, launched in 1869, suffered millions of pounds worth of damage when a huge blaze ripped through its wooden hull during a £25 million restoration project in 2007. Speaking at the scene last night, London Fire Brigade Station Commander George Vost said: 'The Brigade were called just before 7.30am by an automatic fire alarm system. 'Crews from Greenwich fire station responded quickly arriving on the scene within four minutes, at which point to officer in command called for assistance. The historic vessel was saved from destruction by the rapid response of firefighters . 'Within an hour a team of 20 firefighters had extinguished the blaze which damaged hull timbers.' He added: 'The crews worked swiftly to contain a fire which had broken out on level three, a floor below the top deck, which had started in one of the museum sections. 'Unfortunately a small area of the interior lining of the hull was damaged. We worked with the Cutty Sark conservation team to get the ship open to the public again at 10.30am, around half an hour after its scheduled opening time. 'We have our investigation team on site working with engineers from the ship. Having had a serious incident in the past there was a lot of pre-planning that goes into how we deal with situations like this. 'The Cutty Sark is an important part of the Greenwich Museum and they are very good with carrying out fire drills and fire safety checks.' Visitors were allowed into the ship while fire investigators inspected the ship's hull to establish the source of the blaze. Teams could be seen abseiling down the port side of the ship looking for clues from the outside as to why the latest incident occurred. Emergency services were called out to the fire in Greenwich at around 7.30am . Fire originally broke out on the Cutty Sark on May 21st, 2007, causing £10 million worth of damage. Luckily large sections of the ship, including the masts, saloon and deckhouses had been removed prior to the first blaze. By the time restoration was complete more than 90 per cent of the ship's original features were still intact and the attraction reopened to the public in April 2012. The cause of the first devastating blaze was blamed on an industrial vacuum cleaner which had been left on for days. Queuing to look around the boat this morning Egyptian tourist Mahmoud Zayed, 35, said: 'It's a good job this thing didn't go up in flames again. 'It's so beautiful and had so much history attached to it.' National Maritime Museum spokeswoman Sheryl Twigg said: 'At 7.21am this morning local fire crews responded rapidly to a fire alert on board Cutty Sark. 'This turned out to be a fire and the damage is very limited. The ship opened to the public half an hour later than normal. The cause of the fire is under investigation.'

"Councillor David Cussons who pressed the for button when he meant to vote against a 260 housing development . It was a simple but crucial action to determine if a quiet market town would be changed forever by an estate of 260 new homes. Just a push of a button on a motion he had proposed himself would register the strong opposition of councillor David Cussons. But he made a basic and far-reaching error, pressing the wrong button – ‘for’ instead of ‘against’. This left the vote tied and the chairman then used his casting vote to over-ride fierce local resistance and back the controversial scheme. Previously Mr Cussons, 75, had said the new homes on a field at Kirkbymoorside, North Yorkshire, would ‘stick out like a sore thumb’. News of the Tory district councillor’s blunder has infuriated residents as much as the housing development. Fellow councillor Sarah Ward said: ‘It is a scandal and the decision should not have been approved. ‘It calls the whole democratic process into question. It’s an absolute disgrace that these plans have gone through on the back of a human error. The residents are outraged.’ Town Mayor Chris Dowie said: ‘I’m furious that this application has gone through as a result of what would seem to be a mistake and that this beautiful part of Ryedale, just outside our town, is going to be built on.’ Frank Youren, 83, a retired electrical engineer who objected to the scheme, said he was ‘appalled’ at the councillor’s error on the  electronic voting system. ‘This is so clumsy,’ he said. ‘The future of this small town hangs on what he did. It’s going to be terrible. Anybody can make a mistake, but I am surprised it can’t be rectified.’ Another objector Anita Bartram said: ‘It’s disgraceful. He has been a councillor for many years. I am appalled by what’s happened and he has no excuses.’ Mr Cussons did not ask for the vote to be taken again during the meeting but apologised later. ‘I pressed the wrong button, that’s all that went wrong and I would rather it hadn’t happened,’ he said. ‘I am disappointed really, I am sorry that’s what happened.’ His blunder was raised at the planning meeting immediately after the result was announced. Chairman John Raper commented: ‘He has pressed the wrong button then.’ The planned controversial housing estate on a green site in Kirbymoorside North Yorkshire is now going ahead . In a major blow for campaigners who . believe the development is too big and out of place, Mr Raper added: . ‘That stands, that can’t be undone.’ Ryedale District Council received . more than 51 letters of objection from residents and the local town . council also wanted the housing estate to be blocked. The plans to . build 210 houses and 50 flats on a farmer’s field will drastically . increase the town’s population from its current figure of under 3,000. In . June, the same committee rejected a similar application from the same . company, Gladman Developments. However, the plans were revised to take . account of objections and this time planning officials had recommended . that councillors approve the venture. There are three buttons for councillors during meetings marked ‘for’, ‘against’ and ‘abstain’. Kirkbymoorside residents ptotest at the site where 260 new houses are planned . A spokesman for the district council said there were no written procedures covering  mistakes in using the system. He added that it would have been left to the chairman’s  discretion on how to respond to the error. ‘Members . were given training two years ago on how to use the system,’ said the . spokesman. ‘We have had no problems with the system to this date.’ After . winning backing for its plans for the homes estimated to have a sales . value of  £25-£50million, Gladman  confirmed that it will market the . scheme to builders. The firm said it was unlikely work will start before the middle of next year but declined to comment any further.","Ryedale District Councillor David Cussons said he had made 'a mistake'

"Its picture-perfect streets and houses made it the ideal setting as the fictional village of Downton. And the Cotswolds village of Bampton has enjoyed a surge in tourism thanks to its starring role in Downton Abbey. But residents are up in arms at the prospect of being overrun by more than the show’s devotees – thanks to a new housing development proposed under the Government’s planning regulations. The town has been overrun with admirers since Downton Abbey started filming there in 2010 . Plans for 280 new homes in the Cotswolds village of Bampton have left residents up in arms with claims the town cannot cope with as many new residents . Plans are in place for 280 new homes to be built. But opponents to the proposals say the town of 2,500 people cannot accommodate hundreds of new residents. The quaint location was chosen to be the fictitious village of Downton when filming for the period drama began in 2010. Since then, Bampton has enjoyed rocketing numbers of visitors, with devoted fans flocking to see where main characters Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley married. But critics say if the estates are approved, Bampton – which was chosen by Downton producers because it was well-preserved – will lose its charm. Trevor Milne-Day, chairman of the Society for the Protection of Bampton, told the Daily Telegraph that village life would be threatened by the new developments. ‘We are going to get lots of people living here who probably won’t work anywhere near here. Fans of the period drama have travelled to the rural town to visit churches and sites featured in the programme . Critics say if the estates are approved, Bampton, which was chosen by Downton producers because it was well-preserved, will lose its charm . ‘The feeling in the village is that quite often these new estates take an awfully long time to bed in and for people to get involved in village life.’ The planning application is for one estate of 127 houses and another of 160. Bampton parish council has come out against the smaller of the two proposals. Chairman Jackie Allinson said that such a large number of new homes would be disruptive for the village. She said new Government planning regulations mean the plans could be pushed through even if they were rejected by the local council. ‘We are understandably worried that if our local democracy supports us, it could be lost at a higher level,’ she added. Viewers of the costume drama will be familiar with the village where Anna and her husband Mr Bates moved when they married. Most of the programme is filmed in Highclere Castle, a manor house on a 5,000-acre estate in Berkshire. West Oxfordshire District Council will make a decision on the smaller of the applications before Christmas, and on the larger one in January. Mark Booty, a district councillor for Bampton, said: ‘The reality here is the National Planning Policy Framework sits in the background, saying, “if it’s sustainable you should allow it”, and the Government are saying, “build, build, build”. There’s going to be some very interesting discussion.’ Gladman Developments, the company behind the smaller housing scheme, declined to comment. The second developer, Richborough Estates, could not be contacted for a response.","Cotswolds village of Bampton has seen a surge in tourism thanks to period drama .

"The four police officers involved in the fatal pursuit of Brazilian student Roberto Curti in Sydney's CBD are seeking to permanently halt criminal proceedings against them.

In a hearing on Monday, Barrister Bret Walker SC told Downing Centre Local Court they were now making an application to stay the proceedings against them. The prosecution case against the four had been tainted by directed interviews which took place in the days after Mr Curti's death, Mr Walker said. During the interviews, officers were 'compelled' to answer questions by threat of disciplinary action and therefore their answers should not have been used against them. Instead, Mr Walker argued, the interviews became 'inextricably entangled' in the ensuing investigation of them. This meant the prosecution case was 'rooted in an eradicable error', he said.

"A crippling strike by Air France pilots continues despite company bosses offering to withdraw controversial plans to expand the low-cost Transavia brand in Europe. With the costly strike now in its 11th day, Air France-KLM has called on pilots to return to work 'immediately' in exchange for its offer as it attempts to bring an end to a labour dispute that has grounded around half of the airline’s fleet. But the pilots, who walked off the job to protest the expansion plans, have remained defiant and are making further demands. Grounded: Air France says it has cancelled hundreds of flights since the pilots' strike began . In a statement issued Thursday morning, SNPL, the main pilots' union, said the strike is being ‘maintained’ for the time being, although negotiations were scheduled to resume in the afternoon after they broke off overnight. The union said it had made further demands regarding workers' terms of employment under the no-frills Transavia brand within France, but that management had refused these. The striking pilots have said they also want Air France pay and conditions to be extended to Transavia France pilots. On strike: Air France pilots continued their job action even though the airline has offered to scrap the expansion . Air France has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights since the pilots began their strike on 15 September at a cost of £16 million a day. SNPL is accusing the airline of trying to move jobs to countries with lower taxes and cheaper labour, and they fear the expansion would erode their pay and conditions. Air France-KLM had planned to develop Transavia with hubs in France, the Netherlands and other parts of Europe to compete with budget airlines. It previously offered to delay the expansion until December in a bid to convince the pilots to return to work. But the pilots threatened to extend the strike ‘indefinitely’, prompting the latest offer from airline bosses. Big loss: The airline says it is losing up to £16m a day while the pilots protest Transavia's proposed expansion . Facing mounting political pressure to make concessions, Air France-KLM said it proposed the immediate withdrawal of Transavia Europe, insisting there would be no outsourcing. The statement said: ‘This proposition addresses the concerns of the social partners and brings a new guarantee that there will be no delocalisation (of jobs).’ Signed by Air France-KLM chief executive Alexandre de Juniac and Air France chief executive Frederic Gagey, the statement said there is ‘no longer any reason to strike.’ Meanwhile, Vereinigung Cockpit, the union representing Lufthansa pilots, has warned that they could also go on strike as talks over early retirement scheme stalled again Thursday. The union has already held four strikes this year and a fifth could deliver more misery for European travellers.","Pilots went on strike on 15 September over proposed Transavia expansion .

"Planes carrying hundreds of British holidaymakers came within 500ft of each other in a near-miss at Malaga Airport in southern Spain. Aviation authorities said the pilot of a Ryanair Boeing 737-800 from Leeds was forced to abort its landing and take evasive action at the last minute because a Glasgow-bound Jet2 plane - also a 737-800 - was still on the runway in front of it. Spain’s Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission (CIAIAC) has launched an investigation into the September 17 incident. The two planes were carrying a total of 363 passengers and crew. Scroll down for video . Boeing 737-800s operated by Ryanair and Jet2 were involved in a 'loss of separation' at Malaga Airport . According to a preliminary report, the planes experienced what is known as ‘a loss of separation’ at 1:20pm local time as the Ryanair flight was coming in for landing and the Jet 2 flight was taking off. The report said the Ryanair pilot was forced to take evasive action while the plane was almost on the threshold of the runway and the Jet2 flight was in its initial climb. Radar data suggest the Ryanair plane, carrying six crew and 167 passengers, overflew the Jet2 aircraft with a vertical separation of just 400 to 500ft and no horizontal distance shortly after the Jet2 plane became airborne with six crew and 184 passengers on board, according to the Aviation Herald. The incident occurred in the Mediterranean resort city over two weeks ago but wasn’t publicly reported until Friday when Spain’s civil aviation authority published a preliminary report on its website. Spain’s Civil Aviation Accident and Incident Investigation Commission has launched an investigation . A spokeswoman for Ryanair said there was no near-miss and insisted it was a routine ‘go-around’ flight procedure. The airline said in a statement: ‘This flight from Leeds to Malaga performed a routine go-around on approach into Malaga as the runway was occupied by another aircraft. ‘The go-around was uneventful and the aircraft landed safely shortly after. Ryanair will cooperate fully with the CIAIAC investigation into this matter.’ A Jet2 flight prepares for take-off at Malaga Airport in this file photo . In its report, the CIAIAC said: ‘The operations performed by each aircraft were hampered by being carried on the same runway heading.’ After the incident, both planes continued with their flight plan and landed safely. No injuries were reported and there was no damage to the aircraft. A final report containing all of the investigation’s findings will be published once the probe is complete.

"Actor Randy Quaid and his wife Evgenia are suing John Kerry and the State Department to recover passports that the government revoked three years ago. The State Department said it takes U.S. passports for reasons including issuance of a felony arrest warrant, fraud, failure to pay child support or a criminal court order barring departure from the country. Randy Quaid said the revocation involved an issue over 'an insurance policy that we did not take out,' but declined to discuss it further.

Quaid and his wife sued John Kerry and the State Department on Monday to recover passports that the government revoked three years ago . 'We can't go anywhere,' Quaid said. 'Randy can't take a film job,' said Evgenia Quaid. 'He had to turn down the Cannes Film Festival last year. We can't proceed with our life.' The Quaids have had a string of legal problems, including accusations of vandalism of a home they once owned and a California felony warrant issued over an unpaid hotel tab. The couple applied for refugee status in Canada in October 2010, saying they were being persecuted by a group of devious lawyers and agents bent on killing famous actors. The pair relocated north of the U.S. border at the time, jumping bail and skipping court dates in Santa Barbara, California, where they face felony and misdemeanor counts in connection with vandalizing a home they once owned. $500,000 bench warrants are still in effect for the couple in Santa Barbara.

"British shoppers have fallen out of love with the big name supermarkets, cutting their spending and switching to cheaper rivals, a new study reveals. Since the start of this year total spending in supermarkets has been flat, after a decade of rising prices fuelling strong growth. It comes as Tesco reported a catastrophic slump in pre-tax profits, down 91 per cent in six months, as large retailers struggle to compete with the emergence of discount stores like Aldi and Tesco. While the amount people in Britain buy has risen steadily this year, the quantity of goods bought in supermarkets has remained flat . The Office for National Statistics today published new research on spending in ‘‘non-specialised food stores’, which are dominated by supermarkets. It found that rapid growth in the amount shoppers spent in supermarkets over several years came to an abrupt halt at the end of 2013. Since then there has been almost no change in the amount of money rung through supermarket tills. By contrast, spending across the retails sector, covering every kind of shop, has risen steadily. The amount of shopping in the nation’s trolleys has also remained unchanged. Figures the quantity of supermarket purchases has been flat throughout the decade. Supermarkets have seen a greater increase in the amount spent, but a smaller one in quantity bought. However supermarket prices have actually fallen in 2014. The ONS said: ‘One cause of this may be increased price competition amongst supermarkets, caused by an increasing market share for discount supermarket chains and discounting. ‘Another suggested cause could be the falling cost of food production, resulting from falling wheat prices. ‘Regardless, it is clear that the change in pattern in supermarket spending reflects a clear change in pricing environment; demand has been essentially flat for significantly longer than spending.’ Total spending in supermarkets has also remained flat, as shoppers switch to cheaper alternatives . Millions of customers have switched to budget chains like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. Tesco, which was once king of the supermarkets, is now in crisis after failing to deliver on price, service or quality. Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent quit this morning after the most disastrous six months in the supermarket's 95-year history. Tesco in crisis: Chairman Richard Broadbent quit today after a disastrous drop in profits, being branded its worst results in its 95-year history . Britain's biggest retailer said its pre-tax profits in the six months to August have plunged 91.9 per cent to £112million, compared to £1.3billion a year earlier. However, other parts of the high street are also struggling. Latest retail figures released today show retail sales fell last month as unseasonably warm weather meant that shoppers delayed buying new coats and jumpers. Store sales volumes fell by 0.3 per cent in September compared to the month before, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The worst performers last month came from clothing, textile and footwear sales which fell 7.8 per cent compared to August, and 4.1 per cent over the year. But taken over a 12-month period sales volumes rose 2.7 per cent in September, the 18th consecutive month of year-on-year growth, the longest sustained period of expansion since May 2008. The ONS added that average store prices fell by 1.4 per cent compared to last year, the largest fall since July 2009. The biggest drivers were petrol price cuts, which were down 5.4 per cent over the year, while the ongoing supermarket price war saw prices fall 0.3 per cent, the biggest drop since December 2004. Overall retail sales volumes rose just 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter of the year, down markedly from growth of 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. Many economists believe that the moderation in consumer spending in the third quarter will contribute to a slowing in gross domestic product (GDP). IHS Global Insight chief UK economist Howard Archer said: ""It does look like consumers have reined in their spending to some degree after splashing out at a strong rate overall through the first half of the year. ""This is not that surprising given the overall pressure coming on consumers' purchasing power from prolonged very weak earnings growth.""","Total amount spent in supermarkets flat since the start of 2014 .

"A teacher at one of Britain’s top public schools has been arrested on suspicion of raping a former pupil. Dr Dean Johnson, a physics master at Charterhouse in Surrey, has been forced to leave the £31,680-a-year boarding school following the alleged incident. The divorced father-of-three,  who was educated at Oxford and Cambridge, was held by police on April 12. The letter sent to parents of children at Charterhouse School informing them about a teacher who had an inappropriate relationship with a former pupil . He has taught at the prestigious school for 12 years and was well-liked among students and teachers. The victim is understood to be a graduate in her 20s, who cannot be named for legal reasons. According to two former pupils who knew her, Dr Johnson and the girl had been involved in a secret relationship since her first year of sixth form – when she was 16. One of them, who didn’t wish to be identified, said: ‘She was quite quiet and was involved in societies he ran.’ Dr Johnson, 48, who specialises in astronomy and astrophysics, lived in a £500,000 house owned by the Godalming school. He also advertised his services as a private tutor outside of school hours. The master – who was known to staff and pupils as ‘Deano’ – would regularly stay after school hours with pupils from his school-house until 10pm, helping them with homework and after-school activities.His alleged victim was one of the pupils he would supervise. A letter from the headmaster of the school, Reverend John Witheridge, was sent to parents last weekend. The teacher has since resigned from his post at the exclusive Charterhouse School in Godalming . It read: ‘I write to inform you that Dr Dean Johnson (Physics) has resigned after the school was made aware of serious concerns about the existence of an inappropriate relationship with a former sixth-form girl. ‘I am sure you will understand that I am unable to go into any further detail.’ It continues: ‘If you have concerns, do please let me know, and I will do my best to answer them if I can.’ A school spokesman said it would be ‘improper’ to give any further comment. A police spokesman said: ‘A  48-year-old man is currently on conditional bail in relation to  an allegation of a serious  sexual offence at an address in Godalming.

"Chris Jordan is determined to be part of a much-improved England performance at the Premadasa Stadium as he continues his late surge into World Cup contention. Jordan was veering towards the periphery of the 15-man squad when he put in an alarmingly erratic display in England's warm-up victory over a Sri Lanka A team at the SSC ground last month. But since returning to the one-day international team in the five-wicket win at Hambantota, he has bowled all but one of his full quota in four matches - and taken two wickets on each occasion. Chris Jordan  runs into bowl during a nets session ahead of the seventh ODI . England (possible): AN Cook (Captain), MM Ali, JWA Taylor, JE Root, RS Bopara, EJG Morgan, JC Buttler (wkt), CR Woakes, CJ Jordan, JC Tredwell, ST Finn . Sri Lanka (possible): A Mathews (Captain), T Dilshan, M Jayawardene, K Sangakkara (wkt), D Chandimal, L Thirimanne, T Perera, J Mendis, S Senanayake, S Lakmal, L Sandakan . Umpires: R Tucker (Aus) and R Martinesz . Third umpire: B Oxenford (Aus) Match referee: D Boon (Aus) He has bowled much better lines and been a much more reliable option for captain Alastair Cook. Jordan's improvement has coincided with two wins and two losses on the way to series defeat after England were also beaten in his absence in the first two fixtures. From 4-2 down, they will therefore be playing for pride - in front of a significant travelling support - but also World Cup confidence, and in the hope of a badly-needed return to form for Cook at the top of the order, in Tuesday's seventh and final ODI. Jordan is frustrated by the scoreline but still believes England have much incentive to rouse themselves and reduce the deficit. 'It's a series we wanted to win, and we thought we had a really good chance of winning,' he said. Big-hitting batsman Alex Hales takes part in a fielding drill during a nets session . 'We're really close to putting together a full performance. 'Every time you put an England shirt on, you go out there to win a game for England. 'We have fans who've travelled a long way to see us perform, and we plan to put a really good show on for them.' Jordan admits, in a year containing 17 of his 18 ODI caps to date, he has lacked consistency. But the 26-year-old seamer has every right to think he may be on an upward curve at the right time, with England set to pick a tri-series - and unofficial World Cup - squad on Saturday. 'Because I set such high standards for myself, I think it's been a little bit up and down,' he said of his performances in 2014. England captain Alastair Cook speaks with coach Peter Moores during a nets session . 'At times, I haven't been as consistent as I'd like. But after the last four games especially, I'm happy I've been able to back up one performance with another one and then another. 'So I'm pretty happy with that progress.' His uncanny striking ability down the order has not been evident yet on this tour - but allied to his brilliant fielding, especially his slip catching, means he offers an all-round package to tempt the selectors. He said: 'I guess being a three-dimensional cricketer doesn't hurt. I think I've steadily improved. 'I've been working quite hard on my accuracy and consistency ... and also to keep my pace up, and think I've shown glimpses in the games.' Chris Jordan takes a break from training as he prepares for the seventh ODI . Jordan is hardly about to pre-empt the squad announcement, though. 'I guess that's a job for the selectors,' he added. 'All I can do is keep putting in my hard work in the nets and any opportunity I do get in games, and leave the rest up to them.' As for that shoddy first showing on this tour, he agrees 'rustiness' following the end of the English summer might have been a factor. He said: 'Also [I was working on] my plans to left-handers, getting my angles right from round the wicket and mixing up my pace....I'm just happy with the improvement I've made. Joe Root appeals during training and then playfights with James Taylor . 'On slow wickets, I guess I have the ability to extract a little bit more bounce. I find a knack to pick up wickets, even when I'm not quite bowling as well as I'd like. 'That's quite handy in one-day cricket, keep taking wickets and get two new batters at the crease. You can keep building pressure that way.' Kumar Sangakkara has been among his victims three times here - albeit most recently caught at cover off a short one after a match-winning 112 at Pallekele. But Jordan said: 'Even (then), it was worked to a plan - a change of pace after bowling a few quicker balls. 'It's a nice scalp to have a few times.' England are unlikely to make unenforced changes to their losing team in Colombo, but will be keeping an eye on the fitness of in-form batsman Joe Root - who appeared to be in discomfort at practice with tightness in his groin.","England are 4-2 down in the one-day series with Sri Lanka .

"Emmanuel Adebayor will not be rushed back for Tottenham Hotspur's Capital One Cup quarter-final tie with Newcastle United on Wednesday night. Adebayor has returned to training after a week's compassionate leave in Africa. The Togo striker was allowed to return home after he was embroiled in a family row. In November, Adebayor's older brother Kola claimed the player had been brainwashed by Islamic spiritual healers into thinking their mother used black magic to sabotage his form on the pitch. Emmanuel Adebayor will not be rushed back for Tottenham Hotspur against Newcastle United on Wednesday . The Togo striker was give a week of compassionate leave ahead of the Capital One Cup quarter-final . But even though he reported back on schedule on Monday morning, manager Mauricio Pochettino says that the best part of 72 hours will still not be enough to throw him straight back in. Adebayor has not played since November 7 due to an injury picked up on international duty which later ran into a virus. Despite the player now being fit, manager Pochettino said on Tuesday: 'He was back yesterday, but play tomorrow? No. 'He began training after one week yesterday so it would be impossible for him to be ready tomorrow.'

"Steve Smith wants to lead from the front as he takes over as Australia's Test captain in the absence of the injured Michael Clarke. The 25-year-old was on Monday promoted to the vice-captaincy, chosen ahead of the veteran Brad Haddin to lead the Aussies out against India in the second Test in Brisbane on Wednesday, with Cricket Australia indicating the decision was made with an eye on the future as Clarke's injury woes put his long-term status in doubt. Smith is the third youngest player in the squad to play at the Gabba and will be Australia's youngest captain since Kim Hughes in the 1970s, but he promised not to let the added responsibilities change the way he approaches the game.

The new Australia captain smiles as pace bowler Mitchell Johnson (right) limbers up . Smith in the nets with Josh Hazelwood, who was 12th man during the first Test . 'I think first and foremost I will try to lead from the front in terms of my performances,' he said. 'The on-field tactics, I think we've been pretty good this year, ""Pup"" (Clarke) has been amazing with that and what he's got going on. With the group we've got going forward I don't really feel there's any need for a big change there.' Smith, who made his Test debut as a spinner aged 20, was not even in the squad at the start of last year, but since coming back into the side he has established himself as one of the leading batsmen and his unbeaten innings of 162 and 52 in the 48-run victory over India in the first Test took his Test average to 46.03. 'It's obviously been a pretty whirlwind 18 months for me personally, and for the team as well,' Smith said. 'For this to come up so quickly, it's an amazing thrill. It's something that I've always dreamt of doing. To now have the opportunity to lead Australia in a Test match and the rest of this series, it's an amazing thrill.'

Johnson lifts weights on the outfield at the Gabba as Australia look to go 2-0 up in the series . Smith speaks to the media as he is announced as Australia's skipper for the series . Smith has captaincy experience with both New South Wales and the Sydney Sixers and is confident he can step up at Test level with the help of some of the senior players around him. 'When I'm just a player on the field I have my brain thinking as a captain all the time about the situation,' he said. 'Sometimes I throw thoughts over to Michael or Brad (Haddin). I have had the leadership experience with New South Wales and the Sixers and have been quite successful. It is a different kettle of fish with Australia but I'm looking forward to the challenge.' For now, Smith has only been confirmed as the Test captain for the three remaining Tests against India, but his appointment is a statement on the part of Cricket Australia. Haddin, 37, has served as Clarke's vice-captain and was the straightforward choice to step in when the 33-year-old Clarke suffered a fresh hamstring problem on the final day of the fifth Test, having captained the side for the remainder of the final day. Michael Clarke is congratulated by Smith - and the Australia captain is unsure if he will return from injury . Smith celebrates his century against India and pays tribute to the late Phillip Hughes . But with Clarke himself admitting that the latest blow, when added to his ongoing back problems, leaves his future in doubt, Cricket Australia felt it needed to address the question of his long-term successor. Pat Howard, Cricket Australia's head of team performance, said: 'This is a longer-term injury (for Clarke) and the panel have been very strong in showing their hand looking for a longer-term solution. 'The nature of Michael's injury - and we'll get a better prognosis in the next 24-48 hours - was a pretty big factor in making this decision.' Haddin, 37, will serve as Smith's vice-captain. Smith said: 'I'm extremely close to Brad and when I told him yesterday that (national selector Rod Marsh) called me, I think he knew what was going on. He's over the moon for me, he's proud as punch. 'I'm certainly going to look to Brad out there as Michael always does. He's a terrific team man and he's got a great cricket brain as well. He's certainly someone I can lean on out in the middle as well.'","Steve Smith, 25, will lead Australia in Test series against India .

"Matt Prior ponders the question of how he will remember his career if he is unable to recover from serious injury and play again at the highest level. ‘It’s been wonderful, the best of times to be an England cricketer, and the memories are very special,’ said the three-time Ashes winner. ‘Working hard, winning games and playing a fantastic brand of cricket. We had an unbelievable environment in the dressing room and it was just great fun. Matt Prior has become the co-founder of a professional cycling team during injury lay-off . ‘I remember us saying in 2009 that we wanted to create a club cricket spirit in our dressing room, a bit like playing with your mates on a Saturday. Only we just happened to be playing at Lord’s or Old Trafford. ‘It was a fantastic period that I look back on very fondly despite what has happened in the last year. If I don’t get back, and I’ve thought about that, then I can honestly say I’ve achieved most of my goals. Not all of them, but most. ‘Every day before play the coach or captain would say, “Let’s leave everything on the pitch”. And I’ve done that. I’ve run myself into the ground for my team and for my country and if I finish as a player now having done that I can feel quite proud, I think. I can live with that.’ We meet to discuss Prior’s new venture in a very different sporting world but it is impossible to escape his old life at the forefront of a golden period for English cricket which ended so spectacularly and so controversially this year. Prior has become the co-founder of a professional cycling team at the same time as he faces a very real battle to prolong a cricket career that saw him become one of England’s greatest keeper-batsmen and an integral team man. England wicketkeeper Prior faces a very real battle to prolong his cricket career . The last point is relevant, as are his comments about the ‘fantastic’ team environment, for Prior also unwittingly found himself at the centre of Kevin Pietersen’s bitter attack on the very foundations of what he was most proud of. No one is attacked as spitefully as Prior in Pietersen’s autobiography, where he was derided as the ‘Big Cheese’ and accused of being at the head of a bullying culture. Prior has not come to the hotel in London where we meet to talk about Pietersen but it is clear in his first big interview since publication of the book that rocked the English cricketing world that a figure who has always been respected for his selfless attitude feels wounded. ‘It was sad and it hurt,’ said Prior about his treatment in Pietersen’s book. ‘It was a tough time when it came out, for my family as well as me. But we’ve come through it and I’m proud of how I handled it. It’s now time to move on. ‘I know I said at the time that I wanted a right of reply but having had time to think about it I just want to forget it. It’s about doing what is right for the England team. And what’s right for the England team right now is for us all to get behind them in Sri Lanka and at the World Cup next year. Prior  was derided as the ‘Big Cheese’ in Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography . ‘We all should want to do anything we can to help them make England fans proud. That’s the important thing. I have moved on now. ‘I’m so excited with ONE Pro Cycling and I’m cracking on with my rehab. All my energy is going into those things. There’s a lot going on in my life and I want to look forward.’ It is ONE Pro Cycling that has helped him cope with an achilles injury that proved much more serious than first imagined when he withdrew from international cricket last summer in the aftermath of Pietersen’s bile which even included, among other things, an attack on his desire to take a bike on tour. In just three months, Prior, at 32, has helped set up the new professional team who will be competing at UCI continental level next year, two levels below the likes of Team Sky. Ultimately, he wants to take them to the world tour. ‘I got into cycling a number of years ago when my achilles first began to trouble me because I couldn’t run any more and as time went on I got more and more passionate about it,’ said Prior. ‘The cricket schedules are so crazy that you can’t think about anything else while you’re playing but suddenly I found myself out with an injury and time on my hands. ‘I’m really big on the team environment and the exciting thing for me is that it’s like, “Here you go, here’s your team, see what you can do with it”. Prior celebrating a 3-0 Ashes series win with captain Alastair Cook at The Oval in August last year . ‘What I want to do is provide the structure to allow these guys to succeed and achieve their ambitions. ‘I’m hugely involved, not just an ambassador, as co-founder and every decision that’s been made from the coach, to riders and even the equipment, I’ve had a hand in. That’s important.’ The whole project has taken three months from fanciful suggestion to reality even though the team will not be officially launched until February. It is a positive end to the most horrible of years for Prior. He was left out of the England team after the Ashes were lost in Perth, battled his way back when Alastair Cook wanted him by his side for the start of the new era but then had to concede defeat to injury after the low point of being beaten in the Lord’s Test by India. ‘It got to the point where I knew I was hurt and I couldn’t play any more, but it was a big decision to stop,’ said Prior. ‘The thing that hurt me was people saying I just carried on because I was scared of losing my place. ‘That definitely wasn’t the case. I’m not like that. The minute I got dropped from the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne, I grabbed Jonny Bairstow and went out and worked with him. That’s not me doing it for show or the cameras. I only carried on this summer because I thought I could help the team. ‘I knew I couldn’t carry on after Lord’s and one of the things that got to me most was hearing Cooky after that match saying, “We’re still backing Matt”. But I got to the point where I was spending more time with the physio than I was on the cricket pitch.’ The injury to his left achilles, which had clearly been affecting his mobility at Lord’s, had become acute. ‘The first thing I said to Ben Langley, the England physio, when I came round after my op was, “Will I play again?” He said, “I wouldn’t say you won’t but it’s a lot worse than we thought”. The 32-year-old does not want to give the impression he is giving up . ‘My left tendon was pretty much in two halves. I had a 3in tear a centimetre wide running down the achilles. It was a mess and they had to put the tendon back together. It was a big op.’ He is three months into a six-month rehabilitation that will make or break his hopes of a return to county, let alone international, cricket. ‘I will only know if I can do it again once I get back to playing cricket,’ says Prior. ‘Only when I’ve played three or four days back to back, keeping for a lot of overs, will I know. I don’t want to come back half the player I was. If I can do myself justice and play to 100 per cent of my capabilities then I’m in. ‘If I lose that yard that allows me to perform at the level I can perform at then I will only get frustrated with myself. I’d have to look at it if I didn’t get back to my old standards but, fingers crossed, hopefully that’s not the case. ‘The other option is playing only as a batsman, which is going through my mind, too, because I’m pretty certain I can get back to my level just batting. We will see. ‘The physicality of keeping is very demanding, particularly if you want to embrace that engine room mentality of leading the guys on the field. It’s hard work and physically demanding but that’s what a keeper has to do. That’s your role.’ He does not want to give the impression he is giving up. ‘I’m hugely ambitious to play for England again but it all depends on what level of fitness I can get back to. Playing for your country is the greatest honour and biggest achievement you can get. To stand in the Lord’s dressing room with your name on the honours board is a very special privilege, something you can’t forget as a player. ‘If somebody gave me that opportunity again I would bite their hand off.’ For now he is concentrating on his new team. ‘If you create an environment where people are happy in what they are doing then I believe that’s how to get the best out of sportsmen. It’s our responsibility to produce that for the guys. When you start off as a cricketer you want to play in the Ashes and the World Cup, that’s what drives you, and it’s no different to us. ‘We’re not saying, “We’re going to be unbelievable, we’re going to be the best”. But we do have goals, aspirations and ambitions. ‘The biggest thing in cycling is the Tour de France, so why wouldn’t we set out to get there one day?’ You would not put it past him.","Matt Prior was accused of being at the head of a bullying culture .

"Alastair Cook acknowledged his drop of man of the match Kumar Sangakkara was damaging as England lost the sixth one-day international against Sri Lanka in Pallekele. Sangakkara, dropped by Cook at mid off on 41, hit a run-a-ball 112 at the Pallekele International Stadium in his last one-day international on his home ground. It set up a 90-run success which consigns England to a series defeat with one match to play. Cook said afterwards on Sky Sports: 'It didn't help, me dropping ""Sanga"" on 40 was a really costly drop. Alastair Cook says his dropping of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara on 41 was a 'really costly drop' Cook takes the field for what would be a tough day at the office for the England captain in the sixth ODI . 'That was a really big catch to drop at that time because we'd built up quite a lot of pressure on them. 'It was probably a 260 (run) wicket and credit to him, he made us pay for that.' On his own struggle for form, Cook said: 'It's hard. You want to score runs and set the platform at the top of the order. I've done it before. 'We came here to try to make it three wins and didn't play well enough. Sri Lanka outplayed us today, in all forms.' England coach Peter Moores said: 'We felt we could draw the series level today but we've been outplayed in all departments. Sangakkara leaves the field in Kandy for the final time after spearheading Sri Lanka's 90-run ODI win . The keeper-batsman's team-mates ensure their veteran leads them off the field after clinching the series . 'We probably bowled our best up front. Towards the end our plans have to be a bit clearer, a bit simpler. Not just bowling yorkers but matching the ball you bowl to the field you've got, although the yorker is still a great ball if you bowl it well. 'We made some errors and didn't field as well as we could have.' On Cook's plight, he added: 'Everyone understands people struggle at times. It's tough on Alastair because he had the chance to take a catch and got out early. 'He's desperately trying to get himself some form and working very hard to do that. 'He's a very solid catcher - I'd have backed him nine times out of 10 to catch that. But confidence is a massive part of anyone's game. After putting down Sangakkara, who got 112, Cook was out LBW to Sachithra Senanayake for just one . 'He's our most successful Test match centurion and has had great success as a one-day player. He's in a tough patch at the moment but working hard to get out of it.' Sri Lanka captain Angelo Matthews said: 'It was a challenging wicket to bat on but 'Sanga' was amazing once again. 'Together with (Tillakaratne) Dilshan, they were brilliant and set the tone for us to launch at the end. 'The older he (Sangakkara) gets, the more runs he scores.' Sangakkara himself added: 'It's great to have grown up in Kandy and gone to school here ... to play one of my last games here is a special feeling.

"Mahela Jayawardene will say goodbye to supporters in Colombo by making sure he enjoys himself, as he always has on a cricket pitch. Jayawardene, one of the outstanding batsmen of his generation and alongside Kumar Sangakkara a pillar of Sri Lanka's middle and top order throughout his 17-year career, is to retire after this winter's World Cup. The 37-year-old's 434th one-day international, against England at the Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday, will be his last on home soil and in his native city. Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene (centre) plays a shot during the fourth one-day international against England . Jayawardene will make his 434th and final home one-day appearance for Sri Lanka in his native Colombo . Sangakkara, who may play on in Tests only after Sri Lanka's campaign in the global tournament in Australia and New Zealand, signed off in his final ODI on his home ground at Pallekele on Saturday with a match-winning century to seal the series against England. Jayawardene, of course, would love to follow suit. But most of all, he is determined to play the game as he always has - with style, and a smile on his face. Asked for his favourite recollections of an international career which has so far brought him more than 25,000 runs across the formats, he said: 'I think the best memories will be the fans, the music, the rhythm. 'I grew up with that, playing for my school, always had it when we played the big matches. 'To finish it off in that same rhythm, you can't ask for anything else.' Jayawardene believes the same joyful crowd involvement is the essence of his sport in his country. 'That's the uniqueness about Sri Lankan cricket. That is the flair we grew up playing with,' he said. 'That is what we've managed to improve on. We haven't gone away from that flair, just kept on improving it. Batsman Jayawardene has fired over 25,000 runs across all formats of cricket during his 17-year career . 'What we would like to leave for the next generation is that challenge to keep doing that.' Sri Lanka is a country of cricket enthusiasts, and for that he is forever grateful. 'The fans have been fantastic,' he said. 'We've probably got the best - they do criticise us, but it is with a good heart. 'They don't go overboard. They know it's just a game, and they keep turning up whether we do well or not, and they're always behind us. 'To say thank you tomorrow will be a great, great honour.' Sri Lanka have already clinched the series, after their 90-run win at the weekend gave them an unassailable 4-2 lead with just the final ODI to play. Sri Lanka have already won the seven game series as their 90-run win at the weekend gave them a 4-2 lead . Jayawardene prizes another victory above a farewell century. 'I just want to go out and enjoy myself. That's what I've done throughout my career, and it won't change just because I'm playing my last game (here),' he added. 'We have already wrapped up the series, so there is less pressure on all of us, but we want to finish on a high. 'It's important we keep winning ... a good habit to have.' His preference will be to open again, as he did two days ago, but he will be happy too if asked to drop down again into his more accustomed middle-order role. Wherever he bats, he will inevitably have to deal with heightened emotions. 'It probably will get to me at some point - I hope not during the game,' he said. Jayawardene (right) will bring his career to a close after Sri Lanka's campaign at the cricket World Cup . 'But having prepared for this, I think I know where I am mentally. 'When I retired from Test cricket, that game was very emotional for me - that last Test match. 'Knowing I still have the World Cup to play, I don't think this game will be that emotional. 'But playing in front of your home fans for the last time, there might be a bit.'","Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene is going to retire after the World Cup .

"His villainous arch-enemies may have tried to kill him off many times, but he always escaped to live another day. Now, 60 years after Commander Bond of the British Secret Service was introduced to the world in Ian Fleming’s superb thriller Casino Royale, he has been given yet another incarnation. This morning sees the publication of Solo, a new James Bond novel written by the Scots-born novelist William Boyd, the seventh author to have tried to bring Fleming’s spy back to life. But what is so extraordinary is that 61-year-old Boyd’s attempt is the first to have succeeded. Back to his best: Geoffrey Wansell praises William Boyd's new book Solo as a return to form for James Bond (portrayed here by Daniel Craig) after a string of 'second-raters' in the 007 series . It is not as if those who have previously recreated Fleming’s hero have been second-raters. The great Sir Kingsley Amis tried his hand. So did top U.S. thriller writer Jeffery Deaver, as well as one of our most brilliant novelists, Sebastian Faulks. But all of them failed in one way or another. Amis was too much of a fan, so his descriptions of Bond were gushing and too detailed. Deaver lacked the quintessential Englishness and lightness of touch to make 007 leap off the page. Sebastian Faulks, meanwhile, was too sensitive a writer for the macho world of Bond. In truth, producing a Bond sequel is one of the most daunting tasks any writer could ever undertake. Ian Fleming was a master craftsman who lived and breathed the world of Bond, and he was of a very different age. William Boyd launched his Bond novel in London on Wednesday, following in the footsteps of six other authors who have tried to bring Ian Fleming's iconic character back to life in print . A former naval intelligence officer and journalist, and the Eton-educated son of a Tory MP, Fleming died of heavy smoking and heavier drinking in 1964, four years before the current screen Bond, Daniel Craig, was even born. With his licence to kill, 007 became one of the true British icons not only of the Sixties, but of all time — despite, or perhaps because of, the fact he was so politically incorrect, so shamelessly attracted to beautiful women and so insistent on his endless martinis (shaken, not stirred). But William Boyd brings back the real Bond, triumphantly. His first masterstroke was to set his story in 1969, giving Bond an age of 45, and allowing himself a rich palette of history and emotions to work with, for Bond was born in 1924 and served in the D-Day landings in 1944 as a young Lieutenant in 30 Assault Unit. Flying high: The new Bond novel Solo was jetted to seven countries around the globe - Amsterdam, Edinburgh, Zurich, Los Angeles, Delhi, Cape Town, and Sydney - ahead of its release on Thursday . Boyd cleverly pays tribute to Fleming by setting the story in an age when the spying game was full of flamboyance and style, and before John Le Carre and his fictional British spy Smiley made the world of espionage so comparatively grey and murky. In his new novel, Boyd gives Bond the task of single-handedly stopping a bitter and tribal civil war in the fictional oil-rich West African state  of Zanzarim. This reflects the author’s own long-term fascination with that continent, which is clear for all to see in his first novel, A Good Man In Africa, published in 1981. The civil war does come to an end, but not so much as a result of Bond as the stain of political corruption that seeps through Boyd’s dark story. Boyd is not afraid to make Bond as politically incorrect as Fleming created him. He remembers that 007 made his first appearance as a hard-smoking gambler getting up from the roulette table in a French casino, a ruthless man who liked nothing more than to take a risk and trust his luck. The James Bond in Solo harks back to the hard-drinking, heavy-smoking spy Ian Fleming (pictured) first introduced to readers in 1953's Casino Royale . Nor does he shy away from Bond’s ruthless streak. After all, Fleming described Bond in the very first chapter of Casino Royale as a man unafraid of violence, whose features ‘relapsed into a taciturn mask, ironical, brutal, and cold’ as he fell asleep with his hand resting on the butt of a ‘.38 Colt Police Positive revolver with a sawn barrel’ beneath his pillow. Intent on revenge for what went on in Zanzarim in his new novel, Boyd’s Bond is every bit as calculating. He goes shopping for guns in Washington D.C. and buys himself not only a Beretta M1951 — ‘third series with the smaller sights’ — which takes eight rounds of ‘9mm Parabellum’ bullets, but also a ‘Frankel and Kleist S1962’ assault rifle complete with ‘Single shot, bolt action. Point five zero calibre bullet’. Boyd is equally robust when it comes to women. He clearly remembers that when Fleming’s Bond first meets the delectable Vesper Lynd in Casino Royale, 007 noticed that ‘her medium-length dress was of grey soie sauvage with a square-cut bodice, lasciviously tight across her fine breasts’. In Solo, Boyd’s Bond first encounters the heroine Bryce Fitzjohn in The Dorchester hotel, London: ‘The zip on the front of her outfit — her catsuit — was like a provocation, a challenge, crying out to be pulled down,’ writes Boyd. ‘Bond smiled to himself as he imagined doing precisely that and drank more coffee — there was life in the old dog yet’. These may not be politically correct thoughts, but they are an authentic part of the personality of Fleming’s James Bond, a man driven by a fierce desire to take revenge for the treachery that always seems to surround him. Treachery is one of Fleming’s favourite themes — and one which Boyd returns to in Solo. The familiar figures of M, Miss Moneypenny and Q — who is younger, but equally eccentric — appear but Boyd also takes care to pay homage to Fleming’s villains and their vicious assistants. He has created a mysterious multi-millionaire, Hulbert Linck, who may be Swedish, German or Dutch. Linck relies on the help of the brutal Jakob Breed, who trained with the Rhodesian Light Infantry in Matabeleland in 1966. Jeffery Deaver (left) and Sebastian Faulks (right) have both published books in the James Bond series . Both are as unscrupulous and psychopathic as Fleming’s Dr Julius No, Auric Goldfinger or Ernst Stavro Blofeld, not to mention Oddjob, Jaws or Rosa Klebb, and — like every great fictional villain — contrive to make the story itself stronger, and the suspense even greater. In Solo, Boyd even leaves open the possibility that the horrifying Breed may have survived to haunt him in the future. To bring a much-loved character back to life in this way is a formidable literary achievement. It takes a deep understanding of the original character. It means adapting that character for our modern, politically-correct age but at the same time retaining its essential personality: the way Boyd’s Bond shamelessly eyes up women, harks back to a chauvinist English class system, and smokes and drinks as if such vices were going out of fashion — remains utterly credible. It also requires an ability to mix homage to another author with your own creative voice, and many writers find this balancing act incredibly difficult. Swinging '60s: Solo is set in the 1960s, the same era Sean Connery (pictured) first brought the secret agent to life on the big screen . Who, for example, would want to be in crime writer Sophie Hannah’s shoes? She has just agreed to write a new Hercule Poirot story based on Agatha Christie’s Belgian detective, who died in the novel Curtain, published in 1975. Will she chose to bring him back to life? Will she bring him up to date? These are momentous decisions she has to make. William Boyd’s decision to place his Bond firmly in 1969, with references to contemporary films, ‘Afro’ haircuts and flared jeans, finds 007 in a world in which he is not so much out of place as just slightly old-fashioned, with his love of Savile Row suits and hand-made cigarettes. It succeeds wonderfully. Boyd’s achievement in matching Fleming is all the more remarkable because it reminds us vividly how fine a writer Fleming was. Raymond Chandler was a tremendous fan; John Betjeman insisted that he had ‘discovered the secret of narrative art . . . the reader has to go on reading; and one magazine called him a ‘kind of supersonic John Buchan’ while another added that he was ‘the best new thriller writer since (Eric) Ambler’. More than 100 million Bond books have been sold in the past six decades, and William Boyd’s new one will add considerably to that total, for he has kept the legend alive while not tarnishing it, nor diminishing it for a single moment. Bond is most certainly back between hard covers, with a vengeance.","William Boyd's new book Solo features a heavy-smoking, hard-drinking James Bond set in the Sixties .

"Tax cuts for millions of families could be implemented long before the deficit is eradicated, David Cameron said yesterday. The Prime Minister said we could benefit from slashed taxes much sooner than 2018, when Britain is due to balance its books. He said there was no reason for public finances to be back in the black before a Tory government starts to lift the tax burden on hard-working families. It raises the prospect of the tax cuts coming in as early as 2016 – the first Budget after the General Election. The PM has suggested that tax cuts could be delivered sooner rather than later, saying that with a clear plan ‘you don’t have to wait until Britain is back in the black before you make progress with these reductions' It comes after he electrified the Tory conference on Wednesday with a dramatic pledge to raise the 40p income tax threshold from £41,900 to £50,000 by 2020. Thousands of extra workers, including teachers and police officers, have been dragged into the band in recent years. Yesterday he said he had ‘no plans to raise VAT’ but did not rule out further savings from the defence budget after the next spending review in 2016. He also promised to raise the personal allowance to £12,500 if his party wins a second term in office to give a £500-a-year boost to those on low incomes. It had been thought that the changes would not come in until Chancellor George Osborne eliminates the deficit, which he says he is on course to do by 2018/19. But, on a trip to Afghanistan yesterday, Mr Cameron suggested the threshold increases could start much sooner than had been expected. David Cameron talks to Royal Air Force firefighters in Camp Bastion, Helmand Province, during his trip to Afghanistan . Mr Cameron said that the current parliament had shown that the Government could make £100billion of cuts while also raising the income tax threshold at a cost of £9billion . It was thought that the tax cuts, which will cost £7.2billion a year, would be delivered towards the end of the next parliament, as another £25billion of cuts are needed to balance the books. But speaking about the issue for the first time since his conference speech, Mr Cameron said they could be delivered sooner rather than later. The current parliament, he said, had shown that the Government could make £100billion of cuts while also raising the income tax threshold at a cost of £9billion. He said: ‘I think we have shown in the last parliament that it’s perfectly possible – if you manage the nation’s finances wisely – to deliver tax reductions at the same time as making savings and efficiencies. In the last parliament we had to make something like £100billion of cuts but also actually made tax cuts in terms of the personal allowance. ‘So in a parliament when we have to make further spending reductions – but not as much as in this parliament – I think it’s perfectly possible to achieve the sort of tax reductions we have set out. Attack: George Osborne yesterday . George Osborne yesterday warned that British politics had returned to a battle between the statist Left and the free market Right not seen since the days of the Berlin Wall. He urged bosses to stick up for the market – and warned that many pressure groups, charities and trade unions would be quick to put the anti-business point of view. He said in a speech to the Institute of Directors: ‘You have to get out there and put the business argument.’ ‘Because there are plenty of pressure groups, plenty of trade unions and plenty of charities that will put the counter view. There is a big argument about our future, about whether we are a country that is for business, for enterprise, for the free market. Mr Osborne added: ‘For the first time since my adult life, that is up for grabs. That issue felt it had been resolved when the Berlin Wall fell. ‘It doesn’t mean you have to endorse a party, a party like the Conservatives, but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument… that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise, low-tax economy which delivers prosperity for generations to come.’ TUC leader Frances O’Grady, said the Chancellor had ‘let down his guard to show how he agrees with Margaret Thatcher’s “enemy within” rhetoric’. ‘As long as you have got a clear plan and a clear pathway, you don’t have to wait until Britain is back in the black before you make progress with these reductions.’ Mr Cameron would not be drawn on which departments would face the greatest reductions in their budgets, although he has already promised to protect spending on the health service for the next five years. ‘In terms of defence and other budgets, we have made some commitments on defence and to the defence equipment programme but greater details will be set out at the next election,’ he said. All Nato countries have pledged to spend 2 per cent of their GDP on defence, and Britain is currently meeting this target. But analysis by senior military personnel leaked to the media this summer warned it would drop below this threshold in 2017.","Speaking in Afghanistan, PM suggested tax cuts could come as early as 2016 .

"Nick Easter  has joined a growing chorus of high-profile stars to raise concerns about professional rugby’s ‘gym-monkey’ culture at academy level amid fears careers will be cut short by increasingly brutal collisions. The 36-year-old Harlequins No 8, who only turned fully professional 11 seasons ago and was not involved in academy rugby, believes the size of youngsters entering the sport now is cause for serious concern. A Mail on Sunday investigation earlier this year found the England Under 18 side that played Wales last season was heavier man-for-man than Will Carling’s 1991 senior England side that reached the World Cup final. Nick Easter charges into the Leinster defence during his side's 14-13 loss at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday . Easter makes the hard yards against Argentina during England's World Cup pool match in Dunedin in 2011 . Easter (left) gets to grips with France No 8 Imanol Harinorduquy during the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal . Easter (right) offloads to Paul Sackey during England's 2011 World Cup final defeat to South Africa in Paris . ‘If I’d been playing high-level club and international rugby at 20 or 21 in an attritional position like No 8 I’m not so sure my body is in the same condition it is now. That is the fear for a lot of the youngsters coming through now. They are two or three stone heavier per man than England Under 18 sides of the past and yet they are running at higher collision speeds now. ‘It might be a good thing that they are doing all their weights and are on the protein shakes building their muscles up but there are other areas of your body that probably aren’t fully developed and are taking a lot of hits. There might be a few repercussions as far as that is concerned in years to come.’ The remarkable increase in the size of schoolboy players has coincided with an unprecedented period of success for the England Under 18 side which has yet to be translated into the senior team. A Mail on Sunday investigation earlier this year found the England Under 18 side that played Wales last season was heavier man-for-man than Will Carling (above) and his 1991 senior England side . Easter is not the first senior professional player to claim the next generation of players are focusing too much on weight training and not enough on skills, with former England lock Simon Shaw first raising concerns back in 2009. But those concerns appear to have fallen on deaf ears. ‘Someone like Billy Vunipola is naturally a big bloke but the guys who naturally aren’t that big are potentially a worry,’ Easter added. ‘You see a lot of the tall and lithe back rows and second rows who are told to bulk up. You see it when they have a shoulder injury or an upper body injury because they completely lose their mass. You think “Oh my God, that’s probably what they are naturally like”. Former England lock Simon Shaw raised concerns about the size of modern rugby players back in 2009 . ‘When they are training they all look pretty much the same but some guys are naturally quite big and can put up with punishment but others find it harder to keep the weight on. Their bodies are not meant for that punishment.’ Last week RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie admitted to serious concerns about the number of positive doping tests returned in junior rugby in recent times while insisting the professional game is too tightly monitored for a doping culture to exist. Another England star who did not go down the academy path, Ben Morgan, agrees the sheer size of young players is a worry. Veteran Wasps fly half Andy Goode believes there is too much of an emphasis on weight training . ‘Not everyone goes the conventional route of academies,’ Morgan told The Mail on Sunday. ‘I’m happy with the way it’s gone. You see a lot of people who have been in the system for a long time and that sort of training routine leaves their bodies getting smashed.’ Wasps fly-half Andy Goode, 34, believes the emphasis on weight training among the next generation of English-qualified players is bound to have a detrimental effect on the national team. ‘We seem to have gone away as a culture from kids playing enough rugby to trying to make them big in the gym,’ Goode said. ‘Now it seems to be about how much you can lift rather than developing kids with skill. ‘That’s the big difference between us and the southern hemisphere.’ England number eight Ben Morgan (centre) agrees the sheer size of young players is a worry .","Mail on Sunday investigation reveals massive increase in size of players .

"Glasgow Warriors head coach Gregor Townsend admitted too many handling errors cost his side as they lost 12-9 to Toulouse in Pool Four of the European Champions Cup. The game came down to penalties, with Toulouse scrum-half Nicolas Bezy booting two in the first half and two more after the break. Finn Russell was not so clinical for Glasgow, spurning a pair of decent chances — and it took a pair of late penalties from replacement Duncan Weir to make it a tense finish. Toulouse scrum-half Nicolas Bezy kicked all his sides points in their narrow 12-9 victory over Glasgow . Townsend said: ‘The effort was there in a game that never really kicked off. However a mixture of the quality of the opposition, their excellent defence and our errors, particularly handling, left us just short.’ Toulouse are clear at the top of the pool, with Glasgow battling Bath for second spot. ‘We have to win the last two games to qualify — that is the challenge ahead,’ added Townsend.

"Harlequins stay top of Pool 2 despite this narrow defeat but have Leinster for company now after this thrilling battle in a freezing Dublin. Mike Brown and Danny Care inspired a stirring second-half fightback from Quins, who came from 11-3 down to lead 13-11 with little over 10 minutes to play. An Ian Madigan penalty proved decisive in the end, with the match marred by a late punch-up and a somewhat strange yellow card for Charlie Matthews, for bringing his hand close to the eyes of Dominic Ryan during the scuffle, despite officials saying they were not sure he was eye-gouging. Leinster scrum half Isaac Boss dives over for the home side's opening try at Aviva Stadium . Harlequins and England number nine Danny Care eyes up a gap during a tight first half in Dublin . Leinster inside centre Ian Madigan fires out a pass as Harlequins centre Matt Hooper looks to make a tackle . Quins host Wasps in round five in January and a win there will take them close to the knockout stages, since their final pool match is against hapless Castres. They will rue a disallowed try and six points spurned by rookie kicker Tim Swiel. Making only his fifth senior appearance for Harlequins, Swiel badly mishit a second-minute penalty. That brought the first roars from Leinster supporters but the visitors steamed into the contest. Quins took two quick lineouts inside the first five minutes, determined to keep the ball in play and run the legs off the three-time champions on their home pitch. Harlequins full back Mike Brown makes a strong carry into the Leinster defence . Madigan eventually kicked Leinster in front after 25 minutes but they kept applying pressure like a tourniquet and were rewarded with a try — only their fourth in Europe this season – when Isaac Boss slid over in the 32nd minute. A quick pick-up from Jamie Heaslip off an attacking scrum close to the Quins line allowed him to pop a pass to Boss, who had an unimpeded dart to the line. Madigan missed the conversion but, within two minutes, Swiel spurned another easy chance to open the Harlequins account. Having to start without former All Black Nick Evans in the No 10 shirt looked as damaging as losing Chris Robshaw given their team-mates’ failure to string together coherent attacks in the first half. Leinster lock Devin Toner is stopped in his tracks by the twin tackle of Will Collier (left) and George Lowe . In Care and Brown, though, Conor O’Shea had two proven Test-quality backs in his arsenal and they combined for a marvellous try two minutes after the restart, Care’s delicate chip behind the Leinster defence caught by the on-rushing Brown. But incredibly, referee Romain Poite judged that Harlequins had knocked on earlier in the move, despite video evidence suggesting the ball had been touched by a Leinster hand. Harlequins refused to feel downhearted and won a thumping scrum penalty in the 46th minute, with Swiel finally landing a kick at goal. Harlequins veteran Nick Easter carries into the Leinster defence as Jimmy Gopperth (right) watches on . Quins minced their opponents with two huge scrums and from the second they won a penalty to set in train the move that ended with a legitimate Brown try, with Swiel converting. The Leinster cause was further weakened by a silly penalty given away by Leinster lock Devin Toner for tackling Clifford without the ball. Swiel swept over the line to score and put his team ahead with 15 minutes remaining. Leinster survived a 25-metre scrum in the 70th minute and broke quickly forward, the attack ending with Harlequins going offside and a penalty scored by Madigan to nose Leinster back ahead. Then came the scuffle but, more importantly, Leinster won the penalty and somehow held on.","Ian Madigan kicks three crucial penalties for Leinster .

"Dodging Bullets landed a ninth Grade One 888sport Tingle Creek Chase for trainer Paul Nicholls at Sandown as Sam Twiston-Davies drove the six-year-old to a two-and-a-half-length success from Somersby. But the race was marred by death of Nicky Henderson’s Oscar Whisky who had to be put down after breaking a hind leg when falling at the sixth fence. The winner of 16 of his 28 races and over £500,000, Oscar Whisky had not matched the high expectations of him over fences but only because of the level he had set over hurdles where his achievements included a third to Hurricane Fly in the 2011 Champion Hurdle and two wins in the Grade One Aintree Hurdle. Dodging Bullets races clear to win the Tingle Creek Chase with Sam Twiston-Davies on board . Henderson had otherwise enjoyed a rewarding afternoon with three winners - Caracci Apache, Cup Final and Snake Eyes – at Sandown and Dawalan at Aintree. But the day belonged to Nicholls, who completed a Grade One double having landed the Henry VIII Novices’ Chase with Noel Fehily-ridden Vibrato Valtat while also training Tingle Creek Chase third Hinterland. Dodging Bullets is 14-1 for the Betway Champion Chase at Cheltenham in March. The six-year-old clears the last as he went on to win by two and a half lengths from Somersby . Nicholls said: ‘He is getting stronger and better. We'll get him at his best at Cheltenham and he should be there with a chance.’ Amateur rider Sam Waley-Cohen continued his fine Aintree record with a win in the Becher Chase on Oscar Time, trained by his father Robert. There was also a sad twist to this race, Irish runner Balbriggan fatally breaking a leg while galloping after the ninth fence.","Sam Twiston-Davies rides Dodging bullets to win ahead of Somersby .

"Rory McIlroy's fine form this year has seen his online popularity surpass three of the biggest global brands who sponsor him, a study has shown. McIlroy ended an 18-month barren spell by winning the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth earlier this year and back-to-back major victories at the Open Championship and US PGA Championship took him back to world number one. All that, coupled with a successful Ryder Cup defence by the European team and a host of individual accolades, have taken his online brand reputation past Nike, Bose and Omega, according to data analytics company Adoreboard. Rory McIlroy's success in 2014 has left the Irishman more popular than his sponsors online . The Irishman poses with the European tour championship trophy after the final round in Dubai . The tech firm, based at Queen's University, Belfast, analyses online emotion to determine how brands are rated by the public in an index rating called Adorescore, which varies between minus 100 to 100. Just over a week ago, with the clock ticking down to this Sunday's BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards - at which McIlroy is a top contender alongside Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, the 25-year-old achieved an Adorescore of 51. That put him five points beyond sound system manufacturers Bose and Swiss watchmaker Omega, while Nike was languishing seven points behind the golfer who agreed a multi-million pound deal to endorse its clubs last year. Results also showed that he had 40 times more mentions in online news than Nike and 60 times more than Bose. McIlroy celebrates winning the BMW PGA Championships, a win that sparked success in two majors . The world No 1 was also part of the victorious European Ryder Cup team . Data scientists at Adoreboard monitored mentions of McIlroy across online news, blogs and social media such as Twitter and Facebook between November 27 and December 3 to get a snapshot of how he compared to the big firms. But in total they spent six months monitoring McIlroy's general progress during a year of many peaks and few troughs. They started in May, just after he cancelled his engagement to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, when his popularity had dipped. Another time when a drop was noted in McIlroy's online popularity was after he fell out of contention at the Scottish Open in early July. McIlroy's popularity dipped after his split from tennis star fiancee Caroline Wozniacki . McIlroy is expected to compete with Lewis Hamilton for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award . However, his Open triumph at the Royal Liverpool in Hoylake a week later, followed by the PGA win at Valhalla, soon saw admiration for him sky-rocket. Dr Fergal Monaghan, Adoreboard's chief technology officer, said: 'Even during times of frustration at the time of the Scottish Open when his Adorescore plummeted, just six days later the dominant emotion expressed is amazement because of his performance at the Open (Championship). 'A well-timed Nike advert also helped put his brand perception back on track.'","Rory McIlroy's popularity has grown in 2014 - where he won the BMW PGA Championship, The Open, US PGA Championships and the Ryder Cup .

"Clare Balding will be presenting from just the Cheltenham Festival and Royal Ascot after agreeing new two-year deal with Channel 4 . Clare Balding will present only the Cheltenham Festival and Royal Ascot for Channel 4 Racing in 2015. The BAFTA-award winning presenter has agreed a new two-year deal with the channel, but while she will be anchoring the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games and continuing her hosting of Crufts for the next two years, her racing coverage has been scaled down to just the nine days of Cheltenham and Ascot, meaning she will miss the Grand National and the Derby at Epsom.

"The son of IAAF president Lamine Diack has stepped down from his activities with athletics' world governing body pending an investigation into allegations of a cover-up of systematic doping in Russia. Papa Massata Diack, who works for the IAAF as a marketing consultant, joins Valentin Balakhnichev, the president of the Russian athletics federation and the IAAF's treasurer, in agreeing to step down. IAAF legal adviser Habib Cisse has also taken similar action, sources have confirmed to Press Association Sport, after German television station ARD broadcast three documentaries alleging that the IAAF officials were implicated in covering up the doping in Russia. IAAF president Lamine Diack's son has agreed to step down pending an investigation . The IAAF said in a statement: 'The IAAF appreciates the gesture of council member Valentin Balakhnichev, who has been the subject of recent media allegations, who has voluntarily decided to cease exercising his duties as IAAF treasurer and council member until the independent IAAF ethics commission's ongoing investigation has concluded. 'IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack has also written to the IAAF confirming that he will suspend his activities on behalf of the IAAF until the commission has delivered its final report.' The move comes after the IAAF's executive board met on Wednesday - the governing body's ethics committee is investigating the allegations. The latest programme by ARD involved a list of 150 athletes from 2006-2008 named as having suspicious blood results - including three Britons, one of whom was high-profile. The TV channel alleged the IAAF did not follow up the suspicious results by target-testing the athletes involved. The controversy is now set to play an interesting role in the election to succeed Lamine Diack next August. Sebastian Coe, the double Olympic 1500 metres champion and chairman of the British Olympic Association, is running for the presidency and is expected to be challenged by his fellow IAAF vice-president Sergei Bubka, from Ukraine. Coe, who is understood to have been supportive of the decision for the officials to step down from their IAAF activities pending the investigation, has been a vociferous opponent of doping. Sebastian Coe believes athletics' reputation is damaged by doping case involving a small number of countries . His manifesto calls for the IAAF's doping unit to be completely independent of the governing body - something that is likely to gain support following the latest allegations. Bubka, too, issued a statement earlier this week calling for an investigation. Balakhnichev told Russia's TASS news agency he and the federation had been subjected to 'brutal persecution' by the allegations. ARD reported that three-time Chicago Marathon winner Liliya Shobukhova paid 450,000 euros to the Russian athletics federation to avoid a doping ban - she was eventually banned for doping and she said some of the money was refunded. ARD claimed it had evidence linking the 300,000 euro refund to Balakhnichev and that the Singapore-based company that allegedly made the payment was owned by a business partner of Papa Massata Diack. The French sports daily L'Equipe has also raised questions about meetings in Moscow hotels in 2011 between Balakhnichev, Cisse and Papa Massata Diack. Balakhnichev, who has branded the claims 'a pack of lies', told TASS he had written to the IAAF president offering to 'temporarily cease to work as treasurer and as a member of the council'. Lamine Diack on Wednesday also described as 'ridiculous' a report that his son appeared to request a payment of 5million US dollars during Doha's failed bid for the 2017 World Championships. Dick Pound, the former president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has lambasted the IAAF for not acting on allegations of systematic Russian doping . The Guardian has reported Papa Massata Diack, who holds the organisation's marketing rights for a number of countries including Qatar, sent an email in 2011 asking for the payment. The Qatar Athletics Federation told the Guardian it did not recognise the emails and had complied with all regulations. Lamine Diack said in L'Equipe: 'The Guardian said my son had tapped up Qatar for 5million dollars for me to say we can hold the championships in September. That's very overpriced - and it's ridiculous because I had always answered 'yes' to this question anyway.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Papa Massata Diack, the son of IAAF president Lamine Diack, has stepped down from his activities with athletics' world governing body .

"Paula Radcliffe has revealed she did not know whom to trust during the difficult times in her career. The women's marathon world record holder said she often felt lonely when she was recovering from injury. The 40-year-old said she discovered whom she could rely on in the wake of the Athens Olympics in 2004. She had been expected to win gold in Greece, but, affected by injury and illness, ended up dropping out of the race and sitting on the curb in floods of tears. Paula Radcliffe (right) on her way to a third place finish in the Worcester City 10k run in September . 'You can feel as though there's not that many people who really understand the situation,' Radcliffe said in an interview with the BBC. 'After Athens was probably a difficult time because then it was really knowing who you could talk to and open up to and that's when you really learn who your best friends are and who the people who really you can just open up to (are) and they're not going to go to any media or abuse that trust. 'You're able to share your inner thoughts, inner concerns and inner worries with them. I was really lucky with Gary (her husband) and with my family and coach around me that I had those people that I could just turn to and open up to. 'That's when you really do appreciate that because I think it can be a very lonely place, not so much when things are going well, but when you hit difficulties and you're still at peak performance, in that position where people think, 'They don't need anybody, they don't need advice, they don't need help'. But actually you do and you don't always know where to turn to.' Radcliffe sits on the curb after pulling out of the women's marathon at the Athens Olympics in 2004 . Radcliffe revealed her loneliest time in the sport came in 2003 when she suffered a shin injury in the wake of her marathon world record. 'When you're injured is probably a time when you do feel lonely in being alone with the injury and with the thoughts, wanting to be back running, be healthy again, but not being able to get there,' she said. 'Probably the worst time for that would have been in 2003 when I'd set the world record in London. When I tried to get back into training I had quite a serious shin injury inflammation that just kept dragging on. 'I basically ended up sitting for about nine weeks in Limerick in a flat there in between getting treatment and literally just icing and icing and icing and trying to get it better and it just kept coming back with the inflammation at the end of every day. That was a pretty lonely frustrating time.'

"Manchester United will rely on homegrown talent as they begin their 2014-15 FA Youth Cup campaign with a tie against Bury at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. United are due to field a side in which all but three of the squad have been with the club since the age of seven. The exceptions are defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah, who came from Ajax, Tyler Reid, formerly of Arsenal, and goalkeeper Dean Henderson from Carlisle United. Charlie Scott will be part of a Manchester United squad packed with homegrown talent . Joe Riley will be hoping to feature during United's 2014-15 FA Youth Cup campaign . The line-up will be similar to the one that drew 0-0 with neighbours Liverpool in the U18 League at Altrincham earlier this month. Coach Paul McGuinness said: ‘We’ve got younger players coming up and it’s only going to improve them. We played three or four schoolboys at Liverpool early in the season and it was a shock to the system because they weren’t quite ready for it. ‘Now they’ve had a few games, they are more experienced and we hoped it would be a different story in the home match with Liverpool. Certainly, they’ve improved a lot and I think this team will continue to improve.’ McGuinness spoke to Manutd.com about why he has such affinity with the FA Youth Cup. The U18s coach was in charge of the 2011 side that lifted the trophy and his father, former United player and manager Wilf, won the competition in 1954, 1955 and 1956 and captained the side in the third of those seasons. In total, he played 27 ties and is one of only five players to have earned three winners’ medals. ‘The competition means a lot to me,’ said Paul. I grew up with my dad telling me how he won FA Youth Cups with the Busby Babes. He played more FA Youth Cup games than anybody else - there were only a few of them who played in all the fixtures - and he’s got that record so I grew up with all of that. Dean Henderson is one of just three players not to have come through United's academy . ‘I wanted to play in the FA Youth Cup myself but I only had a brief substitute appearance when I was playing here [against Barnsley in 1984]. I was still at school at the time. ‘In my time as a coach, it’s been great as well. I can honestly say, while the goal is to win the FA Youth Cup of course, it is not the biggest thing. It’s the experience the players gain from having a run in the competition. ‘The year we got to the final when Danny Welbeck was in the team as a schoolboy, the experience he gained there stood him in good stead playing for United and England at the top level. I know that run helped him go such a long way. Axel Tuanzebe in action during United's Under 18 fixture against Liverpool earlier this month . ‘It’s more what the FA Youth Cup can do itself in preparing players for bigger challenges with competitive football and a simulation of first-team football. If you get to the end of it, you deal with big crowds and extra pressure. The most important thing about it is to win it and it’s a massive bonus as it really helps you but it’s the process along the way. ‘You can see them develop in front of your own eyes if they get through each round. The problem can easily be when you go out as it’s a cup competition and you can lose in the first round. Then you miss that opportunity. ‘We’re making some progress by playing matches at Altrincham this season and we need to simulate that kind of game whether we’re in the FA Youth Cup or not. But, in English football, the FA Youth Cup is still one of the most special tournaments to play in. Paul McGuinness is mobbed by his players after winning the FA Youth cup final in 2011 . ‘A number of them are ready to make quite a bit of a breakthrough and it would definitely help to have a little run in the FA Youth Cup.’ Ro-Shaun Williams missed the draw with Liverpool due to injury, with Timothy Fosu-Mensah dropping into defence, while Demetri Mitchell remains sidelined. The cup tie is also live on MUTV as United strive to win the competition for the first time since 2011.

"Liverpool's Under 18 side safely booked their place in their fourth round of the FA Youth Cup after two early goals were enough to hand them victory against Bradford City on Monday night. While the senior side wasted a host of opportunities to score against Manchester United on Sunday, the youngsters showed a far more clinical side to their game at Langtree Park - taking the lead inside just two minutes.

"Gus Poyet will ditch Sunderland’s policy of signing players en masse as he bids to bring in the ‘quality’ which will bump them up the Match of the Day running order. The Black Cats have made 18 permanent signings in the last 18 months – the bulk of which came under the disastrous tenure of Paolo Di Canio – but only six of those remain part of the first-team picture. In addition, loan arrivals such as Sebastian Coates and Ricky Alvarez have failed to impact and it has instead been long-serving players such as John O’ Shea, Lee Cattermole, Seb Larsson and Connor Wickham who have kept the team clear of danger. Gus Poyet (above) has hinted at a change in Sunderland's policy of signing new players . But with five goalless draws already this season – the most in the Premier League – Poyet concedes that he needs to add some attacking flair come January. When asked about the run of appearing at the tail end of Match of the Day, he said: ‘Not in a million years would I be happy going out in each game to earn a point. ‘We need to win. We need to score, we need to play better, we need to be more clinical and create more chances.’ In order to achieve that, Poyet is targeting offensive additions in the New Year, with former loanee Fabio Borini again on the radar amid his struggle for first-team football at Liverpool. Loan arrivals Sebastian Coates (left) and Ricky Alvarez have had little impact since joining the club . Former Sunderland loanee Fabio Borini (left) is back on Poyet's radar . The Uruguayan – whose 14th-placed side entertain West Ham, in fourth, on Saturday afternoon - added: ‘It's quality or nothing, not quantity. Quantity at this club is finished. ‘We're not signing quantity any more. I don't want any more, “maybe if in three months’ time (they will come good)”. There were too many of those in the last three years and in the end the team suffers. You can't progress with too many changes. ‘The more players we bring in to certain positions, the better and easier it will be for me. We're not playing even 50 per cent of the way I want.’ Meanwhile, Poyet will come up against son Diego for the first time at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. The 19-year-old signed for the Hammers from Charlton during the summer and has been involved with Sam Allardyce’s senior side this season. Poyet will come up against his son Diego for the first time when West Ham visit the Stadium of Light . Poyet, though, has cut all contact to his boy for fear of compromising his loyalty. ‘I'm trying to stay away from him so there's no misunderstandings or any kind of doubts,’ he said. ‘It's not nice but it's only for a few days, it's not like I'm not going to talk to him anymore. ‘I think it's better not to call him or for him to call me. I think it's clear that it would have been uncomfortable for him as well, even a joke can be taken the wrong way. ‘Maybe he could read something into me asking a harmless question like “what have you done today?”. ‘Today, I don't care how he does, I don't care. We say in Spanish there are no friends on the pitch and no family ties either. I don't care.

"Transsexual Ashlyn Parram, 16, who was told he could not sit his exams unless he wore a boy's uniform, pictured with his mother Miranda . A transgender pupil has used equality laws to force his headmaster to allow him to sit a GCSE exam wearing a skirt. Ashlyn Parram, 16, who was born a boy but is undergoing gender reassignment treatment, said that at first he was told he could not sit the paper because he was not wearing boys’ uniform. But he said headmaster Chris Walls backed down after he showed him a copy of the Equality Act 2010, which stated he had to be treated the same as other pupils. Ashlyn, who was wearing make-up and hair extensions as well as a girl’s uniform, claimed, however, that when he returned to the sports hall for the GCSE maths paper he was segregated from other pupils. He was put at the back of the room 40ft from everyone else. Ashlyn, who used to be called Lewis, said: ‘The whole way through the exam I felt like bursting into tears, and it was around 15 minutes before I even started the exam because I was so upset.’ He claims to have been victimised several times at Giles Academy in Boston, Lincolnshire. The teenager, who has now left the school and is hoping to go to college to study maths, said: ‘They made me feel like a freak. It’s sad that people can’t be more open-minded.’ His mother, IT worker Miranda Johnson, 42, lodged a complaint. It was investigated by the chairman of governors, Frank Pickett, and dismissed. In a letter, he said all the allegations had been rejected. Ashlyn’s mother said: ‘We don’t want a penny of compensation. It’s not about the money – it’s about protecting other children and educating people. ‘To be made to sit on your own during an exam is horrendous. If Ashlyn had been black or disabled there would have been uproar.’ Ashlyn announced he was gay at 11 but later realised he was a girl trapped in a boy’s body. Doctors and social services referred him to specialists, who diagnosed gender dysphoria. He is now on a waiting list to start hormone treatment. From the age of 18 he will be eligible for full sex-change surgery. The first clash with the school happened earlier this year when Ashlyn was told to take swimming lessons with boys despite feeling uncomfortable about it. His family said that, in the end, sympathetic staff quietly let him skip classes. Ashlyn, now aged 16 wearing girls' clothes and hair extensions, left, and when he was 11 ready for his first day of school dressed as a boy, pictured right . Later a female teacher mimicked a ‘slutty’ walk in front of laughing pupils, pretending to be Ashlyn. Giles Academy confirmed that the teacher had been spoken to about how to ‘conduct herself in future’. Ashlyn – who lives with his mother, brother, sister and stepfather, a partner in a firm of surveyors – made his first appearance in a girl’s uniform on June 1. It was a plain clothes day and other children turned up in outlandish and ripped outfits. Ashlyn said he was banned from going outside at breaktime because he was ‘ruining the school’s reputation’. The exam incident happened ten days later. The Equality Act protects transsexuals from discrimination and harassment in a range of situations, including ‘by a teacher at school’. A school spokesman said: ‘Every time we get a complaint we will deal with it in a professional way.’","Ashlyn Parram diagnosed with gender dysphoria and on a waiting list for hormone treatment .

"Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from an entertaining weekend of Premier League and Football League fixtures. 1. Mauricio Pochettino wants his Tottenham team to defend from the front and both Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen are getting the message. The two young forwards scored a goal each in the 2-1 win at Swansea but it was their work rate that helped make sure Spurs survived a furious second half onslaught. Kane and Eriksen both ran 8.2 miles in the 90 minutes – putting them jointly into second place behind Hull's George Boyd for the furthest distance covered by any Premier League player this season. Tottenham's Harry Kane (left) ran 8.2 miles as his side defeated Swansea 2-1 on Sunday afternoon . Spurs star Christian Eriksen (centre) covered the same amount of ground as Kane at the Liberty Stadium . 2. Raheem Sterling missing a couple of gilt-edged chances at Old Trafford might be a sign that he's suffering from carrying the weight of Liverpool's attacking hopes without Luis Suarez or Daniel Sturridge. The England winger celebrated his 20th birthday only last week but is being asked to do a more experienced player's job. Amid all the chopping and changing by Brendan Rodgers in search of a winning formula, Sterling has missed only one game, and only twice has he not been in the starting XI. Since the start of the World Cup he has now started 24 matches, only one less than he did in the whole of the last domestic season. Raheem Sterling endured a difficult game as Liverpool went down 3-0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford . 3. Paul Lambert is trying to change Aston Villa's game plan to a more patient possession style – keeper Brad Guzan was passing goal kicks to his full backs Alan Hutton and Aly Cissokho standing near the corner flags. The new tactics are a work in progress as the 1-0 defeat by West Brom proved – but it did mean that even with 10 men, Villa hit more passes (438) than they've managed in all but two of their previous Premier League away games this season. Aston Villa attempted more passes against West Brom than in all but two of their away games this season . 4. Even after scoring 22 goals last season Arsenal fans remain divided about Olivier Giroud's quality, but his strike rate this injury-hit year tells its own story. Two goals against Newcastle took him to five for the season in all competitions from just 460 minutes on the pitch – a goal every 92 minutes. New hero Alexis Sanchez has needed 136 minutes each for the 13 he has scored. Olivier Giroud scored twice in Arsenal's 4-1 win against Newcastle to continue his fine form in front of goal . 5. Burnley goalscorer Ashley Barnes had to wait for his Premier League chance but the 25-year-old is making the most of it now. The 1-0 win over Southampton was his seventh start and Sean Dyche's side have taken 12 points from those games. The forward who began his career playing part-time football for Paulton Rovers near his Bath home is making a difference with his work rate – he was involved in 24 duels for the ball against Saints, the second highest of any player in Saturday's top flight games. Burnley striker Ashley Barnes celebrates after scoring his side's winner against Southampton at Turf Moor . 6. Kevin Nolan's days as a West Ham regular looked numbered with the 32-year-old club captain left on the bench for six weeks after recovering from injury. But Andy Carroll's return to fitness has given him a new lease of life – the 1-1 draw at Sunderland was his third start in a row. Re-uniting Nolan and Carroll has also helped Stewart Downing get more chance to be effective – between them they found the England winger 13 times with passes. West Ham skipper Kevin Nolan (right) has found a new lease of life with Andy Carroll back in the starting XI . 7. It could be a long January for Crystal Palace when Yannick Bolasie is away at the Africa Cup of Nations with the Democratic Republic of Congo. The 25-year-old winger's tricks and flicks have an end product – the 63 crosses he has now put over is getting on for twice that of any other Selhurst Park player. He's fourth in the Premier League charts for most crosses – three ahead of Manchester United's Angel di Maria. (Southampton's Dusan Tadic is top by a distance with 114). Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie has delivered 63 crosses this season - the fourth highest of any player . 8. Just when things were settling down at Cardiff, owner Vincent Tan is heading for another fall-out with the club's supporters. The Malaysian billionaire, who changed the club's shirt from blue to red, has now sanctioned a new away kit in all white with red trimmings. They wore it for the first time in the 5-3 defeat at Bournemouth, with the rather spurious claim that it was because they thought their normal blue change gear would clash with red and black stripes. But the suspicion among die-hard fans is that superstitious Tan, who believes red is a lucky colour, will now have the opportunity to consign the colour blue to the club's history books. Cardiff's Craig Noone (right) helped debut his side's controversial new white and red kit against Bournemouth . 9. Teenage sensation Matt Grimes is not letting his forthcoming £1.75million move to Swansea stop him performing at the top of his game for Exeter. The 19-year-old, whose pay packet will jump from £500 to £10,000 per week when he joins the Swans in January, could have hid against Carlisle to make sure injury didn't wreck his big move. Instead he made one goal and scored the other as the Grecians won 2-0 to move into the League Two play-off places. Exeter youngster Matt Grimes, pictured in action earlier this season, is set to join Swansea in January . 10. Former Ipswich defender Tony Humes is facing his first big crisis since starting his management career in charge of Colchester after watching his team ship four goals at home to Rochdale. The 48-year-old, whose previous coaching experience was all with the club's youth system, has to find a way to pick up a side who let in six at MK Dons the week before. He's not helped himself by publicly questioning the commitment of his players.

"Newcastle United look set to be without Mehdi Abeid for the majority of January after the midfielder was called into Algeria's squad for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations. The 22-year-old is currently out injured after breaking his toe while on international duty last month and is a doubt for the Magpies this week. He could miss Newcastle's Capital One Cup quarter-final at White Hart Lane against Spurs on Wednesday and the Tyne-Wear derby against Sunderland at St James' Park on Sunday through injury. Mehdi Abeid (left) has been selected in Algeria's 2015 Africa Cup of Nations squad . The Newcastle United midfielder (right) could miss as many as five games for the Magpies . January 17 - Southampton (H) January 24 - FA Cup fourth round (tbc) January 31 - Hull City (A) February 7 - Stoke City (H) February 10 - Crystal Palace (A) But it seems certain Abeid will not feature throughout the majority of January after being named as the only uncapped player in Algeria's 23-man squad for the tournament. Depending on how well Algeria do in the tournament, Abeid could miss between one and five games for the Magpies. The midfielder only broke into Alan Pardew's first-team side earlier this season but after a series of magnificent displays - including a stellar performance against Manchester City at the Etihad in Newcastle's 2-0 victory at the end of October - he has become an integral part of the Magpies' midfield. Abeid has established himself in the Newcastle first team although he is currently out injured . But injury has restricted Abeid to just three Premier League appearances in all. Tottenham Hotspur's Nabil Bentaleb and Leicester City's Riyad Mahrez are the only other Premier League-based players in Algeria's squad for the tournament in Equatorial Guinea, although Watford's Adle Guedioura is on the reserve list. Algeria face South Africa, Ghana and Senegal in their group. The tournament begins on January 17 and the final takes place on February 8 . Goalkeepers: Rais Mbolhi (Philadelphia Union,), Doukha Izzeddine (JS Kabylie) Mohamed Lamine Zemmamouche (USM Alger). Defenders: Essaid Belkalem (Trabzonspor), Madjid Bougherra (Fujaira), Faouzi Ghoualm (Napoli), Rafik Halliche (SC Qatar), Aissa Mandi (Stade Reims), Carl Medjani (Trabzonspor), Djamel Mesbah (Sampdoria, Italy), Mehdi Zeffane (Lyon) Midfielders: Nabil Bentaleb (Tottenham Hotspur), Yacine Brahimi (Porto), Medhi Lacen (Getafe), Saphir Taider (Sassuolo), Mehdi Abeid (Newcastle United), Foued Kadir (Real Betis) Forwards: Abdelmoumene Djabou (Club Africain), Sofiane Feghouli (Valencia), Riyad Mahrez (Leicester City), Islam Slimani (Sporting Lisbon), Hilal Soudani (Dinamo Zagreb), Ishak Belfodil (Parma) Reserves: Liassine Cadamuro (Osasuna), Adlene Guedioura  (Watford), Mehdi Mostefa (Lorient), Walid Mesloub (Lorient), Ryad Boudebouz (Bastia), Ahmed Kashi (Metz), Baghdad Bounedjah (Etoile du Sahel)","Mehdi Abeid selected in Algeria's 23-man Africa Cup of Nations squad .

"Sunderland boss Gus Poyet has warned his players to beware the unique threat of a resurgent Andy Carroll when the Black Cats take on high-flying West Ham United at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Former Newcastle United star Carroll grabbed two goals as the Hammers soared to their current fourth place in the Barclays Premier League table with a 3-1 win over Swansea on Sunday. And despite his side succeeding in shutting out both Chelsea and Liverpool in recent weeks, Poyet knows they will have to be fully focused to prevent more goals from the 6ft 4ins front man. Sunderland boss Gus Poyet believes the Black Cats must be wary of Hammers striker Andy Carroll . Black Cats boss Poyet thinks Carroll offers a 'special' and 'different' challenge to his players . Poyet said: 'Andy is special and different and I don't think you can find another one of him in the game right now. 'The adrenaline of being out for a while has brought him back at the highest level you can have and you need to be able to deal with that. 'It's a difficult game and we haven't had that kind of challenge yet of a player like Carroll, so the goalkeeper and the centre-halves and everyone else are going to have a difficult afternoon.' Having come through a gruelling period relatively unscathed - Sergio Aguero's mauling apart - Poyet has now switched his attention to his side's festive programme as he looks to build towards a repeat of last year's end-of-season form. West Ham are flying as  Carroll (left) celebrates scoring their second goal against Swansea City . Connor Wickham has signed a new contract to keep him at the Stadium of Light until 2019 . Fast-upcoming games against Newcastle United, Hull City and Aston Villa appear to represent more opportunity to turn a recent glut of four draws from their last five games into much-needed wins. Poyet added: 'The challenge is to win as many of the next four games as possible. We are not looking to have four draws and if they are normal games without any accidents we need to win. 'We are going to play the four to win and then the season will be totally different. Winning games puts you in a different situation - it brings your confidence back. 'Last year we started getting better during this time and we had a very good run of results and took it into January, so we are looking at this period in a very special manner.' Sam Allardyce has steered West Ham to fourth in the Premier League after 15 games . Poyet is set to recall Steven Fletcher to his starting line-up after the striker was an unused substitute at Anfield following a slight knock which forced him off against Manchester City. Sebastian Coates is available again after missing the game against his parent club but is likely to have to settle for a place on the bench, while Emanuele Giaccherini and Billy Jones are both still injured. Poyet was buoyed this week by Connor Wickham's decision to sign a new four-and-a-half year contract, adding: 'I'm very pleased because it wasn't easy. 'The time was great for us and Connor to get to know each other better and show what he's capable of. There are not too many young English centre-forwards free so it was important for us to tie down Connor for another four-plus years.' Former Barcelona man Alex Song has brought a touch of class to the West Ham midfield . Diafra Sakho came off the bench to fire West Ham into a 3-1 lead at Upton Park on Sunday .","Sunderland host West Ham United at Stadium of Light on Saturday .
