"England's World Cup winning captain Bobby Moore has been brought back onto the pitch by the creators of FIFA 15's Ultimate Team Legends, with the game providing a fascinating breakdown of the defender's attributes and how he compares with today's players. Moore is widely regarded as the finest player to wear an England shirt and EA, the makers of Ultimate Team, show that Moore would undoubtedly be worth, and would have earned, millions if he was playing today. His defensive capabilities make him a mix of Giorgio Chiellini, a World Cup winner with Italy, Gerard Pique and Thiago Silva but Moore's ball control, passing ability and balance match him with the best midfielders in the game, such as Frank Lampard, Paul Pogba and Andrea Pirlo. Captain Bobby Moore (centre) holding the World Cup after England's victory in 1966 at Wembley . Moore, pictured in West Ham colours (left), has been created in FIFA 15's Ultimate Team (right) Moore's attributes in the game rank him alongside some of the best present day players . And it is Lampard, alongside his father Frank Lampard Snr, a team-mate of Moore's at West Ham who played twice for England, who led the tributes to the man who is synonymous with English football. 'I remember stories from my Dad telling me 'this is the type of player you want to be, but also more than that this is the type of man you want to be',' Lampard Jnr said. 'If you were to put Bobby in any era, in the era he played or moving up to the era now with (Lionel) Messi and (Cristiano) Ronaldo, with his quality across the board, he would be able to deal with all of them.' The game rates Moore's reactions on par with Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, at 89. But Lampard Snr revealed that the one chink in Moore's otherwise gleaming armoury was his pace, but his instinctive reading of the game meant that his speed was seldom exposed. 'He wasn’t the quickest around, but I think a lot of his ability was in his head,' Lampard Snr recalled. 'He used to read everything before anybody else. He was there before it happened basically. You don’t coach that, you’re born with it, but he used it very well.' Frank Lampard Snr (second left) was a team-mate of Moore's (centre) at West Ham . Frank Lampard Jnr played for England 106 times, two appearances less than Moore did . Moore (right) poses with Brazil captain Carlos Alberto (left) before England faced Brazil in the 1970 World Cup . Moore's eye for an interception is rated at 91, the same as Paris Saint-Germain's Silva, while his strength in the air is 82, level with Pique. A rating of 89 for marking places him alongside Chiellini. But it's Moore's ability in possession of the ball that is something which places him outside of his 22-year career span from 1956-78. Contemporary defenders are expected to be comfortable with the ball at their feet, bringing play out from defence and entwining phases of play from the back into midfield. With ratings of 82 for both short passing and ball control equalling Paul Pogba and Lampard Jnr respectively, as well as 81 for balance matching Andrea Pirlo, Moore was clearly not just comfortable with playing out from the back, he was very good at it, too. Moore's rating of 89 for marking is the same as Juventus and Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini (right) Moore also has a rating for passing of 82 (left) which is the same as Paul Pogba (left) of Juventus . Midfielder Lampard (left) has the same ball control rating as England legend Moore at 82 . Moore's reaction are rated at 89, the same as Bayern Munich and Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer . Ironically, for a man that is emblematic of football in England, it is a style that is not immediately associated with English play. 'If you give a ball away Bobby would never moan at you, he'd just give you a look, a look that said 'we don't do that here, we have to keep the ball',' Lampard Snr said. 'He won the World Cup and he led by example on the pitch. He played so many games for England at the standard that he played at, he is the greatest captain England ever had and England ever will have.' Moore played 108 times for England, as well as making 544 appearances for West Ham. He passed away in 1993 at the age of 51 to bowel cancer.

"Downing Street faces more flak over company tax arrangements after it emerged that a major Government contractor is funnelling profits into an offshore haven. Telereal Trillium has a £3.2 billion contract to manage buildings such as job centres for the Department for Work and Pensions. It also manages property used by the DVLA. While the company paid full UK corporation tax last year, it funnelled £163 million of its post-tax profits in the form of share dividends into a parent company based in the British Virgin Islands where there  is a zero rate of income and corporation tax. The company funnelled £163million of its post-tax profits to the British Virgin Islands where there is a zero rate of income tax and corporation tax . Since 2010, the Trillium group has given £673 million in share payments to its offshore owner. Last year’s financial accounts reveal that the company has links to a secretive arrangement of shell companies, the very structure that David Cameron has described as ‘shadowy’ and has vowed to eradicate. Last night Ian Austin, the Shadow Minister for Work and Pensions, said: ‘People will be staggered to learn that a company paid by the Government ploughs its profits through a well-known tax haven.’ And Richard Murphy, director of Tax Research UK, said:  ‘The Government says it is committed to transparency. That means it should only buy from companies in places where we can find out who the real owners are, which you can’t in the British Virgin Islands.’ Ian Austen, the Shadow Minister for Work and Pensions, said that people will be 'staggered' to learn the news . The Prime Minister yesterday met leaders from Crown Dependencies, including  the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, who agreed to an ‘automatic exchange’ deal for tax information. A spokesman for Telereal Trillium said: ‘The Department for Work and Pensions and DVLA are aware of our structure, and these are very long-standing clients.’ The Department for Work and Pensions declined to comment.","Telereal Trillium has a £3.2 billion contract to manage Government buildings .

"Louis van Gaal is on the verge of being able to send out his dream starting XI for Manchester United, after putting an almost completely fit side through training on Friday morning. And, with the United manager insisting results prove his team is currently the best in the Premier League, that spells trouble for sides hoping to pip the Reds to a Champions League spot. United have lost just one of their last 19 games in all competitions, reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and drastically improving their chances of a top-four finish. Angel di Maria and Wayne Rooney sprint during training as Louis van Gaal had the opportunity to pick from an almost completely fit squad . Robin van Persie (second left) returned to the squad after missing United's unconvincing FA Cup win against Preston last week . Van Gaal says United are the best team in the Premier League on current form after a run that has seen them lose once since early November . Antonio Valencia (right) and Ashley Young (centre) laugh as they run alongside Radamel Falcao with Wayne Rooney watching on . Van Persie holds his arms aloft during Friday's training session as United prepared to exact revenge for their defeat to Swansea at Old Trafford . On Saturday they visit Swansea - who ruined van Gaal's debut as United manager by winning 2-1 at Old Trafford on the opening day of the season. But with van Gaal denied just one injured first team star at the Liberty Stadium tomorrow, the Dutchman knows he is on the brink of having a full-strength squad for the closing stages of the campaign. Van Gaal said: 'We are very close to that stage. In the first four months I started only to select from out of the fit players. 'And, as you know, I always had 10 or 11 players injured. 'Now, the last month, I only have one or two players and now only Michael Carrick is injured so that's a big difference. 'That's also because of the way of training, also the players had to adapt to the way of training, and now that's complete. That's the big difference with the beginning of the season.' Rooney watches his strike partner Van Persie go for a sprint, as the pair prepare for the possibility of playing together up front again . Rooney and Angel di Maria looked focused but relaxed as they trained ahead of the trip to Swansea on Friday morning . Marouane Fellaini walks out to train alongside Spanish goalkeeper David de Gea, who appears to be feeling the cold in Manchester . Victor Valdes looks through the net as he continues to wait for his first taste of first team football since joining from Barcelona . Manchester United, with their stars now fit, have lost just once in the last 19 games in all competitions, and are sitting third in the league . With the likes of Rooney and Falcao fit, Van Gaal has competition for places in forward positions with his star-studded squad . Midfielder Michael Carrick is the only member of the United squad who is currently unavailable for Van Gaal to select against Swansea . It is a far cry from the opening day of the season, when Manchester United lost 2-1 to Swansea at Old Trafford . Van Gaal can't watch as United lost in his first game in charge, but insists the side are better now, with their spirit and quality shining through . United's team look on in disbelief during that August defeat, but they have since become a tough team to beat in the Premier League . Van Gaal has had his critics in his first season in charge of the club but has nevertheless presided over a remarkable upturn in fortunes. And he believes that his first team players have now got over the difficulties of transitioning to a new management style and have bought into his footballing philosophy. Van Gaal said: 'Now I believe every player knows the philosophy of me and my staff. 'You can see that in the team spirit of the team, it's unbelievable. The likes of Angel di Maria and Falcao have arrived at Old Trafford since the opening day defeat and United's squad is now packed with quality . Van Gaal insists the players have now taken on his philosophy, and are playing with confidence in their climb up the league . 'The confidence is the same now as then because we had just come back from the United States where we had won everything against big clubs. 'But now, when you look at the scores of the last 15 or 20 matches, we are the best team in the Premier League so I think the confidence is also high. 'The difference with the beginning of the season is my players know and have experienced much more playing in our system with our philosophy.' Van Gaal has to decide whether to recall Robin van Persie for the trip to Swansea at the expense of Radamel Falcao although he has the option of using Marouane Fellaini up front.","Manchester United have lost just one of their last 19 games .

"The bodies of at least 220 tribesmen have been found in Iraq after militants from the Islamic State exacted bloody revenge on Sunni leaders who have been organising resistance movements against them. More than 150 members of the Sunni Albu Nimr tribe were found in a mass grave near Ramadi in Anbar province this morning, while the corpses of another 48 members were discovered near Hit. In a further frightening development ISIS militants massacred 30 men in broad daylight in the centre of Hit, which is also in Anbar, parading them through the streets and using loudspeakers to declare them apostates. The murdered men were thought to be local tribesmen who had allied with the Iraqi government and were helping to organise anti-ISIS operations throughout the province. Sickening: ISIS militants lined up 30 Sunni men in a town west of Baghdad and shot them dead yesterday . Massacre: Young men use mobile phones to take pictures of the dead bodies inside Hit yesterday afternoon . The bodies of 150 members of the Albu Nimr tribe were discovered after ISIS militants took the men from their villages to the city of Ramadi. Police and security officials say they discovered the mass grave outside the city this morning, with the indication being the militants shot them dead yesterday evening. In a separate case, witnesses said they found 48 bodies belonging to members of the same Albu Nimr tribe near the town of Hit, roughly 50 miles north west of Ramadi. Describing the event a witness  said: 'Early this morning we found those corpses and we have been told by some Islamic State militants that ""those people are from Sahwa, who fought your brothers the Islamic State, and this is the punishment of anybody fighting Islamic State"".' The man spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing for his own safety. Grisly: The Islamic State extremists are understoog to have lined the men up and shot them dead with rifles . Tribal sheikhs from Albu Nimr say both groups of victims were among more than 300 men aged between 18 and 55 who were seized by Islamic State this week. The previous morning Islamic State militants had shot dead 30 members of the tribe in the centre of Hit. The slayings took place on a main street in al-Bakir district of the town, which has been the scene of intense fighting by jihadis and local resistance groups in recent weeks. The militants first paraded the men through town, shouting through loudspeakers that the captured men were apostates who fought against them, residents said. The extremists then lined up the men and shot them dead with assault rifles, residents said. The Anbar faction of ISIS is led by Abu Waheeb (centre) whose notoriety stems from the filmed murder of a group of Syrian lorry drivers in Iraq last summer. His band of militants are known as the 'Al Anbar Lions' Militants from the Islamic State (pictured) have been intensified attacks in Anbar province recently . A photograph showed a line of the men's bodies by a small pool of blood as onlookers walked by. Anbar provincial council chairman, Sabah Karhout, said the Sunnis killed were tribal fighters allied with the government and members of the security forces. The men were captured when ISIS terrorists overran the town, which sits on the Euphrates river and is located about 85 miles west of the Iraqi capital. Karhout called the slayings 'a crime against humanity' and demanded more international support for the Sunni tribes fighting the militants in Anbar province. A harrowing video has emerged showing the charred and dismembered bodies of up to 75 people killed when a Syrian regime helicopter dropped two barrel bombs on a refugee camp yesterday. The graphic footage - filmed at a displaced persons camp in the northern province of Idlib - shows the bloodied corpses of women and children, while passers-by scramble to save the wounded. 'It's a massacre of refugees,' a voice off camera can be heard saying, while tents that act as makeshift homes burn all around him and dazed children wander the camp looking for relatives. Barrel bombs, which are banned by international law, are crudely made containers filled with nails, metal shrapnel and explosive material that are dropped from low altitude. Horror: The graphic footage - filmed at a displaced persons camp in the northern province of Idlib - shows the bloodied corpses of women and children, while passers-by scramble to save the wounded . The video begins with the cameraman racing up to the bombed camp on a motorcycle and finding a scene of total devastation. 'Let the whole world see this, they are displaced people. Look at them, they are civilians, displaced civilians. They fled the bombardment,' he said. The man runs into the camp and screams at others to pick up the bodies, trying to convince them that the people on the ground with limbs missing might still survive if taken to hospital. 'This one's good! This one's good!' he shouts, telling two men to carry a limp body with one leg hanging from strips of flesh to a nearby pickup truck. 'Pick him up from the stomach not the leg,' he screams. Victims: Witnesses and paramedics scramble to save the lives of those injured in the twin blasts . Harrowing: 'It's a massacre of refugees,' a voice off camera can be heard saying, while tents that act as makeshift homes burn all around him and dazed children wander the camp looking for relatives . A man in another video of the Abedin camp, which houses people who had escaped fighting in neighbouring Hama province, said as many as 75 people had died. Syrian state media did not mention the bombing. The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks violence in the civil war, said it heard reports that 10 civilians had been killed. Details of the attack could not be independently confirmed. Human rights groups say the Assad regime has previously dropped barrel bombs on densely populated neighbourhoods. These acts are in defiance of a U.N. Security Council resolution banning their use.","150 members of Albu Nimr tribe found in mass grave near Ramadi today .

"International investors have been warned to pull their cash out of Britain to protect themselves against the 'cataclysmic' impact of Scottish independence. Japan's biggest bank, Nomura, warned sterling could plunge by 15 per cent in the event of a ‘Yes’ vote – amid warnings over a ‘run on UK assets’ threatening savings and pensions of ordinary families. It came as it emerged David Cameron has pleaded with business chiefs to publicly warn against Scottish independence. The Prime Minister asked company bosses at a Downing Street drinks event last night to 'highlight the dangers of a Scottish exit in any way we can'. Scroll down for video . International investors are increasingly concerned about the prospect of a Scottish 'Yes' vote in next week's poll . Among those who attended last night’s reception at Number 10 included Sir Richard Broadbent, the chairman of Tesco and Karen Brady, the West Ham United vice-chairman. One company chief present told Sky News: ‘The PM emphasised the need for us to do everything we can over the next nine days to keep the union together. He wants us to highlight the dangers of a Scottish exit in any way we can.’ Mr Cameron's growing concern over the future of the union came after a YouGov poll this weekend put the independence campaign ahead for the first time – with 51 per cent of Scots now planning to vote for separation. Following the news, sterling fell to a 10-month low against the dollar yesterday while shares in major Scottish businesses tanked. The pound continued to fall today as a second independence poll put the Yes and No camps neck and neck. Jordan Rochester, Namura’s foreign exchange strategist, said: ‘We could see a lot of money being pulled out of UK investments. Sterling could fall at least 15 per cent in a worst–case scenario. These are scary times.’ Giant Japanese bank Nomura has warned of a 15 per cent collapse in the value of sterling . Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at the largest fund manager in the world, BlackRock, added: ‘Everybody has been focusing on geopolitics, with issues in the Ukraine and the Middle East... but this is the one thing they were not looking at. ‘Up until now this was not on the radar of many investors, certainly not in the US, and if it was people assumed this vote would not pass. ‘If the Yes vote passes, then investors would have to accept a prolonged period of uncertainty for UK assets.’ Stephen Jen, head of SLJ Macro Partners, told the Telegraph that Asian investors could not understand what was going on. He said: ‘It is totally bizarre. They simply don't understand it, and nor do I. Until a week and half ago everybody thought there was a zero probability of Scotland voting Yes. ‘We have always assumed the United Kingdom would stay united, but now everything we thought about the UK has suddenly been tested, and will have to be repriced.’ He said the situation would be even worse if Scotland refused to take its share of the UK debt, as Alex Salmond has threatened. Mr Jen said: 'Sterling could weaken a lot, though just how far it falls depends on a complicated dynamics. If Scotland tries to keep all the oil and refuses to take on its share of the public debt, there could be a run on UK assets.' The growing uncertainty over the result of the next week's independence referendum may, meanwhile, have knocked the confidence of Scotland’s biggest employers in Scotland, according to a survey. Manpower's employment outlook study suggested company bosses were holding off hiring new workers amid fears over independence. James Hick, managing director of ManpowerGroup Solutions, said: ‘The UK jobs market has experienced an unprecedented boom so far in 2014, with job creation peaking at its highest level since records began in 1971.' Sterling fell to a 10-month low against the dollar yesterday while shares in major Scottish businesses tanked.The pound continued to struggle today as a second independence poll put the Yes and No camps neck and neck . Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown last night announced plans to rush through new powers for the Scottish Parliament . Warnings against independence from Westminster politicians are not getting through to Scottish voters . Mr Hick added: ‘This raises questions about whether the phenomenal level of job creation we've seen can be sustained. ‘The fourth quarter's Outlook suggests it can't, with a two-point fall in hiring intentions - the sharpest dip we've seen in three years. ‘While the UK economy is in robust health, there are issues that may be making employers more cautious. ‘The eurozone's recovery is stalling, and the UK faces a period of political uncertainty with the Scottish independence referendum, a General Election and a potential vote on EU membership all on the horizon’.","Value of the pound could plunge by 15% in the event of a 'Yes' vote .

"Arsene Wenger insists Jack Wilshere's versatility will help him break back into the Arsenal side following four months on the sidelines. The midfielder will be in the Gunners squad to face Crystal Palace for the first time since undergoing ankle surgery in November. Given the raft of central midfield options at Wenger's disposal, and the emergence of Francis Coquelin, questions have been raised over how Wilshere fits into a full-strength Arsenal starting XI. Jack Wilshere's versatility will help him break back into the Arsenal side, says Gunners boss Arsene Wenger . The midfielder will be in the Gunners squad to face Crystal Palace for the first time since undergoing surgery . But Wenger says Wilshere's ability to play anywhere across midfield and the club's busy schedule will ensure the England international gets ample game time. 'He can play wide so that means he can play on the right, on the left and in the middle. With those positions there is fierce competition as well,' said the Gunners boss. 'When you look at our scheduling over the next month I'm happy with that as he will get games. 'In [Santi] Cazorla, [Mesut] Ozil, [Danny] Welbeck and [Alexis] Sanchez it is a very offensive team and that means you if take one out and Jack in, it is exactly the same. 'He is exactly the same player since he came back from injury. His advantage is to turn the game forward and to win the ball. And that's his game.'

"Support: Conductor Robert King with his wife Viola during his trial over sex offences . When celebrated conductor Robert King was convicted of sexually  abusing choir boys, the court heard his career was ‘devastated’. Yet just four years after being released from jail, the musical  director and Hollywood film score  producer is back at the top of his profession – and has seemingly been given the Royal seal of approval. The convicted sex offender is set to headline a concert at an event for Prince Charles’s charity, Music in Country Churches, with his choral group The King’s Consort. The move has caused outrage among concert-goers and child abuse charities. ‘It is as if nothing has happened,’ said Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood. ‘He made these teenagers’ lives a misery – the trauma continues for them. I can’t believe that the Royal family or their charities would have anything to do with him.’ Esther Rantzen, the founder of the child protection charity Childline, said: ‘You have to ask if his crimes have been taken seriously enough.’ King, 53, whose classical albums have sold more than a million copies, was given a three-year, nine-month prison sentence after he was found guilty of 14 charges of indecent assault on five boys, one as young as 12, during the 1980s and 1990s. A court heard in 2007 that the conductor, who has performed at the BBC Proms eight times, had used his ‘god-like’ status to ply the young musicians and choirboys with alcohol and then indecently assault them. He has always denied any wrong-doing and accused his victims of being ‘absolute’ liars and ‘looneys’. King’s wife Viola, 34, supported him throughout the trial, following which the father of one was placed on the sex offenders register. He was not banned from working with children and has since re-established The King’s Consort group, which recently toured and released a best-selling album. Embarrassing: The concert in aid of Music in Country Churches, which has Prince Charles as its patron . The group has been booked to headline the ‘spectacular musical pageant’ in the village of Long Melford, Suffolk, on August 31, in aid of Music in Country Churches –  which has Prince Charles as its patron. The charity was set up in 1989, with the ‘active support of the Prince of Wales’, who is quoted on its website and has attended more than 40 of its concerts. It organises musical events in the countryside with the revenues used to restore local churches, in this case the village’s medieval Holy Trinity church. One parishioner, who did not wish to be named, said she was ‘shocked’ about King’s background. ‘I had absolutely no idea. You wouldn’t want Gary Glitter playing at your church, would you?’Mark Bridges, the Royal solicitor and chairman of the charity, said: ‘I am obviously aware of the verdict of the court and that he has served his time and having done that, has come to back to society. ‘Our objective as a charity is to provide financial support to churches by providing world-class performances by musicians and he is by anyone’s standards a world class musician.’ Church spokesman Patrick Kohler said the evening had been organised by the charity. He added: ‘It is a very prestigious organisation and we would find it difficult to say no to them.’","Robert King  is set to headline concert for charity Music in Country Churches .

The Mab is a circular unit that scans your home before sending its army of 908 tiny flying robots off to clean the place from top to bottom. Each of the mini robots would be powered by solar technology, to generate clean energy while they’re cleaning and deodorising. The robots polish surfaces by touching them with a drop of water. ‘I was in my university gardens when I observed the controlled flight of bees pollinating a flower, and how magical it is to see swarms of bees working together,’ Perez Zapata said. ‘My concept Mab only requires a short initial configuration to function autonomously, so you could arrive home and see a swarm of mini-robots roaming around cleaning independently. ‘This means you could sit back and relax, as you observe with great astonishment the little Mab “fairies” working their magic.’ Brainchild: Colombian designer, Adrian Perez Zapata, took home first place at this weekend's event - a global design competition open to undergraduate and graduate design students to present innovative ideas for the future . Stefano Marzano, Chief Design Officer at Electrolux and Head of Jury, said: ‘This year’s winning concept renews the idea of looking at the robot, seeing it not as one unit that mimics a person, but instead as something inspired by the magical logic of nature’s collaborative efforts and group intelligence. ‘The Mab is an innovative concept which could be relevant to minimise the daily cleaning efforts of consumers as well as businesses, while maximising the results.’ And it seems that domestic drudges are enthused by The Mab: it received 40 per cent of the 4391 public votes on the Design Lab website, making it the People's Choice Award winner. Adrian Perez Zapata took home 5,000 euros from the competition in Stockholm, Sweden, and also won a six-month paid internship at an Electrolux global design centre. The second prize in the competition went to Luiza Silva from Brazil who created the Atomium 3D food printer, a device that uses molecular ingredients to construct food layer by layer. The product aims to help children prepare their own food in a fun and interactive way. Children can draw the shape of the food they would like to eat, show it to the appliance which then detects this information and prints food in the desired shape as well as choosing molecular ingredients to construct the ideal nutritional balance for user’s body. Third prize went to Jeabyun Yeon from . Korea for the Breathing Wall, an air cleaning concept for people who live in urban areas. According . to Electrolux, the idea of the design competition is to 'stimulate and . activate design students on a global level by inviting them to present . breakthrough ideas for future household environments.' Getting graphic: Atomium is a 3D printer that uses molecular ingredients to construct food layer by layer, its creator took home second prize . Breathe easy: Jeabyun Yeon from Korea took home third prize for Breathing Wall - an air cleaning concept for the home . The theme of this year's Design Lab was Inspired Urban Living. 'Living areas are smaller; there is less storage but the home still needs to be the epicentre of entertaining and culinary enjoyment. The competitors were asked to submit concepts for products, accessories, consumables and services that would be seen as a breakthrough within the sector of Social Cooking, Natural Air or Effortless Cleaning,' explained a spokesperson for Electrolux. Over 1700 submissions from over 60 countries around the world flew in and the competition was conducted in five stages: submitting an idea and a sketch, concept development, visual development, functionality development and the final event presentation. Over 100 concepts were chosen to take part in the competition to develop their concepts further and to be evaluated by Electrolux professionals from Design, R&D and Marketing Innovation.","The 'Mab' took home first prize at design competition .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has welcomed the return of England midfielder Jack Wilshere from three months out with an ankle injury, but warned the 'balance of the team' must always come first. The 23-year-old has not played since needing an operation after hobbling off in the defeat to Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium on November 22. Wilshere, though, has come through his rehabilitation quicker than expected, and is expected to be involved again at Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon. Jack Wilshere is back in training and could feature for Arsenal in this Saturday's trip to Crystal Palace . Wilshere posted this image on Instagram with the caption: 'Think it's fair to say I'm happy to be back' The 23-year-old midfielder has not played for the Gunners since injuring his ankle last November . Wilshere's return is a boost for Arsene Wenger, but the Arsenal boss insists he is not guaranteed his place . Wenger has praised the way the player has dedicated himself to a speedy recovery, during which he made some unwanted headlines off the pitch after being photographed holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub. It was not so long ago the dynamic midfielder would have been a certain starter in the Arsenal XI. However, with the likes of Santi Cazorla, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez all in impressive form as Francis Coquelin shields the defence, Wenger accepts there can be no guarantees of selection for anyone. 'Jack is a bit ahead of schedule and has worked hard with no big problems, so it's good to have him back,' said Wenger. 'It is always difficult to come back straightaway. What is good is that [he is] already back (earlier than expected). Wilshere is back earlier than expected, despite questions about his professionalism during the injury break . The impressive performances of the likes of Francis Coquelin (right) have left questions over Wilshere's place . 'That injury was on the left ankle. He had all his problems on the right ankle. 'It is a straightforward injury - once it's healed, there's no problem.' Wenger, though, added: 'No matter who plays, you always worry first about the balance of the team, yes.' The Arsenal manager hopes Wilshere can put the negative headlines behind him. 'I don't know how everybody is but I think every professional footballer has to control his life and dedicate it to the game,' Wenger said. Arsenal can expect a stern test of their top-four credentials at Selhurst Park against a side which is now well organised and hard to break down under new manager Alan Pardew. Alexis Sanchez watches on during Arsenal's training session on Friday morning .

Wenger said: 'They have found confidence again and they made positive results and that is what it is about when you are a manager. 'We always expect a passionate afternoon there.' Pardew has hailed midfielder Cazorla as Arsenal's stand-out player. The 30-year-old Spaniard has been linked with a transfer to Atletico Madrid, but Wenger insists the diminutive midfielder remains very much integral to Arsenal's future plans. The England midfielder injured his left ankle against Manchester United, and has been out for three months . Arsene Wenger praised the impact Alan Pardew (above) has had at Crystal Palace since taking over . Pardew has praised Santi Cazorla, the Arsenal midfielder who has been in excellent form recently . 'Until now he has been maybe the most consistent, since he has moved centrally his influence on the team has been bigger as well,' Wenger said. 'He has extended his contract last year. I think he has still two years to go. 'You know our policy at the club, so I don't think there's anything special to worry about there. 'The suggestion (of a transfer bid) is only a suggestion. We have never been approached by anybody about him.' Theirry Henry, who recently began coaching with the Arsenal under-16s, is a potential future manager . Henry is currently splitting his time between coaching badges and a broadcasting career with Sky Sports . Wenger confirmed former Arsenal forward Thierry Henry had been back at the club this week working with the Academy as part of his first steps into a coaching career. 'It is good for our young players to be coached by him, a legend of the club,' said Wenger. Asked if the French World Cup winner could one-day replace him as Arsenal manager, Wenger replied: 'That would not be my problem, it would be a problem of the board to make that decision. 'Yes of course (he could be a future Arsenal manager). I have said that many times, but I have had many, many players who can do this job.' FA Cup holders Arsenal have been drawn away to Manchester United in the quarter-finals, with the tie to be broadcast on Monday March 9, kicking off at 7:45pm. Wenger said: 'It is certainly not the most prestigious timing for people who want to watch on television. 'Maybe it is more suited maybe for a Sunday game, but television has made that choice. We will adapt and have no problem with it. 'We just want to win, and play when we are told to play. What I want is to go to Wembley, no matter who we play.'","Jack Wilshere has not featured since injuring his ankle in November .

"England's abject defeat by New Zealand in Wellington ranks as one of their darkest days not only at a World Cup but in the country's entire history of playing the international game. While England have not been expected to mount a serious challenge for the World Cup, nobody can defend a performance of such ineptitude, following so soon after last week's limp surrender to the tournament's other co-hosts, Australia. These are the shocking stats which prove just how low the team coached by Peter Moores and led on the field by Eoin Morgan have slumped. England's James Taylor (left), Ian Bell and Moeen Ali trudge off the field after defeat by New Zealand . 226 - balls remaining when New Zealand wrapped up their stunning eight-wicket victory. 77 - runs scored by New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum during his onslaught. 308.00 - McCullum's strike rate. He scored his 77 off just 25 balls, including eight fours and seven sixes. Brendon McCullum bludgeons another boundary during his savage innings in Wellington . 105 - runs scored by New Zealand during their first seven overs; England scored 36 in the same time. 20 - overs it took England to surpass McCullum's individual total. 6 - England batsmen dismissed in single figures: Ian Bell, James Taylor, Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Stuart Broad and Steven Finn. James Anderson was left stranded on one not out. Bell is bowled by Tim Southee to kick-start England's humiliation by the co-hosts . 9 - boundaries hit by England in their entire innings, which lasted 33.2 overs; McCullum hit 15 on his own. 4.25 - economy rate PER BALL of Steven Finn - the equivalent of being hit for a boundary every delivery. 49 - runs conceded by Finn in just two overs. He was hit for three fours and six sixes. 13 - extras scored in England's innings, which is more than their entire last six batsmen's totals combined. Southee (left) celebrates one of his seven wickets while Steven Finn (right) reflects on a chastening day . 7 - wickets taken by New Zealand seamer Tim Southee. 2 - wickets taken by all four of England's bowlers. Both fell to Chris Woakes. 5.61 - run rate of England's most economical bowler (or least expensive) so far in the tournament - Woakes. 19 - runs scored by Eoin Morgan in his last eight games, including four ducks in his last six innings. 56 - days between Alastair Cook's sacking as England captain and the start of the World Cup. 293 - runs scored by Kevin Pietersen, who was sacked by England despite top-scoring in last winter's Ashes whitewash - in this year's Big Bash.

"Steven Gerrard might have made a big deal over Mario Balotelli's insistence on taking Liverpool's penalty in their 1-0 win over Besiktas, but the Liverpool captain's comments from earlier in the season  indicate the striker was right to take the ball from Jordan Henderson. Injured midfielder Gerrard, working as a ITV pundit for Liverpool's first-leg Europa League win, accused Balotelli of showing 'disrespect' and labelled him 'mischievous' after he took the winning penalty ahead of stand-in skipper  Henderson. But with Balotelli having missed just two of his 29 career penalties, Gerrard spoke out earlier this season to confirm that the £16million summer signing would be Brendan Rodgers' second-choice spot-kick taker. Balotelli takes the ball to take the penalty from Henderson despite the stand-in skipper's inital protests . Sturridge looked furious at Balotelli for questioning Henderson's authority and taking the spot-kick . While Besiktas' players argued with the referee over the penalty, Liverpool argued among themselves . All was well in the end though when Balotelli fired the penalty into Cenk Gonen's bottom corner for a 1-0 win . Balotelli sought out Henderson after scoring the goal and later thanked him with this Instagram post . Balotelli (right) shares a laugh with Raheem Sterling after his penalty spat at Anfield on Thursday night . Henderson (right) was also back in training at Melwood on Friday with Emre Can and Daniel Sturridge . 'I'm aware he's a terrific penalty taker,' Gerrard said in August after scoring a penalty for Liverpool in their 3-0 win at Tottenham. 'I'm sure he'll get the chance to take some penalties for the club. The manager's told me if I'm not on the pitch he'll take them.' And given Balotelli's record - it was a good decision for him to take the ball, as proven when he converted. Henderson, on the other hand, has never scored a penalty in a match of this magnitude and was not even mentioned by Gerrard as one of his spot-kick replacements back in August, putting him behind Balotelli and Rickie Lambert in that regard. Daniel Sturridge, the other option on the field, has missed one of three penalties in the Premier League and who would not have inspired the same confidence in The Kop that Balotelli's presence did as fans sang his name during the argument. Gerrard said on ITV that Balotelli was disrespectful but had previously said he would be second-choice . Henderson (right) gets a lift into Liverpool training on Friday in Adam Lallana's Range Rover . Balotelli (right) also hitched a lift in as he got back to work at Liverpool's Melwood training base . Sturridge gives the thumbs up through the window of his car as he arrives at Melwood . The incident didn't do wonders for Henderson's image as a captain, though. The Anfield club's vice-captain was starting with the armband for just the eighth time but saw his authority brought into question by Balotelli. Henderson later went on to say: 'I wanted the penalty, Mario felt confident and he has taken big penalties before. 'Everyone wants to take them. I felt confident in Mario, he has taken big penalties before and he got the nod.' Gerrard, sat up in the television box, wouldn't have put up with such behaviour and it seems unlikely that even the Italian forward would have taken the same action. Instead, with three months and 10 days left until Gerrard's potential final game for Liverpool - the FA Cup final - questions surround the respect for the man who takes over his role when the 34-year-old moves on to LA Galaxy. Balotelli waves a hand at Sturridge as he prepares to put the ball down for the ultimately successful spot-kick . It's not the first time Sturridge has shown anger on the field, but this time it did not seem to be in self interest . Sturridge was still complaining about Balotelli's actions even after the Italian put Liverpool ahead . The £16million forward casts an eye over to his strike-partner during the Europa League first-leg win . Liverpool's players, and in particular Balotelli, looked to be having a laugh at Melwood on Friday . Balotelli and Henderson were both in as the Reds recovered from their Europa League extertions . Simon Mignolet (left), Joe Allen (third left), Martin Skrtel (third right), Henderson (second right) and Lallana (right) go for a jog at Liverpool's Melwood training base . Sportsmail columnist and Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher said on Kicca: . 'Mario would never have been on the penalties because he was on the bench, the same would have applied to Stevie if he was on the bench. 'Sturridge was supposed to take it and looked a little peeved along with Henderson but at that moment the best penalty taker LFC had on the pitch was Balotelli as we've seen with his spot kicks for Man City. 'So in this instance I was ok with it because the main penalty taker wasn't on the pitch in Gerrard. And also because he scored!' (Carragher later clarified that Henderson was the original chosen taker, not Sturridge) And while Henderson eventually allowed Balotelli to take the decisive penalty, which the goalscorer thanked him for later, Sturridge seemed less than happy - even after the ball found the bottom-left corner with goalkeeper Cenk Gonen sent the wrong way. The England forward was seen ranting to Alberto Moreno away from the celebrations in scenes that brought back images of his petulant reaction to being substituted by Rodgers against Everton last January - for which he later offered an apology. Should Liverpool pick up another spot-kick in the return leg in Istanbul or against Southampton on Sunday, another decision may have to be made. Gerrard doesn't expect to be back in action until two weeks time and thinks the second leg will come too soon. 'I think I'm a couple of weeks away from returning to playing but it's settled down well,' he told ITV. 'I don't really want to put a target game on the injury. I think next week will come too soon.' Sturridge did not even seem pleased to be taking the lead - a contrast to his partnership with Luis Suarez . Gordon Strachan, Peter Reid and Gerrard talk through the decision-making process over the penalty .

"With just the clothes on their back and the rucksacks on their shoulders, an Italian port is swamped by hundreds of immigrants as yet another boat unloads its cargo of desperate travellers fleeing the horrors of their homeland. The crowds of men, women and children have disembarked at Port Augusta in Sicily after making the terrifying journey across the Mediterranean - a trip which has claimed the lives of more than 1,000 people over the last 12 months - in the hope that they will be able to find asylum and a better life in Europe. Many arrive from Libya, where human traffickers have begun to take advantage of the breakdown in order following the toppling of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011, while others come from other north African countries such as Eritrea. Hoping for a new start away from the horrors of their homelands, these refugees arrive at Port Augusta in northern Sicily with, some with just the clothes on their backs . The long line of migrants are led to a refugee camp by guards to make their claim for asylum - and their bid to start a new life . The migrants have travelled across the Mediterranean, fleeing war-torn countries including Libya, which has seen a breakdown in social order since the collapse of Colonel Gaddafi's regime in 2011 . As their application is processed, they are housed in blue tents with their families after being given clean clothes and fed with milk and biscuits . Upon their arrival their first step is to hand over documents from the country they have fled before their photo is taken. They are then fed with milk, water and biscuits, washed and given clean clothing before being taken to one of the many refugee camps around Europe, some seeking ultimate refuge in the UK. Some 140,000 illegal migrants have entered Europe via Italy since January – more than last year’s entire total. Today Italy's search and rescue services found six more bodies in the Mediterranean to add to the 19 people who drowned while a ship tried to make the crossing. The navy said it has now rescued almost 4,000 migrants over the weekend, with Italian vessels continuing to look for victims of a boat which capsized north of the Libyan coast on Sunday evening. It comes after 200 migrants were feared to have drowned after a boat sank less than a mile from the coast of Libya  on Friday. Investigators believe one in five want of those who travel to Port Augusta aim to end up in Britain. The journey from Sicily to Dover can take a mere seven days, with some boarding trains towards Calais while others take the bus. Despite the death of an Afghan Sikh in a shipping container at Tilbury docks last week, hundreds are still determined to risk their lives to reach their destination by any means possible. A boy lies asleep in the vast, tented dormitory while others sit and talk around him. More than 140,000 immigrants are said to have entered Europe via Italy since January .

"James Milner faces a race to be fit for Manchester City's huge Champions League showdown against Barcelona on Tuesday. The England midfielder has been one of the few City players to cover himself in glory during a difficult run that has seen Manuel Pellegrini's team fall seven points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea. City face Newcastle on Saturday looking to win their first home league match since New Year's Day. Manuel Pellegrini admitted that midfielder James Milner could miss Manchester City's next two games . The in-form England international has been superb for City in recent weeks but will be missing this weekend . But they will do so without Milner whose knee injury has ruled him out of the league game and makes him a serious doubt for the Champions League last 16 first leg home tie with the Spanish giants. Pellegrini said: 'Tomorrow the only player that has a problem is James Milner, he has a problem in his knee and he is not available for tomorrow. All the other players in the squad are fit. 'We will see about Tuesday. It is not very, very serious but he couldn't work in the whole week so we will see how he improves in the next days but he has a kick in his ligament in his knee. 'We are just thinking about the game against Newcastle. It is important to try to have three more points in the Premier League. When we finish Newcastle we are going to start thinking about Champions League and Barcelona.' Milner heads in City's winning goal in the impressive 4-1 win against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium . The Englishman rescued a point for City at home against Hull with this fine free-kick on February 7 . Milner was awarded the Etihad Player of the Month award for his performances throughout January . Pellegrini will welcome back Yaya Toure from his triumphant Africa Cup of Nations campaign with Ivory Coast and must decide what role his countryman - and new City signing - Wilfried Bony will play against Newcastle. Pellegrini said: 'I think that Bony will be an important player for us. He will be in the squad list we will see if he will be in the starting 11 or after that have some minutes but he works with our team the whole week without any problems. 'He has settled in the same way I supposed he was going to do it because he is a player that plays here in England, he knows the Premier League, he knows our team so I think it will be easy for him to settle in in a good way.' Wilfried Bony and Yaya Toure offer old and new options respectively for Pellegrini on their return from Africa .

"The astonishing row between Britain’s two best distance runners escalated on Friday night with a series of explosive claims and counter-claims. Mo Farah on Friday reignited the dispute with Andy Vernon when he revealed what sparked their Twitter row earlier this week, claiming the European silver medallist implied he should have won gold in Zurich last year because the Somalia-born Farah is not British. But Vernon, while admitting he had joked over a meal one night in Zurich that he should have been crowned ‘European champion’, responded by accusing Farah and his management team of employing ‘snide’ tactics to trash his reputation in a bid to repair the damage to their own. Mo Farah spoke out about his Twitter spat with Andy Vernon and said it was down to a comment made by his fellow distance runner that implied that he did not deserve gold at the European Championships in 2014 . Farah said: 'One comment he made, which I didn't really like, was to say that he should have won the gold' Farah is in Birmingham preparing for an indoor two-mile  record attempt at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix . Farah and Vernon, who finished one-two at the European Championships, clashed on Twitter . Farah was forced to issue a public apology on Friday - ahead of Saturday’s attempt to break the world indoor two-mile record in the Sainsbury’s British indoor grand prix - for the way he responded to a jibe from Vernon on Twitter on Tuesday night. In branding Vernon an ‘embarrassment’ who had not won anything ‘decent’, the double Olympic champion accepted he had offended the wider athletics community. ‘I’d like to apologise to the public,’ he said. Then Farah, having consulted with his representatives before his media appearance, decided to reveal that he and Vernon had ‘history’ dating back to the European Championships that saw Farah win gold in the 10,000 and 5,000 metres, when Vernon took a silver and bronze. ‘It happened in the European Championship in Zurich where he came second in the race I won,’ said Farah. ‘We were sitting down together and there were a number of staff and athletes there too. One comment he made, which I didn’t really like, was to say that he should have won the gold. ‘I was like, ‘‘what, the gold should have been given to you?’’ And I was like, ‘‘Because he was the only European guy?’’ You can’t say something like that. I was just kind of biting my tongue at the time.’ The implication is that Vernon was referring to the fact that he had been born in Somalia but then moved to the UK as a child. ‘I don’t know what he meant,’ he replied. ‘But at that point it hurt me. But I moved on. That was private. But to come out publicly and say something like that (the Twitter row); that’s why I reacted. I do apologise. I should never come out publicly and say some things. But we have to move on.’ A spokesperson for British Athletics said: ‘We will be talking to Andy about the comment he made and reminding him of his responsibilities as a British team member.’ But Vernon responded with anger on Friday night. ‘Look, I did make a joke about being European champion but in the context of the conversation - which was very light-hearted - I honestly didn’t think I’d caused offence,’ he insisted. ‘If I did, then I apologise but I really feel this has been taken out of context to shift the focus back on me and I now feel I’ve been really badly misrepresented.’ Earlier, the 29-year-old told BBC Radio Solent: ‘I am really disappointed with what he (Farah) said. It’s an outrageous misrepresentation of the chat we had at the Europeans. I don’t discard him as British - it’s complete lies. His management team have been very snide at making me out to being a bad guy here. ‘I’ve known Mo for 12 years. We weren’t best of friends but we were pals. I was delighted when we finished first and second in the 10,000m and I celebrated with him. When I heard he said something in the press conference (on Friday) I immediately tried to contact his management team to say I am sorry if anything I said did offend you, it wasn’t meant like that. But no one has got back to me. He is trying to brand me something that I am not. Farah celebrates his victory over Vernon for the Men's 10,000m European titles in Zurich in August 2014 . Vernon said that the field running with Farah in his bid for an indoor world record in Birmingham was a joke . The response ‘ComeBackWhenYouWinSomething Decent’ from Farah offended many in athletics . ‘There’s nothing more I’d like right now than a two-way press conference when we can discuss what happened, because what he said is not what I said. He has played the cheap shot. He has played the card. I don’t know what I can do.’ Farah had earlier responded over their midweek Twitter spat. Having seen a Tweet from Vernon suggesting that a weakened field for Saturday’s race amounted to a ‘joke’, Farah accepts he over-reacted. ‘I should never have reacted that way and I do apologise,’ he said. ‘When he comes out publicly and says something I’m going to try and defend myself. But someone like me should never really have done something like that. ‘It (criticism) is difficult but you know if it’s the normal public, you just have to deal with it and let your running do the talking. But with an athlete like him, one I’ve been on the podium with, it was difficult to bite my tongue. I couldn’t do it. My frustration just got the better of me, for sure. ‘I put my hand up. But Andy has a history of disrespecting athletes. He did it before, with Lynsey Sharp. You know, me and Andy. We’re not best friends, we’ll never be best friends. That’s just how it is.’ Vernon did not deny that he made the comments but said it was to carry on a joke around a table . Vernon apologised and while Farah did not reciprocate, he did concede that he had over-reacted . Farah says that he and Vernon will never be 'best friends' but he regrets the way he reacted on Twitter .","Andy Vernon and Mo Farah engaged in an argument on Twitter this week .

"A haul of 8.5 million cigarettes is to be incinerated to provide power for the National Grid. They were found in a shipping container from Malaysia – which was supposed to contain fabric –  at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk by Border Force officers. It is believed the cigarettes would have been sold illegally at markets, pubs and car boot sales, depriving the UK Treasury of about £2.5 million in tax. Cigarette energy: A haul of 8.5 million cigarettes from Malaysia has been burned by the National Grid for energy . Charlotte Mann, acting deputy director for Border Force, said: ‘We have stopped a major smuggling attempt and starved those responsible of the proceeds of their criminality.’ It is the latest in a number of batches to be seized this year. In May, a haul of 16.5 million cigarettes smuggled into the UK by a Manchester couple was seized and burned for energy.

"England suffered a humiliating eight-wicket defeat by New Zealand in their second match of the 2015 Cricket World Cup on Friday - undoubtedly one of the worst days in the history of English one-day cricket. Here, Sportsmail looks back at some of the darkest days for England in the sport. World Twenty20, Chittagong, March 31, 2014 - The Netherlands (133-5) beat England (88) by 45 runs . England had endured a miserable winter after being whitewashed 5-0 in the Ashes Down Under. Things got no better in Bangladesh as England suffered defeat by minnows The Netherlands which brought an end to their tournament. The part-timers from the Netherlands made a strong start as they reached 84-1 after 11 overs before going on to set a target of 134 for England. The reply from England was abysmal. Ravi Bopara was the top scorer with just 18 runs as England were all out for 88, scoring just four fours throughout their innings. It equalled England's second lowest score in Twenty20 Internationals and summed up their winter. Players of the Netherlands celebrate their upset victory against England at the 2014 World Twenty20 . Fifth Test, Sydney, January 5, 2014 - Australia (326 and 276) beat England (155 and 166) by 281 runs . England arrived in Australia looking to retain the urn they had won just a few months earlier. By the time they took to the field of the Sydney Cricket Ground in January, the visitors were looking to avoid the whitewash. With England set a target of 448 to win on day three, it seemed unlikely. However, it was still humiliating for England to last just 31.4 overs as they could only muster 166 with Ryan Harris claiming 5 -25. It was an embarrassing end to one of Englands' worst ever Test series defeats and only the third whitewash in Ashes history. Jimmy Anderson (centre) and Boyd Ranking (right) look dejected as Australia celebrate their 2014 victory . World Cup, Chittagong, March 11, 2011 - Bangladesh (227-8) beat England (225) by two wickets . After suffering a three-wicket defeat by Ireland in Bangalore nine days previously, England suffered another shock loss to Bangladesh in the group stage of the 2011 World Cup. England had hit a total of 225 and looked good for the victory as they reduced the hosts to 169-8. However, a stunning ninth-wicket partnership of 58 between Shafiul Islan amd Mahmudullah clinched victory with six balls to spare. England recovered with victory against the West Indies to progress but were knocked out by Sri Lanka in the quarter-finals. Bangladesh pair Mahmudallah (left) and Shafiul Islam celebrate victory against England in March 2011 . World Twenty20, Lord's, June 5, 2009 - The Netherlands (163-6) beat England (162-5) by four wickets . The opening match of the 2009 World Twenty20 for England on home soil ended in embarrassment as the Netherlands claimed victory off the final ball. England struggled to post a decent total, although would still have fancied their chances with the visitors chasing a target of 163. However, the Dutch well and truly went for it with Tom de Grooth scoring 49 off 30 balls. It came down to the last ball with the Netherlands looking for two runs. Bowler Stuart Broad had the chance for a run-out off the initial hit but missed and the Dutch ran through to claim a famous victory. England still qualified from Group D but were knocked out of the Super 8s stage with a defeat by the West Indies using the Duckworth- Lewis method. Edgar Schiferli (centre) is ecstatic after the Netherlands beat Englands in the 2009 World Twenty20 opener . First Test, Kingston, February 7, 2009 - West Indies (392) beat England (318 and 51) by an innings and 23 runs . England captain Andrew Strauss was left shell-shocked after his side suffered humiliation on day four of the first Test in Kingston. After posting a first innings score of 318, West Indies replied with 392 to take a first innings lead of 74. What followed was staggering. England collapsed and were 26-7 before being bowled all out for 51, their third lowest Test innings total ever. It was enough for the West Indies to claim the five-Test series as the four remaining Tests were all drawn. Ian Bell (bottom left) walks off as the West Indies players celebrate his disimssal in Kingston in 2009 . Second Test, Adelaide, December 5, 2006 - Australia (513 and 168-4) beat England (551-6 dec and 129) After a fourth day on which England had bowled Australia out for 513, a draw looked the most likely result. 24 hours later, England had somehow lost in what was described at the time by Shane Warne as the greatest victory of his Test career. England started day five on 59-1 but lost nine wickets for 60, with Warne taking 4-49, and the Aussies came out firing after tea in an attempt to chase the target of 168. Michael Hussey scored the winning runs with three overs to spare, finishing on a total of 61 not out, and the local crowd celebrated wildly as Australia took a 2-0 lead in the series. England's first innings of 551 was the fourth-highest Test match total by a losing side and the visitors never recovered as they went on to suffer a whitewash.

Fourth Test, The Oval, August 22, 1999 - New Zealand (236 and 162) beat England (153 and 162) by 83 runs . England were consigned to the bottom of the Wisden international rankings after suffering a 2-1 series defeat to New Zealand as the visitors clinched victory in the fourth and final test at The Oval. England's batting capitulated in the second innings as they chased a target of 246. The hosts had finished day three on 91-2 but could only muster 162 in the end, with Mike Atherton (64), Graham Thorpe (44) and Alec Stewart (12) the only English batsmen to score double figures. The last eight wickets were lost for just 39 runs as New Zealand celebrated only their second series triumph in England and captain Nasser Hussain was booed by his own fans on the Oval balcony.

Third Test, Trinidad, March 30, 1994 - West Indies (252 and 269) beat England (328 and 46) by 147 runs . After losing the first two matches of the five-Test series, England - captained by Mike Atherton after Graham Gooch had resigned following the 1993 Ashes - arrived in Port of Spain for this must-win third Test. And this youthful side had a shot at it on day five as they were set a target of 194 to win. However, England collapsed in the face of the bowling attack from Curtly Ambrose who took 6-24. Alec Stewart was the only Englishman to make double figures with 18 and 'Extras' was the next-highest scorer with seven as England were bowled out for just 46, their second-lowest Test innings in history. The England team look dejected after being bowled out for 46 against the West Indies in Trinidad in 1994 . P.S. First Test, The Oval, August 29, 1882 - Australia (63 and 122) beat England by seven runs (101 and 77) This was the match which inspired the obituary mourning 'the death of English cricket' after a first defeat to Australia on home soil at The Oval. Australia bowled England all out for 77 in a tense finish, which reportedly caused one spectator to chew through the handle of his umbrella.

"West Ham have been fined £30,000 by the Football Association for failing to control their players in the recent draw at Southampton. The incident in question occurred after referee Craig Pawson sent off Hammers goalkeeper Adrian just after the hour mark for handling the ball outside of his penalty area. Although the Spaniard's red card was later overturned on appeal, the FA has announced the club have been punished for the players' reaction. Craig Pawson sends off Adrian (13) for handball and was subsequently mobbed by West Ham players . 'Following an independent regulatory commission hearing, West Ham United have been fined £30,000 after the club admitted an FA charge of failing to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion,' a statement on the FA's official website read. 'The charge was in relation to an incident which occurred in or around the 61st minute of the game against Southampton on 11 February 2015.' Adrian's dismissal saw West Ham play with 10 men for the remaining half an hour at St Mary's - with Sam Allardyce's side able to hold on for a 0-0 stalemate. The Spanish goalkeeper had his red card against Southampton overturned after an appeal was lodged . The goalkeeper dived on the ball outside the area ahead of Sadio Mane (centre) and was sent off . Following his sending off a melee ensued with the West Ham players surrounding the referee . Allardyce confirmed immediately after the game that they would appeal the red card and, whilst that proved to be successful, the club have now been hit with a fine for the separate charge. It is the second time this season the Hammers have been punished for failure to control their players following an incident in a 2-1 defeat at Everton which saw both clubs handed the same charge. With a derby against local rivals Tottenham on Sunday, West Ham co-chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold have issued a letter to fans asking for their behaviour to remain exemplary at White Hart Lane. Previous matches between the two sides have been tarnished by anti-Semitic chants from a minority of West Ham supporters, with Gold and Sullivan calling for travelling fans to be at their best this weekend. West Ham players show their disbelief at the red card decision which consequently cost the club £30,000 . 'Sam and the team have been working hard on the training pitch this week to put last week's wrongs right and Sunday's game offers an exciting opportunity for us to bounce back (from defeat at West Brom),' they said in a statement on West Ham's website. 'We would also like to remind all fans attending the match at White Hart Lane that they will be acting as ambassadors for West Ham United and their behaviour should reflect the values and standards of our club. 'Working with the Metropolitan Police, the Club will continue to adopt a zero tolerance policy towards any form of discriminatory behaviour and any fan found to be acting inappropriately - including racist, anti-Semitic and homophobic behaviour - will be punished to the full extent of the law and banned from attending matches. 'We are rightly proud of our world-famous support home and away and we look forward to the famous 'claret and blue army' once again getting behind the team with all their heart and showing the world that following the Hammers means supporting with pride, passion and respect.' Sam Allardyce and his side will be hoping that the fans will be on their best behaviour against Tottenham .","West Ham receive £30,000 fine for failing to control their players .

"Jose Mourinho claims Eden Hazard has asked a shin pad manufacturer to come up with a product to protect his entire lower leg because he is being targeted by opposition defenders. Hazard was fouled nine times in Chelsea’s Champions League clash at Paris St Germain on Tuesday and is the Barclays Premier League’s most fouled player. The winger has been fouled 74 times in the top flight - 14 more than Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling - as he prepares to face Burnley at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard was fouled nine times during Tuesday's Champions League clash with PSG . Hazard shouts out in pain after being fouled at the Parc des Princes during Chelsea's 1-1 draw in France . 102 The number of times Hazard has been fouled in Premier League and Champions League games this season - more than any other player. Mourinho said: ‘Eden has asked me to speak with some friends of mine who make carbon shin-pads. He wants one that covers the whole leg. Like a horse. ‘Normally, if you get 100 fouls, the opponents will get a certain percentage of yellow cards. ‘So if he is the most fouled player he should be the player creates more cards in the opponent. But he isn’t.’ Mourinho is convinced the forward, who has signed a new five year contract worth £200,000 a week, is being deliberately targeted at home and abroad. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho claims Hazard has asked for larger shinpads to protect his entire lower leg . The Chelsea chief added: ‘There are fouls and there are accumulations of fouls and there are fouls that are strategy and the referees have to understand exactly that. Sometimes little fouls are big fouls in the context of the game. ‘For example, and there are many of them in the world of football, there are players who are a specialist in stopping counter attacks. ‘The team loses the ball, he makes the foul. It is a small foul but it stops the counter attack. And I think Eden is punished in both ways. ‘If you see the game in Paris he had nine fouls. But three of them were very bad fouls. Very dangerous fouls. And nothing.’","Eden Hazard was fouled nine times during Chelsea's clash with PSG .

"It may have been a relatively mild winter so far, but several Tottenham players couldn't escape the cold as they prepared to aid their recovery in a freezing ice chamber after training. The four Spurs stars, Andros Townsend, Kyle Walker, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen, lined up wearing only shorts, socks, woolen hats and face masks as they nervously awaited the treatment on Friday. And, with temperatures in the so-called kriotherapy chamber ranging from -130C and - 140C, they had every reason to be apprehensive ahead of the three minutes they will spend in a small room cooled by liquid nitrogen. (L-R) Andros Townsend, Kyle Walker, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen prepare to feel the cold . Denmark international Christian Eriksen trains ahead of Tottenham's weekend game with West Ham . Roberto Soldado celebrates after scoring in Spurs 1-1 midweek Europa League draw with Fiorentina . Developed in 1978 by Toshiro Yamauchi in Japan, the process, which has been used by Spurs players including Rafel van der Vaart and Jermain Defoe in the past, aids recovery by stimulating the body to keep warm in extreme cold temperatures. Upon leaving the chamber, the players' veins will open to around three to four times bigger than normal, increasing the blood supply and bringing more oxygen to infected areas. Mauricio Pochettino's side are still in the chase for a Champions League place in his debut season . Harry Kane is expected to be returned to the starting line-up after being rested against Fiorentina . Kriotherapy provides a change of routine for injured athletes. It can trigger the release of endorphins that help combat any psychological malaise. It's also good for the skin, helps osteoporosis and can ease long-term complaints such as MS or ME. Men's testosterone levels increase afterwards, too. Head of sports science at  Manchester City (and formerly with Spurs), Dr Sam Erith, has said: 'Kriotherapy means you can train more, to get fitter more quickly. With the players who have been rehabilitating, they've been training three times a day.' Mauricio Pochettino has no injury concerns ahead of West Ham's visit to White Hart Lane on Sunday, with Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Moussa Dembele expected to return to the startling line-up after being rested for Thursday night's 1-1 draw with Fiorentina in the Europa League . Shock hits you when you walk through the door into a temperature of -135C (-211 F). It is not like plunging into a cold pool because the air is dry and the impact is instant. The cold doesn’t engulf you gradually; it takes your breath away and attacks you from all sides. You cannot imagine how cold it is going to be. My hands, clenched into tight fists and covered by three pairs of gloves, went straight to my back and stomach, trying to cover the most exposed areas. I felt a rush of adrenaline and an instant buzz. Then we — myself, Spurs physician Dr Shabaaz Mughal and kit man James Campbell — began to walk, heads down, in a circle, stomping our feet. It was like being in a misty, bitingly cold tunnel, but without the faintest gust of wind. I suddenly became aware of every inch of my skin. I thought it would feel like an eternity, but three minutes had passed before we knew it. Suddenly we were back in the antechamber and then at room temperature, about 20C (68F), bright red and flushed with a remarkable sense of achievement. Renata puts me straight on to the Vibrogym equipment, making me change position so the pulses can stimulate the blood flow to my muscles. You warm up in no time. My high continued for the next hour or so, then died off, leaving me feeling pleasantly sleepy.","Andros Townsend, Kyle Walker, Christian Eriksen and Jan Vertonghen took part in kriotherapy treatment after training .

"Mario Balotelli could be on his way out of Anfield because he is 'more hassle than he is worth', according to former Liverpool star Jamie Redknapp. Balotelli scored the only goal in Liverpool's 1-0 win over Besiktas, but in the process attracted controversy by grabbing the ball off captain Jordan Henderson to score from the spot. And Redknapp believes his apparent lack of respect will leave Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers to decide he can do without the Italian striker. Mario Balotelli takes the ball from Jordan Henderson despite the stand-in skipper's initial protests . Daniel Sturridge looked furious at Balotelli for questioning stand-in captain Henderson's authority . 'The problem you have with Mario is I don't think he has got a lot of respect for anybody,' said Redknapp on talkSPORT. 'He has worked with some of the best managers in (Cesare) Prandelli, (Jose) Mourinho, (Roberto) Mancini, everybody he has worked with has tried with this man but nobody seems to get to the bottom of it. 'The objective is to put the ball into the back of the net, thankfully that is what he did, but it is not nice to see players arguing like that on the field. All was well in the end though when Balotelli fired the penalty into Cenk Gonen's bottom corner for a 1-0 win . Steven Gerrard called Balotelli disrespectful, and Redknapp said his team-mates don't enjoy his company . 'He is an incredibly confident penalty taker and very good at it, but it is that lack of respect that he has.' Redknapp also suggested that Balotelli, who cost Liverpool £16million this summer and has scored just one Premier League goal, has not justified his place in the squad. 'I don't see long-term he will be at Anfield, I really don't,' continued Redknapp. 'He has scored a couple of goals in fairness, the goals against Tottenham and yesterday were important, but I am sure Brendan Rodgers is thinking he is more hassle than he is worth because he hasn't produced the quality you would like and when you look at other players around him they don't seem to enjoy his company on the field.' Balotelli sought out Henderson after scoring the goal and later thanked him with this Instagram post .

"On any given night at Arsenal's Hale End academy, Brooklyn Beckham may find himself under the watchful eye of ex-England midfielder Dennis Wise. Like Brooklyn, Wise's son, Henry, is one of the young hopefuls enrolled at the Gunners' Walthamstow complex. Some evenings he may even find himself being put through his paces by Thierry Henry, who is taking regular sessions with the club's academy as he completes his coaching badges. And then, of course, there's dad David, a regular at Hale End as he keeps tabs on the fledgling careers of his eldest son — as well as Romeo and Cruz, who are also on Arsenal's books. No pressure then, Brooklyn. David Beckham with sons Brooklyn (left), Cruz (centre) and Romeo (right) at the World Cup last year . The teenager has caused quite a stir at Arsenal's youth HQ over the past few months. At the age of 15, he was named on the bench for last weekend's Under-18 clash against Leicester, raising hopes that he may well have the substance to back up his name. Brooklyn will discover over the weekend whether his call-up was indicative of a burgeoning career, or merely a generous farewell gesture, with the teenager due to be told whether he is to be retained for next season or released. Brooklyn's rise through the age groups — having started in the U15s — at Hale End this season has not gone unnoticed by those who are tasked with guiding his career. It seems he is modelling his game on David's, too. The descriptions of his playing style are uncanny. He plays on the right, but has a tendency to drift into central positions; he is economical on the ball, makes good runs into the box and isn't afraid to have a shot. And to top it all off…he is pretty accurate with a dead ball, too. Sound familiar? David Beckham takes one of his trademark free-kicks during his playing days with Manchester United . Brooklyn Beckham is held by his mother, Victoria, at the Harper's Bazaar Women of the Year Awards 2013 . Brooklyn (right) plays with brothers Cruz (left) and Romeo during his father David's time with PSG . He isn't the strongest, though. His 15-year-old frame is still slight and there's a feeling he needs to toughen and bulk up, a problem many young players have. It is also said that he could work harder on his defensive duties during matches. Whether Brooklyn is given another year at Arsenal remains to be seen — but what's for sure is Beckham Snr will be there to celebrate or commiserate with his son. David has been the driving force — literally — behind Brooklyn's career so far. Schedule permitting, David will invariably drive his sons to Hale End for their evening training sessions and Saturday matches. If he is unavailable, then grandfather Ted will step in. David — like all parents — is sent regular email updates with scheduling details for training, matches and meeting times. The emails also provide details of regular 10-minute meetings parents are required to attend to discuss players' progress. David ensures he regularly attends. By all accounts, there are no airs or graces about the Beckham clan when they're at Hale End. One source said: 'Brooklyn is a down-to-earth kid, the other parents like him, too. He is a credit to the family. You wouldn't know he was David Beckham's son.' Devoted dad David regularly drives his sons to their training sessions and games for Arsenal's youth sides . David and his sons in LA Galaxy kits ahead of the match with Houston Dynamo in the 2012 MLS Cup . David insists on it. He knows the value of the English youth system and wants Brooklyn to have the same football upbringing he had. There seems a good chance that at least one of the Beckham brothers will continue the family's football legacy.

"Brendan Rodgers has brought Mario Balotelli crashing back down to earth with a warning he must improve his work rate to become a success at Anfield. Liverpool's manager yesterday clarified the controversy around Balotelli's spot-kick against Besiktas, insisting the Italy striker was justified in taking the responsibility off Jordan Henderson as he is No 2 penalty taker to Steven Gerrard, who was not on the pitch. Rodgers was unhappy with the bickering that took place after the penalty had been awarded but of far greater concern to him was the way Balotelli played after he had given Liverpool a lead to take to Istanbul. Maverick striker Mario Balotelli joined Liverpool from Milan last summer for a £16 million fee . Brendan Rodgers insists that Balotelli must improve his work-rate if he is to be a success at Anfield . Balotelli has scored just four goals in 22 games for Liverpool so far this season . The 24-year-old has garnered a reputation throughout his career for poor discipline and attitude . This was the former Manchester City player's third big contribution in 10 days, following his goal against Tottenham that secured three points and a free-kick that created Adam Lallana's winner at Crystal Palace. But Rodgers is still looking for much more from his £16 million summer signing. Balotelli has been the subject of public criticism from Rodgers before, notably on Boxing Day when he explained that the 24-year-old's qualities did not fit Liverpool's system. When asked if he had been happy with Balotelli's cameo against Besiktas, Rodgers replied: 'No. Not really. No. We need to ensure that we have everyone working as a team and once we got the penalty he stops working. 'He needs to improve on that facet of his game — to play in his position rather than standing on the side of the football field. He has contributed. He has got the penalty and scored the goal but that is what he is paid to do. 'So he needs to keep that efficiency in his game and show that he can affect the team whether he is asked to play from the bench or from the start. If he works harder than when he came on, he will (become an influence).' Balotelli insists to Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson that he should take the penalty against Besiktas . When all is said and done though, Balotelli does have a very good penalty taking record . Liverpool beat Besiktas 1-0 in the first-leg of their Europa League round of 32 tie on Thursday . One of the main qualities Rodgers looks for in a forward is an ability to relentlessly press and put opponents on the back foot. 'In a different country and a different style of football (scoring goals) would be all that matters,' said Rodgers. 'But in this team it is more than that.' Balotelli was roundly condemned for his behaviour before Thursday night's winning spot-kick and former Liverpool midfielder and Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp believes the Italian is coming to the end of his time at Anfield. He said: 'The problem with Mario is I don't think he has got a lot of respect for anybody. 'He has worked with some of the best managers in Cesare Prandelli, Jose Mourinho, Roberto Mancini — everybody has tried with this man but nobody seems to get to the bottom of it. 'The objective is to put the ball into the back of the net, thankfully that is what he did, but it is not nice to see players arguing like that on the field. 'He is an incredibly confident penalty taker and very good at it, but it is that lack of respect that he has.' Balotelli has been prone to high-profile controversies at all of his former clubs . Explaining the penalty situation, Rodgers continued: 'Steven and Mario are the top two penalty takers, but neither of them were on the pitch at the start so Jordan was nominated. 'But when we had a penalty Mario had come on to the field so Jordan, being someone with responsibility and trust, gave the penalty to Mario so there was no issue. There was a little bit of a kerfuffle around it because he wanted to make sure Mario was happy to take it, but that was it really. 'If you are the vice-captain and the captain is on the bench and then he comes on, it is the etiquette to give him the armband. It is a similar thing with the penalty. 'Mario has scored nearly 30 penalties in big games and he is an outstanding penalty taker. Jordan was happy enough to take it, but he gave it to Mario. There is no drama.' Rodgers, whose side travel to Southampton tomorrow, stressed that no decision has been made about whether Henderson will take over the captaincy when Gerrard eventually moves to LA Galaxy. 'Jordan showed what a team player he is,' said Rodgers. 'People see him as that automatic next captain but that's not necessarily the case. People are trying to catapult him into the next Steven Gerrard but he is a totally different player. He is working his role very well.' Jordan Henderson has been praised by his manager as a 'team player' after Liverpool's win over Besiktas .

"Tottenham have been given the green light for the £400million redevelopment of White Hart Lane after a High Court challenge was rejected. A local business had threatened to derail the development by challenging the compulsory purchase order that Spurs needed to get hold of the land to build the new 56,000-seat stadium. And with a planning application already accepted by Haringey Council, Tottenham can now go ahead with the build that they hope will be completed in time for the 2018-19 season. Tottenham have the go-ahead for their new 56,000-plus capacity stadium at White Hart Lane . How Tottenham's new stadium, given the go-ahead on Friday, will look for night games from 2018-19 . Archway Sheet Metal Works, which is located next to White Hart Lane on the last patch of land Tottenham Hotspur need for their stadium development argued that the compulsory purchase order was unlawful . Harry Kane celebrates in front of the Spurs faithful who could soon be enjoying goals at a new home . This should be the final hurdle cleared for Tottenham in terms of obstacles to the building of a new 56,000-seat White Hart Lane. Archway Sheet Metal Works have been denied permission to appeal - however, they can still ask the Court of Appeal judges directly to consider the case. They have 21 days to do so. Spurs hope that with this challenge concluded they will be able to open the new stadium in time for start of the 2018-19 season. Archway Sheet Metal Works, in Paxton Road, Tottenham, asked a judge to quash the order on the grounds that it was 'unlawful and invalid' but were told there was no 'legal flaw' in the decision-making process. If Archway had won it could have thrown plans for the world-class development into disarray. They have been refused permission to appeal, although they can still ask the Court of Appeal judges directly to consider the case. They have 21 days to do so. Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. The owners also they have received 'bomb threats'. Mr Josif, a 46-year-old Tottenham fan who runs the business, said at the time of the fire: 'People were calling us and threatening us and we were receiving bomb threats and that started a few months ago, but we don't know if that's got anything to do with it.' Tottenham fans stand in front of an image of the proposed new stadium outside White Hart Lane . Archway (pictured here) could have thrown the plans for the world-class development into disarray . Archway's building (seen here in the background, left) is next to White Hart Lane (right) and the redevelopment area (left) for the new revamped stadium in north London . April 2008 - Spurs began investigations into the Wingate industrial estate adjacent to White Hart Lane with a view to stadium expansion. December 2008 - Designs for the new stadium are unveiled. An intended completion date of the start of the 2012-13 season was revealed by Daniel Levy. April 2009 - Tottenham announce they will issue 30m new shares to raise £15m for the first stage of the proposed development. October 2009 - Planning application to Haringey Council is submitted. May 2010 - Tottenham withdraw planning application and submit a revised plan. March 2013 - West Ham are confirmed as Olympic Stadium tenants and Tottenham focus all attentions on the current project. April 2013 - Public Inquiry is held about last remaining properties to be acquired. July 2014 - Secretary of State Eric Pickles grants compulsory purchase order for the last piece of land. February 2015 - Archway are informed there is no legal flaw in Tottenham's compulsory purchase order, removing the final hurdle. Mr Justice Dove said the Josif family trustees had been perfectly entitled to 'fight the appropriation of their land at each stage of the process in a legitimate and proper exercise of their rights.' But the judge added: 'It follows from my conclusions I am satisfied there was no legal flaw in the process and it was in the public interest that this (purchase order) be made.' The defeated Josif family members left court without making any immediate comment. They have been ordered to pay the Community Secretary's legal costs. Both Spurs and Haringey Council applied for part of their costs to be paid by Archway, but the judge dismissed their applications. The first phase of Tottenham's plan for the new stadium was completed in November 2013 with the opening of a Sainsbury's supermarket on the site on the new complex. The plan for the design of the stadium itself includes a one-tier stand - similar to Liverpool's famous Kop - at one end, and will be bowl-shaped in a similar style to north London rivals Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. The project further aims to regenerate the Tottenham area with a central square, shops, housing and the refurbishment of existing buildings included in the club's plans. Last November, a mystery fire gutted the Archway premises, which is alongside White Hart Lane's North Stand. The owners also said they had received 'bomb threats' The owners of the firm have been in a dispute with Spurs for the last decade over its redevelopment plans .

"After various meetings between Chelsea’s directors, plus frantic telephone calls to owner Roman Abramovich, the club wisely went with the main man. Jose Mourinho is the most powerful and convincing voice at Chelsea, perhaps the only person who can get through to those who racially abused the Parisian commuter, Souleymane S. ‘I’m not the right person so many politicians, so many people directly involved in something that is difficult for society,’ he pleaded. And yet, deep down, there was no other person to take care of this in public. Jose Mourinho admitted he felt 'ashamed' by the racially-motivated incident involving Chelsea fans . Mourinho, pictured during Chelsea training on Friday, was dismayed and disappointed by Tuesday's incident . Commuter Souleymane S attempts to board a train but is refused entry by fans travelling to the match . The man attempts to forcibly gain entry to the Metro train but struggles with passengers already on board . The amateur footage goes on to show passengers in the carriage following the disgraceful incident . The reality about Mourinho’s sombre appearance at their Cobham training centre on Friday afternoon is that, for once, it was not an act. His dismay and disappointment, at the moment he referred to ‘the humiliation’ of the black commuter, was evident. At times he paused for reflection, struggling to articulate his feelings on this subject. Mourinho said: ‘We feel ashamed, but maybe we shouldn’t. I refuse to be connected with these people. I support the idea of the gentleman coming to the match, even though I don’t know whether (he) loves football.' Chelsea have written to Souleymane, inviting him and his family to the second leg at Stamford Bridge. Souleymane, in an interview given to BBC Radio 5 Live, argued that Chelsea hold a degree of liability. ‘Chelsea are partly responsible and I have brought a complaint,’ he said. ‘Chelsea need to call my lawyers and they haven’t done that yet, unlike PSG. I haven’t had any reply from Chelsea. Nothing.’ The commuter, Souleymane S, has been invited to attend a game at Stamford Bridge by Mourinho . A club spokesman on behalf of Abramovich added: ‘We were appalled. The club would also like to apologise unreservedly to Souleymane for the behaviour of a small number of individuals and their unforgivable actions towards him.’ ‘I’m not saying there’s no racism in football,’ Mourinho added. ‘But it’s society, it’s underground, it’s public transport, maybe this is not football. Maybe the people with the Chelsea scarf, or the Chelsea flag, maybe they don’t even like football or don’t like Chelsea. 'I feel ashamed to be connected to this sad episode. My feeling is the feeling of everyone at the club. We are very sorry. We want to fight it. We feel ashamed and we want to apologise to the gentleman. ‘Even if he doesn’t like football, put him in the director’s box, people will give him a reaction and he will realise that Chelsea is completely the opposite of what happened. ‘I’m sure he will get a fantastic reaction, in a way where the fans can express how sad they were about it.’ A club spokesman revealed Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich  is 'disgusted' by the incident . The Chelsea manager had only watched footage of the despicable incident once, turning on the television at his home in the early hours of Wednesday morning after he was alerted by the club’s head of communications. The players felt it too, with most of the conversations on the plane home after their 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain revolving around the incident on the metro. ‘The players had the same reaction as we had,’ Mourinho said. ‘I am sure this dressing room is always a dressing room with big principles of equality. We had everything, not just race but also religion.’ To Chelsea’s credit they have acted with speed and courage to identify five individuals already — three on Thursday and two more yesterday — and suspend them from Stamford Bridge while police in Paris and London continue with their investigations. On Friday night the Metropolitan Police released three images of Chelsea fans they wish to speak to in relation to the incident. The Metropolitan police released images of three men they are keen to speak to following the incident in Paris . Branislav Ivanovic gives Chelsea the lead on Tuesday night in their Champions League last 16 tie with PSG . The Chelsea team applaud their travelling fans at the Parc des Princes stadium on Tuesday night . Chelsea fan Caroline Rice has started a campaign entitled 'An invitation to Souleymane' in a bid to show the Paris resident he will always be welcome at Stamford Bridge. Rice is attempting to raise £2,000 in order to invite Souleymane, his wife and children to London for a weekend. The campaign had already raised £347 by Friday afternoon. Click here to view the fundraising page . Pressed on the appropriate punishment, if Chelsea or the authorities are capable of proving a case against anyone singing ‘we’re racist, we’re racist, we’re racist, and that’s the way we like it,’ Mourinho’s solution was final. ‘Everybody has to know that the club is ready to finish it,’ he said. ‘No more Stamford Bridge for them. Unfortunately this will not be the last episode — emphatically.’ It was depressing to hear Chelsea’s manager utter those words, but deep down we know it is true. ‘I imagine myself in that same situation, I want to go home after a day of work and a couple of guys they kick me out of my public transport. It is difficult to believe this can happen in modern times.’ As Mourinho made his way through this minefield, he was also asked to distinguish this incident with the FA’s proven case of racial abuse directed at Anton Ferdinand by Chelsea’s captain John Terry. Chelsea fans let off a flare inside the Parc des Princes during the last 16 first leg encounter on Tuesday night . Chelsea fans are kept back by police after the final whistle of the Champions League last 16 encounter . Chelsea’s manager had been expecting it and there was an admission, perhaps for the first time by the club, that some inappropriate comments had been made. He insisted, though, that Terry is not a racist. He added: ‘The only thing I know is 100 per cent, John is not a racist. ‘He had a bad episode, I don’t know, maybe. But I assure you, and you ask every player who has shared the dressing room with John, they would tell you he is not a racist.’ Sadly, he can’t say the same about a section of Chelsea supporters.

"Stuart Lancaster doesn’t tend to seek selection guidance from Hollywood actors, but he was given some on Friday, as Russell Crowe made a case for the fast-tracking of his friend Sam Burgess. The big-screen ‘Gladiator’ is in the UK to watch South Sydney Rabbitohs - the Australian rugby league team he co-owns - compete in Sunday’s World Club Challenge against St Helens at Langtree Park. Having repeatedly eulogised about Burgess’s heroic contribution to the side’s first NRL title in 43 years, Crowe argued that Bath’s cross-code recruit should be rapidly promoted into the full England squad by head coach Lancaster.

You want your top 30 athletes representing the country and he has to be among the top 30 athletes in rugby union right now.’ A number of England squad players will be in action this weekend, after being released back to their clubs - with several on duty at the AJ Bell Stadium in Salford.

The Italy striker was accused of being a little bit disrespectful by Steven Gerrard after he took the ball off Jordan Henderson in the dying moments of their last 32 clash with Besiktas. But Rodgers, who feels 'a drama' has been made out of the incident, explained the system that is in place for what happens if Liverpool get a penalty. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Brendan Rodgers: Mario Balotelli right choice to take penalty . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers surveys training on Friday, having defended Mario Balotelli . Balotelli (right) shares a laugh with Raheem Sterling after his penalty spat at Anfield on Thursday night . Henderson (right) was also back in training at Melwood on Friday with Emre Can and Daniel Sturridge . Gerrard is the No1 taker but, in his absence last night, Henderson was designated to take over, given that Balotellli was a substitute. Once Balotelli came on, however, he was entitled to take charge of the situation as Rodgers says he is Gerrard's deputy. Rodgers said: 'Steven and Mario are the top two penalty takers, but obviously neither of them were on the pitch at the start so you have to nominate someone. Jordan was nominated, but when we had a penalty Mario had come onto the field. 'So Jordan, being someone with responsibility and trust, gave the penalty to Mario so there was no issue. There was a little bit of a kerfuffle around it because he wanted to make sure Mario was happy to take it, but that was it really. Mario Balotelli celebrates his late penalty at Anfield which gave Liverpool a crucial 1-0 win over Besiktas . Balotelli and Sturridge clash at Anfield over who should take the late penalty in the Europa League clash . 'I always assign responsibility every single game and I think in my time here that was been the first time this has ever reared its head. We have a whole raft of penalty takers here who are outstanding. Rickie Lambert has hardly missed a penalty in his career, so there is another taker if he is on the pitch. 'If you are the vice captain and the captain is on the bench and then he comes on, then it is the etiquette to give him the armband. It is a similar thing with the penalty. 'If Steven is on the field there is no drama. He is the first choice penalty taker. After that if Mario is on the field he takes the penalty. His history shows he scored nearly 30 penalties in big games and he is an outstanding penalty taker. Balotelli (left) takes the ball from the stand-in skipper despite his initial protests . Sturridge (left) looked furious with his fellow striker Balotelli for questioning Henderson's authority . While Besiktas' players argued with the referee over the penalty, Liverpool argued among themselves . Steven Gerrard, working as a pundit for ITV, accused Balotelli of being a little bit disrespectful . 'But at the start none of them were on, so Jordan was the nominated penalty taker. Jordan was happy enough to take it, but he gave it to Mario. It is his goal there is no drama.' Rodgers, whose side travel to Southampton on Sunday, was quick to praise Henderson for his maturity in the situation but he made a point of stressing that no decision has been made about whether the England international will take over the club captaincy when Gerrard eventually moves to LA Galaxy. Rodgers said: 'Jordan showed what a team player he is. Mario is an outstanding penalty taker and we won the game. Jordan showed what a leader he is. 'People see him as that automatic next captain but that is not necessarily the case. People are trying to catapult him into the next Steven Gerrard but he is a totally different player. He is working his role very well. It is a very, very important role.' The Italian striker eventually stepped up to fire in the winning penalty for Liverpool on Thursday night . All was well in the end though when Balotelli fired the penalty into Cenk Gonen's bottom corner for a 1-0 win . Balotelli's actions  angered some of his team-mates, and the striker's long-term future could be in doubt .","Brendan Rodgers' side beat Besiktas 1-0 at Anfield in the Europa League .

"Manuel Pellegrini has hailed Wilfried Bony as the ‘perfect player’ for his squad as the £28million striker prepares to make his debut for Manchester City against Newcastle on Saturday evening. Bony scored nine goals for Swansea in the first half of the season after netting 25 times for the Welsh club during the previous campaign and Pellegrini believes the forward’s familiarity with his surroundings will see him make a strong start to his career at the Etihad Stadium. ‘I think that Bony will be an important player for us,’ the Chilean manager said. ‘He will be in the squad list we will see if he will be in the starting 11 or after that have some minutes but he works with our team the whole week without any problems. Wilfried Bony could make his debut against Newcastle after arriving at Manchester City for £28million . The former Swansea striker scored nine goals for the Welsh club in the first half of the season . City boss Manuel Pellegrini has described the Ivory Coast international as the 'perfect player' for his squad . City now have the top four goal scorers from the Premier League last year: . 1. Wilfried Bony - 18 . 2. Sergio Aguero - 16 . 3. Edin Dzeko - 14 . 4. Yaya Toure - 14 . 5. Daniel Sturridge - 13 . 6. Wayne Rooney - 13 . ‘He plays a lot of years here in England, he is the player that scores most goals during the last year. ‘I think he has all the conditions to be an important player because we try always to play with two strikers. He is the perfect player for our squad. 'He knows the Premier League, he knows our team so I think it will be easy for him to settle in in a good way. ‘We always play with a lot of movement so our strikers always have the freedom to choose in the best place they must be in every play. ‘He can play with Sergio Aguero, he can play with Edin Dzeko, he can play with Stevan Jovetic, he can play with David Silva - he can play with all the players in our team.’ James Milner (left) has been ruled out of Saturday's Premier League clash with a knee injury . One player Bony cannot play with on Saturday is James Milner with the England midfielder suffering with a knee problem . Pellegrini described the problem as not serious but said Milner was a doubt for Tuesday’s Champions League tie with Barcelona, a particular concern given that Yaya Toure is suspended for the last 16 tie. ‘He is talking with the doctor about all the situations,’ Pellegrini said. ‘I don’t think it will be very serious. We’ll see how he improves in the next days.’","Wilfried Bony was signed by Manchester City for £28m from Swansea .

"A law firm invented scores of 'touching' love stories about foreign couples to convince immigration authorities that their sham marriages were real, a court heard yesterday. Solicitor Tevfick Souleiman and three immigration advisers working for him made 'substantial' sums by forging documents to hoodwink the UK Border Agency during the eight year scam, it was alleged. Brides were flown into Britain from eastern European EU countries to marry non-EU citizens, giving the grooms rights to live and work in the UK, the Old Bailey was told. Accused: A solicitor and his three advisors organised thousands of sham marriages between illegal immigrants and EU Citizens, a court heard today. Defendants Tevfick Souleiman, right and Cenk Guclu, left, are pictured . In some cases the couples only met . each other at the solicitor's office on one occasion before their . wedding day and were banned from any other contact, prosecutor Nicholas . Mather said. But the firm organised forged . affidavits in which they 'concocted' accounts of their supposedly . romantic courtships which were submitted to the authorities in order for . the marriages to be approved, he said. In one, Albanian Alban Spaho, . described how he met his Bulgarian bride-to-be Petya Zlatanska while on a . day out with friends in Haringey, North London in 2008 and plucked up . the courage approach her. The affidavit said: 'We went to a cafe . where our friends left us alone to get on with it... Petya was a bit . shy but I eventually persuaded her to let me take her out. 'We didn't go to any of the usual . Bulgarian or Albanian places in North London but instead went to a . really nice place in the West end.' He described how the couple's love . grew and they moved in together, adding: 'After three months I realised I . wanted to be with her all the time and asked her to marry me.' Sham: The gang arranged for brides or husbands from the UK or the EU to marry non EU individuals, the court heard. Defendant Zafer Altinbas is pictured . In fact the letter was a 'script' written by staff at the north London offices of Souleiman GA Solicitors, the prosecutor said. In another allegedly forged affidavit a . sham marriage groom described how he met his bride a nightclub and . after they got together, he eventually proposed after a romantic meal on . Valentine's Day. One Indian student who wanted to stay . in the UK told how he was introduced to his Bulgarian bride to be at the . firm's offices when he went to ask for immigration advice . He was taken outside to have some . photos of them together taken, before being told he couldn't talk to her . until the day of their marriage, it was alleged. The marriages were going ahead despite . the regular use of same addresses and a number of errors on . applications including names of the applicants being misspelt, the jury . heard. The solicitor's firm also used forged tenancy agreements and employer's references, many from a company called Kebab Town. Mr Mather said: 'They, together with . others, were part of a conspiracy to breach immigration laws in this . country by arranging sham marriages, or marriages of convenience. 'In doing so, they made a sizeable amount of money. The arrangement of these marriages was a lucrative business. 'Whatever may be recorded in the . books, substantial sums were being paid to individuals to arrange these . marriages. This was a cash business.' Mr Mather said other work of the solicitors, such as conveyancing, was legitimate. But he added: 'They were running not only a business but also a racket involving sham marriages. 'Substantial amounts would be paid . into personal bank accounts. Clients would pay the firm £500 in . accounts, but the actual sum was thousands of pounds. That money never . went through the books.' Souleiman, 39, immigration advisers . Zafer Altinbas, 38, and Cenk Guclu, 41, and Furrah Kosimov, 29, deny . conspiracy to breach immigration law between 2004 and last year. Souleiman, from Hatfield, . Hertfordshire, Altinbas, from Islington, north London, and Guclu, from . Enfield, north London, also deny receiving proceeds of crime. Kosimov, from Wembley, north west London, who is being tried in his absence, denies money laundering.

"Harry Redknapp believes England could win Euro 2016 and insists 'we might as well all give up' if tournament victory eludes the Three Lions next year. Roy Hodgson's side could not progress beyond the 2014 World Cup group stages, but Redknapp believes it should be a different story next summer in France with the current crop of young players at England's disposal. 'There are some really talented players and Roy's squad for the Euros is going to the best we've had for some time,' the former QPR and Tottenham manager told talkSPORT. Former QPR manager Harry Redknapp believes England are capable of winning Euro 2016 . He said Roy Hodgson's squad ought to give up if they don't as it is the best chance England will get . He singled out Liverpool duo Daniel Sturridge (left) and Raheem Sterling (right) as important individuals . 'If we don't win the Euros we ought to give up because it's the best opportunity we're going to have. It's a really good group at the moment.' Redknapp, who stepped down as QPR boss earlier this month, singled out the likes of Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge, Harry Kane and Ross Barkley for special praise and believes they could help England claim their first piece of major silverware since the 1966 World Cup. He added: 'England has got three or four young players emerging now in time for Euro 2016. Roy will have a team that can really compete. 'I would be disappointed if we don't at least get to the semi-finals and then I could see us having a real go at winning it.' The candid interview also saw Redknapp describe his 2012 tax evasion court case as 'absolute nonsense', claim that Tottenham's board had 'blown the chance' to sign Eden Hazard and Thibaut Courtois, refer to Joey Barton as 'high-maintenance' and also criticise Adel Taarabt. Ross Barkley (left) was added to that list, as was Harry Kane (right), who will be in Roy Hodgson's next squad .

"When Louis van Gaal made the stunning selections of youngsters Tyler Blackett and Jesse Lingard in his very first Manchester United team in the Premier League, jaws hit the Old Trafford floor. We knew Van Gaal was no ordinary manager, but this was team selection from the Twilight Zone. Yet no-one could have predicted that the Dutchman would go on to become the top-flight's biggest Tinkerman. Even Claudio Ranieri's Chelsea sides look predictable compared with the chopping and changing at United this season. You've about as much chance of predicting the lottery numbers as you have trying to second guess who Van Gaal will pick to start against Swansea on Sunday in the reverse of the opening fixture of the season. But, after a quick call to Mystic Meg, a comparison between Van Gaal's first selection and the most likely United team to start at the Liberty Stadium makes for stunning reading. Louis van Gaal's first Premier League game in charge at Manchester United sprang a few surprises . Van Gaal watched on as his United team, which included two stunning selections, lost to Swansea . Wayne Rooney scored United's first goal of the season and is one of the only survivors from the team . Jesse Lingard (left) and Tyler Blackett (right) were the two biggest shocks in Van Gaal's first league team . Only four players from the team who were sunk 2-1 at Old Trafford are likely to be handed the chance to wreak revenge on Swansea after a season of enormous upheaval. David De Gea, Chris Smalling and Wayne Rooney look certain to survive the cull after the opening-day defeat, although which position the England captain will feature in is anyone's guess as he is shunted from centre forward to No 10, central midfield, defensive midfield and then back up front again. Blackett, 20, and Lingard, 22, have both been deemed below the required standard to make Van Gaal's team - at least for now - while Javier Hernandez joined Real Madrid on loan in September and Darren Fletcher packed his bags for West Brom in January. But there are others who have since fallen victim to Van Gaal's tactical whims. Phil Jones, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera have all enjoyed extended stints in the United team but are far from certain starters. After his goalscoring return in the FA Cup win against Preston, Herrera looks the more likely to start. Ashley Young established himself as a favourite of Van Gaal's on the left flank in the former Holland boss's much-maligned 3-5-2 formation but is only making his way back from a torn hamstring suffered on New Year's Day. Gylfi Sigurdsson (second left) struck the decisive blow as Swansea stunned Old Trafford . United's team since that day is much-changed, with the likes of Darren Fletcher (left) having left the club . How United lined up against Swansea on the opening day of the season, in a 3-5-2 formation . Of those who started on the bench back in August, only the unconvincing Adnan Januzaj and the reborn Marouane Fellaini are in contention for the reverse fixture at Swansea. Ben Amos has gone on loan to Bolton, Michael Keane made his loan to Burnley permanent last month, while Reece James is still yet to play for the Red Devils. Shinji Kagawa was sent back to his adoring fans at Borussia Dortmund and Nani went on a temporary move to Sporting Lisbon. Meanwhile, Van Gaal has splurged over £150million on a wealth of talent, who have carried United to third in the table and kept the club on course for a Champions League spot without ever offering convincing evidence that they are growing into a top-class team. Marcos Rojo (£16m) and Luke Shaw (£30m, but signed before Van Gaal's arrival) are likely to start at the Liberty. Shaw was missing from United's season opener along with fellow injury victims Robin van Persie, Michael Carrick, Evans and Antonio Valencia, who is another Van Gaal favourite at right wing-back or right back if needed. Angel Di Maria arrived for £60m from Real Madrid last summer in a British record transfer buy . Radamel Falcao has struggled to find his feet at United and looks set for the drop again . Robin van Persie (right) missed the season opener and has not hit top form this term . Pitch map showing how United could* line up at Swansea on Saturday (*NOTE 'could') But it is further forward where United's spending spree has made the most impact on the team. Angel Di Maria, the British record £60m buy from Real Madrid, and Daley Blind, who cost £15m from Ajax, are almost certain to start in central midfield. Victor Valdes, the former Barcelona keeper who joined as a free agent in January, is likely to be joined on the bench by young defender Patrick McNair and possibly another young player, 19-year-old striker James Wilson. He will be competing for a spot with Radamel Falcao, whose £6m loan from Monaco on £250,000-per-week wages is proving to be a costly and embarrassing mistake. The Colombia striker has been Van Gaal's first-choice in recent weeks but his miserable form surely means demotion to the bench or even further into the abyss. After all the ins and outs, Van Gaal's matchday squad of 18 is likely to include just nine of those who saw in the new season full of hope that their new Dutch manager would lead them to a title triumph after a year in the doldrums after Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. It is not just the personnel that has changed at Old Trafford since then, but the attitude. (3-5-2) GK David de Gea . DF Phil Jones . DF Chris Smalling . DF Tyler Blackett . LW Ashley Young .

"Devin Toner is still getting used to the profile that comes with being Paul O’Connell’s partner in the Ireland second row. Walking through Temple Bar in Dublin, a youngster asks the 6ft 11in forward: ‘Are you famous?’ His bashful response is: ‘No, not at all.’ Once the fan is out of sight, he adds: ‘I think most people only stop me because I’m tall, rather than the fact I play rugby.’ Devin Toner has made a huge impact in the Ireland team as they start this year's Six Nations undefeated . The lock (pictured outside Dublin's Temple Bar) is the tallest player in this year's Six Nations . Toner (third left) stands out at 6ft 11in as he signs the Ireland national anthem with his team-mates . The forward (second left) started Ireland's 18-11 win vs France on February 14 at the Aviva Stadium . He is every inch the reluctant celebrity, but as the tallest player in the RBS 6 Nations it is difficult to blend into the background. The 28-year-old has been a late bloomer on the international stage and - having been fondly known as the Big Friendly Giant during his school days - reveals he had to develop an abrasive edginess to ensure that his oversized frame can fulfil its destructive potential. ‘People used to say I wasn’t mean enough and I would just roll with the punches,’ said Toner. ‘I was always the BFG as a teenager. I wasn’t someone to throw my weight around. It’s not like I’ve suddenly developed a mean streak, but I’ve had to work on that ability to physically dominate my opponent. I’ve had my fair share of critics and I’ve had to develop that edge. You leave the nice guy approach behind when you get on the pitch.’ Speaking at his home in the Portobello suburb of Dublin, Toner explains how the collection of cards on his shelves are not in recognition of his rugby successes, but in congratulation for his engagement to girlfriend Mary Scott. The couple are in the process of renovating their terraced house and one of the first jobs is to remove a beam in the kitchen that is precariously low for a man of Toner’s height. The former Castlerock College student used to have teenage angst about his size, but it now pays the bills for the Leinster forward. Toner (right) spoke to Sportsmail's Nik Simon in an interview at his home in the Portobello suburb of Dublin . Toner says his height has led him to being called 'Mongo' from the film Shrek by team-mate Jonathan Sexton . The 28-year-old's terraced house is currently being renovated with plans to remove a beam in their kitchen . Toner's main passion as a kid was Gaelic football before taking rugby seriously late on in his teenage years . ‘Jonny Sexton (Ireland fly-half) calls me Mongo after the gingerbread man in Shrek,’ said Toner. ‘I was 6ft by the time I was 11 and there have always been nicknames - it was High Tower at college. But no-one ever bullied me and I didn’t bully anyone either, it was just one of those things. When you’re around 13 or 14 there was that typical teenage awkwardness because you would stand out and be a bit self-conscious, but you get used to it. I was fat as well - one of my other nicknames was chunky!’ Toner’s father works in shipping and his mother was previously employed by Guinness. His brother, Dara, is 6ft 6in, and his sister, Emma, is 5ft 10in. Growing up in the County Meath countryside, he previously played Gaelic football and only started to take rugby seriously during his later teenage years. His development has been closely monitored by Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, with the pair working together at Leinster between 2010 and 2013, before the Kiwi took up the position as national coach. Schmidt has been hailed as the brains behind Ireland’s resurgence and, according to Toner, there is no one better in the business. ‘He’s one of the best coaches in the world,’ said Toner. ‘His attention to detail is phenomenal and every little thing has to be spot on. After we lost to New Zealand (in 2013), he went back through the whole thing and picked apart every detail. There was a missed tackle here, or an unnecessary man in the ruck there that compromised the defensive line. He stopped it at every point - he has the video analysts working some pretty long hours.’ Toner has hailed Ireland coach Joe Schmidt (right) as 'one of the best in the world' Toner cites Schmidt's attention to detail as a key factor in Ireland's resurgence in the sport . Schmidt's arrival has seen Toner become a regular starter in the Ireland setup over the last 12 months . Schmidt’s appointment as Ireland coach ties in with Toner’s resurgence in the Test arena. Despite making his international debut back in 2010, Toner has doubled his number of starts in the green jersey over the last 12 months. He has become a key component in the line-out and has been making more of an impact at the collision area, working on his ability to get low. Toner fits into Schmidt’s vision and reveals how the New Zealander has changed the ethos at the Dublin-based camps. ‘He’s very consumed with rugby and winning,’ said Toner. ‘I’ve never really been for a beer with him but he puts a huge amount of hours into his job and he’s very, very focused in that way. There’s been a bit of a shift in mentality since he took over. ‘Before you might hear stories about some of the lads being worse for wear on a Monday morning, but if you’re not 100 per cent now then you’re pretty much out of the team.’ Toner is confident Ireland will earn a positive result against England then they meet in Dublin on March 1 . Like a fine wine, Toner has reached an age where there are far less doubts about his place in the starting XV. He is expected to line up against England next Sunday and the winning team will finish the weekend on top of the Six Nations standings. But has there been any mention of the Grand Slam? ‘It isn’t really talked about,’ added Toner. ‘But your goal is obviously to win every game. England are an exciting young team and they have some lads making a name for themselves. ‘There will be a few extra cameras at training and there will be a bit more hype, but we’ll just be focused on the challenge in hand. ‘We’ll have it up against us, but I think we’ll hold our own.’","Ireland host England in their Six Nations encounter on March 1 .

"More than 70million Americans - or one in five of the population - is on mind-altering drugs, a new study reported by WND.com has found. The shocking survey revealed that prescription drug abuse as well as illegal narcotics use has reached epidemic proportions across the country. Nearly 50 million people are thought to have been given high-strength substances by their doctors - leading to an alarming spike in drug-related deaths. The death of movie star of Philip Seymour Hoffman from an apparent heroin overdose again promoted the spectre of illicit substances in the country's psyche. Overdose: Philip Seymour Hoffman was found dead in his New York apartment in a suspected heroin overdose . But new research by the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested the far greater hazard is posed by over the counter prescription drugs, such as anti-depressants, sleeping pills and anxiety relief substances. Experts have warned legal substances . caused more overdose deaths than heroine and cocaine combined during the . past decade, according to the U.S. report. In 2010 more than 250 million prescriptions for antidepressants were written for Americans. Dangers: experts have spoken out about how people using the pills can become too afraid to stop, even when they do not need them any more . A staggering 27,000 unintentional overdoses deaths were ascribed to prescription drugs in a single year, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention found. Experts have warned that prescription drug addiction has reached epidemic proportions . The organisation was so alarmed by the . figures, its report noted, WND reports, that: 'Prescription drug abuse is the fastest . growing drug problem in the United States.' For the last decade, 'more overdose deaths have involved opioid analgesics than heroin and cocaine combined.' It . feared the rise in the rate of opioid analgesics prescriptions – drugs . marketed under the brand names Norco, . Vicodin, Dilaudid, Exalgo, OxyContin, Percocet, Astramorph, Avinza - was . likely to drive the trend even higher in the coming years. The dangerous implications of so many people being prescribed these powerful mind-altering substances are finally being understood. Recent research is beginning to draw a link between a popular sleeping pill called Ambien and - called as a hypnotic drug - to a series of crimes and serious accidents. The drug was famously thought to have been a factor in a car crash involving the-Republican Patrick Kennedy. Research into school shootings and violence among young people is finding links with the use of anti depressants. Four and nine million by most estimates, mostly boys – to take Ritalin or similar dangerous psycho-stimulant drugs which can have similar  side effects to cocaine or the amphetamines. 19 percent of high school-age boys in the U.S. are being diagnosed with ADHD and about 10 percent are currently being prescribed drugs for it, while 10 percent of high school-age girls are being likewise diagnosed. Dr. William Graf, a pediatric neurologist in New Haven and Yale medical professor told the New York Times: 'Those are astronomical numbers. I’m floored.'","One in Five adults take prescription psychiatric drugs .

"Radamel Falcao has revealed he was in talks with Manchester United 'for some months' before his deadline day transfer.

"China has built the world's fastest supercomputer - almost twice as fast as the previous U.S. record holder - with speeds equivalent to more than 338 million normal PCs. The Tianhe-2, which means Milky Way 2, was developed by the National University of . Defense Technology in China's Changsha city and is capable of . sustained computing of 33.86 petaflops per second. That's the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second, with the average everyday computer performing around 100 million per second (although some are faster and others may be slower). China's supercomputer Tianhe-2 has been declared the Top500 fastest supercomputer title. It was developed by the country's National University of Defense Technology and is capable of operating at the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second . China's Tianhe-2 supercomputer, which means Milky Way 2, knocked the U.S. Department of Energy's Titan machine off the number one spot.

Mira - U.S. 6. Stampede - U.S. 7. Juqueen - Germany . 8. Vulcan - U.S. 9. SuperMuc - Germany . 10. Tianhe-1A - China . The results were published in the TOP500 report, an official bi-annual listing of the world's faster supercomputers. According to this list, the U.S, dominates the top ten with computers in second, third, fifth, sixth and eighth place. Japan's K computer is in fourth spot. Germany's Juqueen and SuperMuc are in seventh and ninth place, while Tianhe-2's predecessor, Tianhe-1A, is tenth. The Tianhe-1A was first in November 2010 and Japan's K computer overtook in 2011. Each computer on the list was tested against the Linpack benchmark. The Linpack Benchmark is used as a 'yardstick of performance' and was chosen because it is widely used across all relevant systems. The Chinese government said it intends to install the Tianhe-2 equipment at the National Supercomputer Centre in Guangzhou, China where it will be used for 'research and education'. Supercomputers such as the Tianhe-2 are used for simulating nuclear explosions and designing jetliners . According to Linpack, the Tianhe-2 operates at 33.86 petaflop/sec - the equivalent of 33,860 trillion calculations per second. This benchmark measures how the computers would perform in real-world environments, yet if the supercomputer was boosted to peak performance, this could theoretically increase to 54.9 petaflop/sec - 54,900 trillion calculations. It knocked the U.S. Department of Energy's Titan machine off the number one spot, which only achieved 17.59 petaflops per second.

Other supercomputers to make the top five in the twice-yearly TOP500 list include the American Titan, Sequoia and Mira computers as well as Japan's K computer in fourth spot. While Tianhe-2's predecessor, Tianhe-1A, is tenth after topping the list in November 2010 . 'That is, the interconnect, operating system, front-end processors and software are mainly Chinese,' said Dongarra, who toured the Tianhe-2 development facility in May. The twice-yearly list is overseen by Hans Meuer, professor of computer science at the University of Mannheim and this current list was published to coincide with the International Supercomputing Conference in Leipzig, Germany.

"In the cramped conditions of an ant nest, living alongside 100,000 of your work colleagues could get a little messy. Black garden ants, however, appear to have a solution - they build en-suite toilets in the corners of their nests. Biologists have found that the insects are meticulously sanitary when it comes to where they deposit their faeces - leaving them in just one or two places. Black garden ants, like the one pictured above, use specific corners of their nests when going to the toilet . But rather than throwing out the build-up of waste like they do with other rubbish - such as the remains of food and corpses - they leave the toilets in their nests. It suggests that the ants may use put their faeces to some use - perhaps even using it as a place to 'grow' food. While humans and even crows have been found to have a favoured side when performing delicate tasks, it also seems ants may do too. A recent study has found that ants tend to turn left when exploring new surroundings. The behaviour was recorded when Temnothorax albipennis, or rock ants, were put in mazes. In the experiment the ants overwhelmingly chose to turn left, as opposed to right, when exploring the new 'nest'. Why ants may have this bias for the left remains unknown, according to biologists. Dr Tomer Czackzkes, a biologist who led the study at the University of Regensburg, in Germany, said: 'For ants, which like us live in very dense communities, sanitation is a big problem. 'Ants normally keep a very clean nest, and usually throw out dangerous rubbish, like food remains and corpses. 'Some insects use faeces for defense, as building materials, as manure for their crops, and as markings. 'Perhaps these toilets are also gardens for crops, or even stores for valuable nutrients.' The researchers, whose study is published in the journal Public Library of Science One, observed the behaviour of black garden ants, Lasius niger. They were kept in nests built from plaster and given sugary food dyed with either red or blue food dye. The researchers found red and blue dye from the food given to the ants accumulated in the corners of their plaster nests, pictured above, over a two month period, which suggests they were using them as toilets . The scientists then took pictures of the nests and surrounding foraging box they were placed in over the next two months. After two months the ants were removed and the scientists found coloured patches had formed in one to four corners of the nests. The colour was always the same colour as the sugary food the ants had eaten. The scientists said that no coloured patches were found outside the nest, but distinct piles of dead ants and other debris from the nest were found outside. They also gave the ants a protein jelly - which worker ants do not eat and can be lethal to them - and this was also found outside the nest. Black garden ants, shown above in this electron microscope image, are also known by the name Lasius niger . Other social insects are also known to collect their faeces for use - termites use it as a building material while leaf cutter ants use it as fertiliser for the fungi they use as food. Honeybees, however, are known to leave their nests to go on 'defecation flights'. Dr Czackzkes said the toilets may have an anti-microbial function to help prevent the spread of disease in the nests. He said that there did not appear to be any fungi growing on the toilet areas, but when ants were removed from the nest some fungi did grow. He also noticed that the ants did not appear to avoid walking through the toilets and is keen to investigate whether workers carry the brood to these areas of the nest or keep them away. He said: 'The growth of micro-organisms on the toilets may be actively inhibited by the ants, perhaps by the application of formic acid or antibiotic secretions. 'Alternatively, the ants may be using the toilets as a garden, and eating the resulting fruiting bodies, as a way of accessing otherwise inaccessible nutrients from their waste. 'These hypothesised roles for the toilets are open to future investigation.'","Biologists at University of Regensburg studied common black garden ants .

"The Iranian pop star Googoosh has released a music video which champions LGBT rights. The 63-year-old singer, whose real name is Faegheh Atashin, posted a music video for her love song, Behesht (Heaven) on her Facebook page on Valentine’s Day, featuring a lesbian couple. The ex-patriate Iranian star is immensely popular among Iranians of all ages and is one of the first high-profile Iranians to advocate for LGBT rights. Iranian pop star Googoosh released a love song, Behesht, the music video shows a lesbian couple in love and has a pro-LGBT message . The music video for the song is shot from the point of view of an unseen person who turns out to be the woman's lesbian partner . The song’s music video, shows a young woman being interacting with her unseen partner, who proposes to her, gives her tickets to a Googoosh concert, gets harassed by a group of men at a train station and meets the woman’s father who does not approve of the relationship. At the end of the video it is revealed that the couple are both women, played by Iranian actresses Pegah Ferydoni and Yasmine Azadi. 'Don't tell me to run away from love. You couldn't do it, I could not too. We could not go back to where we were,' sings Googoosh. The music video, which has been widely shared on social media, concludes with the women holding hands and the caption ‘Freedom to love for all’. The director of the video, Navid Akhavan, told the Guardian: ‘We knew from the start that because of its topic the video is going to be very controversial among Iranians, that's why we expected negative feedback too, but that hasn't bothered me, nor Googoosh.’ Homosexuality is illegal in Iran. Men who are convicted of homosexuality can be sentenced to death. Women are sentenced to be lashed, but if they are convicted four times, they can be executed on the fourth occasion. In 2012, an Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Abdollah Javadi-Amoli, said in a speech that homosexuals were inferior to dogs and pigs and blamed them for spread of AIDS, reported the Guardian. 'Don't tell me to run away from love': Googoosh is one of the first high-profile Iranians to come out in favour of LGBT rights . Hostility"" In the video the couple face opposition. Homosexuality is illegal in Iran and those convicted of it can be sentenced to death . In the video the couple are bashed by a group of men at a train station, which is reflective of some of the violence and stigmatisation that gay individuals face in Iran . The Behesht video has been denounced by various websites in the country. Khabar Online labelled the video obscene and said it aimed to promote ‘hideous’ acts. Enghelab News said Googoosh was ‘anti-revolutionary’ and that the video was produced to spread decadence in Iranian society. However, many Iranian people have responded to the video with enthusiasm. ‘The reactions we have seen so far have been tremendous,’ said director Navid Akhavan. ‘The comments I have read online and the messages I have received from people within the Iranian LGBT community have brought tears to my eyes.’ The Iranian LGBT community posted the video on their Facebook page, with the excited caption: . ‘Googoosh… the most famous Iranian female singer supports equal love in her new music video!!! There are different reactions towards this video so far. Lots of appreciations by Iranians, and lots of hatred as well. But we just can say BRAVO for risking your fame and doing such thing for kinda the first time in history of Iranian/Persian music.’ Googosh rose to prominence before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. After the revolutions she remained in Iran, though she did not perform in public due to a ban on female singers. She revived her career when she left Iran in 2000 and she has lived in exile since then, it is believed in Los Angeles. Googoosh travels around the world performing to sold-out houses in European and U.S. cities with large Iranian populations. She also has a television show, Googoosh Academy, an X Factor style show on Manoto 1, a London-based channel run by Iranian exiles. The music video finishes with the women at a Googoosh concert hearing her perform Behesht, the audience sees that the couple are both women .

"A fourth new identity is to be created for one of James Bulger's killers when he is freed from prison once again - bringing the public bill for protecting the murderer to a reported £1million. Jon Venables, 30 - who was released from his life sentence in 2001 - was locked up again three years ago after being caught with child porn images on his computer, but has now been granted parole in a decision that has left the murdered toddler's parents 'filled with terror'. The killer was given a new identity when he was sent to a young offenders' institution at the age of 10 for murdering the two-year-old with Robert Thompson, then a second was created for him when he was controversially released from his life sentence in 2001. Venables was given a third taxpayer-funded identity after he was sent back to jail in 2010 for possessing child abuse images, and officials are now understood to be working on a fourth new alias to protect his anonymity as it emerged the killer is to be freed once more. Decision: Jon Venables (left), now 30, one of the killers of James Bulger (right), is to be released from prison . Taxpayers will again pick up the bill for the latest identity switch, each of which are reported to cost around £250,000. Officials were last night working on giving Jon Venables his fourth secret new identity. Taxpayers will pick up the bill, likely to run into hundreds of thousands of pounds, for the move and for monitoring Venables around the clock. Only a tight-knit cabal operating under conditions of extreme secrecy will know who he really is. One or two senior  probation officers will regularly visit Venables to ensure he is adhering to the conditions of his release.This will include a ban on travelling to Merseyside, and he also faces restrictions on accessing the internet after his 2010 conviction for possessing child  abuse images. Venables was given his first new identity when he was jailed in 1993, and a second when he was released from a sentence of indefinite imprisonment in 2001 aged 18. In May 2011, his name and background was changed once again after a ‘serious breach’ in the security of the identity he had been using.Earlier this year officials said they would not give him another identity because he could not be trusted to keep it secret. But they have been forced to change their minds amid mounting fears for his safety if he is outed.Earlier this year pictures purporting to be of Venables were circulated on the internet, despite an injunction granting him lifetime anonymity. Only three other people are so notorious that they have been given new identities and made subject to lifelong anonymity orders. They are Venables’ co-defendant Robert Thompson, Maxine Carr – the ex-girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley – and child killer Mary Bell. This is aside from the cost of his stints behind bars, parole hearings, . and keeping tabs on Venables when he was released the first time around. The Ministry of Justice declined to comment today. James Bulger's parents last night expressed outrage last night that one of his killers is to be freed again. Denise Fergus and Ralph Bulger said they were ‘filled with terror’ by the decision to grant parole to Venables. The . child killer was sent back to jail three . years ago after being caught with depraved images of children as young . as two on his computer. He admitted downloading and . distributing the images, which included some of toddlers being raped, as . well as posing online as a mother willing to sell her young daughter . for sex. In May, Mrs Fergus, 45, and Mr Bulger, . 46, appeared before the Parole Board via video link for the first time . to beg the prison authorities to keep Venables behind bars. Last night they spoke of their shock that their pleas had been ignored. They said they had been given no information about the conditions of the killer’s parole. Venables, who struggled to cope with . living a double life the first time round, will receive another new . identity at great expense to the taxpayer. In a statement released through his . solicitor, Robin Makin, Mr Bulger said the decision to release Venables . was ‘misguided’ and filled him with ‘terror’. Mr Makin said: ‘For Ralph and his . family, the living nightmare continues and is exacerbated by the . problems now created by the reckless decision to free Jon Venables . without any publicly disclosed safeguards. ‘Jon Venables is a sex offender who . has murdered once and made it clear when posing as a mother of a child . that an “ultimate thrill” for him was sexual abuse of a child. 'The . authorities have already experimented with Jon Venables living a lie and . it did not work. ‘The decision to release Jon Venables is misguided and fills Ralph with terror. Haunting: CCTV footage shows the abduction of James Bulger from the Bootle Strand shopping centre in 1993 . ‘Ralph fears that an innocent person may be mistaken for Jon Venables and be injured or even killed.’ Mrs Fergus said she too was ‘shocked’. Also involved: Robert Thompson (pictured) and Venables abducted and murdered James Bulger . ‘Venables has shown time and again . that he cannot be trusted and that he is a danger to the public and . himself,’ she said. ‘He lies and manipulates people for his own sick . ends. ‘He is still a huge risk and . . . I . doubt it will ever be safe to be let him out under another false . identity. They should keep him locked up for a long time yet. ‘They should not take a huge gamble on letting him out.’ Mrs Fergus submitted evidence, . gathered with the help of her solicitor, to the Parole Board that . Venables was an ‘undiagnosed psychopath’ who should not be held in a . mainstream prison but treated in a psychiatric hospital. The mother of three said she received . assurances that this evidence, and information gathered by the police at . the time of James’s murder but never presented to the jury at the . trial, which suggested her son had been sexually assaulted before he . died, would be examined in detail before any decision to free him was . granted. Despite this, a spokesman for the . Parole Board last night confirmed Venables was to be released. The date . of his release has not been disclosed. Neither Mrs Fergus nor Mr Bulger have . been given details of the terms of Venables’ release, a situation Mr . Makin described as ‘Kafka-esque’. Parents: Denise Fergus (left) and Ralph Bulger (right), the mother and father of murdered toddler James Bulger . Despair: On her Twitter page, Mrs Fergus said: 'Just don't believe what I've got to go through. Again.' Shocked: Shortly after the first tweet, Mrs Fergus posted on her Twitter page: 'Venables is getting released' Mrs Fergus’s husband, Stuart, tweeted: . ‘Our country justice system f****** stinks! Murder a child equals 8 . years (give or take). Have disgraceful child porn on ur pc equals 3 . years. British justice . . . you’re having a laugh!’ 'He lies and manipulates people for his own sick ends' Denise Fergus, James Bulger's mother . This year marks the 20th anniversary . of James’s murder. Venables and classmate Robert Thompson were ten when . they abducted the two-year-old from a shopping centre in Bootle, . Merseyside, in February 1993, and tortured and murdered him. They were given life sentences for the crime, but released on licence in 2001 with new identities, to a huge public outcry. The terms of Venables’s parole banned . him from entering Merseyside, but it emerged that he had flouted the . terms by attending soccer matches and nightclubs in Liverpool. Murder case: Police search the train track in Merseyside where the body of James Bulger was found in 1993 . Dad and mum: Ralph Bulger and Denise Fergus on February 14 1993, the day the toddler's body was found . Anger: On February 22 1993, there were violent scenes outside South Sefton Magistrates' Court in Bootle, when the two primary school pupils, then known as Child A and Child B, made their first appearance . Grieving: James's father Mr Bulger (right) helped carry the coffin of his murdered son from a church in Kirkby, Merseyside, in March 1993 . He was also arrested over a drunken . brawl and for cocaine offences, but the then Justice Secretary Jack . Straw allowed him to remain at large. Following his arrest for child porn . offences, it was revealed that Venables had fallen into a spiral of . drink and drug addiction because he struggled with the psychological . pressure of living with a new identity. 'The decision to release Jon Venables is misguided and fills Ralph with terror' Robin Makin, Ralph Bulger's solicitor . Solicitor Laurence Lee, who . represented Venables during his murder trial, said: ‘My heart goes out . to Denise Fergus.’ But he added: ‘As a lawyer it is clear that he cannot . be kept in prison for ever. He may be released but he will never be at . liberty.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: . ‘The re-release of life-licensed offenders is directed by the . independent Parole Board once they are satisfied they can be safely . managed in the community. ‘Their life licence lasts for the rest . of their lives, and they may be recalled to prison at any time for . breaching their licence conditions.’ 1993 .

"President Obama has lauded the slain U.S. ambassador to Libya, John Christopher Stevens, as a 'courageous role model' who 'died in a city a city that he helped save'. Stevens, the first U.S. ambassador to be killed by terrorism in 33 years, was a career diplomat devoted to bringing democracy to the Middle East when he was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi. In a heartbreaking twist, Stevens was struck down in a rocket attack on Tuesday by forces unleashed after Muammar Gaddafi's power crumbled - an uprising the ambassador had strongly supported. He was killed alongside three other U.S. officials, including Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith, a ten-year veteran of the State Department, a husband and a father of two. Scroll down for video . Killed: The U.S. ambassador to Libya, John Christopher Stevens, who went simply by Chris Stevens, was killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi after a 20-year career in the foreign service . Stevens, who went by the first name Chris, had only been appointed as Libyan . ambassador by President Obama in January. It came after an esteemed . career within the United States foreign service which spanned more than two . decades. Speaking outside the White House on Wednesday, Obama hailed him Stevens and the three other U.S. officials who died in the attack as devoted to working for democracy. 'It's especially tragic that Chris Stevens died in Benghazi as it's a city that he helped to save,' Obama said. With 'characteristic skill, courage and resolve, he built partnerships with Libyans... and he worked tirelessly to support this young democracy. 'He was a role model to those who worked with him and to the young diplomats who strive to follow in his footsteps.' He added: 'These four Americans stood up for freedom and human dignity. We grieve with their families but let us carry on their memory... I have no doubt that their legacy will live on.' Making links: Mr Stevens said he was determined to bring democracy to the people of Libya . Loss: Hillary Clinton swore Mr Stevens in to his role earlier this year and called him 'eloquent and passionate' 'They exemplified America's . commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people . around the globe, and stand in stark contrast to those who callously . took their lives,' he said. John Christopher Stevens was killed . in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi by protesters angry over . a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad. According to the State Department Office of the Historian, just five U.S. ambassadors have been killed by terrorists: . Two other U.S. ambassadors have died in plane crashes: . 'Chris . was a courageous and exemplary representative of the United States. Throughout the Libyan revolution, he selflessly served our country and . the Libyan people at our mission in Benghazi. 'His legacy will endure wherever . human beings reach for liberty and justice. I am profoundly grateful for . his service to my Administration, and deeply saddened by this loss.' Stevens, . 52, was born in April 1960 and raised in California, where he stayed . for his undergraduate degree at the University of Berkeley, before he . graduated in 1982. In an introductory video for his role as . ambassador, Stevens admitted he did not know much about the Middle East . until he travelled to Morocco in 1983. There, he worked as a Peace Corps Volunteer for two years, teaching English in the mountains - and 'quickly grew to love this part of the world'. When he returned to the United States, he graduated from the University of California's Hastings College of Law in 1989. After working in international trade law in Washington D.C. for two years, he joined the U.S. Foreign Service in 1991. Stevens spoke French and Arabic, which led to a series of postings throughout the Middle East, including in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Israel. Younger years: Mr Stevens grew up in California and graduated from the UC Berkeley in 1982 . Calling: After graduating, he taught English in Morocco for two years and 'grew to love this part of the world' Service: Mr Stevens was posted throughout the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Syria and Israel . Devoted: Mr Stevens said he was looking forward to a stronger relationship between Libya and the U.S . In 1996, he was appointed staff . assistant in the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs at the State Department . in Washington and special assistant to the under secretary for political . affairs. By May 2007, he had also served as a staff adviser on Middle East affairs to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. His first posting to Libya came in June 2007 as a deputy chief of mission. Two years later, he became the chargé d'affaires at the embassy in Tripoli. His second tour in Libya came in . April 2011, when he served as special representative to the Libyan . Transitional National Council and was sent to rebel headquarters in . Benghazi, so he could better understand the different factions fighting . against Gaddafi. The journey meant Stevens was the highest-ranking US representative to travel to Libya since the uprising began. In his introductory video, Stevens . expressed his passion to help the people of Libya, saying he was looking . forward to a stronger relationship between the country and the U.S., as . it used to enjoy. Missed: Married father-of-two Sean Smith was also killed in the gunfire. The gaming community claimed Mr Smith was an avid member and posted this photo of him as they paid tribute to their friend . 'I had the honour to serve as the US . envoy to the Libyan opposition during the revolution, was thrilled to . watch the Libyan people demand their rights,' he said. 'Now I am excited to return to Libya to continue the great work we started.' He was appointed as ambassador in January and arrived in Tripoli in May 2012 to take up the role. 'Libyans are going through difficult times, . challenges,' he said in the video. 'I want peace in this part of the world.' His biography in the US Department . of State website reads: 'As the President’s representative, his job is . to develop a strong, mutually beneficial relationship between the United . States and Libya.' He leaves behind family in north California, CNN reported, adding that they were elderly. In a statement, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who swore Stevens in for his post earlier this year, said: 'He spoke . eloquently about his passion for service, for diplomacy and for the . Libyan people. Welcoming: Mr Stevens is pictured with Arizona Senator John McCain, who visited Tripoli two months ago . Friends: Senator McCain posted this picture to Twitter in July, adding: 'Chris Stevens - one of America's finest diplomats also makes one of the best cappuccinos in Tripoli' Experience: Ambassador Stevens, who joined the foreign service in 1991, had been on two tours of Libya ahead of his role . 'As the conflict in Libya unfolded, . Chris was one of the first Americans on the ground in Benghazi. He . risked his own life to lend the Libyan people a helping hand to build . the foundation for a new, free nation. 'He spent every day since helping to . finish the work that he started. Chris was committed to advancing . America’s values and interests, even when that meant putting himself in . danger.' She called Smith, who also died in the attacks, 'one of our best'. Smith, a married father-of-two, joined the State Department ten years ago. Before arriving in Benghazi, he had served in Baghdad, Pretoria, Montreal and at The Hague. The gaming community claims that Smith was an avid player of the game 'Eve Online', and went by the name 'Vile Rat'. The community has posted tributes mourning the loss of their friend. Relations: Mr Stevens supported the uprising against Gaddafi and was working to help Libya in the aftermath . In touch: Ambassador Stevens, right, talks to boys in Tripoli, Libya in a photo posted to Facebook in August . Murdered: Chris Stevens smiles alongside the American and Libyan flags in Tripoli in June . His friend of six years, named as Mittani, wrote: 'We knew he was in Benghazi. He commented on how there was a constant susurrus of weaponry in the background. He was in situ to provide IT services for the consulate, which meant he was on the net all the time, hanging out with us.' Mittani, who said his friend used diplomacy as a tool in online games, claimed that Smith typed 'F***' and 'GUNFIRE' before losing his connection on Tuesday. 'I’m clearly in shock... and I feel kind of dead inside,' Mittani wrote. 'Sean was a great guy.' The men died after an attack by militia on the US . consulate in the eastern city of Benghazi on Tuesday. The two others killed have not been named as officials are contacting their families. They were killed in a protest over an American-produced film that protestors claim . insults the Prophet Muhammad.

"An American artist has created stunning colourful representations showing what Wi-Fi waves, peaks and pulses would look like if we could see them. Nickolay Lamm worked with former Nasa astrobiologist M. Browning Vogel to learn how the networks move and based the designs on coverage data taken from around the U.S Congress and The National Mall in Washington. The images show the shape of the Wi-Fi signal's and different colours were used to distinguish the different sub channels. The project was a follow-up to Lamm's Wi-fi visualisations released last year which depicted the shape of the Wi-Fi signals. The Wi-Fi pulses are shown here as spheres. Lamm used red, orange, yellow and other colours to represent these invisible channels that make up the overall Wi-Fi signal . Wi-Fi routers on buildings and lamp posts create a circular omnidirectional data fields around them, pictured. Wi-Fi broadcasts at a frequency between radio and microwaves, meaning that the waves or pulses are about six inches apart, as shown by these coloured bands in front of Congress . Wi-fi is an energy field that is transmitted as waves and pulses. Each wave has a certain height, are different distances from each other, and each travel at a certain speed. The . distance between Wi-Fi waves is shorter than radio waves but longer . than microwaves. As well as looking great, the illustrations were also designed to teach people about how Wi-Fi signals work. Lamm, from website MyDeals.com, said: 'Although we use it often, we rarely think about how it works. 'A lot of us take technology for granted and use it without appreciating the science that makes it work.' To approximate the size of the Wi-Fi coverage around The National Mall - an open-area national park in Washington DC - Lamm used the 3D Wi-Fi shapes and data from the District of Columbia Government coverage maps. The captions were written by Browning Vogel, a Ph.D. in astrobiology who previously worked at Nasa Ames . for five years and now teaches science. Each picture shows a familiar Washington landmark surrounded by Wi-Fi channels represented as different colours, as 'interlocking bubbles'. Lamm then added a hazy effect to areas of the signal broken by a tree, landmark or other obstacle. Wi-Fi uses the radio frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between radio waves and microwaves. According to Ofcom, the UK will have a severe shortage of airwaves used for WiFi by 2020 . A typical outdoor router can project its Wi-Fi signal 300ft or more from its location. Objects such as trees can obstruct this signal and the waves are often boosted by using multiple routers. This kind of set up creates a field that extends all the way across Washington DC's National Mall, pictured . Wi-fi waves travel as rapid, data encoded pulses or waves. A freezeframe of these pulses are shown by the lightly coloured bands in this image . In another of his images, multiple . Wi-Fi pulse frequencies are represented as blue, green, yellow, and red . that pervade the space around the mall. In a third, Lamm showed the range of multiple Wi-Fi signals across The National Mall in Washington. Writing on his MyDeals.com blog, Lamm said: 'We use red, orange, yellow and other colors [sic] to show the . invisible Wi-Fi channels that make up the overall signal. 'Wi-Fi . fields are usually spherical or ellipsoidal and . extend about 20-30 meters [sic], assuming a typical off the shelf box.' Wi-fi is an energy field that is transmitted as waves. Each wave has a certain height, distance from other waves, and they each travel at a certain speed. The . distance between Wi-Fi waves is shorter than radio waves but longer than microwaves. Lamm claims this gives Wi-Fi a unique transmission band . that can't be interrupted by other signals.","Artist used Wi-Fi coverage data taken from networks in Washington DC .

"In recent years a handful of 'hybrid' animals have been spotted in the Arctic, such as this Polar bear Grizzly hybrid . In recent years a handful of 'hybrid' animals have been spotted in the Arctic but the number of these animals is set to increase, according to scientists. U.S. researchers have blamed the increasing number of hybrid animals on climate change and now an artist has created images of what the animals at risk of crossbreeding might look like. The scientists believe that as Arctic sea ice melts increasingly quickly, different species of animals such as bears and seals, which were previously kept apart by huge slabs of ice, are now mingling freely and breeding with each other. In 2006 a white bear with brown patches thought to be a hybrid of a polar and grizzly bear was killed by Arctic hunters, while a hybrid of a white and a bowhead whale was sighted in the Bering Sea four years ago. While crossbreeding might seem like a clever survival tactic, scientists from the University of Alaska have said that hybrid animals are often infertile. In 2006 a white bear with brown patches thought to be a hybrid of a polar and grizzly bear (illustrations of cubs are pictured) was killed by Arctic hunters . The Hooded (right) and Harp (left) species of seal both breed on pack ice of the North Atlantic Ocean and extend into the Arctic Ocean in summer months so they could easily meet and produce a hybrid pup . The scientists said a hybrid animal (illustrated) has already been confirmed by molecular analysis . Consequently the trend is worrying as cross breeding could drive certain species to extinction as they are no longer able to mate with their own kind, Business Insider reported. The university's study of 34 species that are at risk of cross breeding was published in the journal Nature in 2010. Artist Nickolay Lamm has created images of what hybrid Arctic animals might look like if they did breed together and the results in some cases are quite subtle. U.S. researchers have blamed the increasing number of hybrid animals on climate change. Belugas (left) and narwhals (right) both inhabit the Arctic Ocean and peripheral seas . Pictured is the imagined Beluga Narwhal hybrid. A skull intermediate in morphology was collected in West Greenland in the 1980s. Local hunters reported seeing other whales of intermediate form in the region . He was helped by writer and biologist Dr Elin Pierce who described the features that the hybrid animals might have based on the dominant features of their distinct original species. Dr Pierce shared his knowledge of the real hybrid animals sighted and photographed in the wild, to inform Mr Lamm's creations. They include a hybrid of the Harp seal and Hooded seal, which appears to combine the two species' colouring. Polar bears (left) may spend more time ashore rather than on sea ice, where they will increasingly encounter . brown bears (right), some of which are expanding northward, according to scientists . Polar, brown and grizzly bear hybrids have been noted in captivity and confirmed by molecular analysis in the wild. Pictured is an illustration of a brown and polar bear hybrid animal . Both types of seal breed on pack ice of the North Atlantic Ocean and extend into the Arctic Ocean in summer months so they could easily meet and breed. The scientists said a hybrid animal has already been confirmed by molecular analysis and diminishing ice will encourage the species to overlap. Dr Pierce and other researchers also noted that a hybrids of the Harbour porpoise and Dall's porpoise have been found off the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Harbor seals (left) range widely in temperate and sub-Arctic waters of the North Pacific and North Atlantic and north into the Bering and Barents Seas. A Ringed seal is pictured right . The two species likely will move north where they will increasingly overlap with ringed seals, breeding to create a hybrid perhaps like the one illustrated . It is thought that this cross breeding occurred because of a very small population of Harbour porpoises, which are found in temperate to boreal seas in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Experts believe this species will move north as temperatures rise, which will further increase their chances of breeding with Dall's porpoises, which are found in the North Pacific . Harbour porpoises (left) are found in temperate to boreal seas in the North Atlantic and North Pacific and will likely . move north. Dall's Porpoises (right) are found in the North Pacific up to 65°N . Extensive hybridisation off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, has been attributed to locally low densities of Harbour porpoises. Similar hybridisation . may occur as the species interact in newly-colonized Arctic habitats where initial densities are likely to be low, scientists said. A Hybrid is illustrated . One of the most intriguing images of possible hybrid animals created by Mr Lamm, is the Beluga, Narwhal hybrid, which curiously does not have the narwhal's famous tusk. Both species live in the Arctic Ocean and peripheral seas and a skull of a hybrid animals was collected in West Greenland in the 1980s, while local hunters have also reported seeing whales of intermediate form in the region.","In recent years a handful of 'hybrid' animals have been spotted in the Arctic and their numbers are set to increase .

"Like twerking, Robin Thicke and the horse-meat scandal, glamping is so last year. Seriously. Look around you. You can barely move for luxury ‘camp’-sites where the ‘tents’ – if this is still the word – look and feel like a boudoir in the Palace of Versailles during the reign of Louis XIV. Lovely. Comfortable. But scarcely the ‘Great Outdoors’. Meet the locals: Matt gets up close and personal with two new canine friends on his visit to Swedish Lapland . Onwards, into the snowy middle distance: Swedish Lapland is a great place to try a session of dog-sledding . On the other hand, the ‘Great Outdoors’ comes with its downsides. For every dew-tipped sunrise, there is a tent collapse that leaves you howling in the dark, or a squirrel dive-bomb attack which has you cowering in a corner. So what do you do if you want a bit of both – a few creature comforts, but also a sense that you are away on a grand adventure? Fredrik Broman, the marvellous mind behind the Aurora Safari Camp, thinks he has the answer. Authentic but cosy: Matt stayed in a lavvu tent - an Arctic tipi with creature comforts such as a log fire . Having cut his camping boots as a photographer and guide across Africa, he came up with the curveball idea of transplanting a traditional bush camping experience into his native environment of Swedish Lapland. The camp is situated a short drive from Lulea airport – far enough into the north of Sweden that, on arrival, I am greeted by a soon-to-be common sight: a spectacular, snow-blanketed village of the most idyllic, festive variety. Throw in suitably Arctic temperatures of -20°C, and the super-smiley faces of the locals who run the camp, and I am certain that I am about to enjoy the not-glamping-but-not-just camping experience I have been seeking. But first, we have to find the camp – which lurks in a place where no roads go. Love match: Matt enjoys another moment with man's best friend (left), and admires an ice sculpture (right) After decking me out in the finest layered snow gear (reindeer pelts come as standard), and warning me to keep an eye out for the area's many moose, reindeer, lynx and - gulp - the occasional bear, I am encouraged to hop aboard a snowmobile. Soon, we are barrelling along a narrow forest-blanketed snowpath into the night. As the wind picks up, a few more degrees freeze away, and my face begins to turn numb. Then we break out of the trees and bounce onto a frozen lake lit only by bright starlight and full moon above. Luckily for me (and the fingertips to which I've grown accustomed), we soon slow to a stop on the bank of a snow-clad island, and I spot the orange lights of the camp twinkling among the dense forestry. All paws forward: Matt headed out with a husky team - one of the must-do experiences of a trip to Lapland . Sunshine on the frozen plains: There are few more majestic sights in Sweden than a team of dogs in profile . I am shown to my ‘lavvu’ tent - an Arctic tipi complete with log fire, thick sleeping bag and sturdy bed. And a quick tour shows me the rest of the surprisingly eco-friendly camp – an indoor lounge; a mercifully canvas-enveloped flushable toilet; just a few other Lavvu tents, all set to a snooze-inducing 20°C; solar-powered ground lamps to guide you along the paths at night. Along with the camp’s other new residents, I head out for a short session of staring upwards, hoping to spot the Northern Lights. Then we retreat to the fire-warmed lounge and while away the night sharing travel stories with the camp's endlessly fascinating guides. As we do so, we munch on dried moose, Arctic char and Swedish cheese, and slurp a combination of warm lingonberry juice and throat-embalming red wine. A pause for a breather: Matt exchanges travel tales - as the huskies also take time out from their wild efforts . Ice ice baby: Matt has his own attempt at creating an frosty sculpture - a little more practice required, possibly . I trudge back to my tent and take a moment to soak up the serene surroundings and the unbeatable, incomparable silence. It is easy to see why rumour has positioned the camp as a magnet for world-famous celebrities. One local whisper has even mentioned Angelina and Brad – no doubt in search of the same things as us mere mortals. If you are looking for unpretentious, soul-soothing isolation, it does not get much better. One undeniably unusual sleep later (a small note of warning – the fire in your lavvu has to be tended, by hand, with pre-cut logs every two hours – otherwise, well, you will freeze), I wake to the sound of mushing, and the arrival of 'The Dog Whisperer'. Sixteen perfectly trained pure-bred Siberian huskies are at the camp's disposable – all of them friendly, approachable and happy-to-meet-you hounds. This will explain why, an hour later, I find myself spread-eagled on the icy surface of another frozen lake, having been comically clattered to the floor while attempting to fend off their affections. Let's see what's below the surface: An afternoon of endeavour carving out ice blocks with traditional tools . Looking up, seeing the lights: A stay at Aurora Safari Camp also means chances to see the Northern Lights . After dusting myself off and returning to camp, I am encouraged to spend the day's last few hours of sunlight carving ice blocks out of the lake using the time-honoured tools of saws and manual corkscrews. As the sun sets in the only way Lapland knows how – retina-dazzling shades of oranges and pinks, kaleidoscopically reflected by the ice and snow – and a few more logs are flung on the fire, I decide that, maybe, I am a camper after all.

"Two men have been convicted of possessing 'truly disgusting' pornography on their mobile phones - despite being sent the material from people they did not know. Old Bailey judge Paul Worsley QC said the content, found on the phones of 'respectable' defendants Gary Ticehurst and Mark Kelly, was intended for 'shock value'. Both men said they had received the content from an unknown source, and had been unable to watch it all due to feeling 'sickened'. Scroll down for video . Members of the public have been warned of the dangers of storing pornography on their mobile phones (file image) The videos and image were later recovered by police after they stopped the defendants, both from Essex, in London in January on an unrelated matter. Sentencing the defendants to a conditional discharge, judge Worsley admitted the punishment was 'lenient' but said neither man had solicited the extreme content. But he warned: 'You have pleaded guilty to possessing truly disgusting images. 'It makes a big difference if someone goes out of their way to seek it, or if they're sent it by some mischievous colleague. 'In your case it was unsolicited. 'This is an exceptional case in some ways. 'The public should not find this carte blanche to possess material of this nature.' Prosecutor Tom Coke-Smyth said the material had been sent to the friends' phones up to three months prior to police examining their handsets. Kelly, 25, of  Romford, pleaded guilty to one count of possessing an extreme pornographic image likely to cause injury, and three counts of possessing pornographic images involving animals. Ticehurst, 28, of Canvey Island, admitted one count of one count of possessing an extreme pornographic image likely to cause injury, and two counts of possessing pornographic images involving animals. Old Bailey judge Paul Worsley QC said the content, found on the phones of 'respectable' defendants Gary Ticehurst and Mark Kelly, was intended for 'shock value' Defending himself in court, Kelly said he was sent the material by an unknown person via Whatsapp. He said: 'I deleted the videos from my Whatsapp, but I had no ideas they would save to my camera roll. 'I didn't even watch the full content of the video. It was very sick and disturbing.' Ticehurst, who was also unrepresented, said he had received a new phone in December and didn't know who had sent them to him. He said: 'They (the files) were on my phone for two months, I completely forgot about them. 'I thought they were disgusting and decided not to look at them.' The pair said they had no idea possessing the material was illegal. Judge Worsley said there was no evidence of the defendants sharing the content, or the men getting sexual gratification from them. He handed both defendants a two-year conditional discharge and told them to each pay £500 costs.","Judge warns public about dangers of storing pornography on their phones .

"In style: When Paul McCartney's wife Nancy Shevell, emerged from the crystal clear Ibizan waters this week, she was wearing a long-sleeved, 'rash vest' Beachwear that banishes bingo wings, sucks in middle-age spread like super-strength Spanx and protects a delicate decolletage  from the ageing rays of  the sun sounds like the answer to every woman over 40’s prayers. But while it may also sound a little too good to be true, when Paul McCartney’s wife Nancy Shevell, emerged from the crystal clear Ibizan waters this week, she was wearing one of these magic garments — a long-sleeved, patterned ‘rash vest’. These vests, also known as ‘rashies’, were originally invented in the Seventies to stop surfers chafing their skin on their surfboards, but have recently become a must-have on the beach for women who want to protect their skin from the sun, while also covering their wobbly bits. The vests, which are usually made out of Spandex, nylon or polyester, are proving incredibly popular with celebrities of a certain age, with actresses Nicole Kidman, Courteney Cox and Minnie Driver, Madonna and supermodel Elle Macpherson all pictured in them on the beach. I’m thrilled that the A-list are finally following my lead, for I’ve been sporting rash vests for almost 20 years — and getting odd looks from strangers on the beach for decades as a result. As an Aussie, I’ll do anything to protect my skin, but still love to be in the sunshine. My British friends, as they lie on the beach in blazing heat with just factor 10 on, laugh at me sitting under an umbrella in my factor 50, hat and obligatory rashie. I’ll have the last laugh, though. For nothing — not divorce, depression, recession — destroys a woman’s looks more than the sun. It is our worst enemy, yet few born in these milder climes seem to really understand the damage it does, even in short bursts. It's a cover up: Nicole Kidman (left) hardly braves the beach without one and proves modesty can be sexy, while Courtney Cox (right) was pictured in 2007, aged 43, in a baggy rashie with nothing underneath . Surf chic: Sporty supermodel Elle Macpherson, a fellow Aussie and a big fan of rashies, takes full advantage of one of their perks - they enable you to stay warm in the water for hours . For proof of this look no further than Nancy Shevell, who at 53 has the smooth skin tone of a woman half her age. And now her secret is out. She’s a sun-shunner. While many women delude themselves that slathering on a bit of factor 20 will protect their pale skin from the sun while splashing around in the waves, Nancy obviously knows better. Whether on holiday each summer at Smith’s Beach, on the south-west coast of Australia, or in the Mediterranean, or even in the chilly sea off Suffolk, I wouldn’t get into the water without a rashie. All white: Madonna (left) stepped out on the beach in France in 2012 wearing far more clothes than she ever does on stage, and Minnie Driver (right) has also been photographed wearing a rashie while enjoying the sun . In fact, I wouldn’t get out in the full holiday sun for more than 10 minutes without my rashie. Unsurprisingly, with its searing heat and ozone holes that make the sun especially fierce, rash vests were invented in Australia, where they have been popular for years. And the Aussies, with their love of anything that ends in a rising inflection and an ‘eee’, dubbed them rashies. (They make great pressies at Chrissie for the relies — or great presents at Christmas for the relatives). Now they’re used for sun protection in . water sports such as windsurfing and canoeing, or just having fun in . the waves. Not sloshing your child in factor 50 and wriggling them into a . rashie before they hit the beach is akin to child abuse there. In . the Seventies they only came in Lycra, made as they were for super-fit . surfers with washboard stomachs, but now you can get them in slimming . Spandex (yes!). They usually . provide a sun protection factor of 50+, which prevents burning, plus UV . filters, to stop the ultra-violet rays that cause ageing and DNA . damage. You can even buy them with factor 100. Extreme, even for me. No . longer built for boys, they’ve become more stylish, in patterns and . bright block colours, and are cut in a way which is more flattering to a . woman’s figure. And it’s . not just because they protect you from the sun that we Aussies — and the . A-list — wear them. For a good rashie can be a woman’s best friend. I . swear they can take a stone off you, in all the right places. The good ones suck you in like a corset. Middle-aged tummy disappears and, worn over a good swimsuit with a bit of support in the bra, they turn a tubby torso into Jessica Rabbit-esque curves. Is it any wonder middle-aged women love them? As well as hiding those giveaways of middle-age — untoned upper arms and a thickening waist — rashies also prevent other signs of ageing. They protect the areas most vulnerable to sun damage – the neck, décolletage and, in some versions, hands. The skin is so thin there, it’s the first to wrinkle and get covered in horrible sun spots, which are all too often early signs of skin cancers. And those parts really show a woman’s age. Once you’ve fried them in oil in the sun for years, they never recover. That’s why rashies need to be almost up to your chin and reach your fingertips, as perfectly demonstrated by Madonna, who stepped out on the beach in France in 2012 wearing far more clothes than she ever does on stage. At 53 she was covered by a white rashie, matching trousers and a baseball cap — in stark contrast to the topless toyboy she was with. She also got it right by wearing a bosom-supporting swimsuit underneath, which completes the hourglass look — unlike Courteney Cox, who was pictured in 2007, aged 43, in a baggy rashie with nothing underneath, looking like she was breast-feeding quadruplets. Fair-skinned Nicole Kidman hardly braves the beach without one, and proves that modesty is every bit as sexy as flashing the flesh.She doesn’t need any help tucking in that tummy, so often opts for a light-weight fabric and sporty style, paired with sleek bikini bottoms. Sporty supermodel Elle Macpherson, a fellow Aussie and a big fan of rashies, takes full advantage of one of their perks — they enable you to stay warm in the water for hours. They act like a wetsuit and trap a thin layer of warm air between your body and the rashie, keeping out the cold and enabling keen surfers like Elle to stay in the waves as long as they like. And think of all the extra exercise you can get surfing and swimming while your bikini-clad sisters are fleeing the water after ten minutes with goose bumps to bake themselves old and wrinkled in the sunshine. But while these celebrities might make rashies look chic, they aren’t for the faint-hearted. Getting into — and out of — them is pure pantomime, like trying to squeeze into a surgical glove. For the most flattering look they have to be skin tight, which means dragging it over your head, wriggling your arms down the slim tubes of sleeves, hoiking it up under your arms then stretching it down over a tummy that’s usually overindulged on holiday. I have to admit getting out of it isn’t a ladylike process, either. I usually get stuck half-way through, have to cry to my boyfriend for help, then adopt the half-brace position as he peels it off, along with a cascade of wet sand. Yet, despite these indignities, ladies of a certain age should bear in mind that there is nothing like a rashie to take inches off the waist and years off the decolletage — just remember to pack a man with a sense of humour to peel you out of it.","Long-sleeved 'rash vests' a hit with stars like Madonna and Nicole Kidman .

"Astronomical: One call to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £5 a minute . Looking through my latest mobile phone bill, I almost had a cardiac arrest. It was three times the usual amount — all thanks to one item. A call I’d made to a 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £5 a minute. And because I’d then got them to put me through, the total cost of the 26-minute call had come to £137.08, including VAT. Spluttering with shock, I contacted Vodafone, my mobile phone service provider, and asked how on earth they could justify this. A very apologetic lady explained that I had called ‘the wrong directory inquiries number’. Maybe I’m naive, but I hadn’t been aware that there could be a ‘wrong’ directory inquiries number. She explained that instead of calling Vodafone’s own service on 118 881, I had called the directory of Orange — another service provider — on 118 000. I explained that this was a totally innocent mistake. I had probably done so because I had dialled out of habit, having been an Orange customer some years ago until I switched to Vodafone. I’d been looking for the number of Sky TV customer services because my parents’ digibox had developed a fault on Christmas Eve. In any case, how is anyone supposed to accurately remember all these 118 inquiries numbers when they’re all so similar? Of course, with hindsight, I realised that I could have scribbled down the number, hung up, and then dialled it myself. That way I would have been charged at a standard call rate when talking to Sky. But when in a hurry or on the move, it can seem so much easier just to be put straight through. The woman at Vodafone sounded very sympathetic. She said she understood my distress but, unfortunately, Orange had charged Vodafone an inflated price and so Vodafone had to pass the cost on to me. If I had rung Vodafone directory inquiries on 118 881, it would have been 71p a minute. There didn’t seem to be any way of arguing with this. So I sighed, thanked her and resolved never to call a 118 number again, just in case I got the wrong one. But something was still nagging me, so the next day I decided to call Orange. They were adamant that the £5 a minute was nothing to do with them: they had not set the high charge for my call, Vodafone had. Orange’s charge for their directory service was £1.29 a minute, they said. In other words, the true cost of my call to Orange directory inquiries was nearer £34. So, with a bit of mental arithmetic, I worked out that when Vodafone charged me £137.08 for calling a rival firm’s directory, they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £100. Yet Vodafone continued to insist the £5 a minute charge was not their fault. I asked them how much they had profited from my call. A spokeswoman said: ‘We pay the service provider (Orange directories) according to commercial agreements and we cannot share this information.’ Over the next few days, I went back and forth between Orange and Vodafone, repeatedly being told by both that the charges I had incurred were the fault of the other. By now it wasn’t the size of the astronomical bill that I was angry about, it was the childish, manipulative and downright disingenuous behaviour of the phone companies. While Vodafone appeared to be the culprit in this case, I started to suspect that they were all in this together, setting complicated pricing structures that were impossible for the consumer to interpret. When I looked at Vodafone’s website, there was a list of their charges for 118 numbers but there was no mention of what they charged for Orange’s 118 000. The biggest charge they admitted to was £2.71 a minute if a Vodafone customer rang BT’s 118 500. Complex: When Vodafone charged £137.08 for calling a rival firm’s directory, they had made a pure profit on that call of almost exactly £100. Yet Vodafone continued to insist the £5 a minute charge was not their fault . So I contacted Vodafone’s head office and said I was giving them one last chance to come clean about whether £5 a minute was their standard charge for a call by their customers to Orange directories. And, if it was, where was this charge published, as the industry regulations require? And at that point, the firm admitted: ‘We’re very sorry, but £5 a minute is our charge. We don’t know why you were told it wasn’t. It must have been human error.’ At last! It had taken me two weeks to establish who had really profited from my call to 118 000. A spokeswoman for Orange — when I eventually got hold of them — said: ‘It is the carrier’s decision on what rates they set. In this case, Vodafone has set the rate at £5 for a call to the Orange 118 000 directory inquiries for its customers. We can confirm that this is not the rate set by Orange.’ Vodafone charges . For Vodafone directories 118 881 . — 85p per minute . For Orange directories 118 000 . — £5 a minute . For ‘The Number’ 118 118 . — £3.25 a minute . For BT directories 118 500 . — £2.71 a minute .

For ‘The Number’ 118 118 . — £2.57 . For BT directories 118 500 . — £2.39 a minute . Only the most persistent person — one like me — would have bothered getting to the bottom of this scandal. But what chance does the average customer have of being able to navigate such a system? In fact, the 118 system is so complex and so complained-about that the regulator Ofcom is set to overhaul it. From July, phone companies will not be able to hide their 118 charges as easily, or levy complex rates where the true cost to the consumer is hidden. A big part of the problem is that there are two different elements to these calls: the cost that all the different directory inquiry companies, with their own call centres often in different countries, charge you for their services; and the cost your phone provider, like Vodafone, charges you to access them. At the moment, if you unwittingly dial the wrong number and use a directory service which isn’t your own phone provider’s, that second element — the ‘access charge’ — can be extortionate. And, as I found out, it is very difficult to find out how much it is. But, under the new rules, phone companies will have to publish prominently what you have to pay, and furthermore, the extra charge will have to be exactly the same for all the different directory inquiry services they allow you to access. The idea is that if customers know and understand what they are being charged, competition will drive the cost down. They will have to make it clear, for example: ‘Calls cost 1.20p per minute plus your phone company’s access charge.’ I’m still not convinced this is simple enough for customers to find out the total cost of the call as it will appear on their bill. After all, you would still need to contact your provider or check your contract to ascertain the access charge. But Ofcom insist it will be an improvement. If so, then it is about time. The 118 swindle is all the more disappointing for the customer because the proliferation of these phone firms was supposed to be a great liberation of the market and drive down prices. But as with the electricity and gas firms, deregulation has not brought the promised savings. In fact, if anything, it has allowed the phone companies to drive up prices. Indeed, it makes one long for the old days when there was just one BT number to dial for directory inquiries. When that old 192 number, costing a mere 40p a minute, was abolished in 2003 and the industry opened up to competition, 118 was made the new prefix for all the new services. Those who worked for Oftel (Ofcom’s predecessor as regulator), which brought in the change, would no doubt now claim this was a mistake rather than a conspiracy. Perhaps no one could have envisaged how phone companies would exploit the system. In practice, though, it has meant that customers have ended up so confused about which 118 number to dial without racking up enormous charges that, increasingly, they have had no choice but to avoid all of them. No wonder the number of calls to directory inquiries has fallen by an estimated 80 per cent in a decade. An Ofcom spokesman said: ‘We want to make the cost of calling 118 numbers clearer for telephone users. Under the changes which come into effect this summer, call charges will be split so consumers can compare the cost of calling different 118 services, and see where their money is going.’ Even so, trying to tie down who is responsible for charging what for which service, with prices changing all the time, remains virtually impossible.","One call to 118 directory inquiries number had been charged at £5 a minute .

"Basketball superstar Kobe Bryant has reportedly confirmed that he will leave the NBA after the 2015-2016 season. The shooting guard, 36, who first entered the league in 1996, said that he will complete the two-year contract he signed in 2013 before ending his career, according to The Hollywood Reporter. He will be paid more than $25million next year after ending the current season with the Los Angeles Lakers because of rotator cuff surgery. Scroll down for video . Kobe Bryant (pictured left in 2013, right in 1997) has reportedly confirmed he will not play after the 2015-2016 season . Bryant's official Twitter account did not comment on The Hollywood Reporter story on Friday. The reveal about the end of his time in the NBA comes ahead of a documentary on the star's recovery from ankle problems by Gotham Chopra, Deepak Chopra's son. He also said that he sometimes questions the amount of his life that he put into basketball at the expense of his relationships. The film looks at the star's recovery after injury woes that have plagued his last several seasons. Bryant played 35 games this year before his surgery in late January after missing almost all of the 2013-2014 campaign. The 6'6'' star executive produced the documentary about himself, Kobe Bryant's Muse, and said the process was '100 per cent therapeutic'. Bryant, a shooting guard who ranks third on the all-time NBA scoring list, has played his entire career with the Los Angeles Lakers . The Laker (top row, third from left) entered the league in 1996, along with other future stars such as Ray Allen (sitting, left) and Steve Nash (top row, third from right) He had said during an hour-long interview with NBA TV that he was hoping for a 'rebirth' next year. Team general manager Mitch Kupchak said last year that he believed the Pennsylvania native would retire in 2016. The Lakers, the only professional team Bryant has played for, are currently scraping the bottom of the barrel in the NBA standings at 13-40. A second consecutive season without a spot in the playoffs would contrast sharply with the winning ways of previous Laker teams. The purple and gold squad has won the NBA Championship five times with Bryant, who ranks third on the all-time NBA top scorers list. Though his team is not expected to make the playoffs this year, he has won the NBA championship five times, including 2000 (left) 2001 (center), 2002, 2009 (right) and 2010 . He also won two gold medals with the USA's Olympic squads in 2008 and 2012. Kobe Bryant's Muse, which airs February 28 on Showtime, also examines some of the darker parts of his life. He was arrested in 2003 on sexual assault charges in Colorado before the case against him was eventually dropped. The All-Star said that 'Those were dark days for all of us' and said making the movie was 'very difficult. But there's beauty in that process.'","Bryant, 36, will leave after his contract runs out, Hollywood Reporter said .

"Forgotten Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo is the man whose permanent switch to Valencia next summer has made his old club’s pursuit of Swansea City’s Wilfried Bony possible this month, it has emerged. City are currently in the process of talking to Swansea about a £25million-£30m deal for Ivory Coast striker Bony and hope to conclude the deal in the coming days. It is possible that City may recoup some of the money by selling striker Stevan Jovetic - possibly back to Italy - before the end of the January transfer window but it is another deal that is enabling the Barclays Premier League champions to stay within UEFA restrictions handed down last May after the club failed to meet Financial Fair Play guidelines. Alvaro Negredo (left) is currently on loan at Valencia but will move permanently for £25million this summer . Manchester City look set to sign Wilfried Bony after opening talks with Swansea City over a £30million deal . Bony was pictured at the airport on Wednesday as he headed for the Africa Cup of Nations . He was pictured with his agent (right) as he prepared to head out and represent the Ivory Coast . As well as limiting City’s Champions League squad to 21 players for this season, UEFA also decreed that the English club must not spent more than £49m net over last summer and this January. At first glance, City’s deal for Bony would appear to take their net spending significantly higher than that, given last summer’s investment in defender Eliaquim Mangala - a deal actually worth £40m - and midfielder Fernando, who cost £12m. However it is understood that the £25m City are due to receive from Valencia for Negredo this coming summer has also been taken in to consideration by UEFA. Negredo is currently on loan at the Spanish club from City but a fee of £25m has already been agreed and signed off for the end of the season.

"When he arrived at the Emirates Stadium in 2010, Marouane Chamakh was billed as the answer to Arsenal's striking problems. With 79 goals in eight seasons in France he had never been a prolific goalscorer at Bordeaux, but the Moroccan offered Arsene Wenger a plan B. His hold-up play, and knack for scoring at important times, as shown by his five Champions League strikes the previous season, suggested that Chamakh provided something different. Alongside Robin van Persie, and with the supply coming from Cesc Fabregas, Andrei Arshavin and Samir Nasri, Chamakh was expected to help the Gunners challenge for the title again. Marouane Chamakh, here wearing a protective facemask, has become an important player for Crystal Palace . The Moroccan striker made an impressive start to his time at Arsenal, but soon faded away . The Gunners signed Chamakh after his impressive form for Bordeaux in Ligue 1 and the Champions League . After scoring 10 times in his first 21 Gunners appearances confidence was higher than ever, before the return of the previously injured Van Persie meant a spell on the bench, from which he never really recovered. Three years, two loan moves and just one league goal later, Chamakh was allowed to leave, his confidence dented and his reputation in tatters. Yet, as he prepares to face his former club again on Saturday, the Moroccan has remodelled his game into the type of player that could really hurt the Gunners. Chamakh is no longer the Champions League standard striker he once was, but instead is a hard-working midfielder, who can play off the front man. Chamakh's arrival, on a free transfer, was heralded as the potential for a new era of success at Arsenal . The 31-year-old has now moved to a more withdrawn role at his south London club, becoming a midfielder . Chamakh scores a Champions League goal at the Emirates, one of 10 strikes in his first 21 Arsenal games . Despite just one Premier League goal since joining Palace permanently this season, the 31-year-old has been a crucial part of the south London club’s plans. On the opening day of the season, in his first meeting with Arsenal since departing the Emirates, he showed the Gunners what he can offer these days, winning five tackles, and seven aerial duels. More remarkably he also got away with 11 fouls, ten of which came before his 67th minute booking. The goals soon dried up for the striker, who became second choice behind Robin van Persie . On his return to the Emirates earlier this season Chamakh committed a remarkable 11 fouls . The converted striker was eventually booked for his tenth foul of the match, after upending Jack Wilshere . In other words he became the kind of player Arsenal so often need – a nuisance, who opponents hate but fans love to have on their side. When the Gunners travel to Selhurst Park on Saturday they can expect more of the same from the player who averages more fouls per game than anyone else in the Premier League. With Yaya Sanogo unavailable against his parent club, Chamakh is likely to continue in the first team. And with his confidence returned – as demonstrated by two goals against Southampton last month - Arsene Wenger knows he faces a dangerous opponent. ‘He’s dropped off as well, he’s not the target man any more, he’s more a midfielder or second striker,’ said the Arsenal boss of his former forward. ‘Because he’s a real team player Marouane, that position suits him very well. Now  a midfielder, Chamakh has committed more fouls per game than any other Premier League player . Despite selling the striker, Wenger admits he always loved working with Chamakh while he was at Arsenal . ‘Look, I loved him always because of his team attitude and he was a hard-working type. But in the end he didn’t play and you have to give the players a chance to go somewhere and play. ‘After, van Persie came back from injury (in 2010) and he was a bit a substitute [and] lost confidence. I’m happy that he went to Crystal Palace and he is making a good career now.’ The Gunners have more than replaced Chamakh, Olivier Giroud offering the hold-up play that the Moroccan was expected to bring, as well as the goals and assists that eluded his predecessor. But though few Arsenal fans would want him back at the club, they will be aware that on Saturday afternoon, their old player has every chance of causing them problems.","Marouane Chamakh signed for Arsenal in 2010 as a much-coveted striker .

"Four months ago Manasa Saulo was cutting sugar cane in rural Fiji, waiting anxiously to discover if his life-changing move to Europe had fallen through. Working on the plantation was a way to take his mind off things as visa issues looked like scuppering the dream of signing a professional rugby contract with Bucharest. He had already resigned from his post with the Fiji navy but, after one missed flight, the paperwork was eventually approved. Like many of his team-mates who face Wales on Saturday, Saulo plies his trade overseas and sends money back to his family in Suva. Manasa Saulo of Fiji has made his dream move to Europe with Bucharest . ‘Working on the sugar cane plant helped me get away from the stress of the visa,’ said the prop. ‘You have to cut it, pull it, load it; it’s a tiring job! I had spent six years in the navy and rugby was my lucky chance. ‘We would spend a whole month on a ship and you would see no land, only the ocean. There were no rugby balls either, just the gym set up in the engine room. ‘One day I told my family that I was going to Iraq and they said, “No, don’t go”. I told them we will all die one day, but rugby gave me my ticket out. I have to thank the Lord for giving me the opportunity.’ Saulo has benefited from the improved facilities available as a professional and has now established himself in the Fijian national team. Saturday’s match at the Millennium Stadium will provide an early test ahead of the World Cup for Fiji, who have been drawn in the ‘group of death’ alongside Wales, Australia and England. Saulo spent six years working in the navy before he got the chance to play professional rugby . Fiji-born Semesa Rokoduguni, who made his England debut last Saturday against New Zealand, could well be lining up against his countrymen next year. He is the latest star player to pledge his allegiance overseas — following in the footsteps of Lote Tuqiri, Joe Rokocoko and Tevita Kuridrani — but coach John McKee does not bear a grudge against the Bath winger for his decision, highlighting the vast financial gulf that exists between Fiji and their rivals. ‘By western standards, the living conditions in Fiji are very low,’ said McKee. ‘There’s a lot of financial hardship. These guys build houses and provide cars for their village and family. We have great rugby players but very little income, so it’s difficult to run high-quality programmes. Fiji's head coach John McKee says he does not bear a grudge against Semesa Rokoduguni for picking England over the country of his birth . ‘We’re operating on about £650,000 a year and that covers our coaching staff, touring and everything else. The players aren’t here for the money, they’re here for the pride of playing for their country. They get a daily allowance of about £80 so when England come knocking on the door, are you going to say no and play for Fiji for £80 a day?’ Wales coach Warren Gatland has been working heavily with GPS data to compare regional rugby with the Southern Hemisphere, but Fiji only have the resources to wire up five players to the analysis system, and just one member of staff who is qualified to analyse the results. It can also be difficult for Fiji to convince big clubs to release their players to join up with the squad. Fiji-born Rokoduguni made his debut for England against the All Blacks on Saturday . These are just a few of the challenges of working on a shoestring, but financial constraints are nothing new and Fiji have learned to live with it, famously knocking Wales out of the 2007 World Cup. ‘Rugby is in the genes for these guys,’ said McKee. ‘There’s a history that goes back to the warrior culture 100 or more years ago. For them, rugby has become a natural expression of what, in the distant past, would have been two villages fighting each other. ‘The manliness of being a warrior in Fiji has in some ways been replaced by rugby. They’re very proud of their roots. ‘Our pool is massively tough, we know that, but we’re not coming to make up the numbers. If teams are beating each other, then the points situation can become very interesting. ‘The 2007 victory over Wales has given the fans back home some very high expectations. We might have to watch a few of those clips on Friday evening.’","Fiji prop Manasa Saulo was working on a sugar plantation while waiting for a visa .

"Scott Baldwin will make his first Wales start on Saturday but there was a time when the hooker looked more likely to follow in the footsteps of Tony Hawk, the American skateboarder, than Tony Woodcock, the 110-cap All Blacks front-row. Having ditched scrums for skate parks at the start of secondary school, a career in international rugby did not seem a likely outcome for the tearaway teenager. But the cost of competing prompted Baldwin to give up his beloved hobby and after returning to his local rugby club his career has been on an upwards trajectory. ‘Until I was 15 or 16 I was skateboarding instead of playing rugby,’ said Baldwin. ‘I came second at a British event in Bristol — my mate from Bridgend actually won it and a boy from my street came third. Scott Baldwin came off the bench for Wales against Australia - but is set to make his first start against Fiji . ‘I was one of those putting wax on the kerbs but I was snapping too many boards and they are expensive! I joined my local youth rugby team [Bridgend Athletic] and it became a lot more social than going down the skate park on your own.’ Baldwin, 26, has not looked back — apart from one impromptu outing on the board two years ago that ended with his 17st 5lb frame landing flat on the pavement. He made his Ospreys debut as a replacement against Leinster in March 2009 before earning his first Wales call-up in the summer of 2013. Baldwin used to be into skateboarding like professional boarder Tony Hawk . On Saturday he will take over from Gloucester’s Richard Hibbard, his former Ospreys team-mate who was wearing a protective boot earlier this week, for the second Test against Fiji. Last Saturday’s home debut against the Wallabies was a baptism of fire in terms of the pace of the game, which Baldwin admits was far greater than what he is used to in the Guinness Pro12 competition. Baldwin (left) and Alex Cuthbert (right) stand dejected at fulltime after defeat by Australia . ‘Obviously, it is different coming off the bench but it was so much quicker than I have ever played,’ said Baldwin. ‘But it was something I enjoyed — apart from the result. We are focusing on all the positives, we are not hiding from what happened in that last 10 to 15 minutes, but we have to move on and focus on this week against Fiji.’ Baldwin has earned his place in the Wales side after good performances for Ospreys . The former Bridgend College student will run out in front of more than 70,000 supporters at the Millennium Stadium, with cheaper tickets meaning sales have well surpassed the disappointing turnout for Saturday’s defeat by Australia. ‘I went to college and the coach [Gareth Nicholas] said I could play in the Premiership,’ said Baldwin. ‘I thought that would be as far as I could go. Then Andrew Millward came in and gave me a chance with the Ospreys and now I have been told I’m going to start at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. It’s a dream come true.’","Scott Baldwin looks set to start for Wales against Fiji .

"A Chinese man has undergone surgery to remove a 3.3lb (1.5kg) tumour from his face. Huang Chuncai, 37, from Hunan province, has been dubbed 'China's Elephant Man'. He suffers from an extreme case of neurofibromatosis, which has caused large tumours on his face that have completely distorted his features. He is said to have the world's worst recorded case of the condition. Huang Chuncai has undergone surgery to remove huge 3.3lb (1.5kg) tumours from his face . The 37-year-old suffers from neurofibromatosis, the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps. Huang is said to have the world's worst recorded case of it . On Wednesday he underwent another round of surgery at a hospital in Guangzhou to remove the tumour from his left cheek. The operation was successful and he will now have two more to try and get his condition under control. Neurofibromatosis is the name for a number of genetic conditions that cause swellings or lumps. Although . many people who have the condition inherit it from one of their . parents, up to 50 per cent develop it randomly from a gene mutation . before they are born. Despite their alarming appearance, the . growths and swellings - called neurofibromas and caused by a growth of . cells - are not cancerous or contagious. Huang's tumours, which five years ago were said to weigh 33lb (15kg), have put such pressure on his body that it has . deformed his backbone, stunted his growth and left him in continual . pain. The tumour first became noticable when he turned four and as he grew up, it became bigger and bigger. On Wednesday he underwent another round of surgery at a hospital in Guangzhou to remove the tumour from his left cheek . The operation was successful and he will now have two more to try and get his condition under control, Chinese media reported . He is said to have quit school when he was 10 years old because his classmates laughed and alienated him because of his condition. All of his teeth fell off at the age of 25 and thereafter, he found it difficult to speak and eat. It has also been reported that several years ago, a circus approached his father to buy his son for holding 'monster performances', but his . parents refused. Huang had surgery in 2007 and 2008 - the first to remove the 33lb tumour. The surgery was extremely risky due to the  high chance of heavy bleeding.

"There is a photograph of James Troisi alongside Andy Carroll and Fraser Forster in the Stadio Renzo Barbera in Sicily taken in 2006. The teenage trio were the future of Newcastle United, promoted to the senior squad for a UEFA Cup tie against Palermo. Show that photo to any Newcastle fan today and they will give you the names of the two boys who went on to become England internationals. As for the third lad, well only reserve-team anoraks could identify him. James Troisi (right) pictured alongside Newcastle teammates Andy Carroll (left) and Fraser Forster in 2006 . Troisi, pictured in 2006, struggled with the Tyneside winter after leaving the 40C heat in Australia . Travel 10,000 miles or so to Australia, however, and that same player is just about the most recognised sportsman in the country right now. For James Troisi, now 26 and on the books of Juventus, no less, was the scorer of the winning goal in the final of last month’s Asian Cup to give the Socceroos – including the likes of Tim Cahill and Mile Jedinak - their first piece of major silverware in front of 76, 385 home fans. In the 48 hours which followed that victory over South Korea, Troisi was everywhere – television, radio, the front and back page of every national newspaper. Ten years earlier, his family – dad Alby, mum Stacia and younger brother Isaac – took out credit and left home in Adelaide to support the two-footed attacking midfielder in his soccer venture in the North East of England. He was earning just £100 a week and walked to training every day, where the likes of Michael Owen and Nobby Solano were team-mates. Meanwhile, the Troisi family home in Australia was just two weeks away from being lost to debt collectors. Troisi (right) was offered a trial at Newcastle after impressing in a friendly while on tour . His family emigrated from Australia to Tyneside to support his career at St James' Park . It is, then, understandable how much that extra-time goal at Sydney’s Stadium Australia meant to Troisi and his family. ‘To make my mum and dad so proud was payback for everything we’ve been through and all of the support they’ve given me, they left everything behind for me when we moved to Newcastle,’ Troisi tells Sportsmail having now returned to Belgian loan club Zulte Waregem, where earlier this season he scored a David Beckham-esque lob from 45 yards which became an internet viral and netted another stunner against Standard Liege which sparked a riot among disgruntled fans. ‘It was massive for Australian football and my name will always be on the goal which won us our first Asian Cup (the equivalent of European Championships). ‘The whole country was celebrating. I’ve never felt like that before. It felt like I was the most famous person in Australia – it was pretty full-on and my phone never stopped. ‘I flew back to Belgium a few days later and back to reality – but scoring that goal was the stuff of dreams.’ Troisi in action for Newcastle during a pre season friendly against Carlisle United in July 2007 . Troisi's trial with the club was in front of Toon legend Peter Beardsley (left) and manager John Carver . So how did the Troisi family end up on Tyneside? When James was 10, Alby set up the Burning Ambition Soccer Academy in Adelaide – which used stick fighting and martial arts to strengthen their youngsters – and during a tour of Europe in 2003 they played Newcastle. Troisi impressed and was invited back for a trial in front of Peter Beardsley and current head coach John Carver. He won the offer of a scholarship and the family took the bold decision to emigrate. ‘It was a dream move and an amazing opportunity, but it was tough,’ he says. ‘It was a big change. We left home in December when it was nearly 40C and then you get to Newcastle and it is freezing. ‘We then nearly lost the house in Australia. My dad got a job as an accountant and my mum worked in Fenwick, the department store in town. ‘It wasn’t until I got my professional contract (a £1,500-per-week deal in 2008) that things got easier. ‘But I was doing well and thought I would make it. Myself, Andy and Fraser were the three players coming through. I was on the bench a lot and training with the big boys every day. ‘I got on really well with Emre (the Turkish international) and he could see I was frustrated at not playing. I needed to move on. Kevin Keegan did me a big favour by waiving the compensation owed to the club and Emre recommended I go to Turkey, where he put a good word in.’ Troisi was close with Emre (right) at Newcastle, who recommended he try playing in the Turkish league . Now 26, the Australian is on the books at Juventus but has been loaned out to co-owned Atlanta . After three years at Newcastle, Troisi signed for Genclerbirligi in the Turkish top flight and during his first season scored a match-winning hat-trick against Keyserispor. His name was noted and top-five Keyserispor duly signed him on a four-year deal. But Juventus were watching, too. ‘I had four brilliant years in Turkey. I was scoring goals and got a call-up to the national side and then there was word that Juventus were interested,’ says Troisi, who now speaks Italian, Turkish and Greek, although admits his accent still betrays a Geordie twang. ‘It was strange and out of the blue but felt like the recognition I deserved. I went over to Turin, had the tour of the stadium and had my medical there. ‘But the deal was a co-ownership with Atalanta and I was sent there during my first season. I hardly played and it was my lowest time in football, that’s not what I went for.’ Relief came when Juventus bought out his contract for 1million euros and he – and his family - returned to Australia for a loan season at Melbourne Victory - 35 appearances and 15 goals later and he had won a seat on the plane to the World Cup in Brazil. After thriving at Newcastle, Carroll went on to break transfer records at both Liverpool and West Ham . Forster (left), now at Southampton, has earned a place in Roy Hodgson's England squad . Troisi was the scorer of the winning goal in the final of last month’s Asian Cup for Australia . ‘I’ve got an Italian and Greek background, so for us it was always football. I remember the 1994 World Cup and being fascinated by Roberto Baggio, but you never think you’ll play at one yourself,’ says Troisi, who played against Lionel Messi, Angel di Maria and Juan Roman Riquelme – the best he has ever faced – at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing. ‘Our group – Holland, Spain and Chile - was incredibly hard. We didn’t get any points but we didn’t disgrace ourselves and the aim now, for me, is to get to the next World Cup. ‘It’s been some journey so far but I’m still young and I’m excited about the future. Who knows what will happen? There has been a lot of interest recently but I’m pretty open-minded.’ In the meantime he is answerable to Juventus – where his contract expires in 2016 – and the immediate future is chasing European football with Waregem. There, in a city of just 35,000, he is still relatively unknown, just as he was during three years in Newcastle. When he returns to his South Adelaide home in the summer, however, the last thing he can expect is anonymity. For in Australia, Troisi is a national hero.

"A 23-year-old university student in China will be executed after hanging two prostitutes and having sex with their corpses. The student, whose surname is Lee, was studying design at Jilin University in Changchun and told police that he had been failing a lot of classes and called the prostitutes to help relieve the pressure. He also told detectives that he used to have fantasies about having sex with dead bodies and decided one morning that he could no longer resist carrying it out. Macabre: The student had sex with a prostitute he'd murdered to fulfill a fantasy, police heard (file picture) On March 6 this year he hired a 20-year-old prostitute called Cai through the internet, according to iFeng.com. Lee then hanged her and had her body shipped back to his house in Changping , where he had sex with the corpse. It was then dismembered and the parts buried in Lee’s garden. Pressure: Jilin University (pictured) student Lee said he ordered the prostitutes to help him relax during his studies . On March 23 he carried out the same macabre act on the body of another prostitute that he’d hanged and shipped home. A forensic psychiatrist determined that Lee wasn’t insane and was criminally responsible for the crimes. The Second Intermediate People's Court found him guilty of intentional homicide and sentenced him to death. It also ordered him to pay 80,000 yuan (£8,000) in compensation to the victims’ families.","The Jilin University student told police he'd fantasised about necrophilia .

"Gary Neville says fans must forget about the 'Manchester United way' and place their trust in manager Louis van Gaal's philosophy. The 20-time English champions have struggled for consistency this season after the Dutchman replaced David Moyes in the summer, but still lie third in the Premier League table. Van Gaal has been criticised by supporters and pundits alike for his tactical stubbornness, with many suggesting he should revert to a quicker style of play to mirror Sir Alex Ferguson's great side. Manchester United must get used to their new style of play under Louis van Gaal, according to Gary Neville . The former United defender says fans need to let go of the Sir Alex Ferguson reign . Marouane Fellaini celebrates after scoring the second goal against Preston in the FA Cup on Monday night . But former defender and Sky Sports pundit Neville insists the Ferguson reign should be forgotten  if United want to move forward. 'The time has come for Manchester United fans – me included – to let go of the Sir Alex Ferguson reign and stop judging this new era by former glories,' Neville said in the Telegraph. 'The style of play and the names have changed, but the one person not confused by the team’s development will be Louis van Gaal. 'I’ve never been a manager, but I personally believe in attacking football, with a high tempo. If United were committed to protecting that style of play at all costs they should have appointed a manager with those beliefs. But there was no way Van Gaal was going to come to Manchester United and adopt somebody else’s philosophy. 'It’s a bit like breaking up with a partner of 26 years and wanting the new person to be the same as the old one. They – we – are going to have to let go. The idea of referencing Ferguson or saying ""It’s not the Manchester United way"" at every turn stylistically is not going to take Manchester United anywhere.'

Captain Wayne Rooney watches on as (l to r) Falcao, Ashley Young and Antonio Valencia work on a drill . Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and Van Gaal have admitted that Champions League qualification is a must this year after missing out on Europe all together last season. But United face a battle for a top-four spot over the next three months, with Southampton, Arsenal Tottenham and Liverpool all closing in. Neville says a 14-day period in March with matches against Tottenham and Liverpool with the league as well as Arsenal in an FA Cup quarter-final will be do-or-die for Van Gaal. 'Definitive opinions remain elusive. You can say momentarily: good performance, bad performance; this player played well, this one played badly.' 'But we are moving out of that hazy period, to a 14-day spell in March when opinions can harden. Arsenal in the FA Cup and Tottenham (home) and Liverpool (away) in the league. 'To reach an FA Cup semi-final and pick up four league points in those games would put United within striking range of ending the season on a high. Those results go wrong, and this could be a baptism of fire for Louis Van Gaal in his first season.'

"Tim Sherwood has reminded the football world his Premier League win percentage at Tottenham Hotspur is still superior to Mauricio Pochettino's ahead of his first match as Aston Villa manager. The 46-year-old credited his Argentine successor for continuing to blood academy graduates, but said Harry Kane would not have been such a scoring success this campaign had Sherwood allowed the 21-year-old to go out on loan in January 2014. The new Villa manager believes Christian Benteke can similarly improve under his watch, beginning with Saturday's visit of Stoke.

Andre Villas-Boas                     53.7% . Harry Redknapp                       49.3% . Juane Ramos                            28.57% . The match is Sherwood's first as a manager since Spurs beat Villa on the final day of last season to see him leave White Hart Lane with a 59 per cent top-flight win rate and his side sixth. Pochettino has guided Spurs to the same position with a 52 per cent win rate. 'The risk of failure at Tottenham was us dropping out of the Europa League slots,' said Sherwood. 'I don¹t think anyone¹s managed to better my win record, not even this guy Pochettino - and everyone¹s talking about how well he¹s done. 'I think he has done a really good job there, but mine¹s still up there to be shot at. He¹s inherited a good bunch of young players who were developed by myself. 'He¹s willing to play them as well, there¹s a lot of big stars there, he could have discarded (Ryan) Mason and (Nabil) Bentaleb but he¹s not done that so fair play to him. I respect him for that. Sherwood believes he can return misfiring striker Christian Benteke (centre) to his best . Sherwood watched from the stands as Villa defeated Leicester in their FA Cup fifth round tie . The former Blackburn captain's win percentage at White hart Lane was an impressive 59 per cent . 'You have to believe in those kids. If I hadn¹t resisted the club wanting to loan Harry Kane out last January, he wouldn¹t be the Harry Kane he is now.' On his Villa striker, Sherwood said: 'I don¹t think Christian thinks he¹s cracked it yet. He can go on and on, he looks like he has a real good desire to want to listen and improve. 'I know he was a beast up there and can bully people. I think he¹s a real good lad - he speaks better English than me as well!' Villa are 18th in the table without a win in 10 league games. 'I just need to do what I can do here,' said Sherwood. 'I know I¹m good enough to do the job, and I want that to sound confident, not arrogant. I just believe in my ability.'","Tim Sherwood won 59 per cent of Premier League games at Tottenham .

"James Hook will be given the chance to reignite his international career after being drafted into Warren Gatland’s Wales squad. Some wondered whether the 29-year-old Gloucester playmaker’s days in the red jersey were over when he was omitted from last month’s 34-man squad announcement. However, an injury to fly-half Dan Biggar has created an opening and the 76-cap utility back will travel across the Severn Bridge this morning to join the squad in Cardiff. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Warren Gatland: Australia will face different beast at World Cup . James Hook has been called up by Warren Gatland after being left out of the original 34-man squad . Dan Biggar has to leave the field with a groin strain which has led to Hook's call-up . Australian fullback Irael Folau beats Wales' Alex Cuthbert to run in the visitors' first try . Wales: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, George North, Jamie Roberts, Liam Williams; Dan Biggar, Rhys Webb; Paul James, Richard Hibbard, Samson Lee, Jake Ball, Alun Wyn Jones, Dan Lydiate, Sam Warburton (captain), Taulupe Faletau. Substitutes: Scott Baldwin, Gethin Jenkins, Rhodri Jones, Bradley Davies, Justin Tipuric, Mike Phillips, Rhys Priestland, Cory Allen. Australia: Israel Folau; Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita Kuridrani, Christian Leali'ifano, Joe Tomane; Bernard Foley, Nick Phipps; James Slipper, Saia Fainga'a, Sekope Kepu, Sam Carter, Rob Simmons, Sean McMahon, Michael Hooper (captain), Ben McCalman. Substitutes: James Hanson, Tetera Faulkner, Ben Alexander, James Horwill, Will Skelton, Matt Hodgson, Will Genia, Rob Horne. Contractual obligations to Gloucester mean Hook will not be available for the fourth Test against South Africa, which falls outside of the Test window, but he will be free to play in the next two fixtures, against Fiji and New Zealand. Gatland was forced to bring in reinforcements after Biggar suffered a groin strain in Saturday’s defeat by Australia, leaving Rhys Priestland as the only fit fly-half in the squad. Hook’s adaptability means he can also cover at full-back, where Wales will be without Leigh Halfpenny, who is sidelined with concussion. The alternative scenario was to fast-track New Zealand convert Gareth Anscombe into the squad. The 23-year-old landed in Cardiff last night and is eligible to play for Wales through his mother, but he will instead make his debut for Cardiff Blues this weekend. ‘Gareth needs to play some rugby first,’ said Gatland. ‘It would be unfair to bring him in. He has to spend some time in the Welsh camp, experience some Welsh banter and learn his trade.’ Wales' Rhys Webb runs in the first try of the match in the third minute after a break from Sam Warburton . Wallaby's Christian Leali'ifano is driven back by Webb and Taulupe Faletau early on at the Millennium Stadium . Folau strikes again after an intercept on the Wallabies defensive 22m line and runs the length of the pitch . Hook is likely to be named on the bench this weekend, with Scarlet Liam Williams expected to take Halfpenny’s place at full-back for the second round of fixtures. Williams was one of Wales’ more impressive players on Saturday, despite being deployed in his weaker position on the wing. He was unable to prevent Wales from suffering a 10th straight defeat by the Wallabies, part of a painfully barren run that has seen Gatland’s side lose 21 consecutive fixtures against the ‘big three’ of the southern hemisphere. It was yet another case of conceding decisive scores at the death for the home side. Wales were leading with eight minutes to play before Wallabies fly-half Bernard Foley inevitably kicked six points to snatch victory.

Tevita Kuridrani busts through a tackle on the burst and beats Jamie Roberts (right) for the Aussies' third try . Wales celebrate their third try through Alun Wyn Jones in time added on in the first half . Wales had taken an early lead after a third-minute try from Rhys Webb, but the scrum-half was among those at fault as a series of cheap mistakes allowed Australia back into the game. Missed tackles from Biggar, Alex Cuthbert and Alun-Wyn Jones proved costly for two of Australia’s three first-half tries, while Webb’s 20-yard miss-pass gifted Israel Folau an interception and he cantered over from 80 metres. ‘I was happy with my try but then I gave away a silly interception,’ said Webb. ‘If it had gone to Liam Williams it would have been a different story, but it is one of those things. ‘It was there for us, but we have to take the positives.’ Prop Gethin Jenkins started on the bench but his impact in the scrum — where Wales won a 64th-minute penalty try after scores from Cuthbert and Jones — could earn the 126-cap front row a starting place against Fiji.

"Lack of romance: The local police chief hinted that James Holmes, seen here during his days as a camp counselor, may have broken up with someone shortly before the shooting . The gunman who allegedly killed 12 people during a screening of The Dark Knight Rises in Aurora, Colorado was due to be kicked out of his apartment and may have broken up with a girlfriend in the days before his shooting spree, it has emerged. James Holmes, 24, had dropped out of the University of Colorado weeks before the attack and was nearing the end of his grace period for staying at the institution's accommodation. Aurora police chief Daniel Oates also hinted that Holmes had recently gone through a break up and that authorities were investigating the claim. The new details may give some insight into what pushed Holmes over the edge. A former classmate from the University of Colorado suggested another cause for the killings, describing Holmes as someone who had lost touch with reality after becoming 'obsessed' with video games. The classmate told the Daily Mail: 'James was obsessed with computer games and was always playing role-playing games. 'I can’t remember which one but it was something like World of Warcraft, one of those where you compete against people on the internet. 'He did not have much of a life apart from that and doing his work. James seemed like he wanted to be in the game and be one of the characters. 'It seemed that being online was more important to him than real life. He must have lost his sense of reality, how else can you shoot dozens of people you don’t know?' It is also believed that Holmes was due to be evicted from his flat. The 24-year-old, who is now in police custody, pulled out of the university weeks before the deadly attack. Neighbours told TMZ anyone living in the block had to be enrolled at the university otherwise you had 30 days to evacuate. Scroll down for video . Inside the life of a killer: After spending hours dismantling the many booby traps set up around James Holmes' Aurora apartment, police investigated the area and took pictures of the evidence . It is not known exactly when Holmes . stopped going to classes but it is thought he was nearing the end of the . 30-day grace period. Earlier Aurora police chief Daniel Oates addressed the hunt for a motive for Holmes's murderous actions, telling CBS' Face the Nation: 'I’ve heard one morsel of information about a relationship that may or may not be true. 'That’s . why we have all our investigators working on this. That’s why we . brought in the FBI behavioral analysts. They’re going to figure all that . stuff out. 'There will be . no easy or quick answers. And maybe there will never be any answers. This requires a lot of work. And we’re just not in a position to give . any indications of that now. 'And again, whatever we do develop, the . proper place to make sure we get proper justice for the victims is to . reveal that stuff in the course of the criminal prosecution.' This . clue came out on the same day as it was revealed that in addition to a . profile on adultfinder.com, Holmes also had a profile active on the . dating website, Match.com. On both profiles, he wrote a chilling message to viewers which said 'Will you visit me in prison?' During . the same interview, Chief Oates said that they had spoken with someone . who was an acquaintance of the 24-year-old shooting suspect, leading . many to initially fear that the investigation had not come to an end. 'I'm not quite sure what the term person of interest means,' Mr Oates told CBS News. 'This was a person who had contact with the suspect, a casual acquaintance. We found him yesterday, we interviewed him.' During the talk with Face The Nation's Bob Schieffer, Mr Oates was quick to downplay the questioning. 'The relationship was really inconsequential and we're happy that we spoke to him. That's all that was,' he said. A witness at the scene initially said that he thought he saw a second man helping Holmes during the attack. The male witness who saw Holmes . launch his deadly attack says he thought he also saw someone open the . doors of the movie theatre to let the shooter in. Inspecting carefully: Police and fire officials carried out the search of Holmes' apartment . Anti-social: Holmes was thought to be a recluse who covered his windows with black garbage bags so that no one could see in . Insight: Pictures have not been released of the interior of his apartment, so the only glimpses come from the outside looking in . The witness, who has not been named, . told KCNC it appeared that a cinemagoer who left the screening after . receiving a telephone call deliberately left the emergency exit open. Holmes used the emergency exit to access the screening of the Hollywood blockbuster in Aurora, Colorado. The . witness said: 'As I was sitting down to get my seat, I noticed that a . person came up to the front row, the front right, sat down, and as . credits were going, it seemed like he got a phone call. 'So . he went out toward the emergency exit doorway, which I thought was . unusual to take a phone call. And it seemed like he probably pried it . open, or probably did not let it latch all the way. 'As . soon as the movie started, somebody came in, all black, gas mask, . armour, and threw a gas can into the audience, and it went off, and then . there were gunshots that took place.' Mr Oates was clear to mention that . while they were still trying to determine the circumstances leading up . to the fatal attack- and what, if any, motive the young man had- he said . that police are confident in saying that he acted alone. 'All . the evidence we have, every single indicator, is that this was all Mr . Holmes' activity. He wasn't particularly aided by anyone else,' Mr Oates . said during the interview. Massacre: 12 people were left dead and 58 injured in the Colorado shooting . The . first time that police began to think that there may have been an . accomplice was when a local officer received a threatening electronic . message Saturday evening, demanding that Holmes be released from custody . or else the sender would become violent. The sender and the format of the . message have not been released publicly, but police investigated the . threat and appear confident that there was no accomplice. They spent hours on Friday and Saturday in Holmes' apartment, dismantling the many booby traps and explosives that the madman had set up to kill whomever entered his apartment. Unconfirmed reports state that Holmes had a Batman poster adorning one of the walls. Police chief Oates would not comment on the poster, but photographers did capture a portion of a different poster while investigators were examining the shooter's apartment. Witness: This man claims to have seen someone leave the emergency exit of the cinema open for Holmes near the beginning of the film . Ritchie Duong told the Los Angeles . Times that he has known Holmes for more than a decade and they also both . attended undergraduate school at the University of California, . Riverside, where they saw each other once a week to watch the television . series Lost. They last met in December for dinner and a movie. Mr Duong says at the time, Holmes seemed fine. He also says academics came easily to Holmes both at high school and at the UC Riverside. Mr Duong says he remembers that in one college class they had together, Holmes didn't take notes but would just sit through class and always got an A. Police have surmised that the grad school dropout had seemingly spent months planning the murderous assault, as he had amassed a stockpile of arms and explosives over long period of time. Victims' families and survivors may get more of an insight into Holmes's motivation after his first court appearance on Monday morning.

"Gethin Jenkins has been promoted from substitute to captain as Warren Gatland names a new-look line-up for Saturday’s Test against Fiji. The Kiwi coach was expected to make wholesale changes and, as reported by Sportsmail, experienced loosehead Jenkins returns to the starting XV after his impressive impact from the bench against Australia. Jenkins is joined in the tight-five by second rows Bradley Davies and Luke Charteris, of Wasps and Racing Metro, as well as Ospreys hooker Scott Baldwin. Sam Warburton (centre, applauding), Wales' regular captain, has been rested for the Fiji clash . Inside centre Jamie Roberts is one of just seven players who keep their place after the Australia defeat . Liam Williams (Scarlets), Alex Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), Scott Williams (Scarlets), Jamie Roberts (Racing Metro), George North (Northampton Saints), Rhys Priestland (Scarlets), Mike Phillips (Racing Metro), Gethin Jenkins (Cardiff Blues, CAPT), Scott Baldwin (Ospreys), Samson Lee (Scarlets), Bradley Davies (Wasps), Luke Charteris (Racing Metro), Dan Lydiate (Unattached), Justin Tipuric (Ospreys), Taulupe Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Replacements: Emyr Phillips (Scarlets), Nicky Smith (Ospreys), Rhodri Jones (Scarlets), Alun Wyn Jones (Ospreys), James King (Ospreys), Rhodri Williams (Scarlets), James Hook (Gloucester), Cory Allen (Cardiff Blues). ‘We have made a number of changes, but we are going out there with what we think is a strong side to take on Fiji,’ said Gatland. ‘The whole squad has been working very hard and were pushing for selection last week so it’s an opportunity for them to start. ‘We were pleased with the performance last week and we will be looking to build on that and get the result we want this weekend. ‘We have made some changes, some have been enforced due to injury but we don’t feel it weakens the side.’ Samson Lee, Dan Lydiate and Taulupe Faletau are the only forwards to keep their place in the pack. Justin Tipuric, the British and Irish Lion, comes in to replace captain Sam Warburton, who is rested. The return to fitness of centre Scott Williams allows George North to move back to the wing, partnering Alex Cuthbert and Liam Williams in the back-three. Taulupe Faletau will continue at No 8, but only three of the Welsh pack will start both games . Alex Cuthbert, who scored Wales' second try last weekend, retains his place on the wing for the Fiji clash . Defensive captain Jamie Roberts keeps his place at inside-centre, playing on the shoulder of a new half-back combination of Mike Phillips and Rhys Priestland. James Hook is named on the bench after being drafted into the squad on Sunday night. Wales are hoping for their first win of the series after Saturday’s 33-28 defeat by Australia at the Millennium Stadium. Gatland’s side have won just one of their previous three Tests against Fiji, who are boosted by the return of Leicester wing Vereniki Goneva and Ospreys centre Josh Matavesi. ‘Josh Matavesi has rejoined the squad following injury and Vereniki Goneva has also joined the squad,’ said Fiji coach John McKee. ‘Goneva was unable to travel to France last week due to late issue of his visa.’","Gethin Jenkins was impressive off the bench against Australia .

"Barbie dolls are often coming under fire for being an unrealistic portrayal of real women. Last week graphic artist Eddi Aguirre caused a stir online by digitally altering an image of the perfect blonde to illustrate what an unmade-up version might look like, warts and all. Gone was the smooth skin, silky hair and bright white Barbie smile, instead this hyperreal version - published with the tagline 'no one is perfect' - featured under eye bags, yellow teeth, braces, blotchy skin and frizzy hair. Now one company has claimed that Aguirre's image went too far and have responded with their own rather more gentle idea of what our favourite dolls might look like without the warpaint. Artist Nickolay Lamm has revelaed what dolls would look really like without make-up following the hyperreal Barbie image that was released last week . Lamm took pictures of the dolls then removed the lipstick, eyeshadow and blusher in a computer image manipulation programme . Lamm says: '(The original picture) got me thinking: is this what Barbie would really look like without make-up? Ken is a pretty good looking doll. So, surely Barbie without make-up can't be too different.' Artist Nickolay Lamm has given Barbie, as well as her friends Bratz and Sindy, a digital make under that reveals a pretty, natural, girl next door look that is a far cry from the original frazzled Barbie. The idea is to prove that these ladies - like most girls - don't really need cosmetics to enhance their looks. Lamm, working with website MyVoucherCodes.co.uk after the site saw a huge spike in ‘Barbie discounts’ searches last week, took pictures of the original dolls then removed the lipstick, eyeshadow and blusher in a computer image manipulation programme. Lamm explains: 'I decided to see what Barbie (and other dolls) really looked like without makeup. '(The . original picture) got me thinking: is this what Barbie would really . look like without make-up? Ken is a pretty good looking doll. So, surely . Barbie without make-up can't be too different. 'Sure enough, Barbie still looks pretty, even au naturel.' 'The . real Barbie without make-up brings up a new point: if Barbie can look . good without makeup, why doesn't Mattel make dolls with a more natural . look?' 'The real Barbie without make-up brings up a new point: if Barbie can look good without makeup, why doesn't Mattel make dolls with a more natural look?' Lamm's conclusion is that the dolls do not really need to wear cosmetics to enhance their looks . Since her inception in 1959, Barbie - with her perky breasts, flaxen hair, and tiny proportions - has been blamed . for instilling a negative body-image in young girls. According to The . Washington Post, Sleepover Barbie even came with a bathroom scale. Many responses to Aguirre's 'natural' Barbie have been negative, however. 'A doll with an incredibly sick look? Like she's got an awful hangover or renal failure? Which child would . want it?' wrote one commenter. 'I . didn't know ""natural"" meant you looked like you've been up all night . and you smoke crack,' wrote another. And: 'I think I just saw Ken . running away in horror!' One . woman, named Raven, added: 'I fail to see what's wrong with admiring . beauty. Even if it's the beauty of a Barbie. Why do we need to destroy . something that has been an icon for generations? Because some people . feel inadequate in comparison? Stop comparing yourself. Don't blame her.' Eddi Aguirre's picture of Barbie looking less than perfect caused a stir online last week with some critics saying that she looked like she was suffering with liver failure . Fran Walfish, a child and family therapist based in Beverly Hills, told Yahoo: 'It's human nature for people to build up iconic figures and then tear them down. 'We . idealize public figures because we want something to aspire to but our . standards are impossibly high. And when these icons inevitably misstep, . we feel disappointed and angry that our hopes have been dashed.' She . added: 'Barbie with braces and acne looks very much like the type of . women and girls who come into my practice. Perhaps this new image is a . good thing.'","Artist Eddi Aguirre created a picture of a hyperreal Barbie last week .

Rapper has been staying in the Italian city ahead of the nuptials without Kim . Reality star back in LA after a brief visit to New York for an E! appearance . For months Kim Kardashian and Kanye West looked set to exchange vows in France, even listing Paris as the wedding destination on their invite. But after it emerged this week that the couple will actually say 'I do' in Florence, the rapper has revealed why the Italian city is so close to their heart. Scroll down for video . Groomzilla: Kanye West, pictured in Florence on Friday with Ermanno Daelli, who is one owner of the fashion house Ermanno Scervino . In an interview with Florence's La Nazione newspaper on Friday, the 36-year-old said: 'I adore Florence. I love Italy and the Italian lifestyle. 'To tell you the truth, I already came to the banks of the Arno [river] with Kim last year, just the two of us, incognito.' He continued: 'I think that our daughter North was conceived here among the Renaissance masterpieces. Here comes the bride: Kim Kardashian arrived back in LA on Thursday night after a promotional visit to New York for the E! network . 'It was our first honeymoon. It is one of the most beautiful cities in the world—for me the most beautiful in Europe.' (The rapper took Kim on a tour of Italy . for her 32nd birthday, visiting Florence in late October 2012 after . stops in Rome and Venice.)

'I am a romantic: for Mother’s Day I gave Kim a . wall of flowers. Family is everything for me, the antidote to the . pressure of fame. Family and creativity relax me. I am happy to create . for my family.' West has been staying in Florence and quietly studying with fashion designer Ermanno Daelli, who is one owner of the fashion house Ermanno Scervino. He said Kim, 33, inspires him and said they turn to each other for fashion advice. 'I consult her on elegance and what I wear,' he revealed. 'And she does the same for me. Today as a musician I like to dress in a less showy way than in the past.' Where the magic happened: Kim and Kanye in Florence in late October 2012 . He is working on his music too, adding: 'I am composing a whole album, Made in Florence.' MailOnline exclusively revealed on Friday that the pair's fairytale wedding will take . place at a sixteenth century castle in Florence, with a dark history.

"The boo boys almost forced Rhys Priestland to call time on his international career two years ago but Warren Gatland has told the Wales fly-half to wave two fingers at his critics on Saturday. Priestland was the target of yet more vitriol in the 33-28 defeat by Australia last weekend. His second-half introduction was greeted by a chorus of jeers, harking back to 2012 when the level of abuse became so bad that the No 10 was reluctant to leave his flat and had to seek help from a sports psychologist. Boo boys almost forced Rhys Priestland (above) to give up rugby two years ago . The fly-half (second from right) was jeered when he came on as a substitute during Wales's defeat by Australia . L Williams (Scarlets); A Cuthbert (Cardiff Blues), S Williams (Scarlets), J Roberts (Racing Metro), G North (Northampton); R Priestland (Scarlets), M Phillips (Racing Metro); G Jenkins (Cardiff Blues, capt), S Baldwin (Ospreys), S Lee (Scarlets); B Davies (Wasps), L Charteris (Racing Metro); D Lydiate (unattached), J Tipuric (Ospreys), T Faletau (Newport Gwent Dragons). Subs: E Phillips (Scarlets), N Smith (Ospreys), R Jones (Scarlets), A-W Jones (Ospreys), J King (Ospreys), R Williams (Scarlets), J Hook (Gloucester), C Allen (Cardiff Blues). But Wales coach Gatland has stood by the 27-year-old Scarlets playmaker, who was yesterday named in the starting line-up to face Fiji this Saturday. New Zealander Gatland made an impassioned defence of his player and urged Priestland to silence the doubters when he returns to the Millennium Stadium. ‘I suppose it’s part of sport now,’ said Gatland. ‘Tottenham got booed at the weekend, didn’t they? ‘You feel for Rhys a little bit because he’s been hammered on social media by certain sections. He is a confidence player and you hate to see it. ‘He’s a young man who at one stage contemplated giving the game away because it wasn’t worth taking that sort of personal criticism. Head coach Warren Gatland has urged Priestland (left) to silence his critics when Wales play fiji on Saturday . Priestland has been named in the side after Dan Biggar (above) suffered a groin injury . ‘I thought he did pretty well when he came on at the weekend. I just hope he goes out, plays well and puts two fingers up to the section of the crowd that may have been booing him last week. ‘It’s something I don’t think we need in the game. We don’t always agree, but that’s the beauty of sport. ‘You disagree with someone and that’s fine, but you’d like to see there’s a bit of respect out there for people who are trying to do their best. He doesn’t go out there to put that jersey on and fail.’ A groin injury to Dan Biggar has given Priestland his opportunity in the Wales starting XV. The Scarlets No 10, who has 31 caps, offers better vision than Biggar, but has come under fire for his inconsistency and a tendency to make mistakes at key moments. His promotion is one of eight changes to the starting line-up. Jonathan Davies, who is also a doubt to face the All Blacks next week, and Leigh Halfpenny are both sidelined, but the return to fitness of centre Scott Williams has allowed George North to switch back to his preferred position on the wing. Leigh Halfpenny (above) is not available to face Fiji after leaving the field with an injury against Australia . The return to fitness of Scott Williams allows George North (centre) to switch to his preferred wing position . Liam Williams moves to full-back and veteran Mike Phillips comes in to complete a new-look half-back combination, with utility man James Hook providing cover from the bench. Hook’s international career was in doubt after his omission from last month’s 34-man squad, but the 29-year-old Gloucester man was recalled on Sunday evening. Leicester’s Owen Williams and Bath’s Gavin Henson were also available, but Gatland saw Hook as the ideal candidate. ‘I didn’t consider Gavin at all,’ said Gatland. ‘Owen’s been playing a bit at 12, but hasn’t been playing a lot at 10. We’ve been watching James and his game has improved for Gloucester. He gives us some versatility. It’s quite hard to integrate a new No 10 that quickly so, for us, it was a logical decision. ‘We had spoken to the coaches about things we wanted James to work on and concerns that we’d had before selection. We were concerned with how lateral he was. We wanted him to attack the line a bit more and be a lot squarer. Gatland said that he did not consider brining Gavin Henson (above) in to the squad . Captain Sam Warburton (centre) will be rested by Gatland for the Test against Fiji on Saturday . ‘He has been working on that aspect and that’s made a difference to him and Gloucester.’ There are also wholesale changes to the forwards and Hook’s Gloucester team-mate, Richard Hibbard, is replaced at hooker by Scott Baldwin. Gethin Jenkins comes off the bench to captain the side and is joined in the tight-five by Bradley Davies and Luke Charteris, of Wasps and Racing Metro. Sam Warburton is rested to give Justin Tipuric a run at openside, completing the back-row alongside Dan Lydiate and Toby Faletau. The forwards will look to dominate the set-piece against their World Cup group opponents, who Gatland believes will be at their most dangerous when they get the ball out wide. ‘They’ve got some quality finishers,’ he said. ‘We’re giving them an opportunity to play on a fast ground with the roof closed, which will suit their ball carriers and their offloading ability. ‘They always manage to do something out of the ordinary and I think that will add to the spectacle.’ ‘They are a side that have perhaps put a bit more emphasis into their sevens campaigns, but they’re going to be tough. We’ve got to have the confidence and self-belief that we’re good enough to handle their threats and put them away to win comfortably.’","Rhys Priestland almost gave up rugby two years ago because of abuse .

"In a tactical war-room at Newcastle United's training ground – decorated with canvas prints of goal celebrations and team huddles – a sign on the wall reads: 'It is not about blame, we are all accountable'. John Carver, however, wants to be accountable, he wants to be the man tasked with leading his home-town club. The final 13 games of this season will determine his fate on that front, but finish in the top 10 – they are currently 11th – and the job is his. John Carver has 13 games left to ensure Newcastle secure a top 10 finish in the Premier League . Newcastle's Dutch right-back Daryl Janmaart plays the ball forward at the club's training ground . Toon goalkeeper Tim Krul dives to make a save in training ahead of Saturday's game with Manchester City . Earlier this week, managing director Lee Charnley felt moved to issue a statement urging fans to support Carver and the team. He was responding to chants of 'Are you Pardew in disguise?' which were aimed at the head coach during last week's 1-1 draw at Crystal Palace. But Carver is determined to prove he is his own man with his own ideas. In the tactics room this week he pored over video clips of the game at Selhurst Park with his players, comparing their performance to training-ground footage – a new initiative under Carver – and offering advice, criticism and praise. Repetition is his aim until it becomes the norm. Every time he sees Ayoze Perez – be it in the tactics room, changing room or dining room – he reminds him that strikers only score goals in the penalty box. There is footage, from Palace, of Perez missing out on a certain goal as the ball drops in the six-yard area. He, meanwhile, is coming into frame on the edge of the box. Then there is a clip of Harry Kane pressurising defenders. Above the head of the Spurs striker is the name Papiss Cisse – it is clear who Carver wants his Senegal frontman to replicate when it comes to work-rate. Subsequent action shows Cisse doing just that in the following game. John Carver has told Newcastle forward Ayoze Perez that he must get himself into the box more often . Carver has encouraged his forwards to emulate the movement of Tottenham striker Harry Kane . Newcastle midfielder Moussa Sissoko enjoys some banter with striker Papiss Cisse in training . Cisse has scored 10 goals in 16 Premier League appearances for Newcastle so far this season . Carver has also tweaked the 4-2-3-1 formation he inherited from Alan Pardew, explaining the weaknesses of that system in certain scenarios. But he is also open to the input of others. On Wednesday, he sought the guidance of some 10-year-old schoolboys at his golf club. 'I asked one lad what his formation would be and to write down his team on a piece of paper. He had two defenders in a 2-6-2 system - I told him we would do that against Manchester City!' laughs Carver, who takes his side to the Etihad on Saturday afternoon. But there are more serious issues for him to address, such as the unrest which triggered Charnley's call for calm. 'When people start having a go I can half understand that, because if I was a fan in the stands I'd be having a go myself at times,' he says. 'But it takes away from the importance of supporting the team. I'm trying to create something here. 'This hasn't just happened, this hasn't been given to me on a plate. I've had to work extremely hard for it. 'So it is important to make sure there is a relationship between me and the fans and that they understand I only want the best for this club.' Back in the analysis room, Carver explains the threat which City will pose tonight, dragging their players towards Newcastle's goal at every point of attack on a magnetic tactics board. At the same time he shines his laser pen towards the sparsely-populated City half. His intention is clear. He has a plan and he's taking responsibility for it.

"Alex Mowatt grabbed the only goal as Leeds dented Middlesbrough's Sky Bet Championship title aspirations with a smash-and-grab 1-0 win. The midfielder scored in the third minute as Middlesbrough, who entered the day's early kick-off one point clear at the top of the table, fell to a first home defeat since August. Aitor Karanka's men headed into the afternoon's early game brimming with confidence having risen above Derby and Bournemouth with a 1-1 draw at Birmingham on Wednesday.

Goal: Mowatt, 3 . Referee: Andre Marriner . But they got off to a terrible start when Mowatt put the visitors ahead with a deflected strike. Middlesbrough responded well but, despite creating a glut of chances in the opening period, they could not find a way past the dogged rearguard led by Leeds skipper Sol Bamba. It was the same story after half-time, welcome news for Middlesbrough's rivals Derby and Bournemouth in the promotion battle. Middlesbrough's position did not stop Karanka continuing his rotation policy, with six changes made to the side that started in midweek. It was the sole enforced alteration that proved Boro's undoing, though, as Leeds took an immediate lead. Tomas Mejias, in the XI because Dimi Konstantopoulos was serving a suspension for his red card versus the Blues, saw a poor throw-out intercepted by Lewis Cook. And the midfielder took full advantage, pulling back for Mowatt to fire into the bottom corner via a deflection. Middlesbrough almost bounced back immediately, only for Jelle Vossen to fluff his lines having been picked out by Grant Leadbitter's well-worked free-kick. The home side looked the most likely to score thereafter, with Kike and Vossen drawing smart saves from Marco Silvestri. Vossen then went agonisingly close to levelling when Giuseppe Bellusci cleared off the line to deny the Belgian after good work from Kike and Adam Reach. The onslaught showed few signs of halting as only last-ditch defending, and excellent saves from Silvestre to deny Kike and Adam Clayton, kept Leeds ahead at half-time.

But Leeds issued a warning shot of their own moments later when Scott Wootton nodded James Murphy's free-kick against the crossbar. Any thoughts that his effort may herald a spell of visiting pressure were quickly extinguished, Silvestri again called into action by Kike and Albert Adomah.

That meant there were nine minutes of injury time, although Middlesbrough - down to 10 men having used three substitutes - could not force themselves level.","Championship leaders Middlesbrough lose to Leeds 1-0 at home .

"A preacher in Florida who shares the same name as the man who shot an unarmed teenager dead last year says he is being plagued by abusive phone calls. George Zimmermann, 78, who has two 'n's in his surname unlike the man who shot Trayvon Martin, says he has received death threats and angry calls since his namesake, who is 29, was acquitted of second-degree murder earlier this month. Now the elderly preacher from Deland, Volusia County, has called police for help in dealing with the calls, in which he has been told to 'watch your back' and 'you're a dead man'. Scroll down for video . Preacher George Zimmermann, 78, says he is plagued by abusive calls and death threats from people who think he is George Zimmerman (with one 'n'), who shot Trayvon Martin dead . Mr Zimmermann says in one call he was told: 'Hey [expletive] you're the one who killed Trayvon Martin, when your [expletive] get out, you're dead. 'Wherever you go, you're dead...You better get ready to dig a six-foot hole,' the Huffington Post reported. The preacher says he is not frightened by the calls and understands that people just want to take their frustration out after a trial verdict that angered many in the U.S. He told WESH.com that most of the calls involved swearing and name-calling and said: 'I know it's ridiculous but this is people.' He added: 'The type of people that would do this, they're just venting their emotions, and being what I am, and who I am, OK, you vented, you've done it. I listened to you.' The preacher says while he understands why people are calling him, the calls are so frequent they are becoming a nuisance. George Zimmerman, 29, left, fatally shot Trayvon Martin, 17, right, in a housing complex in Sanford last February . He has now changed his telephone number and is hoping the issue will be solved.

"In a blow to potential Premier League suitors Manchester City, Diego Simeone is in talks to extend his contract at Atletico Madrid until 2022. The Argentine manager's sister Natalia Simeone, who handles his contractual affairs, has been in the Spanish capital for the last 10 days to discuss terms of a proposed new deal. The reigning La Liga champions, who recently sold a 20 per cent stake in the club to the Dalian Wanda group, are interested in tying down the highly sought after manager on a seven-year deal, according to Spanish daily AS. Diego Simeone has been previously linked with a move to Premier League champions Manchester City . The 44-year-old Argentinian is reportedly in talks over extending his contract at Atletico until 2022 . Atletico Madrid players, including the returning Arda Turan (left), train ahead of their game against Almeria . 7 - After just nine years in management Simeone has already won seven major honours — including La Liga, the Copa del Rey and Europa League. 64.3 - His win percentage in his three-and-a-half seasons as Atletico manager. 4 - The number of times Simeone’s Atletico have beaten arch-rivals Real Madrid this season. They have also had two draws. Among the clauses being negotiated is giving Simeone complete control over player signings in a bid to offer the 44-year-old longevity. The former Argentina international has been a revelation at the Vicente Calderon, winning the Spanish league title and reaching the Champions League final before losing to city rivals Real Madrid last season. Premier League champions City had been linked with Simeone amid growing concern over their faltering season, which has seen them eliminated from both domestic cup competitions and trail league leaders Chelsea by seven points. Manager Manuel Pellegrini's future at the Etihad could be decided by their progress in the Champions League where they face Barcelona in their last 16 first-leg on Tuesday after scraping through to the knockout stage. Manuel Pellegrini's future at the Etihad is uncertain should he end the season without winning silverware . Atletico, the reigning La Liga champions, have lost momentum in the title race after defeat by Celta Vigo . Should Pellegrini leave, Simeone would be top of the oil rich club's wishlist since both Carlo Ancelotti and Bayern Munich’s Pep Guardiola are less likely to leave their clubs while Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp is having a poor season. Despite condemning Real Madrid 4-0 recently, a 2-0 defeat to Celta Vigo in their next match has left Atletico seven points off the title race with the manager claiming that the club's priority is only to finish third ahead of the weekend's game against Almeria. 'I am convinced that this is our target. Our objective is (qualifying for) the Champions League and our rivals are Valencia and Sevilla. Possibly also Villarreal as they are playing well and have grown a lot,' he said.","Atletico Madrid are keen to tie down the Argentinian to a seven-year deal .

"Hugh Hefner became the latest high-profile victim of a 'swatting' prank after police swarmed the Playboy Mansion in response to a 911 call, only to find nothing amiss at the property. LAPD officers rushed to the lavish mansion yesterday following a report of an assault inside the house, but found no evidence of a disturbance at the scene. This week also saw movie legend Clint Eastwood added to the growing list of famous names targeted by the swatting craze, which has seen bogus callers reporting fake crimes at celebrities' homes in the hope that heavily-armed police officers will storm their properties. Scroll down for video . Prank: Police suspected Hugh Hefner had become the latest in a string of high-profile victims of prank 'swatting' calls . 'Crank caller': The 86-year-old Playboy tycoon - seen with new wife Crystal Harris at their New Year's Eve wedding at the Playboy Mansion - tweeted about the prank . Simon Cowell, Chris Brown and the Kardashian family have also been targeted. Magazine magnate Hefner, 86, said on Twitter yesterday: 'A crank call brought police to the Playboy Mansion this morning. Other celebs have been victims of recent hoaxes.' Notorious: Hefner's palatial L.A. mansion has hosted numerous Playmates over the years . It is not known whether the octogenarian was at home when officers arrived. An LAPD spokesman had said 'it could be one of those swatting calls' after the initial investigation at the property yesterday yielded no evidence of a crime, TMZ said. Prank: Clint Eastwood is one of several celebrities to be targeted by 'swatting' calls . But officers have since identified the caller and are understood to believe they genuinely thought an assault had occurred. Police are still investigating. Swatting was behind officers rushing to the home of Clint Eastwood this week in response to fake reports the property was being stormed by gunmen. The prank caller told police people had been shot at the star's Los Angeles home, but officers found nothing wrong when they arrived. It is not known whether Eastwood was in the property when police arrived. More than a dozen celebrities have fallen victim to the prank, including Ashton Kutcher, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Simon Cowell, Tom Cruise, the Kardashians, and Chris Brown.It is called 'swatting' because the heavily armed response officers are from the SWAT tactical teams. Police have said they will prosecute anyone making the prank calls as they tie up valuable resources. A 12-year-old boy was charged earlier this month in relation to fake emergency calls, including a false report of a gun battle underway at the home of actor Ashton Kutcher. Police rushed to Kutcher's house in October last year after anonymous reports of intruders in possession of firearms and explosives, and of several people being shot. The boy was charged with two felony counts of making false bomb threats and two of computer intrusion stemming from the incident, TMZ said.","Officers swarmed the Playboy Mansion in L.A. in response to a 911 call .

Channel every day. ‘We want the border to be moved from . Calais to Dover and Folkestone for one month so Britain understands how . difficult the problem is.’ The comments came as the area’s police . chief delayed raids on the camp, known as Jungle 2, after tensions . erupted into clashes between migrant groups the night before. Jungle 2 and another camp had been ‘due to be dismantled’ after court orders to evacuate expired yesterday.

Basic: Eritrean men cook eggs together outside their shelter at an illegal Calais camp, known as 'Jungle 2' But following the violence the prefect . of the Pas-de-Calais area, Denis Robin, said delegations would be sent . in to speak to the migrants to prevent any further trouble. The huge influx of migrants from Africa comes after the re-opening of the ports in Libya – a main jumping off point to Europe. Migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan who have been gathering there for two years can now leave – and an estimated 300,000 are said to be waiting to head across the Mediterranean for a new life. The change of policy came after Libya said it would help them head to Europe if the EU did not give it financial help to cope with the influx. From January to April this year, 42,000 migrants were recorded by EU border agency Frontex – 25,650 of them crossing from Libya.

"Real Madrid will have to part with at least £74million to sign Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba, the France international's agent Mino Raiola is quoted as saying in Marca.

"Ayman Ibrahim was accused of attempting to frame his ex-wife's new lover for the bombing of an IKEA store . A jealous ferry worker tried to frame his ex-wife's new partner by claiming he was plotting to blow up IKEA, a court has heard. Ayman Ibrahim, who works for P&O ferries, phoned up the IKEA national call centre. He said he ran a cafe in Bristol and had overheard Russians hatching a bomb plot for the days following New Year's Eve, 2011. Police swooped on the Bristol store and two addresses in the city, but no bomb or bomb-making factory was discovered, Gloucester Crown Court heard yesterday. The court was told Ibrahim made the hoax call in an attempt to deport ex-wife Maria Wierzbicka 's new partner, Bartosz Ociepka. Ibrahim, 46, who now lives in Dover, denies communicating false information with intent on December 30, 2011. Karen Chamberlain, an IKEA team leader, told the jury a call was put through to her from a middle-aged sounding man with a calm but heavy Eastern European accent. She told the court: 'He said that he knew that there was a bomb to be put into a Bristol store. 'He said he had a coffee shop and he overheard people speaking in Russian. He said he couldn't understand it but his wife did. 'They were plotting to put a bomb in the IKEA store in the next couple of days in Bristol. 'I asked him if he knew where or how it would be set off but he said ""no"". He said he felt he had to warn us.' Mrs Chamberlain told how the caller referred to IKEA stores being bombed in Belgium and Germany by a large group. She told the jury: 'He gave a person's name and he gave their address and postcode. He didn't give me his own name, he said he had a wife and family and it was for his safety. 'At one point he did say ""Mark"".' Ibrahim attempted to frame Bartosz Ociepka, pictured here with Ibrahim's ex-wife Maria Wierzbicka . The court heard how the caller spelled out the name of the 'bomber' and said he had a lot of contacts as he was a pizza delivery driver. Holly Webb, defending, suggested to Mrs Chamberlain that when she took the call she misheard 'storm' and noted down 'bomb', which the witness denied. Ms Wierzbicka told how they split in 2008 but Ibrahim had court arranged contact with their daughter. Ms Wierzbicka said she formed a new relationship with Mr Ociepka, but they broke up in the summer of 2011. She told the jury: 'He (Ibrahim) was very negative towards Mr Ociepka. He said he would get him deported.' Mr Ociepka, speaking via a Polish interpreter, said he was baffled when police arrested him in connection with a bomb plot. He said: 'I concluded it was a mistake and maybe I was not the right person. The police were looking for a Polish man and in the street where I live there are plenty of Polish guys. Ibrahim referred to IKEA stores being bombed in other European countries. In 2011 there were attacks in Belgium, France, the Czech republic, Netherlands and Germany. The bombings were timed over five months. While no one was killed in the attacks, two people were injured in Germany. Booby-trapped alarm clocks blew up at IKEA stores in Belgium, France and the Netherlands on 30 May. A blast in the kitchen equipment department of a store in Dresden, Germany, left two customers needing hospital treatment on 10 June. Police evacuated two stores in the Czech Republic, defusing a booby-trapped device found near one of them on 2 September. Suspects were thought to have been attempting to extort 6million euros from the chain of homeware stores. Polish Police arrested and charged two suspects later that year. 'I thought the police had knocked on the wrong door.' When police asked him who might have implicated him in a bomb plot, he originally didn't have a clue. He said: 'I just thought he (Ibrahim) was the only person who might have some grudge against me.' Ms Webb, defending, suggested that on December 16, 2011, Mr Ociepka was in a Tesco superstore cafe in Bristol with some Russian men. He said he had not been there, and he only spoke three or four words of Russian having nothing more to do with the language after primary school. Though police searched IKEA for a bomb or bomb making equipment, they found nothing, the court heard. Police searches of Mr Ociepka's home in Hayward Road, Barton Hill, and Ms Wierzbicka's home in Whitwell Road, Bristol, also drew a blank. Analysis of Ibrahim's mobile phone showed he came to Bristol leading up to the threat, but his female friend's phone showed she remained in Kent. Ibrahim told the jury he travelled from Dover to Bristol to buy a car and arranged, through Miss Wierzbicka, to take his daughter to school. He said that, in Bristol, he met a Latvian couple hitchhiking and agreed to take them to a cafe at Tesco before giving them a lift back to Dover. It was at the Tesco cafe, he said, that he spotted the couple sat near two men chatting with Mr Ociepka. Ibrahim said the Latvian couple told him about the cafe conversation as he drove them to Dover later. He told the jury: 'They said the two guys sitting with Mr Ociepka were absolutely mad. An aerial shot of the IKEA store in Bristol where Ibrahim claimed there was a plot to plant a bomb . 'They were talking about storming IKEA. 'The girl said there was nothing funny about it, it had happened in Europe. 'I took no notice. I got back to Dover and I tried to get some information to decide whether to report it or just let it go.' Ibrahim clutched a batch of photocopies in the witness box, containing news reports of bombings at IKEAs in Europe. He said he took advice from a friend before reporting what he had been told was planned for IKEA in Bristol, some to weeks later. He said: 'They were storming the place. It was my duty to report it. It is a duty of any citizen. It is not a crime. 'They were going to storm IKEA in Bristol during the January sales.' Ibrahim said he posed as a Bristol cafe owner to make his tip-off seem more credible, and he didn't give his name to protect his family. The P&O Ferries security man said he used his own mobile phone because he had nothing to hide. He admitted identifying Mr Ociepka to police, and showed the jury a picture of a suspect related to an attack on IKEA which he thought resembled Mr Ociepka. The case continues.

"British athletes travelling to Russia for the Winter Olympics have been advised not to wear their official team kit with the GB logo on arrival because of fears of terror attacks. Officials from the British Olympic Association warned the 56 athletes and 64 other members of Team GB to keep a low profile while in the country for the showpiece Games in Sochi, particularly while travelling through the capital city Moscow. The British team has not received a specific threat of attack in the Black Sea resort but described the advice as a 'common sense approach' which comes just days after UK intelligence warned that more deadly terrorist attacks in Russia are 'very likely' before or during the Winter Olympics. Under threat: British athletes travelling to Russia for the Winter Olympics have been advised not to wear their official team kit while in public places for fear of terror attacks . In a stark assessment, they say that . despite the biggest ever security operation surrounding a Winter Games, . more terror attacks such as the twin bombings that killed 34 people in . the city of Volgograd last month can be expected, probably on the orders . of a terror leader dubbed 'Russia's Bin Laden.' The . Caucasus militant Islamist group, Imarat Kavkaz (IK) that claimed those . attacks are identified as the main threat having called on supporters . to strike against the Sochi Games where nearly 40,000 extra troops have . been drafted-in on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Islamist . fighters who have been taking part alongside jihadi groups fighting . government forces in Syria are also identified as posing a potential . security threat. The United . States has given similar advice to its athletes and officials not to . wear official kit while travelling or away from the Olympic sites amid . fears that they and allies like Britain, who have taken part in major . military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, could be prime targets. Russian President Vladimir Putin has drafted in 40,000 extra troops to deal with the terrorist threat . An Islamic jihadist group in Dagestan posted a video purporting to show the suicide bombers before the Volgograd attacks. The men were identified only as Suleiman and Abdurakhman . Team GB stressed: 'The safety and well being of the Team GB delegation competing in Sochi remains our number one priority. A Russian businessmen says he was told 'you will be drowned in blood' after publicly claiming officials working for Vladimir Putin demanded payoffs in exchange for Olympic construction contracts. Valery Morozov has fled to Britain fearing for his life in the wake of his allegations of corruption surrounding the Sochi Games. Although he says he has no regrets over coming forward, Morozov says he thinks there will be an attempt on his life after the Olympic Games come to an end in late February. Speaking to ABC News, Morosov said he made regular cash deliveries of 'tens of millions of rubles' for Sochi construction projects. Morosov, who is now working with Russian prosecutors, said some of the payments to deputy chief of capital construction Vladimir Leschevsky were recorded on undercover video tape. He claims to have been told the money would be shared with other officials by Leschevsky, who told him: 'I am to bring it upstairs.' The revelations come amid multiple accusations of corruption surrounding the Sochi Games. 'While . we have not received any information or advice suggesting an increase . in the threat level, we are taking a common sense approach in . recommending that team members wear less overtly branded Team GB kit . during their journey to Sochi.' More . than 2,000 British winter sports fans are said to have booked to be in . the Black Sea resort to support the GB team during the event which Mr . Putin hopes will showcase his Russia. Scotland . Yard detectives as well as British intelligence officials have been . with the British team to advise on security matters and the United . States, which is among the nations to already have emergency evacuation . plans in place for its athletes, is also helping with information on . possible threats. The fear is that with the eyes of the world on Sochi, there will be terror attacks elsewhere in Russia such as at Volograd. The . security assessment points out that in July 2013 the IK's fugitive . leader, Emir Doku Umarov, called on his followers to do what they can to . disrupt the Games. A . veteran of the wars with Russia in Chechnya, the 49 year-old self-styled . 'Emir of the Caucasus' has survived many attempts to killed him and is . now said to be directing IK's operations. The . Dagestan-based group is said to be linked to Al Qaeda and to have four . so-called 'black widows', whose husbands have been killed by Russian . security officials, targeting the Games which run from February 7-23. Russia's counterterrorism agency identified the two suicide bombers who struck the southern city of Volgograd and announced the arrest of two suspected accomplices . An ambulance leaves the site of an explosion after a bomb blast tore through a trolleybus in December . The Russian authorities have also been hunting a suspected would-be suicide bomber named as Ruzanna Ibragimova, the 22-year old widow of a militant, who it is feared could already be in Sochi and hiding in a safe house. Her photograph . has been widely circulated around Sochi where a 'ring of steel' has been . imposed at Olympic venues, largely closing them off from public access. IK . is also linked to Ansar al-Sunna, raising fears that veteran fighters . from Iraq and now taking part in Syria may be in Russia planning a . 'spectacular' attack. Terrorism . fears around the Olympics flared after an Islamist group from the north . Caucasus threatened to attack hosts and visitors in an online video. The Caucasus militant Islamist group Imarat Kavkaz has been identified as the main threat to the Sochi Games. The group is led by Doku Umarov, who has been referred to as 'Russia's Bin Laden' Members of Russia's special forces stand guard during an operation on suspected militants in Makhachkala, the capital of Russia's North Caucasus Republic of Dagestan .

"Russia's ancient order of soldiers, the Cossacks, have been drafted in to help with security in the Winter Olympics in Sochi, only a week before they begin. Hundreds of the soldiers, wearing their traditional jackets and fur hats, are now marching the streets of Sochi as the games approach. The arrival of the soldiers has coincided with a recent warning by British anti-terror chiefs that a large scale terror attack on the 2014 Winter Olympics is 'very likely to occur'. VIDEO Scroll down for video . A Russian Cossack (left) stands guard outside a train station as people pass by in the Adler district of Sochi . A Russian Cossack (right) and a police officer (left) stand guard outside a train station as a dog passes by. Sochi will host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in just over a week . Around 1,000 Cossacks have been stationed at Sochi to beef up the security, which has been at risk due to recent threats by suspected terrorists . The Russian soldiers' ancestry dates back thousands of years, with their most well known trait in western culture being their gravity-defying dance. In their home country, they are more synonymous with rebellion and strong military force, with this reputation being enhanced by the literature of Russian novelists Leo Tolstoy and Alexander Pushkin. However, their military might may be used in action against the threat assessment made by Whitehall officials that a Caucasus group, Imarat Kavkaz (IK) are likely to carry out an attack after months of continued threats against the games. Russian Cossacks Vitaly Timoshenko (right), 19, and Vyacheslav Timoshenko (left), 13, juggle swords in the town of Krasny Oktyabr, on the outskirts of the southern Russian city of Volgograd . The assessment points out that in July 2013, the leader of the group, Emir Doku Umarov, called on his followers to do what they can to disrupt the games. However, the report questioned the groups ability to schedule and carry out an attack with such a short time until the games. This warning came after both a twin bomb attacks on the city of Volgograd in December that killed 34 people, and the hunt for a suspected suicide bomber, Ruzanna Ibragimova, who is thought to be part of a larger terrorist group of female suicide bombers called the 'black widows', named because they are the widows of militants. In addition to the Cossack's installation, British intelligence says that 37,000 soldiers and police have been drafted in to boost security in Sochi, and that they are forming a 'ring of steel' perimeter around the event, making it a much harder target for attacks. The warning by British Intelligence came after the bombing of Volgograd, which killed 34 people last year . A photo of a police leaflet seen in a Sochi hotel on Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2014, shows Ruzanna Ibragimova, one of the 'black widow' terrorism group, and states that she is at large in the city of Sochi . Governor Aleksandr Tkachev of Russia's Krasnodar region, where Sochi is located said to local police: 'What you cannot do, a Cossack can.' These comments caused outcry from natives of Sochi, as well as minorities and migrants, with analysts saying it is no coincidence that nationalism and xenophobia are on the rise at the same time the Cossacks are being revived. The new role of the Cossack as hired enforcers may 'naturally translate into conflicts between the indigenous population of the Northern Caucasus and the Cossacks' according to Valeriy Dzutsev, an analyst with the Jamestown Foundation, writing in the Central Asial-Caucasus Institute Analyst.

"When Louis van Gaal was dissecting his Manchester United managerial debut on August 16, he insinuated the 2-1 defeat against Swansea City  was just a symptom of teething problems. 'We have to remember that it is just one game of many games and you shall not be champion in this moment but in May,' he added, having just been baptised a Barclays Premier League manager. That opening day defeat reeked of same old, same old from the season before yet, with the reverse fixture  at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday, Van Gaal can no longer turn to the same excuse. A poll by the Manchester Evening News found  81 per cent of Manchester United fans back Louis van Gaal . Robin van Persie (left) completes a sprint drill as United captain Wayne Rooney watches on .

Jones, Smalling, Blackett; . Lingard, Fletcher, Herrera, Young . Mata . Hernandez, Rooney . Expectations have dwindled at Old Trafford. Going into that game against Swansea in mid-August, supporters wanted proof  they were ready to challenge their noisy neighbours for the Premier League title. Instead they realised a slick public relations campaign and the appointment of an iconic manager don't make for a quick fix. More than six months on, they're third – 12 points behind Chelsea and five off Manchester City –and their lack of progress in a title challenge has made Champions League qualification a must. Most supporters are content with that, and why not? The horror show of the year before under David Moyes saw United lose their place among Europe's elite and if Van Gaal can right that wrong, then that's a significant improvement. Manchester United manager Van Gaal holds a press conference after his style of play was criticised . Van Gaal has been no stranger to press room drama at any of his previous clubs before United . Robin van Persie has been partnered with Radamel Falcao but the duo have not clicked at United . Rooney (left) controls the ball under pressure from Burnley's Scott Arfield in their last Premier League win . This was backed by a poll in the Manchester Evening News which found 81 per cent of supporters approved of Van Gaal's first season in charge, 12 weeks ahead of the May finish. When put to the manager, he said, tongue in cheek: 'Over 80 per cent? Unbelievable. In spite of your [the media’s] criticism, fantastic. Thank you. I can repeat it, more than 80 per cent.' Fail to qualify for the Champions League, however, and watch that number spiral. United have lost just four games in the Premier League this season, and are on a run of one defeat in 19 games. Yet their results, without a doubt, have been better than the performances. Take, for example, their latest Premier League win. A 3-1 victory against second-bottom Burnley on February 11 was expected, but flattering to say the least. As was their 2-1 win over Arsenal on November 22 and their 2-1 win over Southampton on December 8, among others. Offer supporters one defeat in 19 games, a place in the FA Cup quarter-finals and  third in the Premier League before that Swansea opener, however, and  most would snap your hands off. The ends are justifying the means, yet  there has not been a game this year where rival supporters, namely those at the Etihad, sit back and think: 'Uh oh, they're back.' Even Paul Scholes reckons it's been miserable. Supporters pay good money to be entertained, to watch attacking, creative, free-flowing football, not to be on edge. As the reverse Swansea fixture arrives, this has been in short supply. Even with the £153million influx of Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Angel Di Maria, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, and, for one season, Radamel Falcao. In trying to establish United as the monster they once were under Sir Alex Ferguson, questions have been thrown Van Gaal's way, just as they were when he was manager of Barcelona between 1997 and 2000. His three-year reign in Spain was filled with skepticism about his tactics, decisions and philosophy. At the Nou Camp he dropped Rivaldo – a Brazilian genius and 1999 Ballon d'Or winner – and was hounded about it  by the Barcelona media. A friction that ultimately led him to the exit. Former United midfielder Paul Scholes has branded Van Gaal's style of play as 'miserable' It hasn't been all too different in Manchester. The questions keep arriving. Why, for example, waste Wayne Rooney in midfield? Are you finished with the partnership of Robin van Persie and Falcao? What's happened to Herrera – your first purchase at £29m? Why persist with the 3-5-2 formation? Is your relentless side-to-side football limiting Di Maria's influence? And so on. Yet there appears method in Van Gaal's madness. Their extraordinary run of having only lost against Southampton since November 3 is no fluke. Luck does not carry a team that far, and it will worry  Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Southampton and Liverpool to see a side playing average but winning. On Saturday, in Swansea, Van Gaal can exact revenge for that August 16 defeat. 'We shouldn't forget a lot of my players in the first match were not there. Marcos Rojo wasn't there, Daley Blind was not there, Angel Di Maria was not there, Luke Shaw was not playing,' he says in mitigation. 'It's another match.' That it is. It may not be to keep them in the running for the Premier League title with Chelsea and Manchester City, but Van Gaal can ill afford to miss out on Champions League qualification. Progress under their new manager is being made but time waits for no man, not even him. Juan Mata rues a missed chance for United as the Spaniard helps them qualify for the Champions League .

"Jose Mourinho struggled to adapt to the pressure that came with being manager of Real Madrid, according to the club's former president Ramon Calderon. Mourinho spent three years at the Santiago Bernabeu, from 2010-13, but despite winning La Liga and the Copa del Rey, he was a nearly-man in the Champions League with Spanish side, getting knocked out at the semi-final in every season at the club. And Calderon believes that even Mourinho, who is renowned for turning up the heat on his rivals, could not cope with the pressure that was heaped upon his shoulders while at the helm of Madrid. Ramon Calderon believes that Jose Mourinho struggled to deal with pressure at Real Madrid . Ramon Calderon was president of Madrid for three years, from 2006-09 . Jose Mourinho (top) is thrown into the air by his Madrid players after winning La Liga in 2012 . 'To be a manager of Real Madrid is really, really difficult,' Calderon said to BBC World Service. 'See what happened to Mourinho. 'He is someone who is used to coping with pressure and he couldn't.' In his second season at Madrid, Mourinho's side surged to the Spanish league title with a record of 100 points. But at the end of his third year, a mutual agreement between Mourinho and the club was reached for a parting of the ways, and former Chelsea boss Carlo Ancelotti took over while Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge. 'When Mourinho left, things were in a really bad situation,' Calderon said. 'He had to leave the club after three years of a lot of problems, a lot of confrontations.' Madrid's players celebrate with current manager Carlo Ancelotti after winning the Champions League in 2014 . Ancelotti has since led Madrid to their tenth Champions League title, as well as masterminding his team to an astonishing run of 22 straight wins earlier this season. And Calderon, who was president at the Bernabeu from 2006-09, praised Ancelotti's achievements with the club. 'I think he has done a very good job, not only because he won the Champions League but because things are calm, relaxed and everything is smooth,' Calderon explained.","Ramon Calderon believes that Jose Mourinho struggled at Real Madrid .

"Top security experts have warned travelers that a terrorist attack at the Sochi Winter Olympics is 'very likely'. The Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said that the U.S. has deployed two American warships to stand guard in the Black Sea during the Games, which start next weekend, in case they are needed to help evacuate Americans. The threat of a terrorist attack is being viewed as a very real possibility as Russian security forces are hunting a woman suspected of planning a suicide bombing- and she is thought to be in Sochi already. High alert: Russian Cossacks stand guard near the Rosa Khutor Alpine Resort in Krasnaya Polyana near Sochi. British intelligence chiefs say the 37,000 extra soldiers and police that have been drafted in to boost security have formed a 'ring of steel' around the event . 'Soft targets': While extra guards in the Olympic village will make it difficult for terrorists to enter, the more open public locations like the Sochi airport (pictured) will be more difficult to control . Still, it is far from clear that Russia would allow U.S. military assets into its territory following a security incident, and Moscow has made no request for U.S. security assistance so far. The focus of the Sochi Winter Games and Paralympic Games will inevitably be on the 230 athletes who will be competing, but they represent just a fraction of the Americans who will be in Russia. There are expected to be 270 coaches and support staff who will accompany the athletes, and a far bigger number of fans in the crowds. Up to 10,000 spectators are expected to fill the bleachers, putting the best estimate for Americans in Sochi somewhere around 10,600. Asked about the matter at a Pentagon news conference, Hagel said only that proper arrangements would be in place, without saying specifically who might do the evacuating. 'If we need to extract our citizens, we will have appropriate arrangements with the Russians to do this,' Hagel said on Friday. The State Department also issued a travel alert for Americans planning on attending the Games, but it extends throughout the Russian Federation and not simply to Sochi. 'Large-scale public events such as the . Olympics present an attractive target for terrorists, and the U.S. government continues to monitor reported threats of potential terrorist . attacks in Sochi or in Russia in general,' the alert reads. Americans . who decide to travel to Russia between the start of the Games between . February 7 and March 16 'should remain attentive regarding their . personal security at all times'. Wanted: Ruzan Ibragimov, whose husband was an Islamist militant killed by Russian security forces last year, is one of the 'black widow' terrorists who may be in Sochi plotting an attack . British intelligence have said that some reassurance can come from the reports that an extra 37,000 soldiers and police officers that have been called in to Sochi in order to boost security have formed a 'ring of steel' around the event, making it a much harder target. Many American commentators- from former CIA deputy director Michael Morell to former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney- have expressed caution but said that they would still go and bring their families. Mr Morell, the former CIA deputy director, agreed and urged Americans to take care- particularly when they leave the Olympic village. 'I think the venue itself is fairly safe. I'd worry about airports elsewhere in Russia, I'd worry about Western hotels elsewhere in Russia,' he said on CBS This Morning. Back up plan: Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel said Friday that the US will have a contingency plan to get the Americans out should an attack occur . Russian president Vladimir Putin, seen in this file photo, told ABC that Russia will do 'whatever it takes' to make the Sochi Games secure. An expected 80,000 troops are to be on guard . 'I think these are the most dangerous Olympics that I've experienced in my adult life... because you have a capable, dedicated, determined terrorist group that has been around for a long time that recently conducted two attacks in Russia that say that they want to attack during the Games. 'I would go. I would take my family. I would be very careful. I would be very aware of my surroundings.' Mr Romney, who organized the Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2002, told The Today Show last week that the fact that the Russian organizers have released the names and photos of suspected terrorists who may be plotting an attack shows that they have an 'extraordinary intelligence' program. ‘There's never been a Games that I know of that has been so targeted for specific threats as you're seeing at Sochi. At the same time, the level of security preparations appears to be at an unprecedented level,’ Mr Romney said. ‘I believe the Games will be safe. That doesn’t mean there’s a 100 per cent guarantee anywhere in the world today. But this is, after all, a dangerous corner of the world. A twin bomb attack on the city of Volgograd in December killed 34 people before a militant Islamist group- based in Dagestan- claimed responsibility.

Mayweather is understood to have been the dominant figure throughout negotiations for the  mega-fight . The American has hit back at Pacquiao by claiming the Filipino has never fought anyone of his standard during his illustrious 64-fight career. 'I think he's a very exciting fighter,' Mayweather told Fight Hype's Ben Thompson. 'I think he's also strong, but I think that this is a different league. 'I mean, this is a guy (Mayweather) that can box going forward, this is a guy that can box going backwards, a guy that can counterpunch, I can tie you up, I can slug if I have to, but my thing is always working smarter, not harder.' Pacquiao produced an impressive display to beat Chris Algieri by unanimous decision in his last fight in November but Mayweather took a swipe at the Pac-man's opponent, claiming he isn't even a proper boxer. Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November . Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in the pair's rematch last September in Las Vegas . 'He must know that he's not in there with, um, I don't know the guy's name, Algieri, the guy he just faced. That's a kickboxer he was fighting, the last guy, from what I was told. He's fighting a legitimate welterweight.' Mayweather will enter the ring with Pacquiao in May having never lost a professional bout and the Money-man insists this gives him a psychological edge over his opponent, who has been beaten five times. 'The only thing I know is to win, so is losing in the back of his mind? Absolutely! Why? Because he probably lost 3 or 5 times before, so losing is in his mind. Losing is not in my mind because the only thing I know how to do is win.'","Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao will fight in Las Vegas on May 2 .

"Manchester City's new £28million striker Wilfried Bony is set to make his debut for the champions against Newcastle United during the Premier League clash at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. The former Swansea hitman returned from the Africa Cup of Nations a winner after helping Ivory Coast win the tournament in Equatorial Guinea courtesy of a penalty shoot-out against Ghana almost two weeks ago. No player scored more Premier League goals than Bony during 2014 after he netted 20 times for Garry Monk's side and Manuel Pellegrini has hinted he is ready to throw him straight into the action - but how will the 26-year-old fit into the City side? Wlfried Bony is set to make his Manchester City debut against Newcastle in the Premier League on Saturday . Manuel Pellegrini described new signing Bony as the perfect signing for Manchester City . Bony's inclusion from the start would mean a change in both personnel and system to the Manchester City side that beat Stoke 4-1 at the Britannia in their last Premier League outing. Pellegrini set his team up in a 4-4-1-1 formation with Sergio Aguero operating as a loan striker and playmaker David Silva taking up his preferred position just off the front man. Brazilian duo Fernando and Fernandinho added steel and energy in the middle of midfield, while Samir Nasri and James Milner provided the width for the visitors. Should Bony come into the side it would almost certainly be to play alongside Aguero after the Argentina international returned to form with a brace against Mark Hughes' side last week. ‘I think he has all the conditions to be an important player because we try always to play with two strikers,' Pellegrini said of Bony at a press conference on Friday. 'He is the perfect player for our squad. How Man City lined up against Stoke (left) and how Bony could fit into the side against Newcastle (right) Bony returned from international duty with Ivory Coast after helping them win the Africa Cup of Nations . 'He knows the Premier League, he knows our team so I think it will be easy for him to settle in in a good way.' If Pellegrini, who is certain to have one eye on Tuesday's Champions League clash with Barcelona too, is to accommodate Bony from the start against Newcastle, the Chilean manager will increase City's goal threat but ultimately weaken the defensive solidity of his side by switching to a 4-4-2. In Aguero and Bony, however, Pellegrini has at his disposal the most potent attacking duo in the Premier League and it is hard to see past the pair forming the basis of City's strike force for the remainder of the campaign. There is also the small matter of shoehorning Bony's compatriot Yaya Toure back into the side. In a flat midfield four the 31-year-old will be tasked with performing a deeper role alongside either Fernando or Fernandinho. The former Swansea striker scored nine goals for the Welsh club in the first half of the season . Toure has been at his most explosive best for City when he has played a more advanced and, before departing for Equatorial Guinea, he had netted six Premier League goals in his last eight games. The midfielder is capable of performing a more defensive role, as he did at Barcelona and during the recent Africa Cup of Nations, though it wouldn't be unfair to describe Toure's performance in the tournament as underwhelming at best. James Milner, who was superb in the victory against Stoke, will miss the game against John Carver's side  on Saturday and is also a doubt for Tuesday's Barcelona clash with Nasri and Silva likely to play as inverted wide men on Saturday. To get the best out of Bony Manchester City will have to provide the striker with service from the wide areas meaning the full backs will be tasked with offering a threat down the flanks. James Milner (left) has been ruled out of Saturday's Premier League clash with a knee injury . How Manuel Pellegrini could set up his side against Barcelona in the Champions League . With the Barcelona match on the horizon Pellegrini has the option of resting first choice full back pairing of Pablo Zabaleta and Gael Clichy against Newcastle and could bring Bacary Sagna and Aleksandar Kolorov into the side to face Newcastle. For the first leg against Luis Enrique's side Pellegrini is unlikely to retain the 4-4-2 formation and could revert to the more defensively-minded 4-4-1-1 with Bony dropping out of the side. Pellegrini could recall the pairing of Fernandinho and Fernando in the middle of midfield to combat the possession-based game of the La Liga side, and the 61-year-old will be desperate for Milner to shake off his knee complaint in time to play. Should the England international fail to recover Jesus Navas' pace could be used as a weapon to hit Barcelona on the counter-attack, while Toure will miss the game through suspension meaning Silva should return to the number 10 role.","Manchester City welcome Newcastle to the Etihad Stadium on Saturday .

"David Cameron today announced he had . secured agreement with Britain's network of overseas territories and . Crown dependencies to sign up to a new clampdown on tax evasion. The Prime Minister has been holding . high level talks in Downing Street ahead of next week's G8 Summit at . Lough Erne, Northern Ireland where tax evasion is one of the leading . topics for discussion. Getting agreement from Britain’s . overseas territories, among them Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, . the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, the Channel islands and the Isle of Man . is seen as a crucial step in the forthcoming negotiations. Tax haven: crown dependency Bermuda claimed it complied with international tax law already so did not need to sign the EU-US backed register . Britain’s overseas territories make up one fifth of all the tax havens - and are among the largest and most sophisticated - in the world. Until today Bermuda was refusing to sign up to the register backed by Britain, the European Union, United States and Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Bermuda had claimed it already met . many of the provisions Mr Cameron wants the tax havens to sign up to and . was not ready to commit to signing the convention. Premier . Mr Cannonier told Reuters: ‘There's some clauses in there that we need . to look at, that may need to be adjusted, and ... our finance ministry . is going over it with a fine-tooth comb.’ Even after the announcement several overseas territories said the still have misgivings about whether an international register of companies and their beneficial owners will work. The Prime Minister hailed the agreement as a ‘very positive step forward’ which would strengthen his hand in talks with the other G8 leaders. He is hoping to reach agreement from the leaders of all the G8 nations to a series of actions aimed at promoting transparency and exchange of information between tax jurisdictions. Done deal: the Prime Minister moved a step closer to securing a deal on tax evasion after securing the agreement of Britain's overseas territories to sign up to a new international register . 'Let's be clear why this tax issue matters. If companies don't pay their taxes or individuals don't pay their taxes we all suffer as a result,' Mr Cameron said. 'It is important we are getting our house in order. What the Crown dependencies - places like Jersey and the Isle of Man, and the overseas territories - places like the Cayman Islands - have signed up to is basically the existing and the new standards for exchanging tax information. That is absolutely vital. ‘'It is a very positive step forward and it means that Britain's voice in the G8 and the campaigning on this issue around the world for proper taxes, proper companies and proper laws ... will be stronger.' Despite the agreement, Mr Cameron still has to win over a key opponent in the Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who is not convinced by the proposals being put forward by Britain, the European Union and the US. Russia President Vladimir Putin could also prove to be a roadblock to the reforms. International aid organisations have also been quick raise concerns about the British proposals which they say amount to a plan A and a plan B. Yesterday they delivered a letter to Mr Cameron and the other G8 leaders with 189 signatories warning the plan B proposal would effectively lock out developing nations from the register and deny them access to crucial information they need to collect tax efficiently. Under the original plan all countries would have been able to access the register but the under the watered down proposal only internationally recognised tax authorities, such as HMRC would be able to access the register. The letter warns this would mean: ‘excluding developing countries that wish to join such an international system either directly or de facto through an unfeasible burden of reciprocation of information – would in many cases freeze out those…worst hit by tax avoidance and evasion.’ A spokesman for the charity Action Aid, one of the signatories to the letter, said the plan B option would amount to betrayal of the world’s poorest countries preventing them from collecting ‘desperately needed tax revenues that could be used to fund schools and hospitals.’","Bermuda now agrees to sign up to international register of companies .

Low down: Everton have joined Arsenal and Liverpool in the hunt for Sevilla defender Federico Fazio . He has been out with an ankle injury this season but has returned and impressed with both his ability on the ball and uncompromising defence. He was even caught on camera giving Chelsea and Manchester United target Diego Costa a dig in the stomach after the Atletico Madrid striker shoved him in the face. Sevilla will look to sell for his release clause figure of £7.8million. Leeds back in for Butland . Leeds have revived interest in Stoke goalkeeper Jack Butland after negotiations over a deal for Heurelho Gomes grew complicated. Tottenham are understood to have wanted various bonuses should Leeds be promoted and were looking at a potential £1million for a permanent summer deal.

"Just six months ago, this little fellow was found hungry, destitute and unable to see. Basil the blind dog was picked up by rescuers who noticed he could not walk five yards without bumping into something. Now, thanks to an innovative new gadget from America, Basil has been given a new lease of life – and his carers hope they will now be able to find a family to permanently house him. Scroll down for video . Basil, a four-year-old Collie cross, was found abandoned and blind six months ago but is now able to walk around again thanks to a 'halo' he wears around his head . The thin metal loop is worn around his head attached to a cushion that puts pressure on his shoulders when it hits something, signalling for him to stop before hitting something . Basil is the first dog in the UK to use the device after a US distributor learned of his plight and sent one over . The four-year-old Corgi cross has been given a special guard to wear around his head, which manufacturers call the ‘Muffin’s Halo’. The light-weight tubular metal ring stops Basil from bumping into objects, allowing him to run around freely without bruising himself. It is attached to his body with a harness and a pillow, which is fashioned to look like angel wings. The ‘halo’ is designed to be slightly longer and wider than the wearer and when it touches an object, it puts pressure on Basil's shoulders, teaching him to turn away. His foster family say he is the first dog in the UK to pioneer the device, after a UK distributor learned of his plight and sent it over as a free gift. Prison officer Helena Webster, 25, who has been looking after him, said: ‘When we first took Basil in, he was running into things all the time. 'He kept bruising his face and shoulders because he just couldn’t see what he was doing. ‘Now he wears the halo, he’s a lot more confident. He can play outside just like other dogs which is great. Workers at West Yorkshire Dog Rescue hope that with his new headgear, a family will come forward to adopt Basil, who was found wandering the streets of Leeds . When resue workers first found Basil, he was unable to run a few feet without bumping into something and bruising his head and face. Now his halo tells him when he is about to hit something . Vets still cannot say how Basil became blind, but think his owners abandoned him because of the condition . ‘He’s . a really happy, lovable dog. He loves being cuddled and playing . football. He’s got a great personality and he’s really become part of . the family. ‘I’ll be sad to see him go but we hope he’ll find a new loving home so that we can help another dog in a similar situation.’ Basil was fostered by Helena and her parents, Yvonne, 53, and Dale, 54, who run a civil engineering firm. They have a five acre garden and six other dogs – ranging from a Yorkshire Terrier to a Great Dane. The family, from Spalding in Lincolnshire, agreed to take him in after rescuers found him wondering the streets of Leeds. It is not known how he came to be blind, but it is thought he may have been abandoned by his owner because of his disability. West Yorkshire Dog Rescue are currently trying to find him a new, permanent home and say his novel headgear will help him in his new life. The Muffin’s Halo was donated by . Devon-based online company The Pet Business, which acts as a UK . distributor for the product and has since sold many more. Kathy Trout, founder of West Yorkshire Dog Rescue, said: ‘We’ve never seen anything like it. It’s revolutionary. Basil was taken in by prison officer Helena Webster and her parents, but they are now trying to find him a new home as they already have six other dogs . The Halo is officially called Muffin's Halo. It was created in 2012 after LA publicist Silvie Bordeaux's poodle, Muffin, began to lose his sight . The guard comes in different novelty styles including butterfly wings, angel wings and quarterback shoulder pads costs between £40 to £75 . ‘The Muffin’s Halo has turned around Basil’s life. He used to live in a world of darkness, but now he’s much more aware of his surroundings. ‘We want dog owners around the UK to know that this aid exists, because it could help so many more blind dogs.’ The Muffin’s Halo was created by Los Angeles publicist Silvie Bordeaux in 2012 after her beloved 12-year-old toy poodle, Muffin, began to lose his sight. The guard comes in different novelty styles including butterfly, angel wings and quarterback and prices online range between £40 to £75.

"Kim Jong-Un is planning one of his 'purges' to rid North Korea of one of the country's most powerful figures, after the country's records reveal that they, not the son of Kim Jong-Il, might be the rightful heir to the communist state. 200 figures in Pyongyang are supposedly expected to be in the sights of the current leader of North Korea, because of their loyalty to his uncle, Jang Song-taek, who was executed late last year. But Choe Ryong-Hae, currently joint chairman of the powerful Politburo Presidium and political director of the North Korea People's Army has been singled out because of the new evidence which could threaten his leadership. Kim Jong-Un is again planning a purge of political enemies, with 200 of Pyongyang's most powerful on the list, as well as one man who might be a contender to his leadership in the eyes of history . New evidence from the 1930s show that it might have been the father of Kim Jong-Un's uncle who led the attack against the Japanese, and that this attack was later claimed by Kim's grandfather so they could be the ruling family. The attack was a turning point for North Korea, and helped them to claim a part of the Korean peninsula back from Japanese occupation. Grandfather of Kim Jong-Un, Kim Il-Sung, is documented in North Korea's official history as the leader of the 1937 attack on the Japanese base defending the town of Ponchonbo, which helped him gain a foothold of legitimacy in the claim of leadership of the country. These reports that North Korea is looking to change it's history again are not the first incidence of such an occurrence. North Korea regularly changes its own country's history, with children . in the North being taught that the Korean War was started in 1950 by an . invasion by the South, and that Kim Jong-il was born in a cabin on the . slopes of Mount Paektu, when historians claim that the late leader was . actually born in a refugee camp in the Soviet Union. Pictured with Kim Jong-Un (right) is the person said to be in his target sights, Choe Ryong-Hae, the son of Choe Hyon, who is thought to the the rightful leader of a battle that helped establish the leadership of North Korea . It was Kim Il-Sung (statue left), Kim Jong-Un's grandfather who is claimed by North Korean national media to have been the leader of a famous 1937 attack on the Japanese . Now, new reports indicate that it was Choe's father, Choe Hyon, who actually led the attack. A report in the Asahi Shimbun dated June 7, 1937 said: 'A little more than 100 men lead by Communist bandit Choe Hyon attacked Pochonbo. 'One group attacked the local police station, while another group set fire to the whole village and plundered at will.' A second report said: 'They attacked and plundered private houses so Pochonbo village has been completely destroyed.' Kim Jong-Un's other purge targets are said to be supporters of his uncle, Jang Song-taek, who was executed late last year . Ken Kato, a researcher and human rights activist, says the stories are evidence that the self-styled revolutionaries were bandits in the attack that killed two people, a Japanese businessman and a two-year-old infant. Mr Kato told The Telegraph: 'They set fire to schools and plundered from fellow Koreans, and it is fair to say they were robbers who were stealing from their own people. 'Kim Il-sung's legitimacy came from propaganda that he fought against Japan, symbolised by the Battle of Pochonbo . The legacy and history of the Kim family has been the reason why they are able to cling to the leadership of the totalitarian country, which is why they are targeting any people who could potentially threaten that . 'The Pochonbo battle made the august name of the president serve as a beacon for the national resurrection for all the Korean people and the trust and reverence of the whole Korean nation for the president grew more profound.' The claim that Kim Il-Sung led the battle is reinforced by the KCNA news agency, an arm of the North Korean state media, calling Kim Il-Sung 'the legendary hero of the anti-Japanese war'","North Korea says the famous 1937 battle that helped found the country was led by Kim Jong-Un's grandfather Kim Il-Sung .

"A serving policeman and a 49-year-old woman have been arrested in connection with the Andrew Mitchell 'Plebgate' affair following fresh information . A diplomatic protection group police officer has been arrested in connection with the Andrew Mitchell 'Plebgate' affair following fresh information, Scotland Yard said today. The 48-year-old police constable was held on suspicion of misconduct in a public office this morning as part of Operation Alice, the investigation into whether officers lied about a dispute which led to the Tory MP being forced to quit the Cabinet. A 49-year-old woman - who is not a police officer - was arrested at a separate address on suspicion of assisting an offender. The arrested policeman is one of four officers previously issued with a Regulation 15 notice, served following an alleged breach of standards of professional behaviour. He has been on restricted duties and is expected to be suspended later today. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'On June 4, officers working on Operation Alice received fresh information regarding the investigation. 'As a result of this information and subsequent investigations, the Directorate of Professional Standards has arrested two people, a man and a woman, at two residential addresses, this morning.' They were taken to separate police stations - one in London and the other outside the capital - and remain in custody. The Independent Police Complaints Commission, which supervises the investigation, has been informed. Mr Mitchell quit as chief whip after it was claimed that he swore at police officers and called them 'plebs' when they refused to let him leave Downing Street on his bike via the main gate in September last year. But a subsequent Channel 4 investigation cast doubt on that account when it revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate at the time as had originally been claimed. An email from a civilian witness backing up the police account of events has also been called into question. Mr Mitchell quit as chief whip after it was claimed that he swore at police officers and called them 'plebs' when they refused to let him leave Downing Street on his bike via the main gate in September last year . Six people have now been arrested as part of the investigation. No decisions have yet been taken on whether anyone will be charged. The duration and cost of the investigation has sparked anger among MPs. Operation Alice has already taken eight months and cost taxpayers more than £140,000. Earlier this month, London Mayor Boris Johnson was forced to defend Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe's role in the case and express his 'absolute confidence' in the Metropolitan Police Commissioner.

"Manchester United striker Robin van Persie left the Liberty Stadium on crutches and with his right leg in a protective boot to pile more misery on Louis van Gaal. The Dutchman, who started the match alongside Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney, hobbled out of Swansea's stadium after appearing to injure his right leg. Van Persie and his team-mates were unable to stop Swansea from sealing a Premier League double over Manchester United as Ki Sung-yueng and Bafetimbi Gomis struck to hand the home side all three points.

Louis van Gaal said after the match that Van Persie wasn't able to walk during the closing stages of the game . Ander Herrera had put his side in the lead in the 28th minute, however the Spaniard's opener was quickly cancelled out by Ki Sung-yueng. The extent of Van Persie's injury is not yet known, however Van Gaal did say his fellow countryman 'could not run anymore'. ‘We dominated the game even with 10 men because Robin van Persie could not run anymore because of an injury (after United had made their last substitution),' said Van Gaal. The Red Devils boss will be hoping Van Persie's injury is not too serious as his side face a battle to claim a spot in next season's Champions League and face Arsenal in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup on March 9.

"Arsene Wenger believes his Arsenal side may have 'switched off' towards the end of their victory over Crystal Palace as they escaped with a 2-1 win. The visitors had eased into a two-goal lead at half-time courtesy of an early Santi Cazorla penalty and an Olivier Giroud strike just before the break. But Palace rallied in the second-half and had Arsenal defending deep - with substitute Glenn Murray scoring a stoppage-time consolation before cracking a post with the last meaningful touch of the game. Arsene Wenger feels his Arsenal side might have 'switched' off during their 2-1 win over Crystal Palace . Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck controls the ball ahead of Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak . Arsenal forward Olivier Giroud holds off pressure from Crystal Palace midfielder Jason Puncheon . Arsenal moved third with the win and, although Wenger praised the fighting spirit of his players, he conceded they suffered a lapse in concentration as Palace pinned them back in search of a point. 'Certainly they thought that it was done,' he said of his players. 'We know in the Premier League that it's never done, especially at 2-0. With that ball on the post we were a bit fortunate. 'We can learn from every game. I believe that the players know that maybe they switched off a little bit too early. Overall I still must say that our central defenders played very well today against a very direct and a very physical game at the back. 'We missed goal number three and when they came back to 2-1 we were a bit lucky, a bit fortunate. We did well so overall I'm pleased to have won three points in a place like this. I feel quite strong and let's just continue to fight and be tight until the end.' Giroud taps home his 11th goal of the seaosn to give Arsenal a 2-0 lead at Selhurst Park on Saturday . Arsenal's anchorman Francis Coquelin holds off Puncheon as the pair tussle in midfield . Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew is convinced that Arsenal's second goal was was offside . Eagles boss Alan Pardew was left berating referee Mark Clattenberg as he felt Pape Souare's foul on Danny Welbeck that led to Cazorla's penalty occurred outside of the box - with Welbeck then offside in the build-up to Giroud's strike. 'The first goal was a mistake by Pape - he should do better, although it was tough on us because it looked like the incident was outside the box,' he said. 'The second goal was offside. That call should have been made. A minute before half-time you've got to get that call right.' Despite the defeat, Pardew hailed the performance of his side as the best he has seen since taking over at Selhurst Park at the turn of the year. 'We took a tactical decision to take the game to Arsenal,' he added. 'We continued with the game-plan and I was very pleased with the reaction. Its probably the best we've played since I've been manager. 'The chance when it hit that post and it fell in to the goalkeeper's hands summed our day up. I thought it was going to spin into the net. 'There was some great team play and probably the best players were on our team. But we've lost and sometimes that happens.

"This was just the second time in three years England manager Roy Hodgson has dared to venture to the Stadium of Light, but on the evidence of this sour stalemate he will not be back. It wasn’t only the Three Lions contenders – Saido Berahino and Jermain Defoe - who failed to impress, every player on the pitch was as desperate as the next. Referee Mike Jones and his assistants were equally inept, failing to send off West Brom’s Joleon Lescott early in the game and later denying Sunderland a legitimate goal.

The Premier League table after Saturday's Premier League game . Lee Cattermole worked tirelessly in midfield for Sunderland, as his heat map shows in our brillant Match Zone . But for Hodgson, it was a wasted trip. Or perhaps not, for neither Baggies frontman Berahino nor ex-Toronto striker Defoe – bidding for a recall having returned to the Premier League in January – did anything to suggest they are more deserving of inclusion ahead of the likes of Harry Kane. It was a contest – if you can call it that – low on entertainment and quality. Indeed, Tony Pulis’ West Brom barely mustered an effort on goal. The draw – Sunderland’s 13th of the Premier League season - has done little to ease the pressure on Black Cats boss Gus Poyet, who this week penned an open letter to the fans asking for their support. But the Uruguayan did have reason to moan about some first-half refereeing. The game was just five minutes old when Lee Cattermole sprung Danny Graham clear on the shoulder of Lescott and, under what appeared minimal contact from the recovering defender, the striker flopped to the turf. Referee Jones looked to have made the right call when waving play on, only for assistant Constantine Hatzidakis to flag for an infringement. Lescott, then, would surely have to go. Jones, though, perhaps doubting the advice of his assistant, opted to show yellow. It was a weak decision. From the resulting free-kick Seb Larsson whipped into the side-netting .

What followed was 20 minutes of scrap and tedium, only broken when a Darren Fletcher mistake presented the hosts with a chance to break. Defoe fed Ricky Alvarez and he cut infield before lashing narrowly wide with his left boot. Defoe then took aim from a narrow angle but failed to defy it and smashed across goal and wide. Whistler Jones and his team were again the centre of attention when disallowing Adam Johnson’s goal on the stroke of half-time. Alvarez crossed to the far post where the winger – played onside by Craig Dawson – controlled before dashing across the six-yard box and toeing in. It should have stood. There was still time for Larsson to test the palms of Ben Foster 30 yards as Sunderland finished the half on the front foot. The home fans did respond to Poyet’s call for support after the break but such enthusiasm was not a result of anything they’d witnessed on the pitch. It wasn’t until the 62nd minute that full-back Santiago Vergini flashed wide a header from Larsson’s corner. The Argentine, unmarked eight yards out, should have scored.

While the smartwatch doesn't have a heartbeat sensor like some of its rivals, it apparently detects emotions and can share these ‘vibes’ with others using an app called Vibe. A rival for Apple Watch? will.i.am wore his  smartwatch before the launch, and said that people will be able to use the gadget like a phone, by making calls, using apps and listen to music . Like Apple’s Siri, Windows’ Cortana and Google Now, the device includes a voice-controlled assistant. Music can be stored and played on the device (pictured left) as well as being accessible through a streaming service. While the device does not have a heart monitor, it still offers fitness apps (right) will.i.am was seen using his watch at a DJ set (pictured) three weeks ago. The device was meant to launch in July, but was delayed . In April, will.i.am claimed that the gadget has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and apps including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in an interview with Alan Carr (pictured) A built-in music app will allow users to store music locally, as well as use a digital music service from a British company called 7digital. Will.i.am and 7digital are thought to have struck deals with large and small record labels to cover most musical tastes, which could give the wearable an edge over those with other music services. Because the Puls is a stand-alone gadget, it requires its own data plan. This will be available from AT&T in the US and from O2 in the UK, although no prices have yet been announced, but will.i.am hinted it will be cheaper than a smartphone and ‘affordable’. The cuff will come in black, white, pink and blue. A backpack with built-in speakers, a jacket that is able to charge devices and shoes with a built-in pedometer  will also be sold alongside the Puls wearable. Ahead of the launch, Will.i.am was recently seen wearing his Puls creation during a DJ set, where he phoned a friend and told the audience: ‘Just to let you know, this is not tethered to a phone, or nothing like that,’ before seemingly using it to control the music playing. Music to consumers' ears? The device, runs Android, has a curved screen and can store music locally, as well as coming with a digital music service from a British company called 7digital. This is will.i.am's personal prototype which he wore in public before the launch . The wrapper and entrepreneur was recently seen wearing his creation during a DJ set, where he phoned a friend and told the audience: ‘Just to let you know, this is not tethered to a phone, or nothing like that. He also used it to call Cheryl Cole in the last series of The Voice (pictured) In April, he claimed in an interview with Alan Carr, that the gadget has Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and apps including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, all of which will.i.am uses frequently. Will.i.am, the director of creative innovation at Intel showed off his smartwatch for the first time on Channel 4's Alan Carr: Chatty Man, as well as using it during The Voice. During the show, will.i.am told Alan Carr: 'I don’t carry my phone anymore, this is my phone. ‘A lot of these smartwatches need phones - mine doesn't need a phone. 'I started the company myself, I funded it, I used my own money to develop it. 'So, it’s a phone. It has all my music in it so I can work out with it, without wires using Bluetooth headphones. It’s got Twitter, Instagram, Facebook.’ will.i.am's device will go head-to head with the Apple Watch (pictured left and right). It is not known whether the two products will be similarly priced, with an Apple Watch costing  $349 (£216). There is no launch date for either of the watches, with rumours suggesting the Apple Watch will not be released until February . The following night, will.i.am used the watch to call Cheryl Cole during the final of talent show The Voice - although the call quality was poor and cut out shortly afterwards. Aside from music, Will.i.am has a strong background in science and technology. In 2011, Intel named will.i.am as director of creative innovation and his role was to help develop the firm’s range of phones, tablets and laptops. A year later he made history by streaming a song from the surface of Mars in conjunction with Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. The song was called Reaching for the Stars. The watch has a completely new user interface, different from the iPhone, and the 'crown' on the Apple Watch is a dial called the 'digital crown.' Users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map, or scroll a list. The crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen. Different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes, and force touches. The Glances feature shows info users would like to see, similar to Google Now, and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom. Music can also be controlled on an iPhone through the Apple Watch. Built-in is a 'taptic engine' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications. It understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers, and messages can be dictated to the iPhone. Users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply, or have it transcribed to them. There is no keyboard on the watch, and messages can only be sent through dictation, or emoji. Siri also is built into the Apple Watch.","will.i.am's smartwatch is called Puls, and as expected, can be used to make phone calls, thanks to a built-in Sim card reader .

"Among the qualities required in the heat of a relegation battle, a cool head and composure always come in handy. Step forward Joey Barton. The QPR captain has spent much of his controversial career tackling his demons and trying to control his anger, not always with the greatest success. Even by his questionable standards, however, the red card Barton received in the 32nd minute at the KC Stadium was stupid in the extreme. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Joey Barton sees red for punching Tom Huddlestone in the groin .

N'Doye capped off a fine passing move to hand his side the win - click HERE for more of our brilliant Match Zone . It left his team having to play for the best part of an hour with only 10 men, having already gone a goal down. They hit back to equalise through Charlie Austin but couldn’t hold on and conceded a crucial late goal from Dame N’Doye as fellow strugglers Hull celebrated what could prove to be a priceless victory in the fight for Premier League survival. There was no need for Barton to get involved when Darnell Furlong marred an otherwise impressive debut by lunging into a tackle on Nikica Jelavic. As Hull’s players complained and referee Anthony Taylor reached for his yellow card to book the youngster, Barton positioned himself at the centre of the melee to try and defend his teammate. He pushed Alex Bruce and then responded to a shove in the back from Tom Huddlestone by swinging a low blow into his opponent’s groin. The ninth red card of Barton’s career duly followed, further blotting the disciplinary record of a player who had come into this game with a Premier League record seven consecutive yellows against his name. Barton apologised to his team-mates and the club’s fans on Twitter afterwards, but the incident was reminiscent of his sending-off on the last day of the season at Manchester City in 2012 when he saw red and received a 12-match ban for elbowing Carlos Tevez, kneeing Sergio Aguero and then trying to headbutt Vincent Kompany. Barton took to Twitter shortly after the match to apologise to his QPR team-mates following his side's defeat . QPR were fighting for their lives that day as well. They survived despite Aguero’s late title winner, but the price of this defeat could be altogether more costly. ‘You can’t go punching people in the knackers, can you?’ said Hull manager Steve Bruce. ‘I didn’t see the incident but everyone tells me that what he did was just ridiculous.’ New QPR head coach Chris Ramsey dismissed suggestions that he could now strip Barton of the captaincy. He said: ‘Joey apologised to the boys straightaway (at half-time). I’m sure he will be the first one to put his hand up and admit that he probably should have acted in a different manner. ‘It’s always difficult when you have players who have that bit of edge. We’ll have a chat when I see him next which will probably be Sunday or Monday. ‘I’m more disappointed than anything for the hard work that seems to have gone down the drain.’ Hull went ahead in the 16th minute when Steven Caulker headed Huddlestone’s high freekick straight to Jelavic who executed a clinical right-foot volley into the bottom corner. Despite Barton’s dismissal, QPR equalised six minutes before the interval when Austin got in between Bruce and Michael Dawson to meet Matt Phillips’s cross with a glancing header. Austin, who missed out on a £4.5million move to Hull in 2013 after failing the medical due to concerns over his knee, celebrated by hobbling off the pitch. ‘I congratulated him afterwards,’ said Hull boss Steve Bruce. ‘Our loss was certainly QPR’s gain.’ But N’Doye, Bruce’s new £2.2m deadline day signing from Lokomotiv Moscow, settled it with his second goal in two games as he headed in from Robbie Brady’s cross late on. Barton lashed out at Huddlestone during the first half of QPR's match against Hull . QPR striker Charlie Austin cancelled out Nikica Jelavic's opener to put his side back on level terms at the KC Stadium . Austin feigned a knee injury in reference to the striker reportedly failing a medical ahead of a proposed move to Hull from former side Burnley . Barton took to Twitter after the final whistle to publicly apologise to his QPR team-mates following his moment of madness at the KC Stadium. He wrote: 'Young kid making his debut has made a good tackle. Couple of Hull players trying to get him sent off. My job as captain is to protect him. 'I've tried to prevent Hull's players influencing referee as u can see by me pushing [Alex] Bruce away. 'My actions towards Huddlestone were certainly not malicious, it was a stupid reaction to being barged but I can appreciate it wasn't right. 'I'm gutted I got sent off. I've let my team-mates down today and being someone who puts the team above everything else I'm gutted about that. 'I've apologised to the lads and would like to apologise to all QPR fans who travelled today.' Austin rises above Hull duo Alex Bruce and Michael Dawson to score his 14th goal of the season .

"With £28million new boy Wilfried Bony looking on from the bench all eyes were on Edin Dzeko. How would the big man react? The arrival of last season's Premier League top scorer already seems to have prompted the departure of one City striker, with Stevan Jovetic not even included in Manuel Pellegrini's squad for this one. Edin Dzeko scored his first Premier League goal since his brace against Hull on September 27 . The Bosnian shows his excitement after scoring past Newcastle goalkeeper Tim Krul . Dzeko scored his side's third goal in Manchester City's 5-0 win against Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium . Edin Dzeko: 2 Premier League goals . Wilfried Bony: 9 Premier League goals (all for Swansea) Sergio Aguero: 17 Premier League goals . Stevan Jovetic: 5 Premier League goals . And while Dzeko landed a place in the starting XI it appeared as though this was the Chilean's bid to turn up the heat. It did not take too much time to find an answer. 26 seconds, to be precise. That is how long had passed when Dzeko nicked the ball from an inexplicably slumbering Vurnon Anita. The Dutchman then sent him flying and Sergio Aguero made no mistake from the spot. Simple, sharp and effective, it was the kind of vintage City that they had not seen in these parts for some time. It got better quickly. Dzeko has often been accused of being selfish, despite being paid to score goals. Dzeko celebrates with his Manchester City team-mates after scoring against John Carver's side . The 28-year-old played the full 90 minutes as Manchester City ran out 5-0 winners . But after setting up Aguero's penalty he showed his giving side again 10 minutes later when he found Samir Nasri with an admittedly-deflected pass. Eight yards out and with the freedom of the Etihad, the Frenchman could not miss. All that was missing now for Dzeko was a goal. He had to wait another 10 minutes for that. The pass, linked over the middle from David Silva, was exquisite. The chest down and left-footed finish from Dzeko sublime. Hell hath no fury like a Bosnian scorned. Before the half was over, and with a less forgiving referee than Chris Foy, it could have been even better but Dzeko saw two decent penalty appeals turned down. Newcastle simply could not handle him. Newcastle goalkeeper Dzeko was unable to get a hand on to Dzeko's first-half strike . Yaya Toure may have been back in the side, Bony may have been on the bench and Aguero may have been looking close to his best but it was Dzeko's name the gleeful City fans belted out time and time again before half-time. Only Tim Krul, quick off his line, denied him a second as the cakewalk continued after the break. On the hour mark the new man came on for Aguero and the pair linked well with the game won and the pressure off. Manuel Pellegrini may ask him why he needlessly handled home a corner late on to pick up a deserved yellow card but the manager will have been pleased with the response. He may have been wearing gloves (because it's always tropical in Sarajevo) but there was nothing cold about red hot Dzeko here. Wilfried Bony came off the substitutes' bench to make his Manchester City debut .","Edin Dzeko scored in Man City's emphatic 5-0 win against Newcastle .

"Algerian 1,500 metres medal contender Taoufik Makhloufi, who was thrown out of the Olympics for not trying hard enough in his 800m heat yesterday morning, has been reinstated. Makhloufi won his 1500m semi-final in style on Sunday and looked destined for a podium finish in Tuesday's grandstand final. But the 24-year-old was banned from taking any further part in the London Games after he gave up less than half way through his first 800m heat today. Not trying hard enough: Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi casually strolls off the track after giving up during his 800m heat on Monday . Banned: Makhloufi was excluded from all future events at the London Olympics for failing to try his best in a men's 800m Round 1 heat on Monday before being reinstated after providing medical reasons for not finishing . Trailing behind: Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi, third from left, quickly fell behind the other runners in the 800m heat yesterday . Algeria had attempted to withdraw the athlete from the two lap event, but missed Sunday's deadline - forcing him to take part today, or risk expulsion from the Games. He lined up at the start of heat five at the Olympic stadium on Monday but . was already well behind the field at the start of the back straight . before stopping running completely another 100 metres into the race and . wandering back across the infield past the pole vault area. Officials at the International Association of Athletics Federations were so incensed by his lack of effort they kicked him out of all competition. The IAAF announced in a statement: 'The Referee considered that he had not provided a bona fide effort and decided to exclude him from participation in all further events in the competition.' But he has now been reinstated in today's 1,500 final after providing adequate medical reasons for his failure to finish the 800m, the IAAF has confirmed. An IAAF statement read: 'After reviewing evidence provided by a LOCOG medical officer, the disqualification of athlete Taoufik Makhloufi from further participation in the athletics competition of the 2012 Olympic Games has been revoked by the IAAF technical delegates. Celebration: Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi as he wins the men's 1500m semi-final . Vast difference: Makhloufi led the pack in the men's 1500m heats on August 3 . 'Consequently, Mr Makhloufi is able to compete in the men's 1500m final.' Makhloufi, the African champion in the 800, has shown a marked improvement this year, bringing his personal best down from 3.32.94 to 3.30.80 in the 1,500. The exclusion is the latest in a string of incidents at the Games where athletes have not tried to win in order to manipulate results or draws in their ultimate favour. The worst was the badminton fiasco, where eight women from China, Indonesia and South Korea were thrown out of the Olympics for playing to lose group matches in order to get a better draw in the knockout stages. There have been other incidents which have not drawn any punishment, with organisers deciding that spectators had not been denied a competition. French rider Mickael Bourgain quit the cycling road race after just a few kilometres as planned on the first weekend of the Games having been forced to take part in order to compete in his favoured keirin track event. Makhloufi stormed past Olympic and world champion Asbel Kiprop in a stunning to finish to his 1,500 heat on Sunday, winning in three minutes 42.24 seconds . Injured: Algeria's Taoufik Makhloufi suffered an injury after the men's 1500m semi-finals on Sunday . Last Thursday, teenage cyclist Philip Hindes appeared to admit he deliberately crashed in cycling's team sprint event to ensure Britain were handed a restart because they set off badly. Earlier today it was announced American judoka Nicholas Delpopolo has been disqualified from the Olympics after failing a drugs test. The 23-year-old competed in the men's 73kg division and was tested on July 30 after his loss to Mongolian Nyam-Ochir Sainjargal in the repechage stage. The International Olympic Committee said Delpopolo tested positive for 11-nor-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid, which is connected to cannabis consumption. Delpopolo admitted his guilt but claimed he had not deliberately taken a banned substance. According to the IOC ruling, Delpopolo 'explained that his positive test was caused by his inadvertent consumption of food (prior to his leaving for the London Olympic Games) that he did not realise had been baked with marijuana.' Delpopolo has apologised to the United States Olympic Committee and team-mates and, according to the IOC, 'indicated that he was embarrassed by this mistake'.","Algeria tried to withdraw Taoufik Makhloufi so he could save himself for 1500m final, but they missed deadline .

"A section of Crystal Palace fans protested against the exorbitant costs of watching top flight football during The Eagles' game with Arsenal at Selhurst Park on Saturday. Unfurling a banner, targeted at football's boardroom chiefs or 'pigs', supporters made their feelings clear about the new £5 billion Premier League broadcasting agreement signed by Sky and BT Sport earlier this month. Up 70 per cent on the current £3 billion deal, the two companies will share 168 live games between 2016 and 2019. Crystal Palace fans pass around a banner, criticising football's 'pigs' and unwaveringly high ticket prices . Despite the enormity of the fees involved, little of that money is expected to filter down to supporters; rather, the fulcrum will be directed towards players' salaries and transfer fees. With mid-table Palace charging £45.00 per adult ticket for a 'Grade A' match - those against the likes of Arsenal, for example - it is little wonder that fans feel exploited.

"It has been described as part rock concert, part investment workshop. The annual gathering of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders is an odd mix. This year, former model Kathy Ireland joined Berkshire CEO Warren Buffet and the faithful crowd of more than 30,000 who attended Saturday's events. The attendees get the chance to learn about business and life from Mr Buffett and spend the day with like-minded investors. Special guests: Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett holds up the hand of former swimsuit model and now CEO, Kathy Ireland at a mini-golf competition at his AGM in Omaha . Kathy Ireland was a fixture in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue for 13 consecutive years with her last issue coming in 1996 after being on three different covers. But it's not just for her good looks that Buffet had her by his side. Since hanging up her swimsuit to dry, Kathy has been virtually printing money as CEO and Chief Designer of her company Kathy Ireland Worldwide which is reported to be worth some $2.0 billion. She has also written six books, including three for children and has a portfolio of real estate in Hawaii and California. Still got it: Former super model and now business woman Kathy Ireland and Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett follow Ireland's golf putting prior to the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting in Omaha, Nebraska . The level of appreciation shareholders have for Mr Buffett becomes clear as he tours the meeting's 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall each year. Admirers held their cell phones and iPads in the air as they surrounded the billionaire Saturday morning. A pack of security guards created a buffer around Buffett as he visited displays selling Berkshire's See's Candy, explained BNSF railroad's virtues and highlighted some of the company's other 80-plus subsidiaries. Josh Miller, 11, of Maple Grove, Minnesota, couldn't see over the throng of people, reporters and cameras that moved through the exhibition floor crowd. But he knew who was at the center. 'Warren! Warren!' he called, holding up his iPad to get a shot of the Oracle of Omaha. Oracle: Investor Warren Buffett greets shareholders. No other annual meeting can rival Berkshire's, which is known for its size and the straight talking Buffett . At the See's booth, Buffett got a lesson in making hand-dipped bonbons. Then See's manufacturing manager Steve Powell got Buffett to autograph his white uniform coat. The Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting began humbly in 1982 with a crowd of 15 in an insurance company cafeteria. It has been growing steadily just as the company's stock price rose to become the most-expensive in the U.S., reaching $162,904 for a Class A share on Friday. Now the meeting regularly fills Omaha's 18,300-seat arena and every nearby overflow room. Buffett likes to call it 'Woodstock for Capitalists.' It's the one day of the year when the 82-year-old Buffett gets treated like a rock star while his friend Bill Gates, who serves on Berkshire's board, can wander through the crowd without much recognition. Kathy Ireland: After appearing as a model in 13 consecutive Sports Illustrated swimsuit issues, she now runs the brand product marketing company, 'Kathy Ireland Worldwide' Shareholder Larry Cundiff has seen a lot of change at the meetings since he started attending about 15 years ago. He said it's hard to get within 15 feet of Buffett now. 'I met him once at a meeting in - I think - 1997,' Cundiff said. 'I was sitting at a booth, and he just walked up and sat beside us in the next booth. He autographed a dollar bill for me. I don't think he even had security then.' Buffett again shared the stage this year with his 89-year-old business partner, Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, to answer questions from shareholders, journalists and financial analysts for six hours. The questions seemed somewhat tougher and more detailed because of the addition of a panel of investment professionals, including Doug Kass, who has a negative view on Berkshire's stock. But the bulk of the questions explored familiar themes, such as the future of Berkshire after Buffett and Munger are gone. The questioners also wanted to hear what the two men thought about the economy, the Federal Reserve and life in general. Buffett said he thinks Berkshire will continue to thrive after he's gone because the company's employees and managers will resist any attempt to change the way it runs. 'The key is preserving the culture, and having a successor as CEO who is smart and energetic,' Buffett said. The U.S. economy should continue growing at a steady pace just as it has since the fall of 2009, Buffett said, but the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate growth are likely to eventually create inflation. 'We've encountered far worse problems than we face now,' Buffett said. 'This is not our toughest hour.' Not everyone at the meeting was applauding Buffett. Outside, dozens of Utah coal miners picketed in the hopes of winning a better contract offer. A handful of environmental activists left disappointed after shareholders rejected a proposal to require Berkshire's utilities to adopt goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Bernie Morris, of Price, Utah, stood in the rain to hand out flyers Saturday morning. The 67-year-old said he's worked for the Deer Creek coal mine for 28 years, but fears he won't be able to afford the monthly health insurance premium the company wants to charge. A spokeswoman for the mine, which is owned by a subsidiary of Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co., said the company is committed to a fair solution but won't comment on specific proposals. But the protesters didn't deter the thousands of people who came to hear Buffett and Munger. Amaury Fernandez and his best friend Rick Cabrera said they had traveled to the meeting from Miami because Fernandez is interested in investing. 'They are two of the most remarkable men I've ever learned about,' Fernandez said. 'We don't know how much longer these gentlemen are going to be alive.' Jim Weber, CEO of Berkshire's Brooks Running company, said he has been reading Buffett's annual letters to shareholders since the 1980s - long before Brooks became part of Berkshire. Weber had even attended four Berkshire annual meetings before Brooks was acquired in 2006 along with Russell Athletic. 'If you're in the business world, it's a bucket list item. There's no other annual meeting like it,' Weber said.","Buffet widely considered the most successful investor of the 20th century .

'He’s not old. He is a really top centre-half. He’s the best I have ever worked with, that’s for sure.'

Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans are Moyes' other options but, after promising more big-moneys signings after the arrival of Juan Mata from Chelsea last month, the former Everton boss will be hopeful of bringing in a suitable replacement when the transfer window reopens.

Vidic has so far made 284 appearances for United, scoring 19 goals in all competitions and lifting five Premier League titles, one Champions League trophy, three League Cups, five Community Shields and one FIFA Club World Cup.

"Thorpe Park has been accused of 'stigmatising mental illness' for naming a Halloween attraction The Asylum. Campaigners say bosses at the theme park should consider changing the name of the horror maze. The attraction has featured as part of the Surrey park's annual Halloween event, Fright Night, for eight years. Thorpe Park, in Surrey, said The Asylum attraction has been part of its Fright Night events for eight years . Campaigners want the name of the Halloween attraction changed and say it 'stigmatises' the mentally ill . Mental health advocates said that having actors chasing people around 'The Asylum' pretending to be patients reinforces stigma around mental illness. A Thorpe Park spokeswoman said that the attraction is not meant to be offensive nor 'a realistic portrayal' of mental ill health. The news sparked a row on the attraction's Facebook page, with one user posting: 'I have psychosis, I'm not dangerous, and have never run after someone with a chainsaw.' Another said: 'Stuff like this genuinely contributes to an atmosphere in which people with mental illness suffer discrimination and violence.' To which one user replied: 'Obfuscation in discussing mental illness is equally damaging. Do you seriously believe that your bracketing all people who have mental illnesses (of a variety of kinds) under the ""offended"" flag because of the use of the name ""Asylum"" isn't offensive?' Another added: 'It's for Halloween, get a grip.' The petition organised by nursing student Katie Sutton has attracted hundreds of signatures . A petition calling for the ride to be shut down organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student, has attracted more than 750 signatures. She wrote: 'Asylum, Thorpe Park's Halloween maze, is stigmatising to mental illness.' Paul Jenkins, chief executive of the charity Rethink Mental Illness, said: 'While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to ""patients"" crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness. 'It really matters because the promotion of the scary ""mental patient"" stereotype reinforces stigma and means people with mental health problems are afraid to be open about it. This means they are less likely to get support both from friends and professionals. 'We'd like executives from Thorpe Park to meet face-to-face with people with mental illness, to hear about their concerns. We also think they should change the theme of the attraction and stop referring to ""patients"". There are plenty of other themes they could choose like zombies, vampires or monsters, without upsetting anyone.' Thorpe Park bosses say the maze is for adults and the experience draws on classic horror film content . A Thorpe Park spokeswoman said: 'We have listened to the feedback and respect the opinions of everyone who has been in touch. However, these comments are not universally representative either of many of our guests who have given us very positive feedback, or of others working within the mental health sector. 'The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping. It is set within a single closed environment and is a very small element of an event aimed at adult visitors - all of whom chose to visit, and have paid for entry to the overall event. 'This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of mental health or indeed any other institution.' Last month supermarkets Asda and Tesco came under fire for selling Halloween costumes which were said to have caused offence. Asda withdrew its 'mental patient fancy dress costume' and Tesco took its 'psycho ward' outfit off the shelves.","Hundreds of people signed petition against Halloween horror maze .

"Yannick Bolasie is demonstrating his 360-degree flick for a film crew at Crystal Palace’s training ground when coach Ronnie Jepson strides over. ‘We taught him that trick, you know,’ jokes Jepson before slapping the Palace winger on the back and urging him to make the hour-and-a-half commute back to his home in Uxbridge, west London. ‘We’ve got a big game against Stoke and he needs his rest,’ added Jepson, before wandering off with his mug of tea to resume a conversation with assistant manager Keith Millen in the canteen. Yannick Bolasie hopes to start scoring more goals for Crystal Palace this season . Bolasie, pulled off a memorable tricked last week, which saw him face away from the pitch with Spurs' Christian Eriksen putting him under pressure . The Palace star has the ball under control, using both feet, as Eriksen closes in . ‘People talked about that bit of skill at Tottenham, but did we win?’ Bolasie asks of himself. ‘Did I score a goal? No. Did I create a goal? No.’ Even so, it is difficult to tire of watching Bolasie’s move, trying to figure out how he completed an electrifying three-point turn and flick off his right boot that took him past Christian Eriksen at White Hart Lane. That was the official unveiling, but the improvisation and the invention was perfected during his years playing on the street near his parents’ home in Willesden, north-west London. ‘We had to pick a team, so I’d be Brazil, my friends would be Argentina or England or whoever, and there would be 40 kids trying to beat the keeper to stay in the World Cup,’ he said. ‘To get through to the next round I had to improvise, to change direction and speed before anyone could anticipate what I was about to do. It’s a difficult move to defend because if you sense I am about to do it, I can double tap in a different direction. The slightest touch from Bolasie's right boot plays it over Eriksen and leaves him stranded . And he's off, heading for the byline after the perfect execution of his trick . ‘When Eriksen came towards me I knew it was the time to try it. Down by the corner flag, no-one expects you to try something like that. People think I don’t know what I’m going to do next, but it’s all up here,’ he says as he places his raspberry protein shake on the table and points to his head. On current form, Bolasie, 25, is one step ahead of the game. Yet he has come to the Barclays Premier League the long way, via spells in Malta, with Barnet, Dagenham, Plymouth and Bristol City. He was born in Lyons, France, and moved to Willesden with his parents as a young boy. Football runs in the family. Dad Gaby, a truck driver, played for the Congo Under 21 team — Yannick will travel to the Africa Cup of Nations next month to represent the national team and could be away for six weeks. Younger brother Ruddock Yala plays non-League for Maldon and Tiptree, and Yannick went to watch Glenn Yala — another brother — playing for Chalfont St Peter a couple of weeks back. The Palace winger talks to Sportsmail's Neil Ashton at the club's Beckenham training ground . Bolasie (right) goes flying as he battles for the ball with Spurs' Ben Davies last Saturday . The 25-year-old DR Congo international has received widespread praise for his impressive performances . ‘Everybody I know played, it’s just how it has always been,’ he added. In many ways Bolasie is an old-fashioned winger, a throwback to the days when Chris Waddle or Ryan Giggs would send a defender off balance with a step-over before skinning their man down the line. ‘When I’m on the ball I want to make something happen and my theory is that if I go into a game and work hard, everything will happen as a result,’ said Bolasie. ‘If you don’t work hard, and the flicks and tricks don’t come off, then it doesn’t go down well with the fans, does it? ‘I’m benefiting as a winger because these days every kid coming through wants to play No 10.’ Back when Bolasie was a couple of years behind his neighbours Kerrea Gilbert (then of Arsenal) and Phil Ifil (Tottenham), he played all over the park. Neil Warnock will be dealt a blow when both Bolasie and captain Mile Jedinak leave on international duty . Left back for Brent, right back at Hillingdon Borough, central midfield for his county Middlesex and up front for his Sunday side. ‘At 14, when I went for a trial at Rushden & Diamonds I was playing central midfield, but I came to my senses and realised I was a winger.’ There are few finer sights in English football at this moment than Bolasie flying down the wing for Palace, fuelled by the injection of confidence given to him by the previous manager, Tony Pulis, and his new boss Neil Warnock. ‘I was intimidated by Pulis at first, he was scary,’ admits Bolasie as he reflects on Palace’s remarkable ascent from the drop zone last season. ‘You wouldn’t want to get on his wrong side, but he is a very good tactician and a very good man-manager. ‘We also knew of his record of never getting relegated and it played a big part. His tactical awareness lifted the players. Bolasie admits he was 'intimidated' by former Palace manager Tony Pulis (above) ‘He knew I could attack, but he also improved me defensively.’ Speak to the Palace coaches at the club’s Beckenham training centre and they are full of praise for Bolasie’s determination to improve. The Palace fitness coach Scott Guyett has challenged Bolasie to set a new personal best by running 11,000 metres against Stoke at Selhurst Park on Saturday. He smiles at the prospect and Palace’s training ground has been a happier place since Warnock, who returned to the club in August, urged Bolasie to enjoy life a bit more. ‘I met Neil last year and he gives me confidence. He is always telling me to smile and there’s no doubt I am playing better this season. ‘As a professional I made it late, I didn’t have trials and I didn’t have a manager teaching me. I just pinched stuff as I went along.’ The 25-year-old tackles Aston Villa defender Jores Okore during his team's 1-0 defeat . Bolasie has scored two goals in his nine games representing DR Congo . He is bashful about the tattoo he had inked on to his right arm — ‘Hope for the best but expect the worst’ — when he was struggling to get into the first team under Paul Sturrock at Plymouth. ‘I’m never getting another,’ he admits. His Twitter account is maintained by his agent: ‘I’m not interested in it because there are too many negative people.’ He no longer drinks — just a Coke at the Christmas party on Saturday evening — and works out in the gym most days at the training ground. On Thursday, during a practice match towards the end of the training session, he finished off a neat move when he was supplied by Wilfried Zaha from the wing. Bolasie (left), who has been at Palace since 2012, revealed he no longer drinks . It is an area of Bolasie’s game he accepts he needs to improve if he is to be regarded as one of the best wingers in the top flight. Since his move to Palace in 2012, Bolasie has scored only four times in nearly 90 appearances. ‘I’ve been unlucky not to score in the past few games. I was panicking a bit about not scoring, but I know it will come.’ Just like his 360-degree trick, it could be just a matter of time before he delivers something special in front of goal.","Yannick Bolasie hopes to score more goals for Crystal Palace .

"Newly-released audio from a 911 call has revealed the shock and disbelief witnesses had after a Wu-Tang-affiliated rapper's self-castration and leap from a second-floor balcony of a North Hollywood apartment. Andre Johnson - who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar - was reportedly high on drugs when the bizarre April incident occurred, and the witness who placed the emergency call couldn't believe what he had seen. 'We have a friend over here and… we don’t know if he’s alive or not [after jumping from] the second floor… I don’t believe this s**t,' said the unidentified person. Andre Johnson, who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar, has revealed that he wants to star in a porn movie to prove that his manhood remains fully functional . The caller claimed he and a couple friends were on the balcony when Johnson jumped from the balcony. The audio was first made public by TMZ. It was later reported the 40-year-old rapper was high on the drug PCP, also known as angel dust. The psychedelic is known for causing people to jump from ledges because they think they can fly. Loud screaming can be heard in the background. The person on the phone claims it is Johnson. He also says at least one child who witnessed the ordeal, but it is not clear if either of his daughters was present. 'I guess he’s alive, he’s screaming, but you need to hurry,' he tells the 911 dispatcher. 'There’s a puddle of [blood]’ The man then starts talking to another person in the room. 'What a stupid mother f****r, make me call the police. This is the worst s**t I ever seen in my life.’ Police soon arrive. 'You gotta come get him, he cut his damn penis off,’ he can be heard telling cops. 'We were sitting on the balcony and this mother f****r just came and [jumped]' The 911 audio emerged almost two months after Johnson broke his silence about the ugly incident, saying depression drove him to do it. High on drugs: Seen here performing as Christ Bearer in the group Northstar, Johnson was reportedly high on angel dust at the time he jumped . Johnson told TMZ last month that he was smoking weed and reading a book about monks and vasectomies right before the self-castration. He said he felt his 'world was collapsing' after being prevent from seeing his two daughters due to a restraining order, and that he had a third child on the way. TMZ also reported that Johnson's member was able to be reattached by doctors. While he claims he will be able to regain full functionality, having more children will likely not be possible. The incident occurred at an apartment compex about 1am on Wednesday April 16. Police classified the case as an attempted suicide. Friends within the building said Johnson managed the mutilation quickly before running and jumping over the ledge. However E! Online reported that the rapper cut off the tip of his penis first, then removed his testicles and the remainder of his genitalia. Johnson was high on PCP at the time, E! reported, citing police sources.. When people from the building ran downstairs to see if Johnson had survived the fall, they said he was already on his feet screaming. He was found in critical condition before he was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The organs were recovered upstairs inside the apartment. Neighbors initially said Johnson did not seem to be under the effect of hard drugs. In dispute: Johnson (right) said he had been smoking weed, not doing PCP, and reading a book about self-castration at the time of the ugly April 16 incident . Northstar is described on the Wu-Tang website as a duo from the north side of Long Beach who have produced songs warning of the dangers of drugs and saluting their own Muslim beliefs. In 1998, they were discovered by Wu-Tang member RZA, who produced some of their albums. As Johnson's unfortunate incident hit headlines, RZA moved to distance himself for the rap duo, releasing a statement he has had nothing to do with them for 10 years. PCP is a 'dissociative drug' meaning that it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. First introduced as a street drug in the 1960s, PCP - which comes in crystal form but is often smoked with a herb like mint or marijuana -  quickly gained a reputation as a drug that could cause bad reactions and was not worth the risk. However, some abusers continue to use PCP due to the feelings of strength, power, and invulnerability as well as a numbing effect on the mind that PCP can induce. The dispatcher is bold. The caller is only italic when talking to others. Man, we have a friend that was over here and he just [sliced] his damn penis off and (unintelligible) and we don’t know if he’s alive or not.Which floor did he jump off?The second floor… god d**n I don’t believe this s**t.Okay, tell me exactly what happenedI don’t know. We were sitting on the balcony and he just ran in there and started messing with… (garbled) … He’s calling right now, so I guess he’s hurt, but you need to hurry up and get here.What’s the patient’s name? Is he there with you?Yeah, he’s downstairs. He just came to right now.How old is he?(Garbled)A male correct?Yes.Is he awake?Yeah, he’s out there yelling right now.Is he breathing?He’s bleeding like a mother f****r, somebody needs to get here.No, is he breathing? Is he moving air?(Garbled)Oh, okay.(Both men pause while there is loud screaming in the background)That’s who I’m talking to right now.(More screaming)Why did he even do that sir?I don’t even know, I don’t know.Okay, is he completely alert?No, he’s not, obviously if you do something like that.Okay, is he breathing normally?Yeah, he’s down there talking now, but he’s (garbled).Is the blood spurting or pouring out sir?(Garbled) puddle out there.I’m sending paramedics right now as we speak, okay, but I have more questions for you. Do you know if he has a mental disorder or if he’s on medications?No, I don’t know none of that sir.Okay, alright, that’s fine. Stay on the line and I’ll tell you exactly what to do next okay? Just try to control that…I don’t know what we can do, he’s acting irate and we have a child over here.He’s not letting you guys help him? Is that what you’re saying?No, he’s (garbled).Okay, alright sir, don’t let him have anything to eat or drink okay? It might make him sick or cause problems for the doctor.He’s outside.Okay, just let him rest in the most comfortable position and wait for an officer to arrive. Don’t move him unless absolutely necessary. What’s he doing right now?He's out there running wild in the alley, I’m telling you man.Do you know this guy?We can’t – yeah, we know him, but we can’t stop nothing that he’s doing.Okay, alright. Okay, sir, they are on their way okay?  Just watch him closely. If he gets worse in any way, calls us back immediately.Do you mind if I stay with you on the phone?Yes, I’ll stay with you, okay? Stay on the line.I’m here.(More yelling in the background)This stupid mother f****r, I don’t believe somebody called the police. Yeah somebody called, they got neighbors up there callin’, I’m not letting his a** in here.(Someone in the background begins shouting to lock all the doors)Mother f****r, this is the worst s**t I ever seen in my life.(More yelling)They ain’t comin’ in, why you tell them we don’t want them in? There’s kids in here, f**k with a grown as n***a goin to do that a stupid a** n***a. I thought he was fam and chill, but this mother f****r went over there and tore his s**t off. What the f**k?You gotta come get him, you gotta come get his penis (garbled)’ to the police. Hey, he cut his (garbled), you gotta come up here and get his penis…Sir, who are you talking to?He cut his damn penis off, I’m on the phone with the – with 911.Sir, are you with the fire department now?No, that’s the police.We were sitting on the balcony and this mother f****r just came in there and (trails off)… yeah, we got a little girl in there, that’s why I didn’t let his a** in.Alright, but his kid is over here man.Sir, is he with the paramedics now?","Andre Johnson, 40, chopped off his own penis inside a North Hollywood apartment about 1am on April 16 and then jumped from the second floor .

"A £76million 'missing link' stretch of railway - dubbed the M25 on rails -  was officially opened to rush hour passengers today. The new 1,422 yards of track south west of Surrey Quays station links the east London section of London Overground with existing track to the north of Queen’s Road Peckham in south east London. It means commuters can make short journeys around the capital without having to travel via central stations already at full capacity. The new line will significantly reduce journey time. From Clapham Junction, it will now take 28 minutes to Canada Water and 35 minutes to Shoreditch . London Mayor Boris Johnson launches the new rail service at Clapham Junction Station to complete London Overground's orbital network, marking the arrival of the first orbital railway in the capital for 128 years . But if you want to make your way across the capital, be prepared to be on your toes - commuters will need to change a number of times to reach the other side of the city. A trip on the orbital section lasts . about 90 minutes, but cannot be taken uninterrupted, with changes at . Highbury and Islington and Clapham Junction. The last jigsaw piece in the London Overground line was heralded by Mike Brown, managing director of London . Underground and London Rail. He told the Evening Standard: 'If the Circle Line is the equivalent of the . North and South Circular Roads, this is the M25 of rail.' He said it enables people to get around the capital without going through exceptionally busy . stations such as Victoria, Waterloo and London Bridge, and allow passengers to travel from Clapham Junction to Canary Wharf . and cut out the middle part of the journey. Around 12.3million passengers a year are expected to use the new link, which will operate 16 trains an hour. It will also significantly reduce journey times. From Clapham Junction, it will now take 28 minutes to Canada Water and 35 minutes to Shoreditch . London Mayor Boris Johnson rode on the new link today with Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin as they discussed Mr Johnson's bid to  win control over commuter rail services. If talks between the pair on December 19 go as expected, and Mr Johnston wins control over routes, he will have the power to order new trains, set ticket prices and schedule timetables. The new line crosses from Clapham Junction to Surrey Quays. It has 77 miles of track and 83 stations, from Watford to Croydon and Richmond to Barking . The mayor joins commuters along the new line. It has been dubbed 'the M25 on rails' Mr McLoughlin said: 'I hope we can be positive in what we’ve done. In principle I have no objections but we have got some problems to overcome.' Mr Johnson said the 'hugely popular' overground link would help . the regeneration of east London, while Mr McLoughlin said it would be a . 'boon for businesses and commuters'. The Overground line now has 77 miles of track and 83 stations, from Watford to Croydon and Richmond to Barking. The Department for Transport contributed £60million to the new rail link, with £15million coming from the Mayor and TfL. Trains were made by Bombardier in Derby, and 48 drivers and five support staff  have been hired.","The £76m line - running 16 trains an hour - will reduce journey times .

"Taxpayers’ handouts to massive ‘ugly’ solar farms which scar the countryside are to be axed by Environment Secretary Liz Truss. She will tell farmers tomorrow to stop pocketing public funds by carpeting large parts of the landscape with the black panels – and go back to growing fruit, vegetables and crops instead. The move, to take effect from January, is the latest part of David Cameron’s attempt to move away from green politics. Ms Truss said: ‘I want Britain to lead the world in food and farming and to do that we need enough productive agricultural land. ‘I’m very concerned that a lot of our land is being taken up with solar farms. We’ve already got 250 of them and we’ve got 10,000 football pitches worth of new solar farms in the pipeline. Scroll down for video . ‘They are ugly, a blight on the countryside, and villages are pushing production of meat and other traditional British produce overseas. ‘Food and farming is our number one manufacturing industry, the whole food chain represents £100 billion in our economy, and it is a real problem if we are using productive agricultural land for solar farms. ‘I’m not against them per se – they’re fine on commercial roofs and school roofs – but it’s a big problem if we are using land that can be used to grow crops, fruit and vegetables. We import two-thirds of our apples, and using more land for solar panels makes it harder to improve that.’ The boom in solar farms in recent years has been fuelled by big grants from Whitehall and Brussels that have seen landowners pocket up to £50,000 a year. It has led to claims that they are becoming ‘the new onshore wind’ after growing criticism of giant wind turbines. Ms Truss’s initiative comes amid claims by Tory officials that the party is to dump the colour green from its official leaflets. A green doodled oak tree logo replaced the Conservatives’ traditional torch in 2006, a year after Cameron became leader, in an attempt to give them an eco-friendly image. However, the Prime Minister’s enthusiasm for ‘green power’ has dimmed with growing scepticism about the speed of climate change and a growing backlash against the appearance and energy efficiency of wind turbines and solar farms. Mr Cameron, who once vowed to lead the ‘greenest government ever’, publicly promised to ‘roll back’ green taxes, which add more than £100 a year to average fuel bills. And, to the horror of environmental campaigners, his message in private is said to have been more blunt. He reportedly told a colleague: ‘We’ve got to get rid of all this green c**p.’ The Tory mantra of the early days of Cameron’s leadership – ‘Vote blue, go green’ – has rarely been uttered by Ministers in recent months. The solar power industry costs the taxpayer an estimated £600 million a year. Some of the subsidies are funded by channelling money from household fuel bills, prompting claims that ordinary families are bankrolling wealthy landowners. Ms Truss is to end grants of £2 million a year available via her department from the European Union’s Common Agriculture Policy. The grants are worth up to £100 an acre. Ministers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change announced earlier this year that solar- farm grants from their budget will also be slashed. There has been huge growth in large solar projects since 2012. Two years ago there were just 46, but the total has soared to about 200 this year, with another 200 awaiting planning permission. The Tories have already promised not to subsidise any new onshore wind farms if they win next year’s Election with an outright majority. She played the role of Maggie at age of 8...and she might just follow her into No10 . Environment Secretary Liz Truss who played Margaret Thatcher in a school election in 1983 . It is difficult to top the Thatcherite credentials of high-flying Cabinet Minister Liz Truss. After all, she made her first pro-Maggie speech as an eight-year-old schoolgirl at West Primary School in Paisley, in Labour’s Scottish heartlands. ‘I was Margaret Thatcher in the school election during the 1983 General Election,’ she says, laughing at her own precociousness. As a debating debut, it was not a triumph. In the real General Election, Margaret Thatcher won a landslide victory over the hapless Michael Foot, but at West Primary it was a different story. ‘I got no votes – and I didn’t even vote for myself!’ Why not? ‘I was indoctrinated by my parents and didn’t believe in it.’ Truss’s mother and father were dyed-in-the-wool Lefties who took her on Ban The Bomb marches and had her singing anti-Thatcher songs. They even helped write her classroom address. Perhaps that is why her classmates were unconvinced. By the time she was a teenager, Truss decided her parents were wrong about Maggie. ‘I just had this – it’s hard to analyse it going back… but I always had this fascination with her,’ she says, as we chat during our interview in her Whitehall office. ‘I just thought there was something interesting about what she was doing. There was a lot of negativity about Britain’s future, the Left were very pro-Europe and anti-American. I was fascinated by America and thought, “Actually, this country doesn’t sound that bad”.’ Truss’s appointment as Environment Secretary in July marked a meteoric rise for the 39-year-old mother of two. After primary school in Scotland she went to a comprehensive in Leeds – her accent is more Yorkshire than Yah. Brainbox Truss got two, not one maths A-levels. An Oxford degree and career as an oil industry economist followed. In 2010, she finally won an election on a Thatcherite platform, becoming MP for Norfolk North West. Just four years later, she inherited the Environment post when Owen Paterson was sacked by David Cameron. Huntin’-shootin’-and-fishin’ Tory reactionary Paterson thought Truss, with her Laura Ashley hues and trendy ‘Cameroon’ friends, was better suited to pink designer Hunter boots worn by yummy-mummies than green ones worn by proper country folk. Yet anyone who thought she would call off his crusade against eco-warriors may be proved wrong, as she showed by using our interview to announce a crackdown on ugly solar farms. I carry out a mini eco audit of Ms Truss. ‘We have eco light bulbs and I’m very frugal,’ she says, lowering her voice and leaning forward to stress each vowel, evoking another frugal blonde Tory who outraged the Left by saying she hoarded baked beans in her kitchen cupboard. Her appointment as Environment Secretary in July marked a meteoric rise for the 39-year-old mother of two . I don’t mention her name, Thatcher. There’s no need. ‘We have lots of roadside stands in Norfolk where you can just pick up vegetables that people have grown in their garden and put the money in a pot.’ I’m not sure I want to get her started on turnips! (When Truss was selected as a Parliamentary candidate, the less than progressive squirearchy of Norfolk got into a prurient stew over a brief extramarital fling she had had – prompting headlines about the ‘Turnip Taliban’.) ‘Turnips are a very tasty option,’ she chuckles, though it was no laughing matter at the time. Truss is now happily settled with husband Hugh and their two daughters, aged eight and five. Never mind buying vegetables, does townie Truss, who constantly tells farmers to grow more fruit and veg, get her manicured fingers dirty and practise what she preaches? ‘I keep the water butt full, we’ve grown tomatoes, runner beans, raspberries, cherries, I’ve put two gooseberry bushes in and planted two apple trees in the garden.’ What about her work-life balance? Did she read her daughters a bedtime story last night? ‘I did actually, Hilaire Belloc’s Cautionary Tales.’ Not exactly The Gruffalo. Belloc was a moralising early 20th Century writer, politician and devout Catholic who warned about the threat posed by Islam. ‘Remember to hang on to nurse, for fear of finding something worse,’ says Truss, trotting out the best known line. Doubtless it was a Maggie favourite too. Eyeing my frown, Truss says: ‘My daughter loves bloodthirsty stories. My other daughter is obsessed with The Great British Bake Off and made croissants for breakfast.’ Truss’s friend and Cabinet ally Michael Gove is fond of saying she will be the Tories’ second female leader. Truss bats it away. ‘I just want to get things done. David Cameron is going to be the Prime Minister for a long time.’ And after that? ‘I’m just enjoying doing what I’m doing, Simon,’ she says with a smile.","Handouts to fund massive solar farms are to be axed by Liz Truss .

"Demi Moore has announced she is ending her six year marriage to Ashton Kutcher. The 49-year-old actress said in a statement today that she is filing for divorce with 'great sadness and a heavy heart'. Hinting at Kutcher's infidelity, Demi said: 'As a woman, a mother . and a wife, there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it . is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life'. It's over: Demi Moore has filed for divorce from Ashton Kutcher, pictured together here at the January premiere of his movie No String Attached in Los Angeles . Moore added that it's a trying time for her and her family and asked for people to respect her privacy. Immediately after the announcement, 33-year-old Ashton posted his own statement on Twitter. He wrote: 'I will forever cherish the time I spent with Demi. 'Marriage is one of the most difficult things in the world and unfortunately sometimes they fail. Love and Light, AK.' The pair are still following each other on Twitter in wake of the announcement and Demi's handle remains @mrskutcher - something she may now consider changing. Despite their dignified statements, Demi is now gearing up to battle it out over their $290m fortune after enduring public humiliated because of his alleged infidelity. Showing the strain: Demi has looked shockingly skinny in recent months as the break down of her marriage took its toll, pictured earlier this month, and Kutcher seen today leaving his trailer on the set of Two And A Half Men in Los Angeles in wake of the news . Message . to fans: Ashton released his own statement on Twitter following Demi's . announcement, saying he will always cherish the time they had together . Moore and Kutcher wed in . September 2005. The couple's relationship hit the headlines in recent months as rumours swirled about Kutcher's alleged infidelity. The Two And A Half Men star allegedly . shared a night of passion with party girl Sara Leal, 22, at the Hard . Rock Hotel in San Diego. Texas-born . Leal sold her story on Kutcher weeks after the fling, which took place . on Ashton and Demi's sixth wedding anniversary, September 24. Party girl: Kutcher allegedly had a fling with Texas-born Sara Leal, right, on his sixth wedding anniversary to Demi in September . Leal relived the sordid details of . the night - including how they had unprotected sex - detailing that she had cavorted naked with Kutcher and a gaggle of . girls in a hot tub in the luxurious hotel suite. She claimed Kutcher told her he was separated from Demi before the Two And A . Half Men star tried to persuade her to have a threesome along with her best friend . Marta Borzuchowski - but in the end he settled for a two-hour romp with . her. Speaking of the fling, she told The Sun: 'We had sex twice. Everything felt natural. We were having a good time. He was good, but it . wasn't weird or perverted or creepy. 'He had good endurance. We were up for a while. It was about two hours.' In the weeks after the story broke, Kutcher and Moore made apparent attempts to heal their relationship with Kabbalah retreats, including a camping trip to Cachuma Lake near Santa Barbara, California, last month. The couple were accompanied by some close friends along with their Kabbalah instructor Yehuda Berg and photos emerged of the pair sat around an outdoor fire. It was first time they were pictured together since news of Kutcher's alleged booze-fuelled one-night stand broke. In the weeks that followed, Demi appeared to be suffering under the strain of her marriage breakdown, becoming gaunt and scarily skinny - reportedly dropping down to just 7st (98lbs) which given her height of 5ft 5in is considerably underweight. The Leal affair was not the first time Kutcher has been accused of being unfaithful to Demi. Kutcher was first accused of  infidelity in September last year, when Brittney Jones, 21, said she had sex with the actor at the Beverly Hills home he once shared with his wife while she was away. She also later claimed that Kutcher told her he had an open relationship with Demi and they would 'often engage in threesomes'. Scene . of the 'crime': Kutcher was said to have cavorted naked with Leal in the . hot tub of the Hard Rock Hotel in San Diego before bedding her . Jones told Star: 'He looked over our . texts and said he wanted me to delete all the messages from him. He then . told me he wanted me to delete the texts I had sent to him. He said . they could hurt him.' At the time, the couple, who are worth  an estimated £95million, brushed off the allegations. Kutcher, who took over Charlie . Sheen’s role in hit U.S. TV series Two And A Half Men earlier this year, . wrote on Twitter at the time: 'I think Star magazine calling me a . ""cheater"" qualifies as defamation of character. I hope my lawyer . agrees.' He added: 'Star magazine – you don’t get to stand behind ""freedom of the press"" when you are writing fiction.' Kutcher’s spokesman also denied the allegation while Miss Moore tweeted ‘Excellent point my love!’ Campfire summit: Demi and Ashton met with Kabbalah counsellors last month in an apparent bid to heal their . relationship . Escape: They visited Cachuma Lake in Santa Barbara, California for the retreat . Moore, who was previously married to Bruce Willis, started dating Kutcher in 2003. They married two years later. In May last year Demi talked about wanting to start a family with Kutcher in an interview with Elle magazine - something that never came to pass. The actress has three daughter with her ex Willis - Rumer, 23, Scout, 20, and Tallulah 17. She . has maintained a friendly relationship with the Die Hard star - even attending . his wedding to underwear model Emma Heming in 2009. By the same token, . Willis came to Demi and Ashton's wedding four years earlier. Moore and Willis married in 1987 before divorcing 13 years later in 2000. At the time of the split, Willis said: 'I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.' Moore, who starred alongside Patrick Swayze in the 1990 movie Ghost, was first married to singer Freddy Moore. They got hitched when she was aged 18 in 1980 and the relationship lasted four years. She still goes by his last name. Happy families: Ashton and Demi pictured in 2008 with her ex-husband Bruce Willis, his wife Emma Heming and her family, along with Rumer, Tallulah and Scout - Demi and Bruce's three daughters . For Ashton - who is 16 years Demi's junior - Moore was his first wife. He previously had relationships with the late Brittany Murphy and Mad Men's January Jones. Today's news tops off a bad run for Ashton, who last week was at the centre of a Twitter fallout after posting messages of support for Pennsylvania . State University football coach Joe Paterno. Paterno, Penn State head coach for 46 years, had been fired for . allegedly covering up sexual abuse by the school's former football . defence coordinator Jerry Sandusky. Kutcher responded to the news by tweeting: 'How do . you fire Jo Pa? #insult #noclass as a hawkeye [the University of Iowa . football team] fan I find it in poor taste.' But his remarks cause a furious backlash - forcing Kutcher to admit he didn't have the full facts when he posted the message. He then handed the control of his Twitter feed over to his management team at  Katalyst Media to 'ensure the quality of its content'.

"British singer James Blunt has said he wants to become a Swiss citizen after living in the tax-friendly country for the past five years. 'As soon as the authorities will let me, because I don’t know if I’ve been here a sufficiently long time, I would like to become Swiss,' he told a Swiss newspaper recently. 'Verbier is my home,' said the 38-year-old multi-millionaire, who bought a chalet in the ski resort in 2005. Singer, songwriter, skier, foodie: James Blunt wants to become a permanent citizen of tax-friendly Switzerland because he 'loves skiing and good food' Singer, songwriter, skier, foodie: James Blunt wants to become a permanent citizen of tax-friendly Switzerland because he 'loves skiing and good food.' He made a guest appearance in town on Saturday.  He opened a restaurant called The Cow, according to Swiss media. Blunt said opening the restaurant - nearly 9,000 feet up a mountain with stunning views - was a dream come true. 'I love skiing and good food,' he said, adding: 'I am a horrible cook'. Former British army officer Blunt, who once headed up the Household Cavalry alpine ski team in Verbier, is a man with snow in his veins. He became a champion skier of the army's  Royal Armoured Corps. Blunt has mooted a career break in the past.  He rocketed to stardom in . 2005 with his Back to Bedlam album and, since there, his other works have sold over 18 million copies worldwide.

It might take his mind off ugly rumours that surfaced in the UK last month linking him to a tax scandal, insisting attempts to question his contribution to the nation's finances are a 'witch-hunt'. The You're Beautiful star hit headlines when it emerged his name was on a leaked list of HSBC bank customers with an offshore account on the Channel Island of Jersey. The list, which also contains the identities of several other high-profile Brits, has sparked a tax probe by officials at Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, but Blunt is adamant his banking practices are legitimate and insists he pays his fair share into the UK's public purse. In a post on Twitter.com, the singer wrote; 'I have an account at HSBC Jersey which has always been declared to HMRC, and I pay my taxes.

"The mother of a five-year-old girl paralyzed by the enterovirus has spoken out about the hell of watching her young daughter battle  the deadly illness. Kinley Galbreath, from Hamilton, has spent the past three weeks in intensive care at Children's of Alabama, where she remains on a ventilator paralyzed from her arms to her legs. Her mom Kim Nichols has remained by Kinley's side since the little girl was admitted to hospital and  diagnosed with the potentially fatal respiratory illness enterovirus D-68 . Five-year-old Kinley Galbreath, from Hamilton, has spent the past three weeks in intensive care at Children's of Alabama, where she remains on a ventilator paralyzed from her arms to her legs . Speaking exclusively to ABC 3340, the mother said: 'As she was getting ready to doze off, she said 'mommy, my hands are going numb' and by that point she started to lose movement in her neck. 'On the third day is when she lost movement from her legs down,' Ms Nichols added. 'The only thing she's had control of has been her toes. And that's what she wiggles to let me know something's wrong. And she'll blink her eyes for yes, and won't blink her eyes for no.' Ms Nichols explained that her daughter had a mild form of asthma prior to being diagnosed with the virus. Children with respiratory issues are more likely to suffer complications with enterovirus. 'A lot of people thought it was more of a common cold, she said. 'And they didn't realized that it had totally paralyzed Kinley.' Kinley, who turns six in two weeks, was so weakened by the paralysis that she needed a tracheotomy, just so she could breathe. Kinley's mother Kim Nichols explained that her daughter had a mild form of asthma prior to being diagnosed with the virus. Children with respiratory issues are more likely to suffer complications with enterovirus . Ms Nichols has remained by her daughter's side since the little girl was admitted to hospital and diagnosed with the potentially fatal respiratory illness enterovirus D-68 . 'She has lost all of the muscles in her diaphragm to push any sound up to talk,' her mom said. 'Today, she's really frustrated, because she started moving her lips and I can't understand what she's saying. She's continuously crying because I can't understand her.' Dr Jayne Ness, a pediatric neurologist at Children's of Alabama, said that although Kinley tested positive for the virus they cannot be sure that it is connected to the paralysis. 'Right now we know that, for example, in Kinley's case, she's tested positive for the virus,' she said. 'But, we can't prove right now, for sure, that the virus is the cause of the inflammation of her spinal cord.' Kinley was a happy, healthy little girl before she was struck down by the deadly illness three weeks ago . The doctor said she is hopeful that Kinley will recover but it will take time. 'I think a long, slow rehabilitation,' she said. 'But, based on what I'm hearing in other parts of the country, based on what we are seeing from other kids, is that there will be a recovery.' Ms Nichols has been using Facebook to provide updates to Kinley's condition and a page titled Praying for Healing for Kinley has received nearly 8,000 likes. She said: 'I'm usually a very private person, but it was so overwhelming with the output of support from my community. We are from a small town. But they've all got hearts of gold.' Ms Nichols has been using Facebook to provide updates to Kinley's condition and a page titled Praying for Healing for Kinley has received nearly 8,000 likes . Kinley's doctor said she is hopeful that that the little girl will recover but she added that it will take time . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said four people with enterovirus have died nationwide, although it is not yet clear what role it played in their deaths. In total, 628 people from 44 states and the District of Columbia have been affected, the CDC said. The majority of the cases are believed to be children. Only Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Hawaii and Alaska have not seen any cases. The illness has flu and cold-like symptoms and can cause difficulty breathing for infants and young children, officials have said. The disease can spread through droplets in coughs or sneezes or when someone touches a contaminated surface, such as a countertop or doorknob, according to the Florida Department of Health. Four-year-old Eli Waller, left, died last month from the illness in New Jersey, while 10-year-old Emily Ortando also had it when she passed away in September. She had a bacterial infection at the same time as the illness . Officials said the best way to prevent the disease spreading is by keeping good hygiene such as washing hands and disinfecting surfaces.' Those having cold-like or flu-like symptoms should stay home from child care centers, school or work and, if possible, remain apart from other family members,' said Dr Celeste Philip, deputy secretary for health, the Orlando Sentinel reported. One of those who died was four-year-old Eli Waller, who succumbed to the illness last month, according to the Mercer County Medical Examiner's Office in New Jersey. Eli was asymptomatic before his death and the onset of his illness was rapid, according to Hamilton Township Health Officer Jeff Plunkett said. The youngster had stayed home from preschool on September 24 with a case pink eye that the medical examiner found to be unrelated to the virus. That night, he died in his sleep. Emily Otrando, a 10-year-old from Cumberland, Rhode Island, died September 22 at Hasbro Children's Hospital and was known to have the illness. A ribbon and a sign at Yardville Elementary School in Hamilton Township honor little Eli who died from the virus . Enteroviruses, which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold, aren't unusual and peak usually in September into fall. They usually resemble a bad cold, but this particular strain has become worrisome for parents across the US after a number of fatalities among children . What is proving so worrisome about this particular strain? ED-D68 was first identified in the 1960s and is uncommon, but has been cropping up in recent years in Georgia, Pennsylvania and abroad in Japan and the Netherlands. However, the bottom line is that experts cannot explain why it is has flared so dramatically this year. They also cannot explain why it is proving so virulent. Signs and symptoms . ED-D68 begins as a cold, with coughing, fever and wheezing. The virus can cause breathing difficulties but most recover well after a week. How serious is it? While experts have said that in theory some cases can become so severe they result in death, many of the EV-D68 infections 'will be mild and self-limited, requiring only symptomatic treatment,' according to the Missouri health agency said. How can infection be prevented? This particular enterovirus is spread through bodily contact. Making children far more susceptible. Health officials have said there is not much that can be done about it other than washing hands with soap and disinfecting surfaces. There's no vaccine for EV-D68 . The Rhode Island child's death was the result of a bacterial infection, Staphylococcus aureus, that hit the girl in tandem with the virus, Rhode Island officials said in a statement. This enterovirus germ is not new. It was first identified in 1962 and has caused clusters of illness before. Because it's not routinely tested for, it may have spread widely in previous years without being identified in people who just seemed to have a cold. This year, the virus has gotten more attention because it has been linked to hundreds of severe illnesses. Beginning last month, hospitals in Kansas City, Missouri, and Chicago received a flood of children with trouble breathing. Some needed oxygen or more extreme care such as a breathing machine. Many, but not all, had asthma before the infection. Health officials say they have not detected a recent mutation or other change in the virus that would cause it to become more dangerous.","Kinley Galbreath, from Hamilton, is in intensive care at Children's of Alabama .

"The winter weather that is battering much of the country left a women's college basketball team stranded on the sidelines - of the Alabama interstate. Players from the Middle Georgia State College women's basketball team were traveling by bus from Macon, Georgia, to their game against Martin Methodist College in Pulaski, Tennessee, yesterday. Icy conditions brought traffic to a standstill on Interstate 65 near Huntsville Browns Ferry Road in Athens, Alabama, and the bus driver decided it wasn't safe enough to continue. Scroll down for video . Officers from Athens Police Department brought the Middle Georgia State College women's basketball team to their hotel last night after the team got stranded on Interstate 65 near Huntsville Browns Ferry Road in  Alabama . Things were so backed up last night on Interstate 65 (pictured), the team tried to walk three miles to their hotel . Northbound traffic on Interstate 65 was still bumper to bumper today, but the team did make it to the game . Instead of waiting around for things to improve, the Knights decided to start walking to their hotel three miles away. The team had already gone more than two miles when officers from the Athens Police Department found the Knights shortly after midnight and drove them the rest of the way to the Hampton Inn. Middle Georgia State's game with Martin Methodist was scheduled for 2pm today.

It initially looked like the Knights were't going to make it for tip-off, but they did arrive on time.

"Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski and Arjen Robben struck twice as the champions annihilated promoted Paderborn 6-0 on Saturday to open up an 11-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Poland international Lewandowski, who has yet to deliver the goal flush expected from him when he joined from rivals Borussia Dortmund this season, has not been an automatic starter. Coach Pep Guardiola publicly backed the striker on Friday, saying he was not always playing merely because of different systems.

Lewandowski, who was a late substitute in the goalless draw against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League this week, paid back the trust when he plucked a superb flick from Robben to fire Bayern ahead in the 24th minute. Then, in true centre forward fashion, he tapped in a Franck Ribery cutback 13 minutes later. Paderborn's fate was sealed when Florian Hartherz was sent off on the hour and Robben converted the penalty. Ribery also got on the scoresheet along with Mitchell Weiser before Robben notched his 16th goal of the campaign to equal his best season tally at Bayern and climb to the top of the scorers list.

"Captured: U.S. officials have confirmed the capture of Anas al-Libi, his family said he was captured from in front of his home by armed commandos . Though they seeked to achieve two very similar objectives - the killing or capture of high-ranking terrorists, the different approaches taken in the two Saturday raids illustrate the versatility of Special Operations commandos. The Somali operation, a raid on a highly-fortified terrorist bunker on the coast south of Mogadishu, used water and darkness to its advantage – but the Tripoli, Libya raid took advantage of the natural barriers provided by cornering the target in his gated community while parking a car. The Libyan target, senior al-Qaeda member Anas al-Libi, was quickly captured without a single shot being fired. Officials are unsure if the Somali target, a high-ranking al-Shabaab member, was killed in a fierce firefight that ended when Navy SEALS retreated. Accused of plotting the coordinated twin 1998 bombings of United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed over 200 and injured well over 1,000 people, Anas al-Libi, 49, was captured rather simply, according to family members. The wanted man was parking his car outside his family’s home in a gated community in Tripoli after morning prayers when three cars filled with armed commandos encircled him, said his sister-in-law. They jumped out, smashed his window and took his weapon within seconds. Anas al-Libi was then extracted from the car and taken with the Special Forces soldiers as they fled the neighborhood, she explained. First said to be armed foreign commandos by the frightened woman, US officials later confirmed Anas al-Libi’s capture. The Libyan government was aware of the raid in advance. No special vehicles were used in the capture, a stark contrast to the Somali raid. Coming ashore in boats under cloak of darkness, Navy SEALS quietly advanced up the beach towards a home in Baraawe, about 150 miles south of the Somali capital city Mogadishu. Scroll down for video . An air of uncertainty: An al-Shabaab spokesperson confirmed a terrorist was killed during the raid but would not say who. Above, a stock image of Navy SEALs . The beachfront home is known to house high-level terrorists and was notably the most-recent known address of Ahmed Abdi Godane, an al-Shabaab leader who claimed responsibility for last month’s Westgate Mall terror attack in Nairobi, Kenya. Using silencers, the SEALS opened fire on the beach house exactly two weeks to the day the Westgate Mall siege began. It is not clear how many SEALS were involved in the dramatic raid, but they were soon engaged by the terrorists in a loud firefight that startled neighbors and forced the withdrawal of the American commandos. Witnesses said 12 al-Shabaab militants were in the home at the time of the attack, likely staying before deploying to a mission abroad. Somali government officials said one person died in the attack, local police claimed seven men were killed, according to Reuters. Off the boat: The SEAL team attacked a beachfront house in the coastal town of Baraawe, which was the last known home of the leader of al Shabaab . 'We were awoken by heavy gunfire last night, we thought an al Shabaab base at the beach was captured,' Sumira Nur, a mother of four, told Reuters. Mr Nur also heard shells, but was not sure where they landed, she said. Aware of the assault in advance, a Somalian government official said several ‘high-profile’ foreigners were targets of the SEALS. One enemy combatant died, a spokesperson for the terror group said. There were no American casualties, according to US officials. 'Westerners in boats attacked our base at Baraawe beach and one was martyred from our side,” an al-Shabaab spokesman told Reuters. 'No planes or helicopters took part in the fight. The attackers left weapons, medicine and stains of blood, we chased them.' US officials have been unable to confirm the death or the identity of the wanted terrorist. The Westgate Mall siege lasted three days and resulted in the deaths of 69 people.","The Libyan raid was carried out in broad daylight, not a single shot fired .

"Louis van Gaal rained on Swansea’s parade, telling the Welsh side they did not deserve to beat Manchester United 2-1. The United boss was fuming after his side suffered only their second defeat in 20 games in all competitions, falling to goals from Ki Sung-Yueng and Bafetimbi Gomis after Ander Herrera had put the visitors ahead in the first half. He said: ‘We created a chance every two minutes in the second half and they had one chance. Louis van Gaal (centre) was fuming after Manchester United suffered only their second defeat in 20 games . ‘In the first minute of the second half Swansea had a good chance and after we were dominating the game. We were not effective. In one counter they a shot (from Jonjo Shelvey) deflected and maybe also Gomis is in an offside position. So we are not happy and not lucky.’ There was a whiff of sour grapes about Van Gaal’s review of a game in which Swansea actually had more shots on goal - six to United’s three. Van Gaal added: ‘We dominated the game even with 10 men because Robin van Persie could not run anymore because of an injury (after United had made their last substitution). United goalkeeper David de Gea dives in vain to try as Ki Sung-Yueng scores the equaliser for Swansea . Jonjo Shelvey's long range shot was deflected off Bafetimbi Gomis' head for Swansea's winner . ‘It is always frustrating when you lose after dominating a team. Your disappointment is much bigger because of that. ‘It's amazing we have lost. But you do lose games. We have only lost to Southampton (since November) and when that happens we have to continue. We were the better team. But against Burnley we were not, so it's the benefit of football that the result is unpredictable. But for us it's very disappointing.’ Swansea manager Garry Monk, who has now done the double over United this season, was bemused by Van Gaal’s reaction. He said: ‘I'd rather be lucky than good. Yes we had to ride some pressure, but all their pressure amounted to one shot. We got a fantastic goal and probably could have got a third. ‘It’s the first time in the club's history (double over United). I told players before game anything in terms of creating history is worth fighting for. To be able to do the double everyone connected to club should be proud of it.'

"A Minnesota toddler who has been on dialysis since she was an infant is about to receive the gift of a new kidney thanks to a complete stranger 1,500 miles away. Two-year-old Arianna Moore of Pine City was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder when she was born, and has since had to spend 10 hours of every day hooked up to a dialysis machine. But that may soon change thanks to the generosity of 37-year-old Jacksonville, Florida mother Christy Harding, who was touched to donate her own kidney after reading a Facebook post about Arianna. What a gift: Arianna Moore of Pine City, Minnesota will soon be getting a new kidney thanks to a stranger organ donor who read about the 2-year-old on Facebook . Helping out: 37-year-old Jacksonville, Florida mother Christy Harding read about little Arianna's plight and decided to see if she was eligible to donate her own kidney to the toddler . Arianna seemed a healthy baby when she was born two years ago along with her twin sister, Nevaeh. But just seven weeks later, the infant's kidneys failed taking her family by surprise. 'When I had her and they said, ""Her kidneys don't work,"" I was like, ""What do you mean? She's a baby."" She was completely healthy at birth,' mother Ashley Booth, 27, told KMSP. Since then, the little girl has spent most of her day on dialysis and the effects of the disorder had left her 10 pounds lighter, and 4 inches shorter, than her sister. Booth became desperate to find her daughter a donor, and while she wasn't optimistic about posting on Facebook - she figured she'd try her luck anyway. 'I had no faith that we'd find a kidney donor on Facebook but I sure as heck was going to try,' she told Good Morning America. But the post surprisingly turned out to be fruitful when Harding read it on her wall. 'One of my friends shared one of Arianna's pictures and it showed up on my timeline,' Harding said. 'For some reason, I stopped and started thinking about it, and I just knew I had to make a phone call.' Harding then contacted Arianna's hospital in Minneapolis to see if she was eligible, and after a few tests she figured out she was a perfect match. She says she was inspired to donate because she has a 2-year-old daughter herself, and would hope someone would perform the same act of kindness for her girl. Young ones: Arianna was born with a rare genetic disorder that causes scarring of the kidney, and her kidneys failed at just 7-weeks-old. Pictured as a baby on the left with her twin sister Nevaeh . Twin sisters: Disease and dialysis has caused Arianna (right) to experience stunted growth. She is 10 pounds lighter and 4 inches shorter than her twin sister (pictured left) Try anything: Arianna's mother Ashley Booth (pictured together on the left) says she wasn't optimistic posting on Facebook would find her daughter a donor, but it proved successful in the end . 'Christy emailed me to let me know she was the one donating. I was in tears reading her email to me,' Booth said. 'It was pretty crazy. All I can do is cry every time I think about it.' Now the 2-year-old and her stranger guardian angel are set to undergo surgery on May 7 in Minneapolis. And that's not the only gift Harding is giving the Arianna. She has since set up a Go Fund Me page to raise money to send Arianna and her family to Disney World in Florida - a favorite vacation spot for the Harding family, who have season tickets. 'It's so amazing. We haven't even met her yet. I cannot wait for next Monday. I don't know if I'll be able to let go of her once I hug her,' Booth said. Harding, pictured with her family above, says she was inspired to donate because she has a 2-year-old daughter herself .","Arianna Moore's kidneys failed when she was just 7-weeks-old .

"Crystal Palace defender Scott Dann has heaped praise on in-form winger Yannick Bolasie, claiming that there is 'no-one who can stop him when he's on form'. Bolasie has only scored one goal this season, away at Everton in September, but despite his lack of potency in front of goal, his scintillating performances on the Eagles' wing have seen him receive widespread acclaim.Â . The 25-year-old is quick to admit his desire to score more goals, and teammate Dann believes that if he can add that to his game, the DR Congo international is on to a winner. Yannick Bolasie (left) shoots at goal under pressure from Aston Villa defender Aly Cissokho at Selhurst Park . The 25-year-old DR Congo international has received widespread praise for his impressive performances . 'If he can start doing that [scoring goals], we have got a great player on our hands,' Dann told the Croydon Advertiser. 'When he is in that type of form [against Spurs] he is unstoppable. I do not care who he plays against, there is no-one who can stop him in that kind of form.' Bolasie's pace and trickery on the wing has earned him a regular starting berth in the Palace team and, despite signing a new three-year deal in the summer, he has been promised a further improvement to his contract if he continues playing well. Palace earned a credible 0-0 draw away at Tottenham on Saturday, with Bolasie the main threat in the Eagles' attack. In fact, Neil Warnock's side were unlucky not to leave White Hart Lane with all three points, as they pushed for a winner in the latter stages of the game. Neil Warnock will be dealt a blow when both Bolasie and captain Mile Jedinak leave on international duty . Bolasie (right) is in the DR Congo squad for the Africa Cup of Nations and will leave in January . In January, Palace will be dealt a blow when Bolasie - as well as captain Mile Jedinak - leave on international duty for their respective countries. Bolasie is in DR Congo's squad for the Africa Cup of Nations, while Jedinak will lead Australia out on home soil in the Asia Cup. Dann admits that losing Bolasie will be a blow for the team as they strive for safety in the Premier League. 'The way he is playing, he would be a loss to any team. He is obviously a big loss but we have got people there who will fill in. Scott Dann (left) joined Palace in the summer and has been impressed by Bolasie since his arrival .

"You are either going to love it or hate it. A new Marmite cupcake has been developed which marries the extreme saltiness of the sticky, dark brown paste with the sweetness of caramel and chocolate.

The . cupcake has a chocolate sponge, salted Marmite caramel centre and is . topped with rich Marmite buttercream and chocolate ganache. It . is difficult to imagine a more unlikely combination, for Marmite is . known for an extreme and overpowering flavour, generated from yeast . extract, which is a by-product of beer brewing. So . intense is the flavour and the reaction it generates that the makers . Unilever have played this up with the advertising slogan ‘Love it or . hate it’. The . product that was to become Marmite was invented in the late 19th . century when German scientist Justus von Liebig discovered that brewer's . yeast could be concentrated, bottled and eaten. The luxury treat, which costs £2.75, has been created by bakers at the London company Lola's cupcakes . In 1902 the Marmite Food Extract Company was formed in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, w n mhile the name came from the French word to describe a large, covered earthenware or metal cooking pot. The product, which was made from yeast supplied by the Bass brewery, became so popular that a second factory was opened in Camberwell Green, London, in 1907. In the early 1900s it was revered as a health food because it is rich in B vitamins and was issued to British troops in World War I as part of their rations to stave off conditions such as beriberi, which left them feeling weak and sick.

Asher Budwig, the managing director of Lola’s Cupcakes, said: ‘I’m always searching for ways to create innovative, exciting cupcakes with unusual ingredients.

We expect it to divide the nation’s opinion and can’t wait to hear people’s thoughts.’ It will be stocked in Lola stores in Selfridges, Topshop Oxford Circus, Covent Garden, Brent Cross, Bluewater, Kings Cross Station and at the chain’s flagship store in Mayfair for four weeks. s.poulter@dailymail.co.uk .","The cupcake has a chocolate sponge, salted Marmite caramel centre .

"A growing numbers of teenagers in search of Internet fame are risking their lives by performing dangerous stunts in the New York City subway in what has become an alarming online trend. YouTube is filled with clips of mostly men in their teens and early 20s jumping across the tracks, playing chicken with trains or 'surfing' on moving trains. The growing number of recordings and images posted online showing the underground acts of daring has left New York City officials calling for a crackdown on thrill-seekers. Scroll down for video . Easy rider: The young man shown in this viral YouTube video 'surfing' a New York City subway is only one of a large community of thrill-seekers who perform risky stunts underground . Leap of faith: One of the most popular feats among teenage daredevils is jumping across the subway tracks . Call for action: Manhattan Borough President Stringer has called on the MTA to crack down on people bent on putting their lives at risk and threatening the safety of others . 'This game should be an embarrassment to New Yorkers. I don’t think we should let it go. I think we should prosecute people who do this because they are putting other people in harm’s way,' Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer told CBS 2. Stringer said he wants the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to take steps to prevent teens from risking their lives and the lives of straphangers. In a statement, the transportation agency overseeing the sprawling New York City subway system has called the stunts 'exceedingly stupid' and 'extremely dangerous,' urging the public: 'Don’t do it.' There were 55 subway-related deaths in New York City last year and more than a dozen so far this year. Game of chicken: YouTube is filled with videos showing people jumping on the tracks for a death-defying stroll just moments before a train arrives . One of those who perished underground was Liam Armstrong, who was struck and killed by a No. 2 train in March as he tried to run across the tracks as a dare on his 18th birthday. Liam and two friends had mistakenly boarded a northbound No. 1 train while trying to get to Greenwich Village and got off at 79th Street when they realized their mistake. But instead of crossing to the southbound side above ground, they dared each other to run across the tracks. One friend successfully reached the other side and another had yet to cross when Liam was struck as the train barreled into the station. As a result, the teen’s leg was severed and he succumbed to severe head injuries.

The . candidacies ended weeks of speculation over who will aspire to replace . President Hamid Karzai, who has essentially run the country since the . October 7, 2001 invasion that ousted the Taliban. Karzai is not entitled to . run for a third consecutive term, but is . expected to back at least one of the candidates - his former Foreign . Minister Zalmai Rassoul, despite the fact that his businessman brother . Qayyum Karzai is also running for president. The . contenders are a mix of Afghanistan's past and current power players, . including some warlords with a tainted history, a couple of technocrats . and some complete political outsiders. All . the candidates have tried to shape tickets that attempt to unify an . ethnically fractious political scene marked by patronage and alliances . among the elite - a group who . can marshal votes among the country's various ethnic groups. The . population of 31 million is roughly 42 percent Pashtun, 27 percent . Tajik, nine per cent Hazara, and nine per cent Uzbek along with other, smaller . factions. The Taliban are predominantly Pashtun. Candidates . declare tickets that include two vice presidents and will be reviewed . by the Independent Electoral Commission before final approval on Novemver . 11. To run, candidates must have at least 100,000 signatures from all 34 . of Afghanistan's provinces. By the end of . the day and after a mad scramble by candidates and hundreds of . supporters and heavily armed bodyguards, about 20 presidential . candidates had registered for the first independent vote organized by . Afghanistan without direct foreign assistance. Top . contenders include former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah, who was . the runner up to President Hamid Karzai in the 2009 elections and . dropped out just ahead of a runoff vote following allegations of massive . fraud in the first round. Out of the race: Afghan President Hamid Karzai is not allowed to run for a third consecutive term . Ashraf . Ghani, a Pashtun former finance minister who oversaw the transition of . security from foreign forces to the Afghan army and police. He weighed . in with support from two of Afghanistan's ethnic groups. His choices for . vice president are Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, a former warlord who is . thought to control the majority of the Uzbek vote and Sarwar Danish, a . former justice minister who has the support of former Hazara warlord and . vice president Mohammad Karim Khalili. Ghani ran and lost in the 2009 . elections. Two former . Afghan warlords are sharing a ticket, one for president, the other for . vice president. They are Abdul Rab Rasoul Sayyaf, an influential Pashtun . lawmaker and religious scholar, who is running for president along with . former energy and water minister Ismail Khan, a Tajik. Rassoul, . a Pashtun, is running with Ahmad Zia Massoud, the brother of Ahmad Shah . Massoud, the Northern Alliance commander killed in an al-Qaida suicide . bombing two days before Sept. 11, 2001. Habiba Sarabi, a Hazara who was . governor of Bamyan province and is one of five women vice presidential . candidates, fills out the ticket. Karzai's . brother is also running with Wahidullah Shahrani, an Uzbek who was . minister of mines, and Abrahim Qasimi, who was a Hazara member of . parliament. The . registration came on the eve of the 12th anniversary of the invasion, . which led to an insurgency that shows no signs of abatement and a war . that has become largely forgotten in the United States and among its . coalition allies, despite continued casualties suffered by their forces . on the ground. Billions . of dollars in funds pledged to Afghanistan are tied to the government's . holding transparent and credible elections, a challenge in a country . rife with patronage and corruption and a resilient Taliban insurgency. The Taliban have asked people not to vote and do not recognize the . election process.","Four U.S. soldiers killed by bomb in Afghanistan .

"Bernard Holmes, an English Defence League commander has been jailed for leading a mob of EDL members to the house of a Muslim MEP . A ‘commander’ in the English Defence League who led a mob of 40 people to barricade the home of Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim has been jailed for 18 months. Bernard Holmes, 28, was arrested after members of far right group converged on the property of Mr Karim whilst his wife and two young children were at home. Claiming they wanted to deliver a letter, invaded the politician’s driveway and were said to have behaving in an ‘intimidating, threatening manner’ and shouting abuse whilst holding up placards from the EDL. Police were called to the house in Burnley but were too late as the mob had already moved on to carry out a string of ‘flash demonstrations’ in Blackburn and nearby towns led by Holmes. This is not the first time Mr Karim has experienced harassment from far-right groups like the EDL: In 2010, Mr Karim said he was forced to hire a private security firm for round the clock protection due to threats. Mr Karim, MEP for North West, said he believed he was targeted for religious reasons because the EDL have an ‘anti-Islamic agenda’. Mr Holmes, who goes under the nickname ‘Mr B’ is the EDL Blackburn division’s ‘commander’ and led the operation on July 2 last year. Holmes, from Blackburn pleaded guilty . to racially aggravated public order offences and was also given a five . year CRASBO on top of his 18 month prison sentence at Preston Crown . Court today. The court . heard how the group gathered outside 41-year old Mr Karim’s house at . lunchtime in July last year to stage an anti-Islamic protest allegedly . regarding EU proposals on the labelling of Halal meat.

The . demonstrators carrying placards reportedly went into Mr Karim’s garden . and began shouting abuse at him, before peering through his windows and . filming his house . Mr Karim . was in the house with his wife, Zahida, and two children, 10-year-old . Bilal, and Rabia, eight, at the time of the protest. At . the time Mr Karim said: ‘It was very intimidating experience for us. They were all over my driveway and looking into my house. ‘I had my family in the house and it is just disgusting that they were able to do this. My daughter has been left petrified’ Mr . Karim, who defected from the Liberal Democrats in 2007, said the group . had gone to his house in Burnley, claiming that one member had wanted to . deliver a letter to him. MEP Sajjad Karim believes he was targeted for religious reasons as the EDL have 'anti-Islamic policies' The home of Conservative MEP Sajjad Karim in Burnley where around 40 EDL members, led by 'commander' Bernard Holmes, staged a protest . He said people normally used a stamp or arranged to deliver the letter to his parliamentary address. ‘That really was a pretence,’ he said. ‘Their intention was to intimidate, to cause fright to my family and that is why they went about things in the way they did.’ Holmes . had a history of violence and in 2010 was jailed for two years and four . months after he beat up a man outside a nightclub and left him brain . damaged. Mr Karim at Conservative HQ with David Cameron . After Mr Holmes and the group left Mr Karim's fighting broke out in nearby Brierfield town centre. Members of EDL attacked a 17-year-old called Azhar Iqbal and nearby a man was run down by an EDL supporter’s car. Three people were jailed . and seven others were given non custodial sentences for the events in Brierfield town centre. Two other people . failed to appear at court and warrants have been issued for their . arrest. It has been confirmed that Bernard Holmes was involved in the general violence but not in these specific events . Lawyers representing them insisted there was no pre-meditated plan to cause trouble in Brierfield. Supt Steve Pemberton of Lancashire said he was pleased with the convictions and the sentences imposed. ‘This . was a spontaneous incident on a busy Saturday afternoon which could . have been much more serious than it fortunately was had it not been for . the speedy police response and that of local community leaders who were . able to quell any subsequent rise in tensions.","The group barricaded Tory MEP Sajjad Karim's house, shouting abuse and holding EDL placards with Mr Karim, his wife and their two children still inside .

"Jose Mourinho claimed there is a 'campaign' against his Chelsea side and it seems the siege mentality at Stamford Bridge has been adopted by the club's official website. Following the 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge, Mourinho outlined the timing of several questionable decisions by referee Martin Atkinson which went against the Premier League leaders. 'I think there are four moments of the game where you can write the story of the game. Minute 30, minute 33, minute 43 and minute 69.I repeat for you, I make it easy for you. Minute 30, 33, 43 and 69. The game had four moments and don't ask me more questions because I don't answer,' the Portuguese passionately told Sky Sports.

Chelsea's site continued in a similar vein, outlining the incidents in detail: an unpunished challenge from Burnley's Ashley Barnes on Branislav Ivanovic; being denied two 'clear' penalties and a shocking Barnes'  challenge on Nemanja Matic - again unpunished - which led to the Serb's sending off. Following Match of the Day's analysis of the match, the website posted a lead article entitled: 'Match of the Day: Referee ' had a terrible game'. Chelsea saw their lead cut to five points following Manchester City's 5-0 rout of Newcastle and pundits Alan Shearer and Robbie Savage agreed with Mourinho and questioned the performance of Bradford official Atkinson.

'He [Barnes] should have been booked for the first challenge and that should have been a straight red for Ashley Barnes. Alan’s right, Matic is lucky he’s not out for six or seven months. Mourinho’s right, Chelsea were hard done by today,' Savage added. Speaking on Radio 5 Live, Chris Waddle appealed for common sense to be applied to Matic, who is set to miss next weekend's Capital One Cup final against Spurs.

"It is often said that a small act of daily kindness goes a long way. But one lucky Australian could not have expected that her good deeds would land her a multi-million dollar cheque. The next-door neighbour, who helped an elderly widow with her daily chores, was left with a ‘thank you’ gift of eight million pounds. Sydney widow Betty Harris, who died at . the age of 95, left her entire estate, worth $12.5 million (£8.18 . million) to her neighbour Beatrice Gray. Appreciative: Betty Harris died aged 95 in 2009 and chose to leave her Sydney estate worth $12.5 million (£8.18 million) to her neighbour Beatrice Gray, above, instead of her family . Mrs Gray showed kindness to Mrs Harris in . her later years in the wealthy harbourside suburb of Point Piper, buying her milk and bread and taking out her rubbish. Mrs Gray told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph today that she was ‘extremely grateful to Betty Harris,’ but declined to comment further. But Mrs Harris, widow of Keith Harris, a former horse breeder, spoke out strongly before her death against her relatives saying she wanted to leave her money to Mrs Gray and her husband because they were not expecting it and she trusted them. ‘The Grays would be surprised, while my family are waiting for me to die,’ she said. ‘I am determined that my relatives, after what they have put me through, will not get one cent.’ After the widow’s death a bitter legal battle erupted with Mrs Harris’ s niece challenging the gift in the New South Wales Supreme Court. The niece, Caralie Hart, claimed that a will leaving the estate to Mrs Gray, was invalid because Mrs Harris was deluded at the time. During one court hearing it was . revealed that Mrs Harris had no children and was largely estranged from . her nieces and nephews. She told hospital staff in 2005 that she had not . spoken to them for 13 years. Shortly . after changing her will in favour of Mrs Gray, Mrs Harris complained . that her niece and nephews ‘all want their bit of money.’ Inherited: Betty Harris left her multi-million dollar house in Point Piper, above, to her Mrs Gray . Exclusive: Point Piper, one of Australia's most expensive suburbs, pictured, where Mrs Gray and Harris were neighbours . The court was told that she complained her nephews were ‘a pretty pathetic lot’ and called another niece, Anne Nickolls , a bitch. Justice Richard White, ruling today that Mrs Gray - a wealthy Sydney University academic and barrister - was entitled to the estate, said there was no doubt that Mrs Harris had ‘some degree of cognitive impairment’ but she was still capable of signing a will. An earlier will, written in 1996, had left the entire estate to niece Mrs Hart, but then Mrs Harris revoked it after learning Mrs Hart wanted to put her in a nursing home and appoint a legal guardian to take control of her finances. Mrs Harris lost control of her money through a number of legal moves, resulting in her borrowing money from Mrs Gray. Mrs Gray and her husband helped Mrs Harris pay her bills, organise her car registration, replace light bulbs and wheel out her recycling bin. The neighbours also checked on Mrs Harris’s house to ensure she had not been robbed. Mrs Harris’s late husband Keith was not without controversy. Although he had made his fortune making radios and televisions, he was a former vice chairman of the Sydney Turf Club and a horse breeder. In 1987 he was jailed for conspiracy to bribe the NSW Corrective Services Minister, Rex Jackson, over a prisoners’ early release, a court was told.","Widow Betty Harris left entire estate to neighbour as a 'thank you gift'

"Martin Murray exhibited courage beyond the call of duty in Monte Carlo. The hard man from St Helens withstood a witching hour of agony to make history against the mightiest pound-for-pound boxer in the world. That almost suicidal refusal to sink into purgatory was not enough for Murray to finally win his world middleweight championship at his third time of trying. That persistence under crucifying fire – a mentality beyond the comprehension of most who never venture onto that roped scaffold – could not quite carry him to the honour of going the 12-round distance. The bloodied face of Martin Murray contorts as Gennady Golovkin connects with another barrage of brutal punches to rock the Briton . The relentless Golovkin did not give Murray a moment's respite and was forever on the front foot, landing blow after savage blow . Golovkin knocked Murray down to the canvas several times in the fight, but the St Helens man showed tremendous bravery to keep going . The baby-faced fighter from Kazakhstan made it 32 wins from 32 fights with another dazzling display to showcase his incredible talents . Murray is forced back on to the ropes as Golovkin unleashes another savage right-hander to rock the St Helens fighter back on his heels . Murray cowers in the corner as Golovkin unleashes an unstoppable barrage of punches in the 11th to put Murray on the back foot . Referee Luis Pabon darts between the two fighters to put a merciful end to Murray's bravery with Golovkin keeping his 100 per cent record . Pabon puts his arm around Murray as the bloodied Briton reflects on a brave performance in the Principality . But it did give our reformed ex-prisoner the distinction of taking Gennady Golovkin the furthest he has ever been in his 32 fights of terrifying destructive power, to the agony of the 11th. The Kazakh wrecking ball had not been past eight rounds in 18 fights in the past six years and only once as far as the tenth in this entire career which now contains 29 knock-outs, the highest stoppage percentage in the annals of the classic middleweight division. For that Mr Murray was applauded from the ring within an opulent ballroom in this Disneyland for grown ups – and deserves a hero’s welcome when he arrives home in Lancashire. It is not always about winning. Murray, having turned his life around, found even more dignity, admiration and, most importantly of all, self respect by his valour. I could give him no better than a share of one round. He was battered to the canvas for the first time in his career. Then twice more. The last time, from a right hand blow like a bazooka, sank him into a tortured crouch and enabled referee Luis Sabon to enact a merciful, rightful stoppage. Murray had not just come to survive. He fought back whenever he could, often enough for Golovkin has a chin which would probably withstand even his own murderous punchee. But every time he did hit out he was brutally punished for his temerity by not only the power but also the ring mastery of one of probably the next greatest pound-for-pound boxer on the planet. The nervous wait for Murray finally ended as he entered this bizarre venue at three minutes to midnight. Golovkin made his ring walk precisely at the witching hour. They like a late night in Casinoville. It was well into Sunday by the time the national anthems, the formalities and announcer Michael Buffer’s call to Rumble gave way to the first bell. Once the opening bell rang Golovkin went to work with his left jab but Murray was unabashed and landed a couple of rangy right counters. A combination from Murray stung the Kazakh into action and the first volley of his power punches sent the Englishman on to the retreat. Gennady Golovkin connects with a brutal right jab as Martin Murray feels the force of the unbeaten Kazakh fighter in Monte Carlo . Murray was sent to the canvas three times by a rampant Golovkin but showed guts galore to take the fight into the 11th round . Golovkin grins after another victory for the enormously impressive 32-year-old, who successfully defended his middleweight title once more . Golovkin is embraced in the ring after another dominant display from arguably the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet . Golovkin is hoisted aloft by a member of his team after demonstrating exactly why he is one of the most feared fighters on the planet . In round two, the brave Briton had the advantages of height, weight and reach but Golovkin’s speed was the problem and referee Luis Pabon warned Murray for holding. Murray had come to fight but was rocked by a right left combination but kept doing enough in adversity to steal a share of the round. Golovkin showed all of his power in the third, after Murray’s one-twos were again in evidence at the start of the round. But he was rocked by lefts and rights to the head and body and did well to stave off being knocked down for the first time in his 31 fight career when Golovkin opened up in the final minute. With the heat well and truly on, not for the first time Murray was warned for hitting low in desperation, That first visit to the canvas was not long delayed. A wicked, trademark body shot sat him down. No sooner did he rise than Golvokin unleashed a vicious combination which dropped him again. It was an act of courage for Murray to make it to the bell. Golovkin took a comparative breather in the fifth, and Murray was able to throw some punches of his own but the Lancashire complexion was reddening badly. Murray's only hope appeared to be that the champion would punch himself out. Murray’s courage was remarkable as the fight headed into the sixth, but he was taking a beating now. Three uppercuts in succession left him spitting blood and he sank painfully onto his stool in the corner at the end of the round. Prince Albert claps as Golovkin clutches his middleweight belts after a convincing display to stop Murray in the 11th . The Monte Carlo crowd were treated to a fight of blood and guts from Murray and unstoppable power and precision from Golovkin . A show of defiance from Murray gave him the satisfaction of landing a couple of combinations in the seventh, but he was being stalked and after more heavy blows from Golovkin had to cling to the Kazakh's waist to stay upright under heavy fire in the closing seconds. Murray’s resolve was heroic. Many a good man would have had enough by the end of the fourth but here he was still trying to fire back four rounds later. At times only his strength kept him up and when he did sink to his knees the referee gave him the benefit of a slip. There was more hell to come and it looked as if only the bell prevented Mr Sabon from calling a halt to proceedings. Under the open scoring system the announcer revealed that Golovkin was holding a huge lead at the start of the ninth. No surprise there. Just as predictably the hole for Murray deepened but he kept taking the punishment and swinging in hope. Somehow Murray had become the second man to take Golovkin to the tenth in his career. Again he called on his phenomenal reserves of strength come out fighting. Again Golovkin punished his affrontery with an assault verging on slaughter and a massive right dropped Murray for the third time. Again the bell came to the rescue. Murray came back out to make his little piece of 11th round history – but there was to be no survival to the final bell. Another near-decapitating right sank him to a seated position on the ropes and more blows rained Mr Pabon – mercifully and rightly – hurried to call the stoppage.","Murray and Golovkin shared two even opening rounds in Monte Carlo .

"The three women who survived their decade-long captivity in Ariel Castro's Cleveland House of Horrors shared a stage together in public for the first time on Monday night. Amanda Berry, 27, Gina DeJesus, 24, and Michelle Knight, 33, were honored by Ohio Governor John Kasich at his annual courage awards - where they received a two-minute standing ovation. Kasich called the women's story one of hurt beyond imagination, but also a story that didn't end there. 'It is also a story of three women who found an inner strength and a courage that brought them through and sustained them,' Kasich said near the end of his annual State of the State speech. Scroll down for video . Safe: Ohio Governor John Kasich with (from left) Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight during his State of the State address at the Performing Arts Center on Monday in Medina, Ohio in February . 'No one rescued them, they rescued themselves-first by staying strong and by sticking together, and then by literally breaking out into freedom.' The women were rescued in May after . being kidnapped by Ariel Castro from the streets of Cleveland between . 2002 and 2004 at the ages of 14, 16 and 21. Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus escaped when Berry pushed out a door and yelled for help. She told a police dispatcher in a dramatic 911 call: 'Help me. I'm Amanda Berry. I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years, and I'm, I'm here, I'm free now.' Castro pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison. He hanged himself on September 3, just weeks into his sentence. The award presentation nearly overshadowed Kasich's speech given the women's popularity since their release. They were household names in Cleveland for years as missing persons, and their discovery electrified a community accustomed to bleaker outcomes. Ovation: Governor John Kasich, talks with Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight after they received the Governor's Courage Award, during Kasich's State of the State address at the Performing Arts Center on Monday . Kasich hugged the three women as he entered the hall before his speech and pictures of that moment quickly flew across cyberspace. As he announced the awards, Kasich called them 'three extraordinary women, who despite having the worst in this world thrown at them, rose above it and emerged not as victims, but as victors.' The three women then walked onto the stage to be embraced by the governor and receive their medals. The audience stood and cheered in raptures for more than two minutes, the longest ovation of the night. First joint appearance: Amanda Berry (left) Gina DeJesus (center) and . Michelle Knight (right) were rescued in May along and rarely appear . together in public. Berry, De Jesus and Knight made their first . prerecorded appearances in July of 2013 . 'Is that just unbelievable,' a clearly moved Kasich said to GOP House Speaker William Batchelder and GOP Senate President Keith Faber, who were also on stage. 'Wow.' While the three women have appeared in public since they escaped their decade in sickening captivity, this is their first appearance since they released a joint video in July to thank all their supporters. Indeed, that video marked the first public appearance of Michelle Knight. It was not even known that she had been kidnapped until she was found in Castro's home on Seymour Avenue on May 6. The video, which is three and a half minutes long, was posted on YouTube and revealed the women to have physically recovered well from their ordeal. Back in July, Kathy Joseph, an attorney for Knight, said in a statement that the three women wanted to 'say thank you to people from Cleveland and across the world, now that two months have passed.' She said they're being recognized in public, 'so they decided to put voices and faces to their heartfelt messages.' Brave first public appearance: Michelle Knight, one of the three kidnapped women, pauses to wipe away tears as she reads her statement during the sentencing of her accused kidnapper Ariel Castro at a court hearing in Cleveland, Ohio August 1, 2013 . James Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, also issued a statement at the time saying Knight and his clients thank people for the privacy they've been given and do not want to discuss their case with the news media or anyone else. Following that revelatory joint prerecorded video, Knight made a brave and defiant appearance at Castro's sentencing in August in which she told him, 'I spent 11 years in hell, your hell is just beginning.' Knight was the only one of Ariel Castro's three victims to appear in person. Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry's victim impact statements were read by members of their family. The 33-year-old described how the days turned into weeks, weeks into eternity and said when she was 'dying' from the abuse she suffered, her friendship with Gina was the only thing that kept her going. Michelle Knight spoke of Castro's hypocrisy as he attended church every week and then came home to torture them. 'I remember all the times you came home talking about what everyone else was doing wrong when you were doing the same thing,' she said. 'I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day.' Speaking of her 'teammate' Gina, she said: 'She never let me fall, I never let her fall. She nursed me back to health when I was dying from her abuse. My friendship with her is the only good thing to come out of this situation. 'I will overcome all this that happened. I will live on, you will die a little every day,' she said to him. 'I will forgive you, but I will never forget.' And only five days after Castro's death in September, Knight was also seen to attend a Cleveland Browns football game in September for the opening NFL game of the season. Rare appearance; Stepping out for the first time since Cleveland kidnapper Ariel Castro's suicide at the beginning of September, victim Michelle Knight beamed broadly for the cameras as she attended at Cleveland Browns football game on September 8 . Harrowing: In November, Michelle Knight gave an interview to Dr. Phil in which she went into distressing detail about the torture that she endured at the hands of Ariel Castro . In late July, Amanda Berry was spotted on stage at a very public concert for rapper Nelly - walking on  with her family and waving at the cheering crowd before reemerging later again to join rapper Nelly. The announcer called for 'a bigger round of applause and cheer...than any of the acts that are here' and said after she arrived on stage: 'I told her she had a little bit of time to make up on the partying and you guys could help her out tonight'. Rapper Nelly introduced her onstage later saying: 'Everyone, here's Amanda Berry'. Gina DeJesus' public outings have been rarer - around the same time that Berry was spotted at the Cleveland concert, she took part in the annual Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest in the same city. Kidnap victim: Guests in the crowd at 2013 RoverFest got a special surprise Saturday night when Amanda berry, front left, appeared on stage . Public thanks and support: Gina DeJesus right, took part in the Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest for a city council candidate in later July - her first appearance in public since her escape from Castro in May . Riding in a car along the parade route, Gina smiled and thanked her supporters by throwing candy treats to the crowd during in late July. And in the most harrowing appearance since they escaped Castro's clutches, Michelle Knight spoke to Dr. Phil in an exclusive interview in November during which she described being 'tied up by my feet and neck like a fish'. After Knight recounted the daily torture ordeal she went through over the course of a decade, a visibily affected Dr. Phil called the interview his most difficult. Dr Phil said the interview 'changed him like no other in 12 years of doing the show.' House of horrors: The three women were held in this house (right) for nearly 10 years .

"It all started for Jordon Ibe, like so many young Liverpool fans, after one unforgettable night in Istanbul 10 years ago. He was only nine then and, growing up in Bermondsey, South London, his fledgling football affinity had been towards Chelsea. But on May 25, 2005, young Jordon was given a treat. Though it was a school night, he was given permission to stay up and watch the Champions League final. Liverpool's Jordan Ibe and Besiktas' Olcay Sahan (left) battle for the ball during the Europa League clash . That night in Istanbul is one etched on the mind of young Ibe, as he opted to support the club after watching it . It turned out, of course, to be a game like no other and as Steven Gerrard inspired that stunning comeback against AC Milan, a dream took flight in the Ibe household. ‘Dad was a Liverpool fan,’ says Ibe, taking up the story. ‘Growing up I supported Chelsea a little bit but I’ve been a Liverpool fan since I started watching the games. I watched the Champions League final in the evening. I wasn’t [normally] allowed to stay up but I watched it.’ What separates Ibe from other Liverpool fans of his age, however, is that when the club returns to the Ataturk Olympic Stadium on Thursday to tackle Besiktas, he will be out on the pitch aiming to show why he is considered one of the hottest young talents in English football. Ramon Motta battles for the ball with Jordan during the UEFA Europa League match at Anfield on Thursday . Jerzy Dudek keeps out Andriy Shevchenko's penalty to hand Liverpool their fifth European Cup . His emergence over the past month, which has featured exciting displays against Everton, Tottenham and Besiktas, has been as swift as one of those rapid bursts down the right flank he can produce, and the hopes Brendan Rodgers has for this confident 19-year-old are understandably high. Liverpool did not look to make signings during the January transfer window but one move Rodgers wanted above all was bringing Ibe back from a successful loan spell at Derby County. Having watched his progress, Rodgers firmly believed he could influence their aggressive pursuit of a top four spot. ‘I am enjoying it and it’s good for the gaffer to get me involved and hopefully I can get a few more chances to play,’ says Ibe. ‘My Dad is proud and the whole family are proud. I enjoyed it at Derby. I made a lot of friends. The team was great and I was playing all the time [he made 24 appearances]. Ibe battles to get past Besiktas player Sahan during Liverpool's Europa League clash with Besiktas . ‘Steve McClaren is a good manager, definitely a great coach on the training ground. He always helped me and the young players. I enjoyed my time with him. So [when I heard Liverpool wanted me back] I was thinking to myself, “was I going to come back and not play?” ‘But it was a confidence booster because I had been doing well and he [Rodgers] asked me to come back. It’s given me confidence to join in with the first team and try to prove myself. I have done well and I am enjoying my football.’ He always has. There may have been early disappointment in his career, when he was released by Charlton as a 12-year-old, but going to Wycombe Wanderers — where Gary Waddock gave him a Football League debut at 15 — set him on the road to the Premier League. Philippe Coutinho turns on the Brazilian samba skills at Anfield as Liverpool beat Besiktas in the first leg . After just 11 appearances, Liverpool signed him for £500,000 on January 1 2012 and he developed in their Academy before Rodgers handed him a debut against QPR just over 16 months later — his pass allowed Philippe Coutinho to score the goal that sent Jamie Carragher into retirement with a 1-0 win. ‘I thought it was the right time for me to move away from home,’ says Ibe. ‘I had a trial at Manchester City when I was younger but this was a good choice for me. It was a bit difficult when I was a bit younger but as I was leaving secondary school I thought it was the right choice. ‘My family moved up with me and it’s been great ever since. I haven’t been homesick at all and I had education when I was in the youth team, so everything has been cool and I have made friends at the club. Coutinho and Veli Kavlak collide during the UEFA Europa League clash between Liverpool and Besiktas . ‘I’m learning from the attacking players like Mario [Balotelli], Raheem [Sterling], [Daniel] Sturridge and Coutinho, and I’m trying to add goals to my game and prove to the manager I can keep playing. Wing-back is a new position for me but it’s good because I can attack the [opposition] full-back.Raheem has been a really big influence. He has been helping me and we talk off the pitch and he gives me advice. ‘He is a year older than me and it gives me a lot of confidence to try and achieve what he has achieved at such a young age. Mario is another person who has helped me on and off the pitch.’ Comparisons with Sterling are understandable, given their respective pace and frames, but Ibe, while taking inspiration from how his friend has developed, is his own man and is determined to take this opportunity to carve out a niche for himself in the team. Liverpool have already taken steps to secure him for the long term by offering him new, improved terms — his current deal runs until 2017 — and their ambitions for him are mirrored within the FA, as England Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate watched him against Besiktas last Thursday. Daniel Sturridge  in action during the Europa League Round of 32 match between Liverpool and Besiktas . The fallout from that game was consumed by Balotelli’s penalty but it was Ibe’s thrilling change of gear that tempted Ramon Motta to make a misguided lunge for the ball, thus setting up another thrilling night in the Ataturk. This time Ibe will be able to shape Liverpool’s destiny. ‘The manager has also given me the chance to play in big stadiums in front of big grounds,’ says Ibe. ‘So when I play at Anfield I have that confidence and there are great players around me as well, which helps. I just want to keep progressing and see from there.’ Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli and Sturridge line up in a wall as they look to block a free kick on Thursday .","Jordan Ibe became a Liverpool fan after the Champions League final .

"An immigrant child sex gang was jailed yesterday by a judge who condemned them for failing to respect Britain by abusing young girls and failing to learn English. Judge John Bevan QC said the four Roma men and boys and an Iraqi Kurd had ignored the responsibilities of living in this country as he sentenced them for raping and sexually assaulting five girls aged as young as 12. The Old Bailey had heard how the victims had been forced to have sex with men for money, which was used to buy drugs and alcohol. One of the girls had become pregnant and another had self-harmed. (Left to right) Hassan Abdulla, Jan Kandrac, who have been jailed at the Old Bailey in London for raping and sexually abusing girls as young as 12 in Peterborough . The other two adult members of the gang were Renato Balog (left) and Zdeno Mirga, who were also jailed . Judge Bevan told the five gang . members: ‘The combination of the crimes you have committed and your . attitude to these crimes both in this country and this court bring . discredit on all of you in the dock and does a disservice to your fellow . Roma who want to work hard in this country, improve themselves and make . a positive contribution. ‘If . you want to live in this country you must do so in an appropriate way. With rights come responsibilities, which you have singularly failed to . take.’ He added that the . gang members’ failure to learn English well enough to follow their . lengthy trial, despite having lived legally in Peterborough, . Cambridgeshire, for between five and 12 years, meant that taxpayers . would foot a bill for interpreters of up to £40,000. A court drawing showing the gang, (from left) Mirga, Abdulla, Kandrac and Balog are pictured and the 14-year-old, whose identity can not be revealed, has been shaded out . ‘The . fact is that the defendants all came to this country with their . families between five and ten years ago and the majority are still . teenagers,’ the judge said. ‘The . acquisition of a new language is not difficult if you put your mind to . it. They have not attempted to learn the language of the country of . their choice.’ The gang’s . Roma ringleader, Zdeno Mirga, 18, known as ‘the boss’, was sentenced to . 16-and-a-half years in a young offenders’ institution for eight counts . of rape and one count of inciting child prostitution. The Old Bailey heard one of the girls was attacked in a Wendy House in a children's play area . Speaking outside court, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway praised the bravery of the victims in coming forward and then going though with the court case. 'Today gives those girls justice. Those who abused them are now behind bars,' he said. 'I'm pleased with today's sentences as it shows how seriously we, and the courts, take this kind of offending. It sends a clear message that we will not tolerate those who seek to exploit vulnerable young people. 'We will do everything in our power to put them before the courts.' The investigation was the first trial under Operation Erle, a joint inquiry between Cambridgeshire Police and Peterborough City Council's children's services. Gillian Beasley, chief executive of Peterborough City Council, said social services and police had taken time to slowly gain the trust of all the victims and ensure they felt safe. 'It is a long road to recovery for these girls,' she said. 'We will give them the best support we can possibly give them to step down that road to lead a normal life.' Iraqi . Kurd drug dealer Hassan Abdulla, 33, branded a ‘dangerous predatory . paedophile’ by the judge, was jailed for 20 years for four rapes and . three counts of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity. Renato Balog, 18, a Roma who helped Abdulla sell drugs, will serve 12 years for five rapes and three sexual assaults. The . judge described him as a ‘bully with an overgrown sexual appetite’. Jan . Kandrac, 17, also from a Roma community, will serve five-and-a-half . years in a young offender institution for one count of rape and two of . indecent assault on a child. The . youngest member of the gang, a 14-year-old Roma who cannot be . identified for legal reasons, was given a non-custodial six-month youth . rehabilitation order for sexual activity with a child. Four . of the gang members are from the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Two of . the victims are Czech and Slovak, while the other three are English. One . has ‘serious learning difficulties’ and an IQ of 54. In . a statement to the court, one of the victims, known as Girl A, said: ‘I . felt upset and scared, the boys told me if I told police they would . kill me and my family and I thought they would. I am still frightened . that they will kill me when they get out.’ Speaking outside court, Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway of Cambridgeshire Police praised the bravery of the victims. He . said: ‘Today gives those girls justice. I’m pleased with today’s . sentences as it shows how seriously we, and the courts, take this kind . of offending.

"When beloved family pet cat Woosie disappeared in 2011 his owners soon gave him up for dead. But little did they know the tomcat had wandered into a Ginsters pasty factory 30 miles away and was being spoilt rotten - living on a rich diet of pastries and sandwiches fed to him by staff. The animal’s adventure came to an end last week when workers decided to hand him in to the local vets. Returned: Stunned owners Helen and Phillip Johns suspect Woosie lived on a diet of pastries after spending the last three years in a Ginsters pasty factory . A scan of his microchip revealed he belonged to Helen and Phillip Johns, of Gover, near . St Austell, Cornwall,  and the cat has now been returned home. And far from looking bedraggled after his three year absence, Woosie seems to have piled on the pounds. Mother-of-three Helen, 58, said: 'He went out one morning as cats do and we . never saw him again. 'Then . nearly three years on, we get a call from the vets saying we have got . your cat here. I looked at our other cat Lola and told them they must be . mistaken. 'Then it suddenly registered they must mean Woosie. I was so shocked. Home sweet home: Mrs Johns was stunned when Woosie was found alive and well after running away in 2011 . 'The vet said he had been living in the Ginsters pasty factory in Callington and one of the workers had been looking after him. 'I was gobsmacked. We never expected to see him again, not after he’d been missing for three years. 'He’s a heavy cat now - he’s quite large. We think that he may have been eating all the pasties and sandwiches up there. 'He’s probably been given lots of titbits from staff there.' Woosie had been adopted by workers who let him have free reign of the offices during the day, fed him on Ginsters products and renamed him ‘George’. Staff at the pie factory 33 miles away say he roamed the grounds outside at night and was always there to welcome workers when they arrived in the morning. High life: Tomcat Woosie had been adopted by workers at Ginsters pasty factory, pictured, who fed the runaway a rich diet of pastries and sandwiches . Since his return Mrs Johns said Woosie had settled in - apart from the 'odd hiss' at their other cat Lola who was just a kitten when he disappeared. Mrs Johns said: 'He came home on Tuesday evening, came straight into the house and just stretched out in the chair as if nothing had happened. 'He’s like Lord Muck. It’s surreal. He’s unfazed by it.' The grandmother-of-one said she was dumbfounded as to how Woosie had ended up at the pasty factory near Plymouth. She said: 'We have no idea how he ended up there, but cats are curious. Diet: Runaway Woosie returned three years after disappearing rather more plump than when he left - possibly due to being fed on pasties from a nearby Ginsters factory . Not going hungry: Woosie had managed to find his way to a Ginsters factory, pictured, 30 miles away from his home where staff kept him fed with scraps . 'We think he may have climbed into the back of a lorry delivering to the Co-Op store and gone unnoticed by the driver. 'Or he could have jumped into someone’s car who was visiting the area when they opened the door. 'We just don’t know. It’s just a miracle he’s here after three years.' Mrs Johns said the vet had advised her not to let Woosie out for a couple of weeks while he adjusted to his surroundings. 'There is a worry that he will just go off again,' she said. 'But we are just glad to have him home.' Ginsters said they were unaware of the incident but were 'delighted' Woosie had been reunited with his owners. A spokesperson said: 'As you would expect from a food manufacturer, we have very strict procedures to ensure that stray animals do not venture into the perimeter of our premises at any time. 'We have not been made aware of this particular incident, however, we are always pleased to hear of a nice ending to a story and delighted that Woosie has been reunited with its owners.'","Tomcat Woosie disappeared in 2011 from the family home in Gover, Cornwall .

"House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is certain the Obamacare website's tech problems won't affect the sustainability of the Affordable Care Act, but very few in Washington are stepping up to second her motion . A startup venture recruiting people for a one-way, 43 million mile trip to live on Mars has generated more signatures than all the Obamacare health insurance plans combined. Just 712 people in Vermont have enrolled in the state's new health insurance exchange, despite $9 million in outreach, advertising and other PR expenses paid for by the federal government. The entire state of Alaska has yet to register a single person, according to Sen. Lisa Murkowski. ('Juneau how many people have signed up?' asks one cheeky blogger. 'Hint: It's a round number!') A CNN medical correspondent has found that the online Obamacare system, which was reportedly first tested just days before its Oct. 1 launch, is now spontaneously deleting some Americans' passwords. The website itself, according to The Weekly Standard, includes pilfered source code but excludes a required copyright notice required by its author. With $394 million in contracts in the rear-view mirror, the Obama administration has an online white elephant on its hands that hasn't worked as advertised. Krystal Ball, an MSNBC commentator best known for a series of racy 'naughty Santa' photos that circled the Internet in 2010, confessed on Thursday that she was 'embarrassed to admit' she once worked for the company that created the federal government's  Obamacare website. Is the Affordable Care Act officially the most dysfunctional and disaster-prone launch in history? Congress, which suddenly has time on its hands after weeks of shutdown and debt-Armageddon liars poker, is about to ask some tough questions. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Want to go to Mars? More than 200,000 people have committed to blasting off and leaving Earth behind -- a larger number than have been willing to roll the dice on Obamacare . Welcome to the disaster: Healthcare.gov is more than three years and $394 million in the making, but few Americans have been able to make it function, leaving a trail of discouraged consumers in its wake . Twitter erupted Thursday with jokes about a launch of a different kind, the Mars One colony project that has attracted 202,586 applications from people eager to depart  Earth for the red planet at the first opportunity. And in the blue corner sits Obamacare, the much-ballyhooed health-care-for-all project whose official numbers are a closely guarded state secret. But unofficial numbers from firms that track the data independently suggest that the nationwide total is somewhere south of the Mars colony's successes. The online analytics firm Compete.com released an analysis this week that determined just 36,000 people registered for Obamacare through the federal government's Healthcare.gov website during its first week of operation. (Sources inside the Department of Health and Human Services put that number at 51,000 when they spoke with MailOnline.) And the 14 states that run their own enrollment websites – 15 if the District of Columbia is included – are slowly adding their own figures to the total. The Advisory Board Company, a consultancy whose influential Daily Briefing has . provided day-to-day totals, puts that number at 42,000 – although . critics point out that it's incomplete. Only a few states have published . their own totals, and most of those announcements have been full of . qualifications and caveats. The Associated Press learned Wednesday that HHS anticipated signing up 500,000 Americans per month, beginning in October, although the agency has denied that project, articulated in a departmental memorandum, was a hard target. President Obama is 'not happy' with the rollout, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday in what might be the understatement of the week . Vermont's health insurance exchange has corralled just 712 new customers, despite $9 million in PR and outreach expenses designed to attract taxpayers to the new system . Maryland, for instance, a state of 5.88 million people, had processed 1,121 applications as of Oct. 11. Minnesota's program claims to represent 11,684 people, but that's only after factoring in 'family members, children and other dependents' of the actual applicants. New York (100,000), Washington (25,000) and Kentucky (13,000) have reported their numbers in a similar fashion, announcing how many people will benefit from newly contracted coverage instead of how many completed applications have been filed. Families of four, for instance, would inflate those numbers by 400 per cent. Still-larger states like California are not publishing definitive numbers at all, instead tweeting web-traffic totals and the number of applications its residents have 'started.' Vermont, with 712 successful Obamacare enrollees as of Thursday, according to WCAX-TV, has another problem to contend with: Its website can accept applications, but it's not capable of collecting any payments. Gov. Peter Shumlin, the Vermont Health Connect program's biggest cheerleader, hasn't addressed the possibility that even those few Vermonters will change their minds when the bill comes due. Slow-walking: President Obama hasn't mentioned his signature legislative achievement since the debt-limit debate reached its crescendo, preferring to look forward to immigration and farm-bill fights instead . Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin is one of several Democratic pols who were ubiquitous in the run-up to the Obamacare launch date, but hard to find in public since the disappointing numbers started to trickle in . An embarrassed Krystal Ball made an on-air 'confession' Thursday on MSNBC, saying that she had worked for CGI Federal, the main contractor behind Obamacare's troubled main website . With the Obama administration cowering and late-night talk show hosts doing a brisk business in Obamacare jokes ('Today Obama changed his slogan from ""Yes we can"" to ""Perhaps we could try. Can't promise anything,""' said Jay Leno), the White House is saying only that the president is 'not happy.' And Congress, fresh from its epic debt-limit standoff, has begun to engage. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that even if the Obamacare insurance exchanges' enrollment mechanisms continue to be failure-prone through the holidays, the program itself must be allowed to continue without delays. 'No, no – It has nothing to do with the programmatic part. It's about technology,' she insisted when asked about the impact of non-functioning websites and frustrated consumers on the public-policy part of Obamacare. The part that won and lost hundreds of elections. But it's the technology that is making headlines now, including one at The Washington Examiner that screamed about the Department of Health and Human Services failing to road-test Healthcare.gov 'until a week before launch.' HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius made time for Jon Stewart on Teh Daily Show, but his pointed barbs have her scrambling to avoid testifyign before Congress about the disastrous Obamacare website . 'Normally a system this size would need 4-6 months of testing and performance tuning, not 4-6 days,' a source on the inside of the project said. 'The actual system requirements for Oct. 1 were changing up until the week before.' And a former employee of CGI Federal, the company behind the website – the same firm that now has former employee and MSNBC pundit Krystal Ball 'embarrassed' – said 'requirements came late' from the bureaucrats who 'dictated the design, especially the sign-up-before-viewing-plans, and there was absolutely not enough time for testing.' CGI's parent company was shown the door by health officials in Ontario in September 2012, after it missed deadlines in three straight years related to the province’s online medical registry. but The Obama administration had already awarded the firm a $93.7 million contract in late 2011 to complete work on Healthcare.gov. And two years later, Reuters reports, the value of that contract has grown to almost  $292 million, nearly $200 million of which has already been paid. All told, according to a Government Accountability Office report published in June, the administration doled out $394 million to dozens of companies for work related to setting up the health care exchanges nationwide. The House Energy and Commerce Committee will likely dig into the administration's high-tech bungling on October 24, when it convenes a hearing on the website implementation that bears the ominous title, 'Unprepared or Incompetent?' Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who said Monday on The Daily Show that she's unaware of how many Americans have enrolled in Obamacare, has told the committee that she won't testify. 'Secretary Sebelius had time for Jon Stewart, and we expect her to have time for Congress,' countered committee chairman Rep. Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, in a statement on Thursday. 'Either the administration was not ready for launch, or it was not up to the job,' Upton said. 'The president and top officials were quick to boast the number of visitors to HealthCare.gov, but they have since gone silent, refusing to disclose even basic enrollment figures.' 'The rollout has been a complete mess, beyond the worst case scenario, and yet those administration officials responsible have indicated they will not be available to testify next week. This is wholly unacceptable.'","'Mars One' colony project has 200,000 commitments from would-be space cadets, outpacing Americans' interest in Affordable Care Act participation .

"Not only is Michael Phelps the most decorated Olympian of all time, with 18 swimming golds to his name - he's also a natural at golf. The U.S. sportsman holed the longest putt ever recorded on TV from more than 150ft (50 yards) at the famous Dunhill Links Championship in Scotland. His effortless skill was showcased on Friday at the Kingsbarns course, six miles east of St Andrews, where he proved his sporting prowess extends well on to dry land. Scroll down for video . One of the greats: The American said that seeing his putt go in at the legendary course was 'a pretty cool feeling' Long shot: Olympic champion Michael Phelps lines up the improbable 153-foot putt in Scotland . Euphoria: The 18-time gold medallist performs a fist-pump as his impressive shot drops into the hole . His putt was only slightly shorter than the length of an Olympic swimming pool - a distance he knows very well. He smashed the existing world record of 99ft (33 yards), which was set by broadcaster Terry Wogan at . Gleneagles in 1981. The jaw-dropping putt, which took a full 17 seconds to drop, probably even elicited envy from his partner, former Ryder Cup player Paul Casey. Born to win: The swimmer's putt smashed the 99ft (33-yard) televised record set by broadcaster Terry Wogan . Amazing moment: Unfortunately, Phelps's astonishing performance in the second round did not last, and he and his professional partner finished at 15 under par . 'It was the longest putt I've ever had and to see it go in was a pretty cool feeling,' Phelps, 27, said afterwards. 'I will never forget it. I just tried to get it to the top of the rise in the green and I couldn’t believe it when it then ran down the other side and all the way into the hole. 'It was a great moment. I just had to give a bit of a Tiger-esque fist pump.' Casey's caddy said he believed the putt was from 153ft, or 51 yards. All-rounder: The 27-year-old  holed the ball over roughly the distance of an Olympic swimming pool . Golfing history: His efforts in Scotland cement his reputation as an incredible sportsman . The monster putt was selected as the ‘Shot of the Day’ by Sky Sports commentator, Ewen Murray. Murray said: 'It was quite simply the perfect putt. Travelling down three different levels at the perfect pace it was well over 150ft (50 yards) in length. 'It was made all the more amazing . because he hit the worst shot of the day on the 18th at Carnoustie, not . even making the bairn with a 40-yard approach shot.' The putt gave the 'Baltimore Bullet', who was playing off a 16-handicap, a net hole-in-one at the 337-yard sixth hole and he followed that up with a net eagle (two under par) at the seventh.

"The biological parents of a baby born to a Thai surrogate mother and allegedly abandoned for having Down syndrome say they did even not know he existed. Pattaramon Chanbua, the child's 21-year-old mother, claims that the Australian couple took her son's twin sister but left him behind because he was sick. However, the father today told the ABC that they knew nothing about the six-month-old boy and believed that the surrogate had only given birth to a girl. Scroll down for video . Thai surrogate mother Pattaramon Chanbua holds her baby Gammy, born with Down Syndrome, at the Samitivej hospital on Monday . He also said that Ms Pattaramon was not the woman he believed to have carried his child and that he had had problems with the Thai agency, which has now shut down. The couple have not been identified but live in Bunbury, in Western Australia. They are expected to release a statement through a lawyer some time in the coming hours. Gammy's mother has threatened to sue the family, claiming that the children’s biological father, who is in his 50s, had visited her after she gave birth. He had only bought milk for the girl, she claimed, and ‘never looked at Gammy’. 'The twins stayed next to each other but the father never looked at Gammy...could say he never touched Gammy at all,' she said. A lawyer presenting the Australian biological parents of Gammy (pictured right) is expected to address the media from the couple's South Bunbury home in WA . The Abbott government may intervene, saying that Gammy could be eligibly for Australian citizenship . Ms Pattaramon told the ABC that the pair had cried on the day that they collected their daughter from hospital but left their son behind. She also alleges that they asked her to have an abortion when she found out that she was carrying a child with Down Syndrome. Gammy’s plight has provoked fury across the world with critics savaging his biological parents. Donations have poured in and now stand at more than $200,000. Meanwhile the little boy is still gravely ill at Samitivej Sriracha Hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand. He is battling a lung infection and, at one point, his birth mother did not expect him to survive. Australia’s Immigration Minister Scott Morrison has labelled Ms Pattaramon a ‘saint’ and an ‘absolute hero’ and said the outpouring of support was a strong indicator of the way Australians felt about the situation. Ms Pattaramon says she will sue Gammy's Australian biological parents for leaving their son behind in Thailand . Gammy's story could prompt the Australian government to look closer at surrogacy laws with the Department of Foreign Affairs already examining practices in Thailand. Agencies were working with Thai officials on the broader surrogacy issues, the department said. Mr Morrison said the legalities surrounding international surrogacy were ‘very, very, very murky’ and regulations must be looked at carefully. ‘Sure, there are lots of Australians who are desperate to be parents but that can never, I think, sanction what we have just seen here,’ he said. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also said the case illustrates the pitfalls of international surrogacy. Commercial surrogacy, where a woman is paid a fee to carry a child, is illegal in Australia. However, if there is an agreement for the biological parents to cover just medical and other reasonable costs, the practice is legal. Pattaramon Chanbua shared a tender moment with her baby boy Gammy at a hospital in Chonburi province, southeastern Thailand on Sunday . Gammy, pictured here with his older brother Game and mother Ms Chanbua, is expected to be moved to a hospital in Bangkok in the coming days . The three of them sit happily huddled together on a hospital bed, Game keeping an eye on his little brother . More than $182,000 has been raised so far for Gammy's mother to pay for her sick son's medical expenses . In hospital on Sunday the six-month-old held onto a creme coloured bear, who looked to be wearing a doctor's lab coat . Ms Chanbua previously said she loved the six-month-old boy like he was her own child, and has vowed to care for her son . Ms Pattaramon told of her heartbreak at Gammy's situation, saying she loved the baby boy like he was her own. 'This was the adults' fault. And who is he to endure something like this even though it's not his fault?' she told the ABC. 'Why does he have to be abandoned and the other baby has it easy? Ms Chanbua said she treated the six-month-old like he was one of her own children. 'I love him, he was in my tummy for nine months, it’s like my child,' she told the ABC.'Never think that you're not my child, that I don't care for you.' 'I would like to tell Thai women – don't get into this business as a surrogate. Don't just think only for money ... if something goes wrong no one will help us and the baby will be abandoned from society, then we have to take responsibility for that,' Ms Chanbua said, The Sydney Morning Herald reported earlier on Friday. The campaign by charity Hands Across The Water is still ongoing and they have vowed to donate every cent raised to looking after the little boy . The young mother, who lives 90km south of Bangkok and has two other children, aged three and six, was paid a total of $16,000 by the couple to give birth to the baby. The couple paid an extra $1673 when they first realised - three-months into the pregnancy - that Ms Chanbua was having twins for them and reportedly told her to have an abortion. Ms Chanbua is a Buddhist and refused to have the abortion on moral grounds. She originally agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems and the arrangement was set-up through an agency, which has since been closed down. The Australian man and his ethnic-Asian wife could not conceive a baby themselves. 'Because of the poverty and debts, the money that was offered was a lot for me,' she told the ABC. 'In my mind, with that money, we one could educate my children and two we can repay our debt.' The Australian couple, who have remained anonymous, reportedly told Ms Chanbua to have an abortion . Ms Chanbua, 21, agreed to become a surrogate mother because of her family's financial problems . Commercial surrogacy is banned in Australia and it is illegal for people living in Queensland, NSW and the ACT to undertake commercial surrogacy in Thailand. It's also illegal for Australians to select a baby's sex. Current Australian Medicare policy forbids Medicare rebates for IVF use for surrogacy and to receive surrogacy as a treatment option in Australia the following conditions must be fulfilled: . Many Australians have flocked to Thailand over the years because the rules were far less strict. However, the rules have changed this week. After Thailand’s military government reviewed 12 Thai IVF clinics involved in surrogacy cases they have announced new laws. Surrogacy is now only recognised in Thailand if: . Surrogacy in Thailand is illegal if: .

"Child rapist: Mohammed Hussain, 28, pleaded guilty and has been jailed for six years and eight months . A takeaway worker faces deportation after he was jailed for raping a 12-year-old girl who was out past her bedtime. Mohammed Hussain, 28, was driving home from work with two colleagues in the early hours in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when they spotted the group of four girls in a park. Afraid to go home because they had broken their parents' curfew, the girls were enticed back to the home of one of the men. There they were offered cannabis and played pornographic films before two of the girls, both 12, were taken upstairs. Hussain raped one of the 12-year-old girls while she asked him to stop, Leeds Crown Court heard. One of his two colleagues, 30-year-old Harris Uddin, tried to remove the trousers of the other girl but stopped when she asked him not to. The four girls - two aged 12, one aged 11 and one aged 13 - were at the home of the third takeaway worker, 28-year-old Shah Miah. Although he did not assault the girls himself, he was jailed for helping arrange the attack after he struck up conversation with them. He is also now serving a four-and-a-half year sentence for sex offences against three other children. The court heard all three men, who were arrested later the same day, groomed vulnerable youngsters for their own sexual gratification. Hussain pleaded guilty to rape and was jailed for six years and eight months. Uddin pleaded guilty to sexual assault and was jailed for 12 months. Attack: The four girls were out past their curfew in the area of this park in Leeds, West Yorkshire . Miah pleaded guilty to facilitating the commission of a sexual offence against a child and was jailed for 18 months. The attack happened in the Leeds suburb of Beeston last March. Hussain and Uddin, from India, were already in the country illegally because they had outstayed the length of their visa, the court heard. Det Supt Pat Twiggs, Leeds head of crime for West Yorkshire Police, said: 'These men preyed on these vulnerable young girls in a premeditated way to sexually exploit them. 'The circumstances of the offences included grooming behaviour leading to the appalling sexual abuse of victims that were clearly underage.'","Mohammed Hussain, 28, and two colleagues spotted the girls in a park .

"The snake is patterned like a venomous snake, but is largely harmless, as an adder's venom is treatable, and the snakes are quite rare to see slithering about . At first glance this snake appears to be a venomous sidewinder that has slithered across a desert. But the serpent is actually an adder that was caught on camera making its way across a sandy beach in Cornwall. The 3ft long snake was snapped by Tim Hunt who spotted it and its lengthy trail while he watched the sunset at Godrevy beach, near Hayle, Cornwall. He used his camera tripod to scoop it up away from the incoming tide and moved it to safety behind some sand dunes. Tim, 25, from Worcestershire, said: 'I was photographing the sunset when I saw a trail in the sand and assumed a child had dragged a stick down the beach. 'It was only whilst walking further down the beach that I noticed there was something at the end of the trail, it turned out to be an adder. 'It was the first time I had seen an adder and I was shocked at how small it was, it was a beautiful creature. 'I was amazed by the great distance it had travelled while being in the open with the danger of being stepped on or taken by predators. 'The sun had set and the snake remained in stasis. Due to snakes being cold blooded its body was starting to shut down. From far away, the snake seems like a venemous sidewinder that would better fit into a desert . 'I was sure that with it being so far out in the middle of the beach and with the incoming tide, its chances of survival were slim. 'So using my tripod I carried the adder to the safety and shelter of the sand dunes behind the beach.'",The snake was spotted by Cornish photographer Tim Hunt on Godrevy beach near Hayle .
"A cancer patient who was forced to have a section of his upper jaw removed has been given an entirely new set of teeth built by a 3D printer. The 41-year-old man, from Bangalore, India, was left unable to eat or speak properly after undergoing the operation when he was diagnosed with mouth cancer. It also left him with large gaps in his teeth that made him feel self-conscious about his appearance. Scroll down for video . New smile: The 41-year-old patient was left with gaps in his teeth, left, following a surgery to treat mouth cancer. A team of scientists were able to give him a new set of teeth, right, to fill in the top row . Realistic: A picture of the mould of the man's mouth, built using a 3D printer, reveals how closely the scientists were able to match the shape and colour of the new set to the patient's original teeth . Self-conscious: The man, from Bangalore, first sought help from dentists to try and fix the gap in the roof of his mouth, left, caused by the surgery. Right: His smile shows the 3D-printed teeth built by scientists . Solution: As well as losing a number of teeth, the patient had a section of the roof of his mouth and part of his jaw removed. Above, the areas that were rebuilt in the 3D printer are coloured to look like his natural mouth . But he is now able to use his mouth with greater ease after a team of scientists used a 3D printer to model and build the section of his jaw that was removed. The patient  had to undergo the surgery in order to remove the cancer in the roof of his mouth. He experienced further complications after developing radiation-induced lockjaw following six weeks of radiotherapy treatment. The condition, which limited his ability to open his mouth, affected his eating and his speech. The upper jaw surgery also had a severe impact on his appearance. Dentists were reluctant to give him any sort of implant, as taking an impression and producing a mould proved problematic given his inability to open his mouth. But a local company that specialises in 3D printing for healthcare became involved in the patient's case. Digital solution: As the man was unable to fully open his mouth to allow doctors to take a conventional mould, a CT scan was used to create a 3D reconstruction of the patient's face, pictured above . Next step: The model of his jaw, pictured above, was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully. This allowed the scientists to make sure that he would have a full range of movement . Perfect fit: Using the 3D-printed replica as a template, a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that it would fit the patient as comfortably as possible. Above, part of the 3D-printed jaw is seen . Treatment: Osteo3D, a Bangladore-based company that specialises in 3D printing for healthcare, became involved in the patient's case after dentists said he could not be fitted with a dental implant . Using a CT scan to create a 3D reconstruction of the patient's face, the company, Osteo3D, printed a replica of the patient's mouth, complete with lower and upper jaw, the defect and his teeth. The model was able to simulate the movements of his joint and mimicked the mouth opening fully - overcoming the issue of making a mould from the patient's jaw. Using the 3D-printed replica as a template, a wax model was produced and adjusted to make sure that the fit was correct. This was then hardened, fitted with teeth and given to the patient. He is now able to chew, swallow, speak and smile with greater ease.","The 41-year-old man from Bangalore was diagnosed with mouth cancer .

"Jose Mourinho and Chelsea can feel hard done by after contentious decisions contributed to Burnley grabbing a point at Stamford Bridge, according to Alan Shearer. The Blues boss spoke made reference to four key incidents which he believed changed the course of the 1-1 draw in his post-match interviews - citing a foul on Branislav Ivanovic, two penalty appeals and the sending off Nemanja Matic. Match of the Day pundit Shearer, who was backed-up by Robbie Savage, agreed with Mourinho and claimed that referee Martin Atkinson was at fault on each occasion. Jose Mourinho identified four key incidents which he believes shaped his side's draw with Burnley . Match of the Day pundits Alan Shearer (left) and Robbie Savage agreed with Mourinho's points . Nemanja Matic was sent off after pushing Burnley's Ashley Barnes to the ground in the second half . Speaking about an Ashley Barnes challenge on Ivanovic which went unpunished in the 30th minute, Shearer said: 'I think Martin Atkinson has had a terrible game today. 'Ashley Barnes goes up for the header with Ivanovic, he leads with his foot and he's very fortunate. You can see he kicks out, studs into the back of his hamstring and that should be a yellow card.' Former Leicester midfielder Savage added: 'Definite yellow card there. Ivanovic's reaction is quite poor, he rolls over and gets up but I agree – a yellow card for Ashley Barnes.' The second incident - a Chelsea penalty appeal which was turned down in the 33rd minute - also drew criticism from Shearer and Savage. 'This is blatant handball,' said Shearer of Michael Kightly's successful attempt to block a shot from Ivanovic. 'The referee has got a brilliant view of it, he's about 10 yards away. He turns his back, sticks his arm out and that has to be a penalty.' 30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. Verdict: Should have been a free-kick and could have been a yellow card. for Barnes.

Diego Costa vents his frustration after being shoved inside the box by Jason Shackell . 69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. Verdict:Shocking tackle merited a red card for Barnes and a Chelsea free-kick. Referee Martin Atkinson shows Matic a straight red card after his altercation with Barnes in the second half . Speaking about an Ashley Barnes challenge on Ivanovic which went unpunished in the 30th minute, Shearer said: 'I think Martin Atkinson has had a terrible game today.

Shearer believes Chelsea and Mourinho can feel hard done by after Martin Atkinson's performance . Ivanovic screams in pain after being fouled by Barnes but the striker avoided a yellow card . 'The referee has got a brilliant view of it, he's about 10 yards away. He turns his back, sticks his arm out and that has to be a penalty.' 'He's made himself bigger,' added Savage. 'His arm is in an unnatural position. It's a definite penalty.' The Premier League leaders had another strong appeal for a spot-kick turned down 10 minutes later when Diego Costa went down under a challenge from Jason Shackell. Shearer said: 'He shoves him, he gets his legs caught up in his and it's a shove. You can see from Costa's reaction what he thinks of it. I've got to agree with Jose – it should be a penalty.' Savage added: 'Martin Atkinson was in a great position once again but he wasn't having it. Mourinho's right – he and his team have been hard done by today.' The most controversial incident occurred in the second half when Nemanja Matic was shown a straight red card after pushing Barnes to the floor following a dangerous tackle from the Burnley man. This tackle from Barnes infuriated Matic, with Savage claiming the midfielder was lucky not to break his leg . Costa looks bemused after Martin Atkinson refused to award him a penalty after a tussle with Shackell . The ex-Brighton man escaped without a card but Matic will miss next Sunday's Capital One Cup final through suspension. Once again Shearer and Savage agreed with Mourinho, although the Serb's sending off was justified. 'It's a horrific tackle, it really is,' said Shearer. 'It's dangerous, it's naughty. I understand that reaction. It's not right but I understand it because he could have easily broken his leg there. 'For that Matic will miss the cup final next week and that's a disaster for him and for Chelsea. He (Barnes) doesn't even get a yellow card.' 'Ashley Barnes should've been booked in the first half and that should have been a straight red,' added Savage. 'He's (Matic) lucky he's not out for six, seven, eight months. Mourinho's right today. They've been hard done by.'","Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw against Burnley at Stamford Bridge .

"Launch: Clive Maxwell, head of the Office of Fair Trading says payday lenders must be probed because of 'deep-rooted' problems with the industry . Payday lenders have been referred for a full-blown investigation by the Competition Commission after the trading watchdog uncovered 'deep-rooted' problems with the industry. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) said it decided to make the referral because it suspects that features of the market 'prevent, restrict or distort competition'. The 'fundamental' problems it has found, such as loans becoming far more expensive than struggling borrowers had expected, cannot be tackled by existing laws and guidance, it said. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) decision is the culmination of a large-scale investigation into the £2 billion payday sector, including spot checks on household names such as Wonga. The OFT said it is concerned that lenders are mainly competing on the availability and speed of loan approval, rather than how much it will cost the borrower. It said: 'The competitive pressure to approve loans quickly may give firms an incentive to skimp on the affordability assessment which is designed to prevent irresponsible lending and protect consumers. 'The OFT is also concerned about business models that appear predicated on making loans which are unaffordable, leading to borrowers paying far more than expected through rollovers, additional interest and other charges'. Clive Maxwell, OFT chief executive, said: 'Competition appears not to be working properly in the payday lending market, allowing firms to profit from making loans that cannot be paid back on time. 'We have seen evidence of financial loss and personal distress to many people. 'The Competition Commission can now conduct a detailed investigation to get to the root causes and, if necessary, use its far reaching powers to fix the payday lending market.' Investigation: Companies like Wonga will be probed, who offer loans at 5,853% APR . The commission has strong powers to ban or limit products and shake up whole markets. Tough new regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) will oversee the market from next April. The FCA's powers will include the ability to place a 'possible cap' on interest rates and ban or limit the number of rollovers lenders are allowed to offer, the OFT said. During its investigation, the OFT found that lenders get up to half of their revenue from loans which had been rolled over or refinanced. 240 - The number of payday lenders in the market. £2billion - The estimated worth of the sector. 50 - The number of payday lenders that were warned by the trading watchdog to prove they are up to scratch or risk being put out of business. 12 - The number of weeks the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) gave lenders to show that they have addressed the problems it has found. 30 - The number of payday lenders’ websites that emphasised speed and quick access to cash over cost out of the 50 looked at by the OFT. 270 - The typical size of a payday loan in pounds. 12 or more - The number of consecutive rollovers that some payday customers had in the most severe cases found by OFT inspectors. 17 - The number of lenders out of the 50 inspected by the OFT that were found to actively promote rollovers in marketing material or at the point of sale as a “feature” of the loan. 50 - The percentage of payday lenders’ revenues that the OFT found came from 28% of loans which are rolled over or refinanced at least once. 19 - The percentage of payday lenders’ revenue that came from 5% of loans which were rolled over or refinanced four or more times, according to the OFT’s findings. 38 - The number of lenders out of the 50 inspected by the OFT that failed to comply with at least one of the complaint-handling rules of the Financial Ombudsman Service. 7,221 - The number of people who sought help from debt charity StepChange last year who had five or more payday loans. 5,853 - The APR (annual percentage rate) advertised on loans from Wonga, one of Britain’s best-known payday lenders. Wonga, which has more than one million active customers, argues that its APR figure is not a good reflection of the true cost of its loans, which are intended to be for a short-term period. A 'significant' number of borrowers have poor credit histories and a pressing need to get access to cash, meaning that the cost of the loan may be a less significant factor for borrowers and weaken competition on price, the watchdog said. The OFT said it is concerned that consumers find it hard to compare the full cost of payday loans. The practice of rolling loans over also means that other lenders cannot compete for this business and the borrower is trapped with their existing lender. It said the extent to which payday lenders stuck to the rules was 'variable', meaning lenders which invest time and effort complying are at a competitive disadvantage to those who do not. Mr Maxwell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We think there are fundamental problems in this market. In short, competition isn't working. It's allowing firms to profit from making unaffordable loans that can't be repaid on time, which is causing financial loss and distress to some people. 'The sorts of difficulties we've found include difficulties for borrowers to compare the full costs of loans in some circumstances and the difficulties for borrowers to switch lender at the point of rolling over a loan. 'We don't think changes can be made under existing laws and guidance. Rather, we think that the Competition Commission in looking at this can bring forward solutions if it finds problems. 'It could, as it has in other markets, ban a particular product or a feature of a product to make that market work more effectively.' Charities and consumer groups, many of whom have seen rocketing numbers of people struggling with payday loan debt, welcomed the OFT's decision, although some questioned why action has not come sooner. Martin Lewis, creator of consumer help website MoneySavingExpert.com, called for a cap to be placed on the total cost of loans and said lenders should be forced to take more notice of poor credit histories. He said: 'Finally, politicians and regulators are picking up the ball. Yet it's shamefully late. Millions of people have already spent billions of pounds on these often disgustingly expensive debts that lead many people into financial hell. 'The lax regulation and enforcement in the UK means we've been easy pickings for these lenders. Couple that with the gradual diminishing of the Social Fund, which was the one route for people on benefits or with little cash to get short-term, interest-free loans, and it's no surprise so many people fall foul.' Complaints: Experts say the people taking these loans are left in an often endless spiral of debt because they cannot pay off the loan . Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said its evidence has found that in two-thirds (64%) of cases loans come without any checks to make sure the borrower can afford to repay. She said: 'The industry is in desperate need of a transformation from predatory firms to a responsible short-term credit market.' Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which? said the market is 'rife with poor practice'. He said: 'This is a market where lenders are not competing fairly with each other on price but instead use speed and ease of access to entice customers into deals they cannot afford, so it is right to get the Competition Commission to investigate. 'People under financial pressure being given high cost loans in minutes without proper affordability checks is a recipe for disaster.'","OFT believe payday market does 'prevent, restrict or distort competition'

"The federal government has appealed to the public to help them invent new hazmat suits for doctors and soldiers fighting the Ebola epidemic in Africa and at home. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has sent out an appeal for internet crowdsourcing to design a radical new anti-contamination suit that will lower the risk of health workers becoming infected. USAID wants applications submitted immediately and any successful design accepted will be awarded $1 million in funding. The USAID has set a deadline of two months on the whole process. Scroll down for video . Improvements: The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has sent out an appeal for internet crowdsourcing to design a radical new anti-contamination suit . The USAID has labeled their crowdsourcing scheme, 'Fighting Ebola: A Grand Challenge for Development' as it announced its requirements for their hazmat suits to deal better with tropical heat stress and the risk of contagion when de-suiting. It did not offer any guidance on current hazmat standards, only requiring 'entirely novel' personal protection equipment. In addition to suits for those working on the front line of patient protection, the agency issued a demand for suits to be used by airport staff, TSA staff and for those involved in burials. Current ideas suggested to Sky News to overcome the heat stress of working in a hazmat suit are to equip them with cooling devices, stress detectors and thinner, stronger suits. Precautions: Dr. Michael OíConnor , left, and Dr. Mark Nunnally, learn how to use personal protective gear during Ebola preparedness training at the University of Chicago . The USAID is also looking for suits that provide face cooling shields and suits that are designed to be reusable. Many of the personal protection suits are usable one-time only and when they are thrown away they increase the risk of accidental contamination. This comes as the Illinois Attorney General's office said it is aware that members of the public are being sent email scams directly related to the Ebola crisis. The emails promise to provide an Ebola 'surplus personal protection kit' costing $29 which will provide 'infection defense for emergency response teams,' says the bogus email. 'People being quarantined,' one subject line reads. 'Ebola outbreak pandemic update,' says another. 'We suspect these emails are the handiwork of scammers seeking to take advantage of people’s understandable fear and anxiety surrounding this international public health risk,' Attorney General Lisa Madigan said in a statement. Across the nation, American hospitals have increased Ebola training sessions as health workers are placed on high alert for potential cases of the deadly virus in the U.S. At the University of Chicago Hospital on Monday, doctors practiced pulling on bulky white suits and helmets that make them look more like astronauts than doctors preparing to fight a deadly disease. However training sessions on Ebola preparedness for U.S. medics and health workers heading to Africa can make the reality sink in - learning how to safely put on and take off the medical armor is crucial. No suits: Volunteers in protective suit bury the body of a person who died from Ebola in Waterloo, some 30 kilometers southeast of Freetown, on October 7, 20114 . 'When you're in the real deal, remember to take your time,' biosafety expert John Bivona told doctors during a course this week in Chicago. Suits splashed with patients' vomit or blood must be removed carefully, he explained. 'As much as possible, grab from the inside' to avoid touching contaminated parts of the suits, he said. 'Be liberal with disinfectant.' Across town, at Rush University Medical Center, doctors got a frightening test run this past weekend when a man coughing up blood said he had been in contact with someone from Nigeria, one of the countries in West Africa where Ebola spread. ER staffers donned protective gear and immediately escorted him to a nearby isolation room, but tests showed he had bronchitis, not Ebola, said Dr. Dino Rumoro, Rush's emergency medicine chief. Rumoro said he's worked through similar scary disease threats - AIDS, SARS, swine flu and smallpox after 9/11 - that were in some ways more worrisome because they can spread invisibly through the air. Ebola is transmitted through direct contact with blood, vomit and other body fluids, or contact with needles, syringes or other objects contaminated by the virus. 'At least with Ebola we have a fighting chance,' Rumoro said, 'because I know that it is coming from body fluid and I know if I wear my (protective) suit I'm safe and I know if I don't stick myself with a needle or cut myself with a scalpel I'm safe.' 'There's always going to be a little bit of fear in your head,' Rumoro said. 'But that's OK. That's what keeps us safe.'","US Agency for International Development (USAID) wants members of the public to design new hazmat-suits .

"Starting piano lessons before the age of seven may turbo-charge the brain. A study found that learning to play a musical instrument seems to strengthen the brain – with the biggest benefits found in those who began lessons while still very young. The researchers said: ‘Early musical training does more good for kids than just making it easier for them to enjoy music. Beneficial: Starting piano lessons before the age of seven may turbo-charge the brain, a study has found . ‘It changes their brain and these brain changes could lead to cognitive advances as well.’ The Chinese researchers studied the brains of 48 men and women aged between 19 and 21. All had done at least a year of music practice, with some starting as young as three. Parts of the brain key to language, planning and time management appeared to be stronger in those who started younger. Positive: Researchers found that learning to play a musical instrument seems to strengthen the brain - particularly in those who began lessons young . Plus regions involved in hearing sound and in self-awareness were bigger. The finding held true even when the number of years spent practising was taken into account, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference heard. The researchers, from Beijing Normal University, said that some of the brain regions impacted by music develop rapidly early in life. Research released last week revealed that music lessons aren’t wasted, with adults who hadn’t played an instrument since childhood benefiting from practice put in decades earlier. The US study showed that the more years that adults had spent practising an musical instrument in their youth, the faster the cells in their brains responded to sound. Faster processing of sound should help keep hearing sharp into old age by making it easier to make out a conversation over background noise, or to hear clearly while talking on the phone. All instruments, from the piano to accordion helped equally. Other studies have shown that learning a musical instrument can boost IQ, make it easier to pick up new languages and interpret the emotions of others. But while music lessons in general seem to be beneficial, it is thought that those who enjoy learning an instrument reap the biggest benefits.","Learning to play an instrument strengthens the brain, a study has found .

The . memorial coincided with news that the Varsity Blues actor planned to . give up his life as a Hollywood actor to spend more time with his . 15-year-old daughter, Meadow. Meadow had recently moved from her home in Hawaii to live with Walker in Santa Barbara. In an interview earlier this year, Walker described his daughter as 'the best partner I've ever had'. 'I've never had anything like this in my life,' he said. 'I've been so transient; I've been on my own since I was 16. There's a part of me who feels like I'm making up for lost time.' According to two of Walker's closest friends, Ronn Shikari and Vince Krause, who both live in Hawaii, Walker believed he had accomplished all that he wanted from Hollywood and now believed he needed to devote himself to his daughter. 'He was a family man and I know it hurt him to be spending so much time away from Meadow on location; he loved being with his daughter, she was his world,' Ronn Shikari told The Mail Online.

"Accusation: British model Emma Appleton appears to have uploaded and then deleted a very suggestive message she claims is from photographer Terry Richardson which she uploaded to social media on Sunday . A British model has claimed celebrity photographer Terry Richardson offered her the opportunity to pose for fashion bible Vogue in exchange for sex. Emma Appleton claims the seedy offer was made from the photographer’s Facebook account on Sunday and involved a shoot in Richardson's hometown of New York City. His spokeswoman said the message is a fake and denied her client's involvement. Appleton uploaded the grab to Twitter on Sunday afternoon - setting off a flurry of shocked replies from her followers before she deleted her entire account and took the picture off her Instagram page. 'If I can f*** you I will book you in ny (sic) for a. (sic) shoot for Vogue,' reads the message grabbed by Appleton - which she claims was from the photographer who has been dogged by claims of sexual harassment over the years. While it is not clear whether Richardson, who counts Miley Cyrus and Lady Gaga as some of his photographic muses, is responsible for the message, Appleton explained in more detail to her followers what happened after the offer was made. 'I was like whaat and he said yes or no?', replied Appleton to one Twitter user, @lewisthegreat. When asked what she then said, Appleton said that she declined the offer with a simple, 'no, I'm not your girl, bye ha.' Scroll down for video . Shocking: This is the message - with offending language blurred out - that Terry Richardson was accused of sending to Emma Appleton on Sunday . Appleton, who hails from Witney, Oxfordshire and splits her time between there and London then said she felt the 'industry is f****d up'. One appalled Twitter follower of Appleton said, 'I've been modelling for 5 years and I've never had this before, it doesn't make it okay.' As her account was inundated with replies, some which appeared to be unsupportive of her, Appleton then bemoaned the fact that she had even uploaded the grab. Before she deleted her account, she signed off with, 'The fact people think this acceptable blows my f*****g mind. See ya.' Candice Marks, a spokesperson for Richardson denied the message was real and said that the photographer did not send the message. 'This is obviously a fake. Terry did not send this text,' said Marks to Buzzfeed. A spokesperson for Vogue, who Richardson shot for in February, said that the magazine would not be commenting on the situation at the moment. Despite many accusations of sexual harassment in the past, Richardson has never been charged, or convicted of any crime in connection with any allegations.

In March he called claims that he has acted inappropriately with models he has worked with as 'a witch hunt'. The high-profile snapper has worked with Barack Obama, Rhianna, Justin Bieber and Beyoncé and in the past has been described as an 'alleged sexual predator' and even a 'creep' by some celebrities. The New York Post obtained a letter in which the Rolling Stone, Vogue and GQ photographer called the allegations against him, 'false, hate-filled and libelous tales'. In relation to the years of allegations against him: 'I chose to primarily ignore a cycle of Internet gossip and false accusations against me. 'I felt that to dignify them with a response was a betrayal of my work and my character. 'When . these allegations resurfaced over the past few months, they seemed . especially vicious and distorted, becoming nothing more than an . emotionally-charged witch hunt. 'People have become comfortable concocting hate-filled and libelous tales . 'In writing this, I make a humble attempt at correcting these rumors.

"The pose is unmistakable but the target beggars belief. Arms outstretched, a hooded rioter takes aim and fires at a police helicopter hovering over a scene of carnage in the middle of a city. Yesterday the gunman and five others convicted over a ‘concerted attack on the police’ were jailed for up to 30 years each after a court heard how they used guns to ambush unarmed officers before turning their fire skywards. Scroll down for video . Jailed:  Nicholas Francis, 26, left,  was jailed for 30 years while co-defendant Tyrone Laidley, 20, right, received 20 years . Guilty: Jermaine Lewis, 27, was jailed for 23 years for shooting at police officers during last summer's riots in Birmingham while Wayne Collins, 20, received an 18 year sentence . Threat: Renardo Farell, 20, was sentenced to 18 years while Amirul Rehman, 17, was given 12 years. The gang lured officers into the area by firebombing a pub and even shot at a police helicopter . The yobs, some said to have links with two notorious local gangs, set a landmark pub on fire as its staff cowered in living quarters upstairs to ‘lure’ riot police to the scene.Then, from behind barricades, they goaded the officers and attacked them with missiles before opening fire. CCTV footage released by police shows a large group of men – some armed with baseball bats – gathered outside the pub, smashing windows and throwing objects into the road. At least four firearms were used in the attacks and 12 shots fired, with officers diving for cover as bullets flew over their heads. At least two shots were aimed at the helicopter, which had been brought in to monitor the disorder in Aston, Birmingham, during rioting last August. Jailing the gang for a total of 124 years for what he branded a ‘concerted attack on the police’, Judge William Davis QC said the potential consequences of a helicopter being brought down by gunfire were ‘catastrophic’. Police said the gang were ‘cowards’ who had displayed ‘an extraordinary degree of criminality and malice towards officers’. The court was shown CCTV of a large group of men fleeing from police, . with two men at the rear of appearing to take aim and fire at officers and a police helicopter . Prosecutor Andrew Lockhart QC said that, after getting into formation, officers heard gunshots and were forced to take cover before being given the order to retreat for their own safety . Target: A West Midlands police helicopter circling over Birmingham (file picture) The man seen in the picture firing at the helicopter was said by police to be Tyrone Laidley, 20. Following a six-week trial, he was convicted alongside Jermaine Lewis, 27, Nicholas Francis, 26, Wayne Collins, 25, and Renardo Farrell, 20, of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, reckless arson and riot. Amirul Rehman, 17, was convicted of riot and possession of a firearm. Police said some of the defendants had ties to the local Johnson Crew gang, which entered the national consciousness in January 2003 when its members were the intended targets of a gang-on-gang shooting in the city. Two innocent teenagers died. Others were tied to the Raider’s group from nearby West Bromwich, which was strongly allied to the Johnson Crew. The defendants were part of a masked gang of 41 who were armed with firebombs as they broke in and ransacked the Barton Arms pub. Furniture was removed from the Victorian pub to barricade the street outside before officers in riot vans arrived. The officers came under fire as they attempted to disperse the crowd. Birmingham Crown Court heard the police helicopter tracked the group as it moved across Aston and recorded individuals twice taking aim and shooting at the aircraft. The incident ended when firearms . officers attended the scene and arrested three of the men. The other . three were linked to the scene through forensic work, mobile phone . evidence and police intelligence. Sentencing, . Judge Davis said: ‘The intention was to endanger life. Although no . physical injury was suffered, that was wholly a matter of luck. Had the . police helicopter been struck, the consequences could have been . catastrophic. The Crown alleges that the officers had been lured into the area by the pre-planned arson attack . Mr Lockhart QC told the court: 'As many as four guns were present. Scientific evidence confirms that' ‘There may have been no physical injury to a police officer, but the damage to the wellbeing of the city of Birmingham caused by an armed gang prepared to act in this way was grave. ‘It is very difficult to conceive a case of this type more serious than this one.’ The judge said the disorder happened during a ‘wave of lawlessness’ which had ‘swept through a number of English cities’ last August, including elsewhere in Birmingham. Francis, of Great Barr, Birmingham, was jailed for 30 years. The Raiders gang member was said to have had a ‘deep antipathy towards the police’. Fellow Raider Lewis, of Oldbury, West Midlands, and . Laidley, of Nechells, Birmingham, were jailed for 23 years. Collins, from Luton, and Farrell, from Finchfield, Wolverhampton, were each sentenced to 18 years.Rehman, of Aston, was sentenced to 12 years detention. An order banning his identification was lifted after the sentencing. Outside court, the detective who led the investigation said it had been a ‘miracle’ nobody was killed as a result of the disorder. Detective Inspector Andy Bannister said the gang lured police officers into an ambush by setting fire to the pub. ‘These people showed a wanton disregard for the crew of the helicopter, the unarmed officers on the ground, members of the public and the people inside the Bartons Arms pub,’ he said. ‘This may have happened on the same evening as the other disorder, but this was not about looting. ‘I have never come across a case where the offenders have shown such a blatant disregard for the lives of police officers. ‘The officers were in extreme danger and the shots that flew over the heads would have hit them if the gunmen had lowered their hands by a fraction. ‘We could easily be looking at a murder investigation. They are a cowardly group of people. ‘There is no kudos from shooting a gun at officers who are out protecting the local community.’ DI Bannister said the attack was ‘planned and orchestrated’ with the pub set alight as a ‘tactic to draw as many police as possible into the area’. Victims: Charlene Ellis, pictured second left and Latisha Shakespeare, right, died when they were caught in the crossfire of gangland warfare in Birmingham in 2003 . The Barton Arms lies on the A34 arterial route to the north of Birmingham. It is a road which for two decades has acted as the unofficial boundary separating the city’s two main gangs. The Johnson Crew, based in Lozells to the west, and Burger Bar Boys (BBB), east of the road in Aston, took their names from two cafes where black youths congregated in the early 1980s. The two groups were originally part of the same organisation, but legend has it the BBBs fell out with the Johnson Crew in a row over a game of Streetfighter on a computer. By the late 1980s, the Johnson Crew controlled most of the city’s drug supply and were prominent in nightclub security. They were making tens of thousands of pounds a week. Killings linked to their escalating drugs turf war began in the mid-1990s. Between 1999 and 2005, gun crime in the city rose by 500 per cent. But it was the murders of Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17, in January 2003 which brought Birmingham’s gang warfare sharply into national focus. The innocent teenagers were gunned down at a New Year party in Aston in a drive-by attack by BBB members who were attempting to hit a member of the rival gang. While the BBBs were considered the more ruthless, the Johnson Crew were the more organised. By then, their numbers were swelled by affiliations with newer gangs such as the West Bromwich-based Raiders – of which rioters Nicholas Francis and Jermaine Lewis were said to be members – and the Cash4Money Crew. Their ranks also included women – once considered useful only for providing alibis and to look after their men, but by then on the streets with weapons of their own. It was a hit by the Raiders just a month earlier which led to the double murder which became known as the ‘New Year killings’. On December 6, 2002, BBB member Yohanne Martin, 24, was shot dead as he sat in his car in West Bromwich High Street by assailants linked to the Raiders. The prosecution in the New Year shootings trial claimed his brother, Nathan, one of four men to be convicted over the murders of Miss Ellis and Miss Shakespeare, was ‘blinded by hatred’ because of the attack on his brother. When a teenage woman and member of the Johnson-affiliated Raiders was charged in connection with the death, he had the evidence he needed and began planning a revenge attack. The Aston double murder was a watershed moment in the Birmingham underworld – marking the point at which women became legitimate targets in the turf war between its two main rivals. Amardeep Bassey, a journalist who has written a book on the subject, said at the time: ‘From that moment on women in gangs were seen as fair game. I don’t think anyone deliberately went out looking for girls, but there was a sense that if they were in the way and got hurt, it wouldn’t matter the way it might have done before.’","Nicholas Francis, 26, described as 'a dangerous man', jailed for 30 years .

Crowds have been flocking to see the weeping icon at the church of St Nickolas in the Greek village, which is believed to have a clear, oily, sticky and odourless liquid running down it. Scroll down for video . 'Tears': An icon of Christ being crucified at a church said by priests to have been 'crying' since January 25 . Liquid: Crowds have been flocking to see the icon at the church of St Nickolas in Asprokambos, Greece . People amazed by the phenomenon have been visiting the church to pray at the shrine - and priests have vowed to get a team of scientists to examine the tears, reported La Repubblica. Dionysios Mantalos, the Metropolitan Bishop of Corinth, said he would inform the Greek Holy Synod of the findings, but cautioned that conclusions should not be made until tests have been carried out. The crying of the icon, which is around a century old, has been billed by some as the 'Miracle of Syriza' - but Bishop Mantalos called for prayer, adding: ‘In matters of faith we must be very careful.’ Last month Greece’s new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras - who is an atheist - broke with tradition by not being sworn in by the head of Greece’s orthodox church, currently Archbishop Ieronymos II.

Greek investigative journalist Yiannis Baboulias told Newsweek of the latest incident: ‘The weeping icon is an urban legend that resurfaces every now and again in Greece. Stories like this happen all the time, and this one is really funny.’ He said he believes the 'paint on the icon is starting to leak due to environmental changes'.","Icon at church in Asprokambos, Corinth, has 'cried' since January 25 .

"Cyber attack: Betfair admits more than 3.1 million accounts with encrypted security questions were hacked . Online gambling firm Betfair today admitted it had not told its customers about a major cyber attack  18 months ago where millions of credit card details were stolen. More than 3.1 million account names with encrypted security questions, 2.9 million usernames, and nearly 90,000 account usernames with bank account details were stolen. And the company admitted it did not discover the attack had taken place until two months later when a server at its Malta data . centre crashed. In total, nine servers in the UK and two in Malta were affected. Betfair said it did not inform its . registered customers of the attack as its system made the data unusable . for fraudulent activity and it was able to recover all the information . intact. The betting group said it had contacted the Australian Federal Police and German authorities over the attack, believed to be the work of criminals based in Cambodia. A confidential internal report commissioned into the theft, seen by the Daily Telegraph and published today, was sent out to staff on September 27 last year - six days after Betfair announced its intention to float on the London Stock Exchange. Unfair: Betfair kept details of the major cyber attack under wraps for more than a year . The company moved to reassure customers by saying it had carried out a  review of its security and Betfair's systems have been strengthened so they now conform with best practice guidelines on the protection of customer details. A spokesman said: 'We have subsequently implemented all of the recommendations from the independent reports we commissioned and have done everything we can to minimise the risk of this happening again.' Betfair's share price has fallen 41 per cent since it listed at 1300p last October as revenue growth has been lower than expected, while it has also suffered a string of management departures and regulatory problems. Also the poor performance of LMax, Betfair's new financial exchange retail trading platform launched last year, has not helped the company's share price. Chief executive David Yu and chairman Edward Wray have both recently indicated they will stand down. Mr Yu, who was the company's former chief technology officer prior to taking over as chief executive, said in June he would not renew his contract when it expires in October 2012.

"The owner of a remote-control plane has been ordered to pay £4,340 in fines and costs after it crashed in a no-fly zone near a BAE Systems shipyard that builds nuclear submarines. Robert Knowles lost control of the £2,000 delta-wing plane fitted with a surveillance camera and it ended up in the sea. It was washed up weeks later and police traced the TV repairman because the camera had recorded his car registration number as the plane took off. Robert Knowles lost control of the £2,000 delta-wing plane fitted with a surveillance camera and it ended  up in the sea . The aircraft also bore the name of his company, Vision TV Repairs. Knowles, 46, was convicted in his absence of failing to comply with air regulations. He . was found to be in control of an unmanned aircraft which travelled . within 50metres of Walney Bridge in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and over . the nearby BAE shipyard. The aircraft, with a 1.35m wingspan and . weighing 1.86kg, crashed into Walney Channel and was recovered by a BAE . employee. It is against air regulations to fly aircraft over the BAE facility without permission from the Civil Aviation Authority. Knowles . failed to attend the hearing and his defence lawyer was withdrawn as a . result. He had previously pleaded not  guilty to two counts of failing . to comply with air regulations on the basis that he was not in  control . of the plane. Beware incoming: A man from Cumbria has become the first person in the UK to be successfully prosecuted for the dangerous and illegal flying of an unmanned aircraft (UAV). A stock image of a quadcopter drone is pictured, but Robert Knowles' UAV was homemade . Punished: Mr Knowles, of Barrow-in-Furness, was found guilty on April 1 and fined £800 at Furness and District Magistrate Court. The court heard that on August 25, a UAV was recovered from water near to a submarine testing facility in Barrow-in-Furness (pictured) operated by the defence company, BAE Systems . Last October . Knowles, of  Dalton, Cumbria, said: ‘I think it’s all a bit . heavy-handed. I understand safety concerns, but at the end of the day I . would not have put my name on the plane if I was a bomber or a spy.’ On . Tuesday he was fined £800 at Furness Magistrates’ Court for being both . the controller and operator of the plane. He was also ordered to pay £3,500 in court costs and a £40 victim surcharge. District . judge Gerald Chalk said: ‘The aircraft had a camera on it and the film . has been shown to me. It shows the route the aircraft took over the . bridge and over the nuclear facility. It shows a man operating the . aircraft and a parked car.’ The . court heard that Knowles had carried out seven flights from Walney on . the day last August. He used a sensor from the aircraft to follow each . flight on a laptop. Alison . Slater, prosecuting on behalf of the Civil Aviation Authority, said that . the video footage showed Knowles launching the aircraft, incriminating . himself in the process. She . said: ‘The footage was taken to Greater Manchester Police for analysis. The aircraft was in the charge of Mr Knowles and he was the operator of . it.’ In an email to Robert . Webb, standards officer from the Civil Aviation Authority, Knowles said . he lost sight of the aircraft and could not locate it. He . said he didn’t know how he lost control of the plane, and couldn’t rule . out ‘outside influence’. He is said to be considering an appeal against . the verdict.

"An Observer article that called transsexuals 'bed-wetters in bad wigs' and 'd**** in chick's clothing' has been taken offline after a torrent of abuse from furious readers. Controversial newspaper Julie Burchill was accused of being transphobic after she wrote a column in the Observer yesterday defending her friend and fellow columnist Suzanne Moore who came under fire on Twitter for an article that said women were under pressure to have bodies like 'Brazilian transsexuals'. The Observer website was swamped with comments in response to Miss Burchill's column, many describing it as 'vile' and 'horrible'. Now the paper has spiked the article and issued a statement from editor John Mulholland. Contrite: The Observer withdrew Ms Burchill's feature and apologised on its website after a storm of protest . It said: 'We have decided to withdraw from publication the Julie Burchill comment piece 'Transsexuals should cut it out'. 'The piece was an attempt to explore contentious issues within what had become a highly-charged debate. 'The Observer is a paper which prides itself on ventilating difficult debates and airing challenging views. On this occasion we got it wrong and in light of the hurt and offence caused I apologise and have made the decision to withdraw the piece.' But Liberal Democrat minister Lynne . Featherstone has called for Miss Burchill to be sacked. The . former Equalities Minister, a staunch supporter of transsexual rights, . said she should be fired and Mr Mulholland . should also go. Miss Featherstone, now Minister for International Development, accused . Miss Burchill and the Observer of ‘inciting hatred’. 'Sack her': Former equalities minister Lynne Featherstone, left, has called for Observer columnist Julie Burchill, right, to be sacked after she wrote an article that described transsexuals as 'bed-wetters in bad wigs' She said on . Twitter: ‘Julie Burchill rant against transgender community is . absolutely disgusting – a bigoted vomit for which the Observer should . sack her.’ Replying to a message saying Mr Mulholland should be sacked, she said: ‘Good point – they can both go!’ Miss Burchill wrote the article in defence of fellow columnist Suzanne Moore, who became the target of transsexuals’ fury over what seemed to be a throw-away comment in a previous article. Miss Moore, describing the challenges faced by modern women in an article for the New Statesman, had written that modern women were expected to look like ‘Brazilian transsexuals’. She had said: '(Women]) are angry with ourselves for not being happier, not being loved properly and not having the ideal body shape – that of a Brazilian transsexual.' The comment provoked fury on Twitter and Miss Moore subsequently said she had been forced to stop using the website because of the abuse she had received. Miss Burchill ranted: 'Though I imagine (Twitter) to be something akin to being savaged by a dead sheep, as Denis Healey had it of Geoffrey Howe, I nevertheless felt indignant that a woman of such style and substance should be driven from her chosen mode of time-wasting by a bunch of d**** in chicks' clothing. She added that the reaction of ‘the very vociferous transsexual lobby and their grim groupies’ reminded her ‘of those wretched inner-city kids who shoot another inner-city kid dead in a fast-food shop for not showing them enough “respect”.’ Under fire: Julie Burchill's column was in defence of friend Suzanne Moore, left, who was criticised for a piece in the New Statesman. Minister Lynne Featherstone has also called for Observer editor John Mulholland, right, to be sacked . Miss Burchill’s column also compared the attacks on Suzanne Moore to ‘the Black and White Minstrels telling Usain Bolt how to run’. She added: ‘I must say that my only experience of the trans lobby thus far was hearing about the vile way they have persecuted another of my friends, the veteran women’s rights and anti-domestic violence activist Julie Bindel – picketing events where she is speaking about such minor issues as the rape of children and the trafficking of women just because she refuses to accept that their relationship with their phantom limb is the most pressing problem that women – real and imagined – are facing right now.’ The row started when Suzanne Moore said in a column that modern women were expected to have bodies like 'Brazilian transsexuals'. Brazilian Cristini Couto is pictured posing after she was elected Miss Transexual International in Madrid . Miss Burchill was supported on Twitter by Miss Bindel, who writes for the Observer’s sister paper the Guardian. She said of her article: ‘This has been a long time coming, the bullying has to stop.’ But not all at the Guardian News & Media were so supportive. The Guardian website last night published a retort to Miss Burchill’s column by a transgender rights activist. Entitled ‘Julie Burchill has ended up bullying the trans community’, her article described Miss Burchill’s comments as a ‘list of negative epithets legitimising the currency of hate speech’. She added: ‘The basic point behind everything she says is that trans people lead essentially inauthentic existences and that hers, as a working-class novelist with a taste for lobster and champagne, is real life.’ Readers also took to the Observer website in their hundreds to complain about Ms Burchill's argument. Many readers described it as 'vile', 'shameful' and 'disgusting'. The Observer website version of Ms Burchill's article carried a message that said a number of complaints had been received since its publication. It said that it is subject to 'an inquiry' by the readers editor. The message from the Observer readers editor Stephen Pritchard said: 'As you might imagine, I have received many emails protesting about this piece this morning. 'Thank you to those who have written. I will be looking at this issue and will be replying to all in due course.' A poll of readers on the Independent website following the article saw 90 per cent deem Ms Burchill's article offensive. Ms Burchill, 53, is a self-confessed 'militant feminist'. As well as being a journalist from the age of 17, she is also an acclaimed novelist with her 1989 novel Ambition becoming a bestseller. Her 2004 novel Sugar Rush was adapted for television.","Julie Burchill has come under fire for a column in yesterday's Observer .

"When Glynis Barnett shows friends her new yellow diamond nestling in its jewellery box, they never fail to be impressed. ‘People always say how sparkly it is and compliment me on the fabulous colour,’ says Glynis, 63, a retired PA from Kent. ‘They’re so surprised when I tell them the diamond used to be my husband John. ‘I paid £5,000 to have a laboratory turn his ashes into the gem as a way to keep him close to me after he died.’ Scroll down for video . Glynis Barnett, 63, a retired PA from Kent, shows off the yellow diamond made from the ashes of her late husband John . It may sound like something from a sci-fi film, but these so-called ‘cremorials’ — tributes made from cremated ashes — are becoming ever more common. For £3,000, you can have your ashes pressed into vinyl records, or mixed with paint and painted into a favourite scene. Ashes can also be shot into space, floated out to sea in a model ship or even encased in concrete and turned into part of a man-made reef off the Dorset coast — a scheme created by Dorset Council for families to encase their loved ones’ ashes in concrete ‘bereavement balls’ and added to the reef, providing a home for marine wildlife. When John died in 2011, aged 64, following a long battle with throat and liver cancer, Glynis spent months wondering what to do with his ashes. ‘Although we had been married for 42 years, we never discussed in detail what we wanted if either of us should die,’ she says. ‘His ashes sat by the side of my bed for 18 months, while I struggled with my grief. Glynis with husband John. Despite beiing married for 42 years she says they never discussed in detail what they would do if one of them died. ‘I eventually decided to scatter them under the willow tree in our garden, but then I remembered a friend of mine who’d told me she planned to have her husband’s ashes turned into a diamond if anything happened to him. ‘I liked the idea I could take a little piece of John with me wherever I went. After months of research, I contacted Phoenix Memorial Diamonds in Manchester and ordered a .75 carat canary yellow gem. All I needed to do was send off 100g of John’s ashes by recorded post, and pay a deposit of £2,500.’ Turning ashes into a diamond is fairly straightforward, as both are comprised of the same substance: the element carbon (the human body is 18 per cent carbon, and the rest is mostly water). Natural diamonds are formed underground when carbon is put exposed to huge amounts of heat and pressure. Laboratory-grown diamonds are made by creating the same forces artificially. Glynis says her friends always admire the £5,000 yellow diamond she had made out of John's ashes . First, the ashes are heated to 1,300c until they become molten, then they are compressed at 10,000 tons per square inch for several weeks until they form a diamond crystal, which is chemically indistinguishable from a natural stone. Because the chemical make-up of each person’s ashes is unique, so is the size, clarity and precise colour of the stone that emerges. However, the natural colour of diamonds made from human ash is broadly canary yellow due to the nitrogen content in the ashes. These yellow laboratory diamonds sell for about £6,500 per carat — around 40 per cent less than the equivalent natural diamond, which costs more because it takes thousands of years to form, is scarce and has to be mined. Once the diamond crystal has been formed, it is cut and polished in the same way as a natural diamond would be. Glynis waited 12 weeks for her diamond to be delivered. ‘My youngest son Robert, 29, who works in finance, was incredibly suspicious of the whole process and insisted on being there when the diamond was delivered,’ she says. ‘He drove the courier to our local jeweller to have the gem tested before he’d let me pay the balance.’ Glynis is now hoping to get her diamond set into a ring, and plans to leave it to her daughter Lucie, 31, in her will. ‘John would have laughed at my extravagance, as I am pretty frugal by nature, but I feel it’s an important, lasting and very personal tribute to my beloved husband.’ Cremation expert Richard Martin says that memorialising a loved one — whether that means having some of their ashes made into a paperweight or even decanted into cartridges and fired from a shotgun — can be incredibly cathartic. ‘All that matters is that you feel you have chosen a fitting resolution for that person, your family and friends,’ he says. Sue White in her garden with the £645 sculpture that contains her late husband Bruce's ashes . Not all ‘cremorials’ are as subtle as Glynis’s diamond. When visitors step into Sue White’s manicured garden, the first thing they comment on is the striking modern sculpture, in the shape of a closed flower bud, rising from her rockery. ‘Of course, they’re a little taken aback when I tell them: “That’s Bruce — my late husband”,’ says Sue, 60, a company director from Ascot, Berkshire. Bruce, who ran a successful record label, was 68 when he died peacefully at home in November 2011 from lung cancer with Sue, son Julian, now 44, and daughter Natalie, 40, by his side. Once his funeral was over, Sue was at a loss as to what to do with his remains. ‘It was just too difficult to talk about once he became ill,’ says Sue. ‘The ashes were handed over to us a few days afterwards in an ugly plastic jar. I found it so painful to look at, I hid it in the garage for more than a year.’ A year on, Sue and Natalie decided to scatter some of the ashes in the garden of the family’s holiday home in Spain. ‘We thought about scattering the rest around our garden in England, but I quickly realised that if I ever moved house, it would mean leaving Bruce behind for good,’ says Sue. ‘After searching online, we decided on a memorial ornament instead — something that would be a tangible reminder of Bruce but portable, too. We bought it online from a specialist company called Scattering Ashes for £645 and had a small plaque made for it with Bruce’s name on. ‘It has an internal sphere that Natalie and I carefully opened and decanted the ashes into at the kitchen table. ‘I thought I would find that hard to do, but it was actually very cathartic. Now, every time I pop out to snip a few herbs for my cooking, I see the sculpture and feel connected to Bruce. ‘I sometimes wonder if he would be happy with what I’ve done — but I love the sculpture, and I’m sure he would be glad about that.’ Heidi Lewis, 42, with mum Pat whose last wish was that her family would have a party celebrating her life and send her ashes up in fireworks . Increasingly, people are leaving instructions in their wills about how they would like their ashes used. Heidi Lewis’s mother, Patricia Mitchell, 73, a retired market researcher, was very clear about what she wanted before she passed away from long-standing health problems on April 25. ‘Mum told me in no uncertain terms that she did not want a religious funeral, nor should anyone attend the crematorium,’ says Heidi, a 42-year-old student nurse and mother to Henry, 19, Stanley, 12, and Arney, nine, from Woking in Surrey. Heidi says she couldn't think of a better send off for her late mother . ‘Instead, she left £6,000 from a funeral savings plan for us to throw a big party to celebrate her life. ‘She said she wanted to have her ashes sent up in a firework display over Eel Pie Island, in the middle of the Thames at Twickenham. It’s the site of a famous jazz club that she used to love going to in the Sixties. ‘My sisters Lyndsay, Madeleine and I desperately wanted to hold the wake on her birthday, May 9,’ says Heidi. ‘It was all a bit of a rush, but we managed to courier some of Mum’s ashes to Heavenly Stars fireworks in Colchester, Essex. ‘They transferred around an egg cup-full into a large firework — a complete display in one package — at a cost of £249. ‘We organised a big group of family and friends to meet in a local pub, and then walk, accompanied by a New Orleans-style jazz band, to the Twickenham rowing club. ‘There were eulogies and poetry readings then, as it started to get dark, my eldest son lit the fuse on the firework display. ‘There were two minutes of spectacular flashes, bangs and colours as the fireworks scattered Mum’s ashes over the island she loved. ‘As the fireworks came to an end everyone cheered, clapped, whistled and yes, shed a few tears. ‘What better send-off could anyone ask for?’","Glynis Barnett, 63,  paid £5,000 to have a laboratory turn her husband's ashes into a gem .

"Many English people are now too embarrassed to fly the Cross of St George – because they think the nation's flag has become too ‘chavvy’. Almost a third would not display the flag because it has become associated with football and lager louts, a social anthropologist Kate Fox has said. A quarter were put off by its links to far right extremists, she said. Scroll down for video . Put off: Almost a third would not display the flag because it has become associated with football and lager louts, a social anthropologist Kate Fox has said. (File image) Miss Fox, co-director of the Social Issues Research Centre (SIRC), said the shunning of the flag by middle England had now become a ‘class problem’ rather than a political one. Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, she said most people in this country are ‘closet patriots’ but fear being judged by their peers if they embrace it. She said: ‘30 per cent don’t fly the flag because for them, it’s associated with football and the phrase they used is – I don’t like the word, but they said it’s a bit chavvy to fly the flag. So it’s got lower class associations. ‘It’s almost more of a class problem that the flag has now rather than a political problem.’ Fox, author of the bestseller Watching The English, said her research showed 83 per cent of people in England feel some pride in their country, with only three per cent never taking pride in it. But she added two thirds of us do not know the date of St George’s Day, and three quarters do not celebrate it in any way. Connotations: A quarter of people surveyed were put off by its links to far right extremists, social anthropologist Kate Fox said. Above, British National Front supporters march with the flag . She said her research showed that we are a ‘nation of closet patriots’ but that we valued ‘the importance of not being Earnest’ and felt ‘embarrassed’ about the big open shows of patriotism seen in other countries. ‘There’s this notion that the English lack all patriotic feeling,’ she said. ‘We take a bit of pride in our lack of national pride. It’s bizarre.’ Another factor is that the national flag has in recent years been embraced by far-right extremists, she said. ‘There are about 25 per cent of people for whom the association with the far right and racism puts them off flying the national flag,’ she said. ‘Although actually 60 per cent of people would like us to embrace St George’s Day, and fly the flag, 25 per cent of people do not do it because of those associations. ‘But if you think about it, the flag was only available for appropriation by extremists because the rest of the population already shunned it. ‘That’s how they were able to steal it – to highjack it.’ Fox also spoke about the impact of the internet and social media on our national identity, saying it had helped us become less reserved. She said: ‘The only thing that’s significantly changed is the advent of social media, where the English lose some of their Englishness. It’s a bit like being drunk. ‘The English online are uninhibited. ‘It’s like you’re down the pub.’ On our use of vocabulary, said that we collectively enjoyed feeling that we had the power of foresight over our lives, which is why many English people enjoyed using the word ‘typical’. She said: ‘You have to be able to say it in a way that sounds simultaneously peeved but also stoically resigned and shruggy. ‘And at the same time smugly omniscient - almost pleased that your predictions have been fulfilled. Everything may have gone pear shaped but you have not been taken unawares.’ And on tea, the nation’s favourite drink, she said she had underestimated its ‘magical properties’ when she joked about it in the first edition of her book. She said: ‘Of course, the next thing I saw was that, in the 7/7 bombings in London, concerned shop keepers rushed out to give aid and comfort to the walking wounded. ‘What did they take apart from blankets? Cups of tea. ‘You can imagine those shop keepers looking out and thinking oh god, I’ll put the kettle on.’","Almost a third think it has become associated with football and lager louts .

"Ola Toivonen's goal crowned a gutsy Sweden fight back in a 1-1 draw with Russia but, ever the tough taskmaster, Fabio Capello thought the visitors should have easily won the Euro 2016 qualifier on Thursday.

We started the game well, until their goal we played well. It felt like a punch in the stomach when they went 1-0 up,' he said. 'We missed a penalty and yet we came back.

"The entertainment for tourists on the coast of Negril, Jamaica is somewhat jaw-dropping. For this is where daredevil divers take to shanty wooden boards and dive some 100ft into the narrow pools of sea-water. Rick's Cafe is a famous site where you can watch the skilled locals, as well as tourists, take their respective leaps of faith. The extent of the challenge is captured perfectly by the GoPro camera . Locals take donations from tourists for attempting the death-defying dives . In this incredible video shot with a GoPro camera, one local takes the diving to another level. He spends about a minute taking in the surroundings and views as he perches aboard a self-made, wooden diving board. There are swimming pools, boats out to sea, tourists soaking up the sun, cliffs and trees, at the tranquil resort. The true extent of the challenge he will take on becomes apparent - not only is he 100ft above the sea, but a closer look at his entry point into the water is grim viewing - the view is punctuated by deep-lying rocks. A quick look into the lens, an exclamation of confidence, and then the Jamaican thrill-seeker leaps off the board, with camera in tow. While some people are contemplating more relaxing activities, this diver is ready for a challenge . Tourists can dive from 35ft or so; the higher divers are left to the experts . The daredevil local is safe and well after his cliff dive . The speed of travel and entry leaves the view in a bit of a haze before the camera pans to some underwater shots - capturing the many rocks on the sea bed that the diver manages to dodge. 'GoPro no problem Jamaica' shouts the delighted diver after bringing the camera to the surface. The action was captured after a tourist passed the camera to one of the skilled local divers. Rick's Cafe on Negril, Jamaica, is a famous spot to watch cliff diving .

"Goalkeeper Hope Solo has been reinstated by U.S. Soccer after a 30-day suspension and is on the travel roster for next month's Algarve Cup in Portugal. Solo was suspended last month by the U.S. Soccer Federation after her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, was arrested in Southern California on suspicion of driving under the influence in a U.S. team van. Solo, in training camp at the time, was with Stevens when he was pulled over. U.S. women's national team coach Jill Ellis announced Solo's inclusion on the Algarve Cup 25-player travel roster on Saturday. She's back: U.S. starting goalkeeper Hope Solo was reinstated after a formal review by U.S. Soccer. She missed two games during her 30-day suspension following her husband's arrest on drunken driving charges . Troubled: Solo was suspended  after her husband, former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, was arrested in Southern California on suspicion of driving under the influence in a U.S. team van . Ellis will name a 23-player tournament roster before the competition, which starts on March 4. The United States, playing in its 20th Algarve Cup, opens with Norway. U.S. Soccer has not specified the reason for suspending Solo in the fitrst place, however TMZ understands it was connected to the fact that Stevens was driving a team van. The goalkeeper was reportedly almost arrested for disorderly conduct after she became 'belligerent' while officers conducted the traffic stop. She was in Southern California for training camp with the U.S. national team, which is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June. Solo has posted inspirational messages from fans on social media during her absence, and cheered on the national team in exhibition games in Europe. The United States fell 2-0 against France before beating England 1-0 with goalkeeper Ashlyn Harris starting in both games. Solo's suspension came at a critical time for the U.S. team, which is preparing for the Women's World Cup this summer in Canada. 'The situation warranted a consequence, and we thought it was reasonable,' Ellis said about Solo before the team traveled to Europe. 'This is important for us to be able to focus the players that we have on these games and then allow Hope some time to sort of reflect on some things.' The goalkeeper was dismissed in January from training camp in Southern California, where the team is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June . Hope Solo was in the car when her husband Jerramy Stevens, pictured together in 2013, was arrested for drunk driving . It was the latest off-field trouble for the 33-year-old Olympian, considered one of the best goalkeepers in the women's game. Earlier this year, a judge dismissed two misdemeanor counts of domestic violence against her. Jerramy Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California . The charges stemmed from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in Washington state last June. Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial. Her last appearance in a match with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. In a statement released following her suspension, Solo said: 'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.' A representative for Solo did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Algarve roster also includes Christine Rampone (back), Megan Rapinoe (right knee), who were injured during the team's January training camp in Carson, California, and did not play the two matches in Europe. Newly married forward Sydney Leroux, who had been nursing a sore ankle, was also included. The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title, but first since 1991.","Solo, 33, was suspended for 30 days following incident on January 19 .

"A devastating volcanic eruption and two decades of wars have forced this airport into abandonment - and created the best playground a Congolese street child could hope for. Photographer Christopher Michael Brown captured these breathtaking images of Goma Airport, during a visit to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. A brief lapse in security meant that the street children could guide him through the planes and show him how they have been selling the parts at a nearby market. The New York-based photographer said: 'One is generally prohibited from photographing this airport but in mid-December 2012 after the M23 rebel force which occupied Goma left and before the FARDC, military of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, returned to the city, a security vacuum meant that nobody was guarding this section of the airport.

"The pilot of a civilian jet was left red-faced after he veered off a runway during a test run. The jet, an Embraer E-175, was performing a high-speed taxi test with a crew of two at Kansas City International Airport when the pilot lost control and hurtled into a grassy area at the side of the runway. Airport spokesman Joe McBride described Wednesday's incident on Twitter as a ‘mishap’. Bungling: An Embraer E-170 was performing a high-speed taxi test with a crew of two at Kansas City International Airport when the pilot lost control . Safe and sound: The two crew members on board were not injured, according to an airport spokesman . He said: 'A Republic Airlines Embraer E175 veered off Kansas City International Airport Runway 19L at the end of a test high-speed taxi run. 'The two crew members on board were not injured and there was no apparent aircraft damage. The runway was closed for several hours, but the airport remained open through use of Runway 9/27.' The aircraft spent several hours on the grass while arrangements were made to have it towed to a hangar. Mr McBride added that the runway it was using was already closed for maintenance. The plane was due to be used in a later service to Washington DC, so passengers were rebooked on another flight, Mr McBride said. Stranded: The aircraft spent several hours on the grass while arrangements were made to have it towed away . Removal services: The plane was eventually towed away with the aid of specialist equipment . The incident follows news that Brazilian plane maker Embraer is telling airlines to inspect pins or bolts that hold the engines on its twin-engine E190 regional jet – a different model to the one that slid of the runway in Kansas. An Embraer spokeswoman said that the company sent a service bulletin to airlines as a preventive measure, and called the action routine. The company declined further comment. Virgin Australia grounded several of its Embraer E190s after discovering a problem with bolts that hold the engines to pylons that are attached to the wings, prompting Embraer to issue a worldwide alert, according to published reports in Australia. During inspections, maintenance crews found loose bolts ""to various degrees"" on 12 of the 20 E190s flown by US Airways Express, part of American Airlines Group, company spokesman Paul Flaningan told The Associated Press. He said that the bolts were tightened and the planes returned to flying the same day. JetBlue Airways had 60 of the planes at the start of the year, according to a regulatory filing. The E190 has between 98 and114 seats, according to Embraer's website. Airlines tend to use it on routes where they might not sell enough tickets to fill a larger plane such as a Boeing 737 or Airbus A320.

"Twelve months ago, Ayoze Perez was playing Spanish second-tier football in front of just 10,000 short-sleeved supporters on the holiday island of Tenerife. Life was good; he was turning out for his hometown club and his friends and family were in the stands to enjoy his breakthrough season. Twelve months on and the 21-year-old is a Premier League regular playing in front of 52,000 at St James’ Park, some 2,500 miles from his Canary Island nest. Ayoze Perez (left) has already received heavy praise from his manager at Newcastle, Alan Pardew . The Newcastle team celebrate with Perez after he scored the winning goal against Liverpool at St James' Life, however, is even better; he is scoring goals as part of a winning team – his audacious back-heel at West Brom ‘the best I have ever scored’ – and earning plaudits aplenty, from his Newcastle manager Alan Pardew to club legend Alan Shearer. But the surrounds are very different. Gone are the balmy winters which would welcome late-night tapas and trips to the beach. Instead, Friday night sees Perez and his brother, Samuel, don their coats and head to Kingston Park to watch Newcastle Falcons rugby team, even picking up fish and chips on their way home. One thing which the drop in temperature has not dulled, however, is Perez’s goalscoring instinct. Sixteen for Tenerife last term has been followed by three from as many starts for the Magpies. It’s little wonder that his fish-and-chip paper has been carrying his name in recent weeks. ‘I’ve settled in much quicker than I ever imagined I would,’ says Perez, who headed the decisive goal at Spurs, nicked the winner against Liverpool and added his goal-of-the-season contender at The Hawthorns. Perez spreads his arms wide in celebration after scoring at The Hawthorns against West Brom . The Spain U21 international (second left) has a shot blocked by Queens Park Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green . ‘Being in Newcastle is a very different way of life to Tenerife. For a start the climate is very different. ‘The city itself is beautiful and I really love being here and I’m trying different traditions. I have been to the rugby and have even tried fish and chips. Yes, I do feel the cold and I have been told by a lot of people that this is nothing and there is much more to come. ‘But I have lots of coats and jumpers ready and I am happy to adapt. It won’t be a problem.’ Nothing, it seems, is a problem for the Spain Under-21 striker at present, on or off the pitch. Pardew says Perez is ‘a nice, bright boy and low maintenance to manage’ while labelling him ‘a fearless predator’ on the field. In the wake of his £1.6million arrival in June, however, Pardew suggested this would be a season of adaptation for the rookie, who spoke very little English. As it is, with Papiss Cisse struggling for fitness and others out of form, Perez is leading the line in a side which has won six on the spin. Perez takes the applause of the Newcastle faithful as he leaves the pitch at St James' Park . Perez takes on QPR defender Richard Dunne during Newcastle's Premier League match on November 22 . ‘I am a bit surprised at how quickly I have adapted (on the pitch) and how well things are going, but I have never questioned whether I would be a success because being confident is a really important part of being a footballer,’ adds Perez, who enjoyed his best game yet during Saturday’s 1-0 win over QPR which lifted Newcastle to fifth. ‘I know my own ability and what I can achieve. I know I am smaller than a lot of players and that I have to improve physically, but I enjoy going to the gym and training on my own because I can see the benefits of it further down the line. ‘I am aware I still have a lot to improve on, but the most important thing is that Newcastle are at the right end of the table and if I can play my part in that I will be very satisfied.’ This, then, is still very much the start of Perez’s story, although he admits the narrative is gathering pace. Indeed, two months ago he was playing for United’s under-21s against Carlisle. ‘Things have changed quite a lot for me in just a few weeks,’ he reflects. ‘The Tottenham game was a great opportunity for me. Making the team was a great honour and I knew I had to grab that chance with both hands. ‘To score was a dream come true - and I don’t score with too many headers. ‘In the past, I have only scored one or two so if you had told me my first Premier League goal would be a header, I would not have believed it. ‘Then to score the winner against Liverpool was amazing. This is a memory I will cherish for the rest of my life. I will always remember that game and what the goal meant, the celebrations with the fans and the noise inside the stadium. ‘Whatever happens for the rest of my career and in my life, that will live with me forever.’ With Perez, you get the impression the best is yet to come.","Ayoze Perez was playing second-tier Spanish football 12 months ago .

"Using a dummy could protect babies from cot death, according to new Australian research. Newborns who suck on dummies are less likely to die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome because they have better cardiac control, the research suggests. And scientists at the Monash Institute of Medical Research in Clayton found that the protective effects of the dummy remain even after it has fallen out of the sleeping baby’s mouth. Sucking on dummies reduces the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome because helps control a baby's heartrate. Associate Professor Rosemary Horne told ABC Science that previous studies have shown that using a dummy reduces the risk of cot death, however, she added that until now no one has been clear as to why this is the case. Professor Horne explained that cot death is probably caused by the failure of the baby to wake itself up if its breathing stops, or if it experiences a dramatic fall in blood pressure. Therefore, she believes that sucking a dummy must work either by increasing the baby’s chance of waking up or by improving its cardiac control – its ability to regulate its heart rate. The professor then drew the conclusion that it must improve cardiac control as it would be counterintuitive to assume that a dummy increases arousal when it is given to a baby to help it get to sleep. Babies who use a dummy have more variation in their heart rate, which is a sign that their cardiac system is responding to changes in their blood pressure . To test her hypothesis, Professor Horne and her team studied 37 healthy babies during daytime naps. They . found that babies who were using a dummy had more variation in their . heart rate, which is a sign that their cardiac system was responding to . changes in their blood pressure. According to the NHS: . You should not give a . baby a dummy until breastfeeding is well established, at about one month old. Dummies should be stopped when the baby is between six and . 12-months-old. You should place your baby on their back to sleep. Do not smoke while you are pregnant or in the same room as your baby. Do not share a bed with your baby. Never sleep with your baby on a sofa or chair. Never let them overheat - they should sleep in a room between 16 and 20 degrees C. Never allow their head become covered - their blanket should come no higher than their shoulders. For more information visit the NHS Choices website . This applied even at times when they were not actually sucking on the dummy. However, . further research is required as Professor Horne told ABC Science: ‘I . don't think heart rate variability is the full story.’ Professor Horne does not yet know why it is that sucking a dummy improves a baby’s cardiac control. The NHS acknowledges that using a dummy at the start of sleep can reduce the risk of cot death. However, it says that there is not strong evidence to encourage the promotion of dummy use. It says that a baby should not be given a dummy until breastfeeding is well established, at about one month old, and that its use should be stopped when the baby is between six and 12-months-old. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome is the sudden and unexplained death of an apparently healthy baby. In the UK at least 300 babies die from it each year with the most deaths occurring in babies under three-months-old. Those born prematurely or with low birth weight are at greater risk, as are baby boys. Most cot deaths occur at night and the exact cause is not known.","Newborn babies that use dummies are less likely to die from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome .

"Google acted illegally when it collected data on people's online activities through their Wi-Fi systems, the U.S. Court of Appeals has ruled - leaving them wide open to damages claims which could total billions of dollars. The court's decision is a setback for the web giant, which gathered the information via its Street View cars, and other firms which rely on collecting large amounts of data. Campaigners hailed the ruling, saying it was a 'landmark decision for internet privacy' which established that Wi-Fi networks were private. The decision announced yesterday by the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco is the latest twist in Google's long-running battle to avoid legal action over the date collection, which it claims was a mistake which has now ended. Violation: Google has been criticised for gathering data from people's houses with its Street View cars . Upholding an earlier ruling by a federal court, the appeal judges wrote: 'The payload data transmitted over unencrypted Wi-Fi networks that was captured by Google included emails, usernames, passwords, images, and documents.' Google argued that its activities were exempt from wiretap laws, because data transmitted over Wi-Fi is a 'radio communication' which is 'readily accessible to the public'. But the court wrote: 'Even if it is commonplace for members of the general public to connect to a neighbor's unencrypted Wi-Fi network, members of the general public do not typically mistakenly intercept, store, and decode data transmitted by other devices on the network.' A spokesman for the company said after the announcement that lawyers for Google 'disappointed in the 9th Circuit's decision and are considering our next steps'. Street View cars travel the world photographing streets for the firm's Google Maps website - but unbeknownst to householders, the cars also collected detailed information on personal communication and web browsing between 2008 and 2010. Setback: The firm has apologised for the intrusion but insisted that it was unintentional . 'This appeals court decision is a tremendous victory for privacy rights,' said John Simpson of Consumer Watchdog. 'It means Google can't suck up private communications from people's Wi-Fi networks and claim their ""Wi-Spying"" was exempt from federal wiretap laws. 'Because Google's ""Wi-Spy"" activity was so extensive, the potential damages could amount to billions of dollars.' Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called it 'a landmark decision for internet privacy.' He said: 'Users should be protected when a company tries to capture data that travels between their laptop and their printer in their home.' Earlier this year Google settled a lawsuit for $7million after attorney generals of 37 states sued over the alleged invasion of privacy. A number of plaintiffs have joined a class-action suit against the firm which is now free to continue after the appeals court's decision. After the data-collection was discovered in 2010 by a German official, Google co-founder Sergey Brin admitted that the company had 'screwed up'.","U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco upholds federal court's ruling .

"Armed Russian police today raided the homes of anti-Putin activists today ahead of a mass demonstration in a major new crackdown on dissent. The fresh wave of arrests was today compared with the days of Stalin by opponents on Russian language Twitter. Hello1937 was trending on the social networking site - referring to the year 1937 which was seen as the worst for Stalin purges. Raiders: A man wearing a balaclava walks past two policemen holding submachine guns outside opposition blogger Alexei Navalny's house in Moscow today . The coordinated early-morning raids targeted the young politicians who were thought to represent the biggest threat to Putin's 12-year rule. The Investigative Committee said the raids targeted Alexei Navalny as well as Ilya Yashin and Sergei Udaltsov over a previous demonstration 'that ended in mass disturbances'. 'I never thought we will go back to be a country of such repressions,' said 30-year-old television presenter and campaigner Ksenia Sobchak, who was targeted. 'Most disgusting is that completely unlawfully people can storm in, simply rob you, and laugh at your private letters.' Other Putin foes warned of a return to Stalin-style tactics to suppress freedoms. More than a dozen officers with assault rifles beat down the doors of leading anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, 36, a figure rapidly emerging as Putin's most effective foe. 'Purges': A masked Russian security serviceman enters the apartment block where anti-corruption blogger and opposition activist Alexei Navalny lives .

Targeted: The glamorous Ksenia Sobchak who today condemned the 'repressions' The heavy-handed raids on ten top oppositions activists seem aimed at disrupting a major rally against Putin in Moscow today. Computers and phones were removed. Navalny and Sobchak were also summoned for questioning today over disturbances at a May 6 protest, preventing them from attending the major Moscow demonstration. The raids signal a new get-tough policy by the Russian elite - and Navalny together with other key opposition figures could face jail for up to ten years over clashes with police. Last week Putin - who recently began a new six-year term as president - signed into strict new curbs on protests. The authorities have authorised up to . 50,000 people to take part in today's rally at the site of a December . protest against that month's fraud-tainted parliamentary polls.

"Earlier this month, after Harry Kane scored twice against Arsenal at White Hart Lane, the Tottenham forward claimed nothing could beat a north London derby. He spoke too soon.

The place was bedlam, with young and old hugging each other in the old stands, uncertain whether to turn to Kane as he celebrated in front of the Paxton Road or flick two fingers at the 2,868 West Ham supporters. In the end they did both. Whatever makes them happy, because this was a rank Tottenham performance as they hurtle towards a week when they must at least score and draw with Fiorentina to make progress in the Europa League. They were saved here by the stupidity of Alex Song, foolishly lulled into the shove on Kane in the 94th minute that predictably, had to be, a penalty. The Tottenham forward is a clever so-and-so. ‘You can see why he’s give it - Alex has put his hands on him,’ admitted West Ham’s manager Sam Allardyce. The poor fella’s bubble has well and truly burst at Upton Park and it isn’t just because they threw away a two-goal lead at the home of their greatest rivals. He even found it hard to credit Kane. ‘It was lucky because he missed the penalty and luckily it went to him to finish it off,’ he added. Without the perseverance of Kane, 24 goals to the good as he goes head to head with Raheem Sterling for the PFA young player of the year award, Spurs would not have rescued a point here. They were two nil down to West Ham, thrown out of kilter by the constant, menacing presence of Mark Noble in the centre of midfield alongside Song. They pretty much won everything in there. It was only when Noble was substituted in the 66th minute, a sensible decision before his tiring legs caught one too many Spurs players, that West Ham lost their grip on the game. Until then he had excelled, save for his inevitable booking, and he had even set up the second goal for Allardyce’s team in the 62nd minute. Back to the beginning, though, and the moment West Ham supporters could, with some justification, sing ‘Tottenham Hotspur, it’s happening again’. The reasoning behind Mauricio Pochettino’s decision to withdraw Mousa Dembele at half-time in favour of Christian Eriksen (and Lord only knows why he did not start) lay in the midfielder’s error in the build up to Cheikhou Kouyate’s 22nd minute header. Shuffling around on the ball, idling with it on the edge of the Tottenham penalty area while you wait for a wide-eyed eastender who is foaming at the mouth is not the way to approach a game of this significance. Alex Song brings down Kane in the final minute of the game to give away a penalty at White Hart Lane . Kane takes the subsequent spot-kick but Adrian guesses right and saves the initial shot . Kane missed the penalty but scored the rebound with the final kick of the game on Sunday afternoon . Tottenham's 24-goal striker wheels away after scoring the equaliser in the final seconds of the match .

Sakho is congratulated by his West Ham team-mates after scoring the second goal of the afternoon in the second half . Tottenham captain Lloris makes a superb save from Enner Valencia to keep the score at 1-0 during the first half . West Ham pinched the ball off Dembele’s toes, Aaron Cresswell steered in a cross from the left and Kouyate, predictably, caught Jan Vertonghen and Eric Dier napping. On the touchline Allardyce was in full combat mode, barking at fourth official Mike Dean over a series of innocuous decisions before West Ham took command of this game. The guy is under pressure, with some serious decisions to be made up in the West Ham boardroom after David Sullivan was ambushed by an angry mob in the car park at the Hawthorns last week. He looked good for the three points here, their first since January 18, when Diafra Sakho slid in the at the far post to meet Noble’s 62nd minute cross swung in from the left. They should have seen it through, even without Noble for the last 24 minutes and the enforced substitution of the substitute Carlton Cole because he pulled up lame with a hamstring injury. Until then, Tottenham had poked around a bit in midfield without ever looking likely to score. Kane shot tamely wide and Danny Rose headed over the crossbar in an ultimately dreadful first half performance. The second wasn’t much better, that was until Adrian punched away Erik Lamela’s cross from the right and into the path of Tottenham’s left back on the edge of the area. Rose’s effort, partially botched and completely fortuitous, was driven into the ground and somehow beat the sightline of West Ham’s keeper in the 81st minute. He owed his team-mates for that, brilliantly pawing away Roberto Soldado’s shot two minutes later as White Hart Lane responded to the growing sense that something special was about to happen. When it did, deep into injury-time, Kane’s penalty was initially saved by Adrian before the Tottenham striker reacted quickest to the rebound to make it 2-2.

"A pair of cruel art students in Germany are defying authorities - and moral decency - by promising to forge ahead with the ritual decapitation of a lamb in the name of art. The callous students in Berlin plan to use a home-made guillotine to behead the defenceless animal online for thousands to witness. Their sick project, titled 'An Experiment Experiment Representing the Current Conditions Surrounding Democracy' involves a public vote as to whether the lamb is decapitated. Sick: The students have put their project to a public vote to decide whether the defenceless lamb is killed on the internet . Artists Rouven Materne and Iman Reza have so far received over 200,000 public votes as to whether they should kill the lamb live online . So far 200,000 have taken part in the experiment, with voting thought to be fairly equal ahead of the deadline in the middle of May. The razor-sharp blade of the guillotine alone weighs 80lbs, and the would-be killers promise that their intended victim will 'feel no pain.' It also remains unclear at present whether their cyberspace threat is some kind of sick provocation of the local prosecutors' office and outraged citizens, or whether they seriously intend to go ahead with it. Iman Rezai and Rouven Materne are the bizarre brains behind the project and on their website display the intended sacrificial lamb. In the background of the video, which also appears on YouTube is the voice of Berlin University of Art lecturer Leiko Ikemura. She can also be heard laughing on the video as the students build their pink, orange and yellow execution machine while puffing on Arabic-style water pipes. The two German artists said they painted their guillotine in bright colours to reflect the 'colourful and deadly' nature of society . 'The colours were to fend off the despondent mood we sometimes felt while building the machine,' said Rezai. He adds; 'Yes clearly, this is a weapon. Yet there are thousands of businesses that manufacture weapons. But not such a pretty gypsy-coloured weapon! It is a reflection of our society - colourful but deadly.' Causing the death of an animal in Germany without reasonable cause is an offence in Germany that is punishable by up to three years in jail. Prosecutors in Berlin said they are following the case of the lamb 'with interest.' Materne, 24, claimed the piece of performance art was a 'criticism of current morality What must be done is something that comes directly from art - from the subconscious.' Rezai, 31, originally from Iran but who came to Germany in the 1980s, added: 'What will be will be. There is no why or where about it.'","Pair could face three-year jail term under German law .

"Mo Farah has apologised for his Twitter spat with fellow 5,000m and 10,000m runner Andy Vernon, saying he has learned a lot from the episode. Farah was involved in a lengthy heated exchange with Vernon on Tuesday night, during which he called his Great Britain team-mate 'an embarrassment'. 'I've definitely learned a lot. I apologise to all the fans and the public out there,' the 31-year-old said. He had been responding after Vernon, who earned his best career result to date when he was second to Farah in the European 10,000m last summer, criticised the lack of high-level competition to face Farah in Birmingham on Saturday. The record breaking 31-year-old athlete salutes the Birmingham crowd after crossing the finish line . Farah added on BBC Radio Five's Sportsweek programme on Sunday morning: 'I shouldn't have made the comments I did. To be honest with you, I reacted... my reaction got the best of me - 100 per cent. I apologise and we've just got to move on.' Fired up by the public feud, which saw Somali-born Farah's claims his team-mate questioned his nationality branded 'lies' by his rival, the double Olympic champion roared to a new world indoor best of eight minutes 03.40 seconds over two miles at the Sainsbury's Indoor Grand Prix. Farah later denied that he had anything to prove as he roared to victory days after the Vernon row. The double Olympic champion slots in behind the pace maker on his way to setting his first world record . Farah poses behind the clock in Birmingham showing his world indoor record of eight minutes, 40 seconds . Asked if he felt he had a point to prove, Farah said: 'Not at all. I always knew I wanted to go for a world record. 'Training has been going pretty well. For me, I just wanted to go out there and see what I can do.' It was the first time the double world champion has broken a world record, but he hopes it will not be his last. 'I can't get excited just breaking one record,' he said. 'I've got to continue doing what I'm doing.' Farah was speaking inside the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east London, to launch the Sainsbury's Anniversary Games which will be held at the venue in July. The inside of the venue looked like a building site as its transformation takes place to host West Ham. But Farah revealed it was still special to return to the site of the London Olympics. He said: 'It looks different to when I raced at the Olympics in 2012, but we're working on it. 'It brings back great memories just looking at the track now and thinking, 'where was the home straight? where was the crowd?', and getting that feeling back. 'It's great to be able to know this is going to be our home ground for the next 50 years. 'I can bring my kids to a home where we can come over and watch the athletics every year.'

Speaking in response to the shameful incident in Paris this week in which Chelsea supporters prevented a black man from boarding a train while chanting: 'We're racist and that's the way we like it.' Speaking on BT Sport :'I think a lot of people became a bit complacent with racism because we're not hearing it so much in stadiums in our country people believe we've done the job. Former England defender Rio Ferdinand speaking about racism on the 'Fletch and Sav' show on BT . Chelsea fans were filmed chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' while on the train . 'It's been simmering, it's there. We thought football was a tool to suppress it (racism). It's a good vehicle but the bigger issue is society and education - to get into people's homes and schools to educate away from this ignorance.' The ex-Manchester United man, now with QPR, wrote on Twitter on Saturday that 'complacency' has allowed racism to prevail and reiterated those comments in a column for the Sun on Sunday. But he wrote: 'To be fair to the (Football Association), they have done more than most to try to eradicate racism from the stands. 'We are the standard-bearers. It's not like going to parts of Eastern Europe when you would be thinking to yourself 'what are we going to get here?'. Even those people who are racists here tend to go into a stadium and turn the mute button on for 90 minutes. 'But the game as a whole has to take a zero-tolerance approach. For years it's been clear than FIFA and UEFA have shied away from doing what they needed to do. They have let football down time and time again.' The man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform . The Metropolitan police released images of three men they are keen to speak to following the incident in Paris . The incident at the Richelieu-Drouot Metro station, which occurred ahead of Chelsea's Champions League game against Paris St Germain on Tuesday, was captured in mobile phone footage, which Ferdinand views as a positive development. 'The good thing to come out of what happened is that it showed how society is now so full of camera phones that to think you can get away with that sort of behaviour is crazy,' he wrote. 'Social media platforms help identify people. Anyone who acts like this and gets caught will be embarrassed when they go to work now. 'But we need to find a way of weeding out the people with these ignorant feelings and help educate them. Just punishing them is not enough.' Professional Footballers' Association trustee Brendon Batson called for assault charges to be brought after the man, identified in media reports as Souleymane S, was physically as well as racially attacked. Ferdinand captaining QPR during their Premier League defeat away at Hull City on Saturday . Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright and former Manchester United defender Ferdinand talking on BT Sport . Batson told BBC Radio Five's Sportsweek programme: 'This guy on the Paris Metro was assaulted, he was pushed violently a couple of times, and I think if there are any criminal laws to be enforced then that should be done as well. 'I was very shocked when I saw the pictures and extremely upset, not just for the individual concerned but for football in general because I thought those days were long gone. 'Within stadiums, they just don't have a voice, these people - I wouldn't even call them supporters - but it manifests itself in what we saw in those pictures from Paris. I think there's a totally different behaviour (when fans go abroad) because they know they can't get away with it over here, that's for sure. 'We get very upset when we see our teams, particularly the black players, being subjected to that sort of language when they play abroad. 'Now we've got people travelling, supposedly under the culture of Chelsea, spewing out that sort of language. It is extremely embarrassing, very upsetting, really disgusting, it doesn't paint British football in the right light and we know that 99 per cent of supporters are better than that.'","Rio Ferdinand believes society has become complacent over racism .

"Privately educated Kunal Chaudhary, 32, was a senior manager at Deloitte in Manchester. Seemingly respectable, he was secretly a sex trafficker . An accountant at one of Britain’s top firms led a double life as a sex trafficker. Privately educated Kunal Chaudhary, 32, was a senior manager at Deloitte in Manchester. Outwardly respectable, he was secretly part of a gang who tricked women into coming to Britain where they were forced to have sex with up to 20 men a day. Almost all the victims were trafficked from Hungary. Many applied online for what they believed were administrative, cleaning and babysitting jobs. After their arrival in England, however, they were forced or coerced into prostitution at brothels around London. Kunal Chaudhary worked at Deloitte’s Spinningfields offices in Manchester city centre and was part of a criminal ring based in London that controlled at least 120 women with threats of violence and intimidation. The gang would also take hold of their passports to exert further control over them. Ring leader Vishal Chaudhary, 35, used various pseudonyms, including Rahul Singh and Aresh Khan, in order to disguise his true identity. Until days before his arrest, he lived in a smart block of flats in Canary Wharf and drove a Mercedes convertible, as part of his comfortable lifestyle. Vishal and Kunal Chaudhary, along with three other accomplices, were arrested early last year. Croydon Crown Court heard how flights were booked for at least 120 women, while others picked the women up from Stansted airport and delivered them to brothels in Barnet, Camden, Waltham Forest, Haringey, Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Brent, Westminster, Enfield, Hounslow, Islington and Kensington and Chelsea. They charged clients between £30 and £100 per hour. Privately educated Kunal Chaudhary, 32, was a senior manager here at Deloitte in Manchester. He was sacked by the firm on his conviction . Kunal Chaudhary denied any wrongdoing but was found guilty after a trial at Croydon Crown Court. He was convicted of conspiracy to traffic persons into the UK for sexual exploitation, conspiracy to control prostitution and concealing criminal property. He will be sentenced with his co-defendants at a later date. A spokesman for Deloitte said: ‘Kunal Chaudhary is a former employee of the firm. ‘The police have made it clear that these terrible offences were not in any way connected with his employment at Deloitte. ‘As soon as the charges were confirmed, he was suspended without pay and following his conviction he was dismissed without notice.’","Privately educated Kunal Chaudhary, 32, was a senior manager in Manchester .

"Nemaja Matic’s red card against Burnley on Saturday comes as a severe blow for Jose Mourinho’s Capital One Cup final plans. The 26-year-old midfielder was sent off for pushing Burnley player forward Ashley Barnes following an awful challenge on the Serbian during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. Barnes mistimed his challenge, catching Matic with his studs, but it was missed by referee Martin Atkinson who did not even give a free kick to the title challengers. Ashley Barnes chops down Nemanja Matic during the 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Burnley on Saturday . Unsurprisingly Matic sees red and pushed the Burnley player to the ground out of anger on Saturday . The Serbian international will now face a three game suspension for his antics, leaving a Matic shaped gap in Mourinho’s squad to face Tottenham at Wembley on Sunday. Matic will also miss big games against London rivals West Ham and Champions League chasing Southampton as part of his suspension.

Jose Mourinho voices his frustrations during the dissapointing draw with Premier League strugglers Burnley . Garry Liddle and Andrew Davies  celebrate at the end of the FA Cup Fourth Round match win against Chelsea . Matic was not in the squad when Chelsea lost their unbeaten record to Alan Pardew’s Newcastle in early December. And he also sat out the embarrassing defeat to Bradford City in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge back in January. Chelsea have a win percentage of more than 70 per cent when Matic lines up in midfield which drops to just 33 per cent when he is not named in Mourinho's squad. The only taste of defeat Matic has tasted with the Blues this season was against London rivals Tottenham in a 5-3 goal fest at White Hart Lane. Having Matic in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game. Only fellow Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has completed more passes than Matic this season.

"After a dour first half, Everton and Leicester City shared four goals between them after the break in a pulsating final half hour at Goodison Park. Steven Naismith fired the Toffees into the lead in the 57th minute with a scuffed effort. Everton's opening goal forced Nigel Pearson into action with the Foxes boss springing Jamie Vardy and David Nugent from the bench. The duo made an immediate impact as Vardy set up Nugent for the equaliser. Esteban Cambiasso pounced from close range to put the visitors in front but Matthew Upson's own goal earned Everton a late draw. Click here for the full match report. Host commentator . A frantic finish at Goodison as Everton clear the lines. The Foxes looked on course for victory after Nigel Pearson's inspired double substitution of Jamie Vardy and David Nugent. Romelu Lukaku put a tough afternoon behind him to salvage a point for his side. The Toffees stay in 12th in the table as chorus of boos rings out at Goodison. Atsu has a go but Schwarzer saves well as Everton get a corner. Lukaku gets onto the end of Baines' delivery but Upson makes a superb block . It's been a torrid half for Lukaku but he makes amends with a wonderful finish. Atsu latches onto McCarthy's inviting pass and crosses for Lukaku who heads home from close range to even the scores once more. A fine finish from him after a difficult outing at Goodison... Baines fires in a low driving shot into the Leicester and Lukaku directs it goalwards but his placed ball drifts just the right of the goal. Three days ago, the Everton striker was scoring for fun. Today, he has never looked likely in front of goal. The Foxes are shutting up shop and are inviting Everton onto them as the home side chase an equaliser. Atsu gets free inside the box but he can't get a shot away with Coleman firing over from close range moments later. Fascinating final 10 minutes in store here... The game now has a realistic scoreline and Nigel Pearson’s double substitution, injecting the pace of Jamie Vardy and the poaching of David Nugent, has reaped dividends. They have been given a considerable helping hand, however, by Tim Howard. The normally assured American goalkeeper has fatally blundered twice and the mood around Goodison is boiling. Roberto Martinez will not be dissuaded from searching for goalkeeper cover in the summer. Howard makes a mess of Simpson's cross from the right with Vardy latching onto the loose ball and firing goalwards and it's the Argentine veteran Cambiasso who pounces to give Leicester the lead here with 20 minutes remaining. Just to compound matters for Everton, Lukaku botches another chance on goal soon after. McCarthy plays a great pass to Lukaku but the striker blazes over the bar with just Mark Schwarzer to beat. It's been that kind of an afternoon for the Belgian today. Nigel Pearson sends on Jamie Vardy and David Nugent and the duo make their presence felt almost immediately! Riyad Mahrez and Jeff Schlupp were called ashore as Pearson went looking for an equaliser. Vardy makes a storming run down the right and strikes for goal. Howard did well to save his shot but Nugent shows great instincts to fire the ball in from close range. It's taken almost an hour, but this game has suddenly come to life. Did not see that coming. Everton in front with a scruffy goal from Steven Naismith but it was against the run of play. Leicester had looked much the likelier side to score in the opening 12 minutes. Everton have made two substitutions, with Ross Barkley and Mo Besic being replaced by Darron Gibson and Christian Atsu. The Besic replacement was unpopular with home fans, who booed the sight of his number being raised. Not Steven Naismith's cleanest strike, but the Toffees won't be worrying too much about that. Lukaku showed great strength to hold off Upson and Morgan in the box before passing to Naismith. The Scottish forward fired a low shift which took a slight deflection off Huth to sneak in at the left post as the Goodison faithful finally find their voices. Roberto Martinez freshens up his midfield early on the second half . Schlupp tees up Matty James on the edge of the Everton box who drives a low shot which is parried away by Howard. Schlupp seizes on the rebound but he delivers an awful shot with the goal at his mercy. That was a gilt-edged chance for Leicester to take the lead here. Will it come back to haunt them later on? A dour day on Merseyside so far. Roberto Martinez's side have looked dangerous on the break but have failed to create enough goal-scoring opportunities despite dominating for long periods of that first half. Nigel Pearson has set up us Leicester side to contain the Toffees and save for a few hairy moments , they have just that. Cambiasso has looked a class apart for the visitors but Lukaku needs to up his game in the second half... Leicester play their way out from the back with Upson, Simpson, Cambiasso and Matty James all getting plenty of touches before Barkley intercepts and clears for a Foxes throw-in. Kramaric shows good strength to hold up posession in the Everton box but Besic disposesses the Leicester striker before laying the ball onto Barkley whose deft pass releases Lennon down the right. Lennon plays the ball to Lukaku but Upson blocks his effort before Barkley smashes the rebound high and wide. Coleman causes havoc down the right again and drives into the Leicester box before squaring the ball to Lukaku who fires over the bar. After his hat-trick heroics on Thursday, he'll be disappointed with that effort. Wes Morgan clatters into Steven Naismith and referee Phil Dowd reaches for the yellow card immediately. The Leicester centre back will need to be on his best behaviour for the rest of the contest. Not an ideal situation when you're marking Lukaku mind. Everton are awarded a free-kick on the edge of the Leicester area but Barkley blazes his effort over the Foxes wall and into Row Z. Great feet from Barkley there in a crowded midfield. The young Toffees midfielder drives forward and frees up Lukaku with clever, disguised pass but the Belgian is caught marginally offside with the Leicester goal at his mercy. Another let-off for Leicester. After a shaky start, Everton are looking far more assured here at Goodison with Besic, McCarthy and Barkley getting plenty of touches between them. Baines and Coleman are looking threatening and are getting forward with far more regularity. Coleman and Baines are being afforded acres of space by Leicester on the flanks. Baines gets free on the left and fires in a trademark cross and Lukaku beats Upson but his header goes high and wide. Ross Barkley picks up a loose ball outside his box and bombs forwards before playing a great pass to the onrushing Aaron Lennon on the right. The former Tottenham winger shows great pace down the right but his cross is snuffed out by the Leicester defence. An early warning for Leicester as Everton look dangerous on the break. Everton right back Seamus Coleman drives forward for the first time in the game and plays a lovely through ball to Steven Naismith but Huth is alive to the danger and clears well. Coleman gets free on the right again and plays the ball into the Foxes box but Morgan does well to intercept. Esteban Cambiasso does well to steal to steal possession from John Stones and lays the ball onto Jeff Schlupp who plays a lovely one-two with Riyad Mahrez before launching a strong right-footed shot which Tim Howard parries away for a corner. Everton clear the danger but the visitors will be happy with that early attack. Wes Morgan and Phil Jagielka are leading out their sides at Goodison. A huge clash awaits.

Rock-bottom Leicester make one change, with Robert Huth coming in for Marcin Wasilewski at centre-back. Good afternoon and welcome to Sportsmail's live coverage of Everton vs Leicester City at a gloomy and wet Goodison Park. Roberto Martinez's men will be buzzing follwing their 4-1 demolition of Young Boys in Europe on Thursday with Romelu Lukaku's hat-trick proving just the tonic for the Toffees. Martinez will be hoping Lukaku can bring his cup form into the league. The Belgian strike has scored just once in 11 Premier League outings. The last time he scored? Everton's 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace which was the Merseysiders' sole victory in nine league games. This is a must-win game for Nigel Pearson's side who have been bottom of the league since November. Leicester have been bottom of the table since November and are now five points from safety.

"Sam Allardyce demanded an official timekeeper at Barclays Premier League matches after Harry Kane's controversial equaliser for Tottenham was scored after injury-time had elapsed at White Hart Lane. With West Ham leading 2-1, fourth official Mike Dean had signalled five minutes added time before Alex Song bundled over Kane inside the penalty area. Kane's spot kick, initially saved by West Ham keeper Adrian, was saved after 95 minutes and 54 seconds, but the Tottenham forward followed up to score the equaliser. The referee awards a penalty to Tottenham has Harry Kane goes down under a challenge from Alex Song . Kane appeals for a late penalty at White Hart Lane as he is challenged from behind by Song in injury time .

Tottenham players celebrate the chance to go level at home to West Ham with an injury time penalty . Song is left with his head in his hands as Tottenham are awarded a penalty following his challenge on Kane . The late equaliser for Tottenham came when Alex Song needlessly fouled Harry Kane and his reaction to Jon Moss’s decision told you it was accurate. Given the time that elapsed, Moss probably allowed a little more time for the penalty to be taken which the laws of the game stipulate and he should be pleased with his performance which contributed to an entertaining game. Allardyce claimed referee Jon Moss would not be 'brave enough' to blow the whistle for full-time after Adrian had saved Kane's kick. The West Ham manager said: 'I'd like a timekeeper to be perfectly honest with you. So we're now doing NFL aren't we? 'He wouldn't be brave enough to blow at home, would he? He'll say there was still two seconds left, or he will say that when the penalty was taken there were five seconds left.' Moss blew his whistle for full-time the very moment West Ham kicked off and they were unlucky not to win at White Hart Lane for the third successive game.

Kane reels away in celebration having given Tottenham a late equaliser at home to rivals West Ham . 'At the end, the referee's not the reason why we drew. More than ourselves and a huge slice of luck for Spurs. I thought it was more good fortune today for Tottenham. 'The first goal was a complete miss-hit. When it bounces over the goalkeeper after it's hit the floor, it's so unusual that it sneaks into the corner and it lifts the opposition.' Allardyce also admitted he had some sympathy with Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho over the inconsistency of refereeing decisions after they were denied two penalties against Burnley. He added: 'Diego Costa goes down after a blatant push from the full-back and it's not a penalty. So that is the inconsistency that we unfortunately have to deal with. Carl Jenkinson and James Collins are left dejected as Kane celebrates his injury time equaliser . 'Here you can see why the referee's give it because Alex's put his hands on him but the thing is that will happen next week and you won't see a penalty, as we saw in the Chelsea game. 'Kane wasn't going to go anywhere because Aaron Cresswell was in a covering position and Harry Kane's first touch was too heavy, and he knew it were too heavy. 'You've got to give him credit for getting Tottenham a point in the end. It was also lucky because he missed the penalty and luckily it went to him to finish off.' Tottenham chief Mauricio Pochettinho admitted it was a big point for his side as they enter a crucial week in the Europa League and play the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Kane celebrates his late equalising goal against West Ham at White Hart Lane on Sunday afternoon . He said: 'We are always confident because we trust our players and we never give up. This is important, we showed big character and big personality. 'In the last 20 minutes it was important for us, it was a big point. It was difficult to play, but it is good to show character. For that we are proud. 'At half-time I tried to change, but after the day wasn't good for us. The second goal, now I have seen on TV, was offside. But it's true that at 2-0 down, for me it's important to say that we showed character and personality that was important for the team. 'I don't know if it was a penalty, maybe the TV can explain better. From my vision, maybe. I don't know. It is difficult to say yes or no.'

It's Fendi's limited edition Bag Boy Karlito, of course; the peculiar pom-pom-esque handbag charm with a waiting list of over 600 fashionistas and counting. The Karlito made its first appearance at the fashion house's Milan fall runway show in February, dangling from the poised fingertips of supermodel Cara Delevingne. Its waiting list officially opened last month, with deliveries scheduled for September, according to WWD. And animal rights enthusiasts may wish to look away. Designed to resemble the 80-year-old designer's signature monochrome uniform, the Karlito's 'sunglasses' are black mink, his 'torso' is silver fox, and there's a tuft of goat fur sprouting from his 'head' for good measure. Are you fur-real? Cara Delevingne displays the Fendi pom-pom accessory designed to resemble the fashion house's iconic designer Karl Lagerfeld, now on sale for $1,685, with 600 names on its waiting list so far . At a steep $1,685 each, the Karlito has already made Fendi over a million dollars. Miss Delevingne, a firm favorite of Mr Lagerfeld, has had a long-standing affection for trinkets that resemble the iconic designer. Before the Karlito came into existence, she was regularly spotted carrying round a knitted doll version, which retailed for a much more modest $134. Spitting image: The Bag Boy Karlito (left) is crafted from mink, fox, and goat fur, and first made its runway debut at Fendi's fall show in Milan this February, in an ode to Mr Lagerfeld (right) Fluff galore: The famously outspoken designer has been Fendi's designer of fur since 1965, and once described ethical conversations on the matter as 'childish' During an interview with Topshop two years ago, Miss Delevingne yanked the knitted doll out of her handbag and said: 'This is what I keep with me every day. 'You can change him, I've got different outfits for him. Karl told me I need to change his outfit every day.' She added that she sometimes braids the doll's wool hair. Mr Lagerfeld, has been Fendi's designer of fur and ready-to-wear since 1965. Famous for his blunt approach and acid tongue - he's called Pippa Middleton ugly, Adele fat, and Lana del Rey fake - he once said of the animals who end up on his runways that he is simply 'killing those beasts who would kill us if they could' and that 'the discussion of fur is childish.' Likeness: Before the Karlito, Miss Delevingne carried this knitted doll (pictured) in her handbag with her 'every day,' even changing its outfits and braiding its hair . Designer Stella McCartney, who never uses fur or leather in her collections, once sent Mr Lagerfeld an anti-fur video, later telling animal rights charity PETA that he 'didn't have the balls' to watch it, and had 'rather predictably felt the need to return it.' PETA spoke to MailOnline about the Karlito, stating: 'Either Karl Lagerfeld is losing his marbles and has forgotten that not so long ago, he was sensibly praising faux fur as a substitute - or his innovative years are behind him. 'There's nothing new or exciting about draping models in the skins of dead animals.' There is at least one fluffy animal who makes it into Mr Lagerfeld's work without first being dead, however, and that's his beloved Siamese cat, Choupette. This week, it was revealed that the blue-eyed, white-furred feline will be fronting a new make-up campaign Mr Lagerfeld is heading up with Japanese cosmetics brand Shu Uemura later this year.","Fendi's 'Bag Boy Karlito' has over 600 customers on its waiting list so far .

"It is a fact that illustrates just how difficult the predicament is becoming for Roberto Martinez: in 2015, Bradford City have beaten more top flight teams than Everton. Such a swaggering and creative force 12 months ago, this campaign has become one long episode of domestic disappointment and, on one of those unforgiving, slate-grey Merseyside afternoons, the woes failed to relent against Leicester City. Everton somehow scrambled a 2-2 draw against the Barclays Premier League’s basement team but on a day when they handed out Blue Noses to fans to mark the 27th anniversary of Everton in the Community, the club charity, Martinez and Company might have been left with red faces.

Here's how Naismith gave Everton the lead. Click here for more graphics like this . Tim Howard, normally a figure of such composure and authority, made two uncharacteristic blunders that enabled David Nugent and Esteban Cambiasso to give Leicester a lead that they seemed certain to protect until, in the 88th minute, Matthew Upson put through his own goal. Steven Naismith had opened the scoring for Everton in the 56th minute but not once did they threaten to go through gears, as they did so elegantly in Martinez’s debut campaign. This run – two wins in 14 Premier League matches since November 30 – is vexing their manager. ‘We need to find the enjoyment that we have in the Europa League,’ said Martinez, who refused to point the finger of blame at Howard. ‘We need to look forward to facing the opposition, as we do in Europe, and find enjoy the challenge of facing different teams.’ This Everton team is an enigma. Having looked so confident when they have ventured into Europe, having scored 14 goals in seven games to take them to the brink of the last 16, they have had no rhythm in the Premier League and will not be threatening the top six come May. When Everton are on form, there is a pace and energy to how they go about their business but, from all on, you could see this was going to be one of those ponderous days to which they are prone, passing the ball from side to side without any conviction. An obvious, if rudimentary, tactic to profit here would have been to keep playing balls out to the right flank for Aaron Lennon to scamper after, as neither Paul Konchesky nor Matthew Upson had the pace to get within five yards of the on-loan Tottenham man. But, for some reason, they used it only sporadically and, as a result, Leicester were comfortable. Everton rarely had a sight of goal – Ross Barkley wasted their best chance when blazing over – while the visitors came closest to breaking the deadlock through a curling Andrej Kramaric effort.

They pinned Everton back and had Jeffrey Schlupp shown more composure, they would have taken the lead. Instead, however, Leciester fell behind in the 56th minute when Naismith squeezed a shot past Mark Schwarzer via deflection off Robert Huth. Teams at the bottom can lose heart in such circumstances but Leicester’s character cannot be called into question and they roared back into the contest following Pearson’s decision to introduce Jamie Vardy and Nugent. Vardy is a terrier and his scuttling run down the right in the 63rd minute, beyond Leighton Baines, caused panic but the danger should really have cleared his cross but, instead, Howard inexplicably turned the ball into Nugent’s path and the boyhood Evertonian swept in the loose ball. That rattled Everton and a bigger calamity followed in the 70th minute when Howard completely misjudged Danny Simpson’s cross, allowed it to drift into the path of Vardy, who in turn gave Cambiasso a chance he could not miss.

Nugent runs away in celebration after getting Leicester back into the game at 1-1 in the 63rd minute on Sunday . ‘We have three players around him and it ends up with him,’ said Martinez. ‘In football you are going to have errors but it is how you can help your team-mate when an action like that happens. 'As a team we need to defend much better. I don’t see Tim as directly responsible of the draw.’ The mood darkened around Goodison, particularly when Romelu Lukaku fluffed two gilt-edged chances, but some form of redemption arrived in the 88th minute when Upson diverted into own net after Christian Atsu had crossed. It was harsh on Leicester but Pearson was phlegmatic. The dressing room is very disappointed, as you can imagine. We have got to turn these performances into wins, it is that simple, because of the predicament we find ourselves in. But in terms of the performance, it was full of intent.

"David Nugent described Everton's late equaliser as 'a killer' after Leicester were denied a crucial win in their battle against relegation from the Barclays Premier League. The Foxes looked set for an unlikely three points at Goodison Park after goals from Nugent and Esteban Cambiasso cancelled out Steven Naismith's opener. But, with two minutes of normal time remaining, Romelu Lukaku's diving header was diverted into his own net by Matthew Upson and the game ended 2-2. Matthew Upson converted a late own goal to give Everton a draw at Goodison Park against Leicester City . Romelu Lukaku celebrates the equaliser that saw Everton and Leicester share a point  in their match . Nugent, a boyhood Everton fan, said on Sky Sports: 'Nobody expected us to come away from home and pick up points. To concede like that is a killer but it's a point on the board. 'I always dreamt of scoring at Goodison Park. Thankfully it got the team back into the game. 'Now we've got a tricky game at Manchester City (on Wednesday) but Burnley went there and got a result so there's no reason we can't.' Cambiasso has been more used to fighting for titles in an illustrious career but the midfielder feels his side can get out of trouble if they continue to show the same battling qualities. The Argentinian said: 'If we work hard in this situation, I think we can stay in the Premier League. 'It's a hard fight but I think this time we understand what is important. It's a great fight to the end. We need to play like today and I think we have possibilities.' David Nugent had earlier scored the goal that leveled Everton's opener in the match . But Nugent was eventually left to bemoan the result after his side dropped points late on . Everton boss Roberto Martinez admitted his side did not play well three days after impressing in the Europa League against Young Boys but was happy with their response after going behind. He told Sky Sports: 'It's one of those performances that comes from playing in Europe. We looked a little pedestrian. 'We knew it was going to be a difficult game. Scoring the first goal is always the hardest moment. Once we achieved that, we didn't control the play as well as we should have done. 'I don't think we defended the box well. The two goals were soft. When things are not going your way you create chances but can't convert them. 'But it's a fantastic sign to show the character we did to at least get a point out of the game.' Everton's fans have not been slow to show their frustration at their side's struggles at Goodison Park this season, and it was no different on Sunday. Martinez added: 'We showed a little bit the responsibility we carry when we play football at Goodison. At times we can't really enjoy our role of trying to break teams down. The frustration shows through. It's something we need to get used to.' Roberto Martinez says his side needs to get used to the role of breaking teams down at home . Leicester boss Nigel Pearson (left) believed his team deserved better than a draw from the game . Leicester manager Nigel Pearson felt his team did not get what they deserved but remains confident that will change. He said: 'It feels a bit like a defeat at the moment but I suppose we have to take the positives out of it. 'I think we played well. We've frustrated Everton and their fans to a certain extent and responded well to going behind. 'It's another one of those scratch-your-head days. At some point we will change our fortunes. We can only do that by continuing to apply ourselves in the way we have today. 'It's not a case of feeling unlucky, we have to turn things around ourselves."" Pearson, meanwhile, shrugged off reports his position is again under threat a fortnight after he was reported to have been sacked. The Leicester boss said: 'I always do my job as conscientiously as I can and I will continue to do that until I'm told otherwise. I'm committed to the job and that's all you need to know.'","Everton draw 2-2 with Leicester at Goodison Park in the Premier League .

"India's Anirban Lahiri won his second European Tour title in the space of three weeks after beating compatriot SSP Chawrasia in a play-off at Delhi Golf Club on Sunday. Lahiri, who won the Malaysian Open a fortnight ago, began the final round seven shots off the lead but a closing 69 was enough to force extra holes as overnight leader Chawrasia stumbled to a 76. The home pair returned to the par-five 18th for the play-off and with Chawrasia unable to make par after hooking his tee shot into the trees, Lahiri holed from 10 feet for birdie. Indian golfer Anirban Lahiri poses with the trophy after winning the Indian Open golf tournament in New Delhi . Lahiri had been four over par after 10 holes of his opening round but the win solidifies his place in the top 50 of the world rankings and effectively secures his Masters debut in April. The 27-year-old had crucially chipped in for par on the 17th in regulation as a number of players squandered chances to either win the title outright or join the play-off.

"Graeme Swann feels England were 'crazy' to change their World Cup batting line-up at short notice - but still believes they can turn their tournament around. The in-form James Taylor was dropped down the order to number six to accommodate Gary Ballance's return in place of Ravi Bopara for the competition opener against Australia. Defeats in that game and against New Zealand - the latter an eight-wicket hammering having been bowled out for 123 - have left Peter Moores' side with an uphill task to make the quarter-finals. Eoin Morgan lead his team off the field after their Cricket World Cup defeat to New Zealand . Peter Moores offers a word of advice to Morgan during a session in the nets before the Scotland match . And former Three Lions spinner Swann told BBC Radio Five's Sportsweek programme: 'I don't think the strategy's been clear. Every player hasn't got a clear and concise role. 'The Kiwis have been building up to this World Cup for four years and every player absolutely knows his role - Ashley Giles said that last night. 'England changed their batting line-up the morning of the World Cup against Australia, Gary Ballance is suddenly brought back in, James Taylor's down to number six, Ravi Bopara taken out of the squad - that was crazy, in my book. 'It's muddled, it's not clear.

England's Alex Hales plays a shot during a nets session in Christchurch, New Zealand . Results so far have seen speculation build around Moores' future, even at this early stage of his second spell in charge, but Swann is determined to remain positive. 'They were like rabbits in the headlights against New Zealand. The disparity was enormous,' he said. 'But if they actually play well for the next four games - beat Sri Lanka heavily, destroy Scotland - if they do that, all this anger and emotion will disappear. If they come out fighting and do well, we'll all get back on their side. 'So I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and say, 'Moores must go if we don't reach the quarter-finals'. I'm going to be the positive one that says, ""in three weeks' time, we'll play New Zealand in the semi-final and thrash them by nine wickets"".'

"Beer giant Heineken launched an urgent investigation after an internet photo of a brutal dog fight showed the ring was surrounded by their branded banners. Thousands have called for a boycott of their drinks because of the image from an unknown Asian country, believed to be in Mongolia. Yesterday Heineken said it was 'as shocked and disappointed' as anyone who had seen their name linked to the blood sport. The picture shows people filming a dogfight in a ring with the Heineken logo hanging from pillars above the crowd. Brutal: Two dogs in a ring are shown tearing at eachother, surrounded by a large crowd and Heineken banners . Animal rights groups circulated the image online, sparking an angry response from their supporters. In an official statement on their own Facebook site Heineken said: 'We are aware of images of dog fighting circulating online including our branding. We do not support such cruelty and are urgently investigating.' However many people called on the firm to speak out publicly against dogfighting, accusing them of backtracking after being 'caught out'.

Battle: Angry drinkers have launched campaigns to boycott Heineken because of their alleged link to the cruel sport (file picture) 'Shame on you Heineken--you are what is wrong with this world! How could you sponsor such a heinous crime!' another said. This afternoon the Dutch brewer claimed they had tracked down the club in Mongolia thanks to online comments and said that the venue had held an official Heineken event there the night before. A spokesman told MailOnline they had no knowledge of the dog fighting and have now removed all remaining promotional materials from the venue and ended their relationship. 'The venue owner has verbally confirmed that Heineken banners are visible in the pictures because the previous evening the club had been decorated for a promotional event and he had failed to remove the banners once it was over.  This event was in no way related to the dog fight,' he said. 'We fully understand the level of negative feeling amongst consumers based on what they have seen. 'We encourage our consumers to continue to use social media channels to alert us to any situation where they feel our brands are being misrepresented, so that we can take the appropriate actions.'

"The Obama White House sent three officials to attend Monday's funeral of slain teenager Michael Brown in Missouri, but sent no one to represent the president when photojournalist James Foley, decapitated by a terrorist on video, was memorialized Sunday in a New Hampshire church. Foley was held captive by militants linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) before they killed him and released footage a week ago. Marlon Marshall, deputy director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, is the highest-level official who made the trip to attend Monday's  funeral in St. Louis. He's a native of the Missouri city and attended high school with Brown's mother. Scroll down for video . Worthy: Obama's White House sent three emissaries to St. Louis for Brown's funeral on Monday . Didn't make the cut: Foley's memorial mass on Sunday drew no one from the Obama administration . Obama delivered a heartfelt speech last week after Foley's death was broadcast on the Internet, and then played golf . Joining him was Heather Foster, an adviser in Marshall's office, and Broderick Johnson, who chairs President Barack Obama's 'My Brother's Keeper' task force. Attorney General Eric Holder also made a high-profile visit last week to Ferguson, Missouri, the town where white policeman Darren Wilson shot and killed Brown, a black 18-year-old, on August 9.rimal . He came to mug for cameras and briefly oversee the beginning of a criminal investigation into whether Wilson violated Brown's civil rights. A criminal investigation has been launched inside the FBI into Foley's execution at the hands of ISIS terrorists. But no one from the Obama administration visited Rochester, New Hampshire on Sunday for the memorial mass at Our Lady of the Holy Rosary church. Foley's remains haven't been found, leaving his family to mourn him without the funeral and interment that Roman Catholics believe is an integral part of the end of life. 'There was nobody that represented the White House,' church office assistant Connie Hammond told CNS News. New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan and Rep. Ann Kuster came to the mass, along with both of the state's U.S. senators, Kelly Ayotte and Jeanne Shaheen – three Democrats among them – according to the Catholic Diocese of Manchester. Pope Francis sent a message of condolence to the Foley family in a letter read aloud during the service. 'It's pretty embarrassing,' a former White House official told MailOnline, on condition of anonymity. 'In the last two years the White House has become more and more myopic. When you don't have to face voters anymore, some politicians let it all hang out. I'm afraid this one is especially prone to that.'

Ned Price, a spokesman for the National Security Council in the White House, told CNS that Obama's statement, delivered from his Martha's Vineyard vacation, was sufficient. 'The president expressed his profound condolences to the family in his statement last week,' Price said. 'He was speaking on behalf of his Administration – as well as the American people – in offering these words to the Foley family, and he continues to keep them in his thoughts as we attempt to bring the other American hostages home.'","Memorial mass for Foley in New Hampshire came and went Sunday without a White House emissary .

"Useless: The turbine outside the Welsh government office in Aberystwyth is to be scrapped after only producing £5 of electricity a month . A wind turbine which cost the taxpayer almost £50,000 but generated just £5 of electricity a month is to be scrapped. Installed outside an office of the Welsh government, the turbine was part of its plan to become more environmentally friendly. Despite the fact that civil servants were warned the 60ft turbine was being placed a location that was too sheltered and would not experience enough wind, they went ahead and paid £48,000 for it. Last year it was revealed that the turbine was producing an average of just 33 kilowatts of energy a month – the equivalent of £5.28 worth of electricity. Based on those figures, the turbine would need to stand for 757 years before the cost of it was offset by the electricity it produced. Yesterday it emerged that the turbine is to be removed because the manufacturer has gone into liquidation. Ministers said they do not have anyone else to maintain it. A spokesman for the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘It beggars belief that tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money was squandered on a scheme with such a minuscule return.’ The turbine manufacturers, Quiet Revolution, warned civil servants that their office in Aberystwyth, West Wales, was the wrong place for the turbine before it was erected in 2009. Instead of putting it close to the coastline, they insisted on sitting it in a valley, two miles from blustery Cardigan Bay. Turbine expert Paul Burrell said: ‘It’s very important with any wind turbine to ensure they have unobstructed access to wind from all directions. ‘Unfortunately, the Welsh government’s turbine was located in a valley two miles from the sea. It was also located next to tall buildings, so even if there was a strong wind it was displaced by the time it reached the turbine.’ The wind turbine’s performance was monitored from January 2012 until July 2013 and it was found to generate 33 kilowatts per month. Using the current average price of electricity of 16p per kilowatt, that means it made £5.28 of electricity a month. The turbine broke down in January and the manufacturer went into administration soon after that. A Welsh government spokesman said the turbine stopped working when the brakes were ‘locked on’. He said: ‘Our contractor was in discussion with Quiet Revolution until March to try and resolve the fault, when they received an email [to say] that the company had gone into administration. ‘They have been unable to progress the matter with the administrator and, as such, the wind turbine has remained out of use. ‘As the prospects of finding a company able to take on the maintenance and repair are limited, we are considering options for its removal.’ Not enough power: Last year it was revealed that the turbine was producing an average of just 33 kilowatts of energy a month. Based on the figures, it would have needed to stand for 757 years before cost was offset . Experts are divided over the efficiency of wind turbines and their capacity to generate electricity. Lucrative subsidies – paid for by taxpayers in the form of higher energy bills – are offered to landowners who erect turbines on their property by the Government, which sees building new wind farms as key to meeting tough European carbon emission targets. But opponents say the targets, which aim to reduce carbon dioxide by 80 per cent by 2020, are unrealistic and wind turbines will never be an efficient source of electricity for the National Grid. Earlier this year Rushcliffe Borough Council in Nottingham was criticised after it emerged it spent £30,000 on two turbines which generated only £95 of electricity in 12 months.","Structure was placed outside Welsh government offices in Aberystwyth .

Britain had one last opportunity in the men's Madison, a non-Olympic discipline and track cycling's equivalent of the wacky races, but a commendable effort from Owain Doull and Mark Christian went unrewarded. It means Britain, the once dominant nation of track cycling, have three silver medals from the penultimate Track World Championships prior to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Britain last failed to win a gold in Antwerp in 2001, while this was their smallest haul since the 2003 Track World Championships in Stuttgart, when they won one medal of each colour. Trott, beaten in the team pursuit for the first time at her fifth World Championships, was 'gutted' after missing out on the rainbow jerseys she coveted. But the 22-year-old from Cheshunt vowed to 'come back flying at the next worlds,' which take place in London next March, after a third successive world silver in cycling's equivalent of the heptathlon. Trott's silver meant GB went without a gold medal for the first time at a World Championships since 2001 . Trott (right) competes in the final of the women's omnium event, cycling's equivalent of the heptathlon . She said: 'London's massive, isn't it? It's going to be a home crowd, a home track. It will be about performing there. 'I've always tended to perform in front of a home crowd. That will be a massive target for me.' Olympic champion Jason Kenny, Trott's fiance, would have been expected to be in contention in the sprint, won by Gregory Bauge of France on Sunday, but exited in the first round on Saturday. Trott said: 'I feel sorry for him. I guess he just got a bit unlucky. 'He's a bit disappointed. These things happen. We'd rather they happen now than in a year and a half's time.' Trott attempts to get on the wheel of the event's winner, Edmondson, during the points race . Kenny's exit piled expectation on Trott, who won world and Olympic omnium gold in 2012. Asked if she felt the pressure of delivering Britain's first gold, she added: 'A little bit. I tend to try to put that to the back of my mind. I'll try my hardest no matter what, whether I was winning or whether I was last, I would've tried my best.' Trott resumed on Sunday in third after winning the second and third disciplines, the three-kilometres individual pursuit and the elimination race. She moved up to second after placing fifth in the fourth discipline, the 500metres time-trial, and was third in the penultimate discipline, the flying lap. But Edmondson won both disciplines to take a 14-point lead into the concluding points race. Trott speeds around the track at France's National Velodrome during the flying lap on Sunday . Instead of chasing gold, Trott found her silver medal position under threat from Kirsten Wild, but she finished behind the Dutchwoman on the final sprint to cling on to second overall. Edmondson finished with 192 points, Trott with 176 and Wild with 175. Trott added: 'You've always got a target on your back once you have won. People don't let you move as freely as you'd like to. 'I definitely think it is harder to stay at the top. Hats off to people like Sir Chris (Hoy).' Hoy won 11 world titles and six Olympic gold medals, but since his retirement in April 2013, Britain's aura of invincibility has slipped. Trott's team pursuit squad lost for the first time since December 2010, ending the run of four straight world titles. Team GB had high hopes for Trott's fiance Jason Kenny (left) but he left the championships disappointed . The usually indefatigable Trott admitted the exertions of the team pursuit - where Joanna Rowsell was under-par - affected her in the omnium. She added: 'The team pursuit is 4k and three rounds. Having to do three rides with three riders for a lot of it, and then having to do a whole omnium, I actually found that pretty hard.' Doull and Christian, who was a late replacement for the ill Jon Dibben, won the Madison at London's Track World Cup last December. The pair took a lap early on to lead but, roared on by a partisan crowd, French pair Bryan Coquard and Morgan Kneisky won gold by one point from Italy and Doull and Christian finished ninth. Jess Varnish was hampered by overnight illness as she missed out on advancing to the semi-finals of the women's Keirin, won by Australia's Anna Meares.","Laura Trott came second in the omnium at the Track World Championships .

"Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK (picture posed by model) More people than ever are being diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) -  a condition linked to impulsiveness, restlessness and hyperactivity. But paediatric neurologist Dr Richard Saul believes that ADHD simply ‘doesn’t exist’ and is being used as a mask for less serious problems. Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school. Dr Saul argues all these children are being misdiagnosed and claims ADHD shouldn’t be listed in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM). He claims that ADHD is nothing more than a collection of symptoms and not a disease, according to a report in the New York Post. ‘ADHD makes a great excuse,’ Dr Saul said in his book, ‘ADHD does not exist: The truth about Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder.’ ‘The diagnosis can be an easy-to-reach-for crutch. Moreover, there’s an attractive element to an ADHD diagnosis, especially in adults - it can be exciting to think of oneself as involved in many things at once, rather than stuck in a boring rut.’ In his own practice, Dr Saul began looking for other causes of his patients’ symptoms. He found cases such as a young girl who was unruly in school, but it turned out to be that she couldn’t see the blackboard and simply needed glasses. A 36-year-old man who thought he had ADHD was just drinking too much coffee and not getting enough sleep. Some cases produced no diagnosis. One adult, convinced she had ADHD and who had been given stimulants, realised it was simply life getting to her after being prescribed regular exercise. Prescriptions for stimulant drugs such . as Ritalin have increased twofold for children and adolescents in the . UK with ADHD, and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008. Such . medications can cause adverse reactions such as weight loss, liver . toxicity, and suicidal thoughts, and in the short term may suppress . pubertal growth. Prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as Ritalin increased twofold for children and adolescents in the UK, and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008 . Echoing Dr Saul's views, a group of researchers from Australia and the Netherlands said in November that the diagnosis of ADHD may have become too broad. A wider classification of symptoms for ADHD in the psychiatric ‘bible’ used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication, the study warned. The group of researchers said there was now a risk of over diagnosis which could fuel scepticism about the disorder. In addition, stretched resources may mean some seriously affected children do not get medical help, or they are undertreated. In a report published on bmj.com, they found a 73 per cent increase for ADHD medication in Austrla between 2000 and 2011. To be diagnosed with ADHD, a patient . should meet diagnostic criteria outlined in the American Psychiatric . Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders . (DSM-5) - used around the world to classify mental disorders - or the . International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). But . definitions have been broadened in successive editions of DSM, . resulting in higher rates of the disorder when compared with ICD 10. Echoing Dr Saul's views, a group of researchers from Australia and the Netherlands said in November that the diagnosis of ADHD may have become too broad (picture posed by model) Although clinicians are likely to have got better at detecting and diagnosing ADHD, some of the rise could stem from over diagnosis or misdiagnosis. ‘Severe cases of ADHD are obvious, but in mild and moderate cases - which constitute the bulk of all ADHD diagnoses - subjective opinions of clinicians differ’, said Dr Rae Thomas, a senior researcher at Bond University in Australia. ‘The broadening of the diagnostic criteria in DSM-5 is likely to increase what is already a significant concern about overdiagnosis. ‘It risks resulting in a diagnosis of ADHD being regarded with scepticism to the harm of those with severe problems who unquestionably need sensitive, skilled specialist help and support’ she added. Prof Eric Taylor, Emeritus Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, King’s college London, said the UK was different because NHS guidelines already recommend careful specialist assessment, with psychological treatments given priority over medication in most cases. ‘Probably too few children here get help’ he said. In the UK, the increase in stimulants was from a very low base rate: 4.8 per 1,000 schoolchildren in UK compared with around 70 per 1,000 in parts of the U.S.","Neurologist Dr Richard Saul claims ADHD is just a collection of symptoms .

"DWP officials say benefits cap as a whole will save £300million a year . More than 4,000 jobless single people without children who are living ‘on easy street’ are to have their benefits cut because they get more in welfare payments than many of those in work. Under the Government’s benefits cap, they will see their state handouts capped at £350 a week, or £18,200 a year. That means 4,000 people without jobs or families have been living on a benefits package worth more than the equivalent of earning £23,000 a year before tax. More than 4,000 jobless single people without children who are living 'on easy street' are to have their benefits cut because they get more in welfare payments than many of those in work (stock picture) In an article for the Daily Mail, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith vows to end what he calls these ‘out of control’ claims. His pledge  comes as the final stage of the nationwide roll-out of the benefits cap begins today. ‘For those eyeballing benefits as a one-way ticket to easy street, I have a wake-up call for you: those days are over,’ he writes. ‘We see that across the country there are 4,000 single people making more in benefits than many individual people would earn from work. 'This is not right, not fair and by the end of September these people will come under the cap.’ Figures reveal the full extent of welfare dependency in Britain. The Department for Work and Pensions has already said that about 40,000 households will be affected this year by the benefits cap, which limits the amount couples and lone parents can receive in benefits to £500 a week, or £26,000 a year. But it has never before revealed that one in ten of those affected will be single people who will be hit by a £350 cap that applies to those without families. DWP officials say that the benefits cap as a whole will save £300million a year and those affected will see their benefits cut by an average of £93 a week. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith vows to end what he calls these 'out of control' claims . Figures are not yet available for how much the benefits cap on single people will save the taxpayer, but it may be up to £30million a year. Around 60 single people without children have had their benefits capped at £350 a week in the four London boroughs where the cap started in April. They would have received benefits costing more than £1.1million a year. Officials say the cost of paying benefits to single people is high because many of them are ‘in temporary accommodation where rents can be higher’. The cap affects most benefits paid to those out of work, including jobseekers’ allowance, incapacity benefit, employment and support allowance, income support and housing benefit. But those on working tax credits are exempt. The final phase of the nationwide roll-out will see the benefits cap introduced in most of the major cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff, Leeds and Liverpool plus the remaining London boroughs. Polls have consistently found that the benefits cap is popular with voters. One YouGov survey earlier this year showed that 76 per cent of the public backs the cap, including 69 per cent of Labour voters. Claims by the DWP that the benefits cap is driving people to look for work have proved controversial. But Mr Duncan Smith argues that it is encouraging those facing cuts in welfare to get jobs. ‘The cap actively encourages people into work by exempting those claiming working tax credits,’ he writes. ‘This is a key motivator for people and Jobcentre Plus advisers tell me they believe the policy is already helping drive people back into work.’ Mr Duncan Smith also challenges Labour to endorse the cap. In June Ed Miliband unveiled a plan to cap ‘structural’ welfare spending – those handouts not affected by an economic downturn – for three years if Labour wins the next election. But the Labour leader has refused to name a single benefit he would cut. Labour has also refused to back the Government’s benefits cap or the Coalition’s decision to limit benefits rises to 1 per cent. Mr Duncan Smith accused Mr Miliband of having ‘directed his Welfare Party to vote against £83billion worth of savings I have made’.","Government’s benefits cap will see state handouts capped at £350 a week .

Councils could be forced to cut spending on roads and care for the elderly in order to support households losing out through the Government’s welfare reforms, town hall chiefs warned last night. A study commissioned by the Local Government Association estimates that less than a quarter of the 1.18million English workless households affected by housing benefit cuts would be able to reduce the impact by moving to a cheaper property or finding a job. Councils could be forced to pay out to support them, leaving them with less money for other priorities."
"Stores using larger sized mannequins have been accused of 'normalising' Britain's obesity crisis, according to a report by England's chief medical officer. Dame Sally Davies has warned that larger mannequins are making people think being overweight is acceptable. She also said that many people do not . recognise they have a weight problem, with data showing that 52 per cent . of overweight men and 30 per cent of overweight women think they are the right weight. Larger mannequins are being blamed for undermining the nation's obesity crisis. Mr Miller, who has eight years experience helping people lose weight, blamed 'political correctness for keeping people fat', claiming society need to use shock tactics to tackle the problem . Dame Davies blamed larger . mannequins, combined with retailers' recent tendency to carry out 'size . inflation' with clothes - when clothes with the same size label become larger - for undermining the health risks that come with . obesity. The fashion industry has long been accused of presenting 'underweight' as an ideal goal. However, Dame Davies believes that in a recent trend, society has been complicit in normalising being 'overweight'. She said: 'Larger mannequins are being introduced into clothes shops. '""Size inflation"" means that clothes with the same size label have become larger in recent decades. 'News stories about overweight (issues) often feature pictures of severely obese people, which are under-representative of the overweight population.' While the average woman is a size 16, most clothes stores in Britain use mannequins that are between size 8 and 10. Debenhams was the first department store to start using size 16 mannequins, in a push to try and get all high street stores to display larger models. Chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies says being overweight has been 'normalised' by society and even suggested a sugar tax to improve people's diets . Many stores did not follow suit, with Marks & Spencer saying they took a 'responsible approach to visual merchandising'. The issue of mannequins was a subject touched upon in Dame Davies' larger warning on the British obesity crisis. She presented data that said around 11 . per cent of obese men and 6 per cent of obese women think they are the . right weight, while 77 per cent of parents of overweight children do not . recognise their child is heavier than they should be. Equalities Minister Jo Swinson backed Debenham's launch of size 16 mannequins . Estimates suggest that almost two thirds of adults and one third of children under 18 are obese or overweight - around 33 million adults and 3 million children. Around 25 per cent of adults in the UK are obese, compared with only 7 per cent of adults in 1980, an increase of 18 per cent over the last three decades. Dame Davies also claimed that habits like watching TV and a lack of exercise were on the increase . In her report, Dame Davies also suggested a radical 'sugar tax'. She said adults and children consumed too much, with a third of added sugar in the diet of children aged between 11 and 18 coming from fizzy drinks, smoothies and fruit juices. She said: 'This is an alarming proportion. 'Soft drinks are easily avoidable sources of added sugar. 'I call on manufacturers to ramp up reformulation of products to use less sugar. 'If voluntary efforts fail to deliver then we, as a society, may need to consider the public health benefits that could be derived from regulation such as a ""sugar tax"".' Dame Davies' report also pointed out that research found that adults watched an average of 1,648 minutes (27.5 hours) of television per week in 2013. Dame Davies also spoke about the effects of alcohol on obesity, and suggested that changes to the Budget, such as a penny off a pint of beer, could encourage drinking. This increased drinking could lead to rapid weight gain in the UK. She said: 'Once I discovered the calories in alcohol, as well as the bad side effects, I drank much less,' she told BBC Radio 4. 'I worry that people will drink more . but in fact at the moment alcohol consumption has not recently gone up, . probably because of austerity.' 'People also needed to be made more aware that fruit juice was not a healthy option in large quantities,' she said. 'When . I used to sit in my clinic, mothers would bring their children in . drinking vast amounts of orange juice and they thought this was healthy. A cut in the tax on alcohol in the latest Budget could mean an increase in drinking, which, considering how it is very calorific, could cause an increase obesity . She also used her study to call for more research into a potential link between deafness and blindness and dementia. Data suggested a greater prevalence of dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, in those with severe vision loss or severe hearing impairment. She also said England should explore the impact of minimum unit pricing for alcohol if Scotland introduced it.","Dame Sally Davies says plus-sized mannequins normalising obesity .
