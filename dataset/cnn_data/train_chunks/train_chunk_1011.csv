"Caterham have announced that they will take part at the final Formula One race of the season in Abu Dhabi. The British team, who entered into administration in October, launched a ‘crowdfunding’ scheme last week in a bid to raise more than £2million to make the race. And despite still coming up £500,000 short of their target on Friday afternoon, the administrators acting on behalf of Caterham, have announced that they will race next weekend. The cash-strapped team claim they will now compete at the final race of the season in Abu Dhabi . Caterham have missed the last two races in America and Brazil but say they will take to the grid in Abu Dhabi . Finbarr O'Connell of Smith & Williamson, joint administrator from the London-based accountancy firm said: 'We set ourselves a major challenge, but it’s definitely been worth it. 'In only a week the fans have made the impossible, possible. 'We knew that the best way to keep this team alive and attract possible buyers was to show that it’s still a racing team and be in Abu Dhabi for the finale, and there aren’t enough words to say how grateful we are to all the fans that have made this possible. 'We now head to Abu Dhabi ready to show what a hard-working and positive group of people this is and to hopefully secure a future for the team. Caterham said they needed to raise £2.35million to make the season finale in Abu Dhabi next week . 'During the past few days the interest of many potential buyers has increased massively and by racing in Abu Dhabi the team will be showcasing itself as a live and functioning team that deserves to continue into 2015 and beyond. 'It has hard-working people, team spirit and experience and now it only needs a secure financial future which I’m very hopeful we can achieve. 'I’d like to reiterate that we are racing in Abu Dhabi thanks to all the fans out there – an achievement that will go down in F1 history and one that we can all be very proud of. 'We still need to raise a bit more cash so please do keep an eye on the Crowdcube website.' Part of the  campaign has seen team kit, race suits from former drivers and old car parts sold off to bring in donations, with new items added over the past few days. One high-price ticket item includes dinner with one of the drivers at the Royal Automobile Club in London, although it remains to be seen who will be behind the wheel. Marcus Ericsson severed ties with the team earlier this week. British drivers Alice Powell and Jolyon Palmer meanwhile, are both in contention for a seat.","British team launched crowdfunding initiative in bid to raise more than £2m .

"Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone has dismissed suggestions the sport needs to engage with a younger audience and develop a greater awareness of social media. Ecclestone and F1 have often been criticised for a lack of activity on Twitter and Facebook, which in turn could help attract a new fanbase. Although television global audience figures remain high at around 350 million per grand prix weekend, that has dropped from 500 million in recent years. Bernie Ecclestone poses for a selfie with Brazilian footballer Pato and his partner at the Brazilian Grand Prix . The 84-year-old insists that Formula One does not need to attract a younger audience . That is partly due to the sport's ageing demographic, but also given the variety of viewing platforms these days, such as via smartphones and tablets. Despite F1's obvious need to be more high profile on social media, Ecclestone said: 'I'm not interested in tweeting, Facebook and whatever this nonsense is. 'I tried to find out, but in any case I'm too old-fashioned. I couldn't see any value in it. 'And, I don't know what the so-called young generation of today really wants. What is it? You ask a 15 or 16-year-old kid ""What do you want?"" and they don't know. 'The challenge is getting the audience in the first place. Lewis Hamilton, pictured celebrating his Singapore win, will go head-to-head with Nico Rosberg for the title . Rosberg held off Hamilton to win the Brazilian Grand Prix - he is 17 points adrift of his team-mate . 'I say to some of these people who start this nonsense about social media, look at what tobacco companies tried to do, get people smoking their brand early on because then people continue smoking their brand forever.' In a widespread interview with Campaign Asia-Pacific magazine, the 84-year-old added: 'If you have a brand that you want to put in front of a few hundred million people, I can do that easily for you on television. 'Now, you're telling me I need to find a channel to get this 15-year-old to watch Formula One because somebody wants to put out a new brand in front of them? They are not going to be interested in the slightest bit. 'Young kids will see the Rolex brand, but are they going to go and buy one? They can't afford it. Or our other sponsor, UBS. These kids don't care about banking. 'They haven't got enough money to put in the bloody banks anyway. That's what I think. 'I don't know why people want to get to the so-called young generation. Why do they want to do that? Is it to sell them something? Most of these kids haven't got any money. 'I'd rather get to the 70-year-old guy who's got plenty of cash. So, there's no point trying to reach these kids because they won't buy any of the products here, and if marketers are aiming at this audience, then maybe they should advertise with Disney.'

"England international goalkeeper Jack Butland has joined Derby County on loan. The 21-year-old Stoke keeper is eager to gain more game time and will link up with former England boss Steve McClaren on Monday. Derby moved for Butland after regular No 1 Lee Grant suffered a fractured foot. England international Jack Butland is set to join Championship side Derby County on loan . Butland has found first team chances difficult to come by at the Britannia Stadium, with the continued excellence of Asmir Begovic between the sticks. He is set to make his debut for Derby in their Sky Bet Championship fixture against Blackpool at Bloomfield Road on Tuesday night. 'We're extremely pleased to welcome Jack Butland to Derby County and I would like to extend our thanks to Stoke City for agreeing to let him join us on loan,' McClaren told his club's official website, dcfc.co.uk. 'Jack is a promising young goalkeeper and after Lee Grant picked up an injury on Saturday, as a management team, we quickly set about identifying someone to come into the group. 'We know a lot about Jack and he is someone who Eric Steele (Derby's goalkeeping coach) rates very highly.' Meanwhile, his Stoke team-mate Andy Wilkinson is moving to Millwall on a 93-day loan.

"A ten-year-old boy with a giant tumour on his neck could be cured after being prescribed Viagra. Jose Serrano, of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was losing time as the life-threatening growth could stop him breathing by putting pressure on his windpipe, with surgeons desperate to operate. But it will not be safe until the cystic growth, known as a lymphangioma, is smaller. Viagra, which is most famous for helping male impotence, has been discovered to shrink growths in children. Scroll down for video . Feeling happier: Jose Serrano, of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, had been losing time as the life-threatening growth threatened to stop him breathing by putting pressure on his windpipe, with surgeons desperate to operate . Jose is now taking the medicine in the hope he will one day be able to live life as a normal boy. He said: ‘If the doctors can cure me I will be so happy. I would be thrilled. I would be healthy and I'd be able to do anything I want. I could run fast, play on the swings and rings - anything I want.’ The growth is rough and scaly and often forms painful cysts. It extends across Jose's shoulder and restricts his movement. He cannot swim because the water causes him pain and he gets tired easily if playing football and riding his bike. And now some of the cysts are invading his lungs and approaching his windpipe. There are also fears it could one day spread to his eyes and affect his vision. ‘It's been difficult,’ his mother Cindy explained. ‘People stare at him. Some of them have these terrible, morbid looks on their faces. Smiles: Jose, ten, with his mother Cindy, and father Jose Ramirez Sr. It was only last year that his parents even found out what was causing the growth their son has had since he was a baby . ‘We've tried to let Jose lead as normal a life as possible. We let him do everything the other children do, unless it's unsafe for him or will be too difficult. ‘But sometimes he gets so sad because he is different from other kids. Until now there was simply no money to treat him.’ 'If the doctors can cure me I will be so happy. I would be thrilled. I would be healthy and I'd be able to do anything I want' Jose Serrano . Another stumbling block for Jose's family has been the cost. The treatment and surgery to remove the growth will cost a staggering £125,000 ($200,000). And then there's the cost of the medication - £1,250 ($2,000) per week, which Jose has needed to be prescribed for several months. But the family have been given funding to cover the price. ‘That is unbelievable amount of money for us,’ his mother said. ‘More money than we'd see in a lifetime. Words can express how grateful we are to the people who have helped us. It's surreal. It feels like a dream come true.’ Jose's case was brought to the attention of medical experts after he was spotted by missionaries from the First Baptist Church of Rio Rancho, near Albuquerque, New Mexico. Being brave: The growth is rough and scaly and often forms painful cysts. It extends across Jose's shoulder . They helped his family connect with specialists at the University of New Mexico Children's Hospital. It was only last year that his mother and her husband Jose Ramirez Sr even found out what was causing the growth their son has had since he was a baby. Help: The cost of Jose's ongoing care is being funded with help from a hospital, fundraisers from a church and donations from around the world . ‘When Jose was born with the growth we were terrified for him,’ she recalled. ‘The doctors told me it was very likely the baby wouldn't even survive the night. ‘I felt bad because we didn't have the financial resources to get him the help he needed.’ Mr Ramirez Sr added: ‘The little ball he had as a baby has grown and now it's spreading to the sides. It seems to be filling up more. The first year was difficult because we didn't know what could happen and if we could hurt him. ‘The lump was as big as his head, so it was difficult to hold him. Because they said he wouldn't survive, I get a sense of pride to still have him.’ Jose Jr said, beaming: ‘Now I have much more hope. I just want to be able to play and have fun.’ The emotional scenes are captured in new TLC UK series Body Bizarre. Baptist missionary Patricia Avila stumbled across Jose as she and her husband travelled to Ciudad Juarez, one of the world's poorest and most dangerous cities, where they work with children in orphanages. ‘We saw him in the street,’ she said. ‘My husband and I turned to each other and said 'Did you see what I just saw?” I told him “We have to do something”.’ Now the cost of Jose's ongoing care is being funded with help from the hospital, fundraisers from the church and donations from around the world. Drug-makers Pfizer have agreed to cover the cost of the Viagra. Teamwork: From left, Baptist missionary Patricia Avila, father Jose Ramirez Sr, Pastor Si Vudagher, and mother Cindy pose for a photograph with Jose in Rio Rancho, New Mexico . The boy’s mother, who has three other children, said: ‘Now we can let ourselves dream about Jose's future. Who knows, maybe one day he can go to university and make a great life for himself. 'Words can express how grateful we are to the people who have helped us. It's surreal. It feels like a dream come true' Cindy, Jose's mother . ‘Our biggest fear was that the condition would be incurable and his life would still be at risk. And, of course, we're nervous about the surgery. But we've been told the chances are good. ‘He's excited to be able to wear collared shirts like his uncles. There is a girl he has a crush on and he's hoping she will think he looks handsome. ‘He's very brave. He's been through so much yet he always keeps a smile on his face. Now we just have to keep ourselves busy and hope for the best.’ A new medical series follows the family as they bring Jose from Mexico to the US for treatment and as doctors try to diagnose and find a cure for the huge growth.","Life-threatening growth threatened to stop Jose Serrano breathing .

"Ronald McDonald has a new look, and he's ready for a selfie. McDonald's said Wednesday its famous spokesclown will take an active role on social media for the first time, using the hashtag ronaldmcdonald. The move marks a turnaround from recent years, when the red-haired mascot faded to the background as McDonald's came under criticism for using him to market to children. But the world's biggest hamburger chain seems ready to give its clown a higher-profile role as it works to boost weak sales. Scroll down for video . Spokes-clown: McDonald's says it plans to use iconic clown, Ronald, in social media campaigns . The company says Ronald McDonald won't have his own Twitter handle, but that it will post photos and videos of him on its existing social media accounts. The clown, known for his painted-on smile and baggy yellow jumper, will also appear in TV ads later this year wearing new clothes, including cargo pants and a vest. Other photos of him posted by McDonald's on Wednesday showed him wearing a red sports coat over the cropped pants. 'His iconic big red shoes will remain the same,' McDonald's said in a statement. 'Selfies ... here I come! It's a big world and now, wherever I go and whatever I do ... I'm ready to show how fun can make great things happen,' McDonald's quoted the fictional clown as saying. Ronald's promotion comes as McDonald's looks to reset its business. The company, based in Oak Brook, Ill., is hoping to fix slowness and inaccuracies in orders and is emphasizing its most popular items in marketing, including the Big Mac and french fries. The return: The red-haired mascot faded to the background as McDonald's came under criticism for using him to market to children . Ronald McDonald, first played by longtime TV weatherman Willard Scott, made his debut in 1963 and has played a major role in making McDonald's the dominant player among kids in the fast-food industry. The company even named him its 'chief happiness officer' in 2003. A group called Corporate Accountability International in recent years has pressed McDonald's to retire the clown and stop marketing its food to children. McDonald's has defended its mascot as 'a force of good.' At its annual shareholder meeting last year, CEO Don Thompson noted the company hasn't been using the clown the way it used to, but stood by the mascot. 'Ronald is not a bad guy - he's about fun, he's a clown. So I'd ask all you to let your kids have fun too,' Thompson said. On Wednesday, the company said Ronald 'represents the magic and happiness' of McDonald's. History: The original Ronald McDonald was played by legendary weatherman Willard Scott . After staying relatively quiet in recent years, the clown did make an appearance of sorts online recently after Taco Bell ran TV ads featuring real-life Ronald McDonalds professing their love for its breakfast. McDonald's subsequently tweeted a photo of the clown kneeling down to pet a Chihuahua. The image was a reference to Taco Bell's retired mascot and received around 3,000 retweets. McDonald's said Franchise owners around the world will be able to use new designs incorporating the revamped Ronald over the next few years.","McDonald's announced Wednesday that its iconic clown mascot will take an active role in the restaurant's social media campaigns .

"Big prize: Corey Knowlton is believed to be the man who paid $350,000 for the license to shoot a black rhino . The hunter who paid $350,000 at a Dallas auction on Saturday to hunt a black rhino, one of the most endangered animals on the planet, says not to judge him - he cares 'deeply' about all animals. Corey Knowlton, who has faced death threats since ponying up the cash to hunt the endangered animal, took to Facebook on Monday to respond to the mounting criticism. 'Thank you all for your comments about conservation and the current situation regarding the black rhino. I am considering all sides and concerns involved in this unique situation,' Knowlton wrote on his Facebook page. 'Please don't rush to judgment with emotionally driven criticism towards individuals on either sides of this issue. I deeply care about all of the inhabitants of this planet and I am looking forward to more educated discussion regarding the ongoing conservation effort for the black rhino.' The 'license to kill' was sold by the Dallas Safari Club in conjunction with the Namibian government, as a minister from the African country was said to be jumping up and down in elation at the result because the funds go to conservation efforts in the country. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Big game: Knowlton is an experienced hunter who takes clients on hunting excursions all over the world . Rare: Many of the animals Knowlton hunts are rare animals from exotic locations, like this ram . Conservation: Knowlton claims to love all animals on the planet and is a big supporter of conservation efforts . Mr . Knowlton is an active hunter who arranges shooting trips around the . globe, and regularly posts updates of pictures on his Facebook profile . of himself with clients and the dead animals that they kill. The . hacktivist group Anonymous has now become involved in the debate and . launched a virtual attack- which they have named as OpFunKill- on . hunters involved with the auction. 'Unspeakable . and terrible things happen every second of every day while the whole . planet is forced to watch, as these cold hearted soulless zombies cause . horrific suffering and death to animals, both common, vulnerable and . critically endangered species,' they said in a manifesto. Mr . Knowlton, a married father of two young daughters, is a part of the . Hunting Consortium and his company biography boasts that he has worked . in the hunting tourism industry for more than a decade. Endangered: An estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in the 1960s . 'Corey Knowlton has hunted widely on 6 continents taking more than 120 species, including a Super Slam of wild sheep and the big five in Africa.' it states. He lists conservation as one of his major interests, which stays in line with the Dallas Safari Club's claims that the sale of the license helps protect the endangered species by focusing on the killing of specific, older and arguably more aggressive beasts. The animal that is listed as the target involved with this weekend's sale is Ronnie, an older bull rhino who can no longer breed. Club spokesman Steve Wagner told The Dallas Morning News that the animal was likely becoming a threat to other wildlife as he is getting more aggressive in his old age. Happy hunters: Knowlton (right) has been leading tourist hunting trips for over a decade . An . estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in . the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the safari club. The Dallas Safari Club sale, which has been condemned by environmental groups, was offering the chance to shoot the rare beast as a way to raise funds for the species' conservation. While there were protesters at the event and animal rights groups have regularly spoken out against the sales of hunting licenses, the organizers were more upset that they didn't raise more money- as they were originally hoping to reach the million-dollar mark. 'It annoys me to tears,' said Hanns-Louis Lamprecht, who runs a safari company in Namibia. 'I was so angry last night. A million dollars would have lasted years, years in the conservation efforts...The fact is it could have been more — it could have been a lot more,' he told The Dallas Morning News. The Dallas Safari Club hopes to raise money in order to conserve the rhino in Nambia . A beautiful series of giraffe art is on view and available for sale at the Dallas Safari Club expo in Dallas . After complaints and protests about the . sale, the FBI said earlier this week that it was investigating death . threats against members of the club. About 40 protesters held signs and chanted outside the convention center where the . auction and dinner took place. Jim . and Lauren Ries traveled from Atlanta to join the protest after their . children Carter, 12, and Olivia, 11, asked if they could campaign. 'We heard what the . Dallas Safari Club was doing and we thought it was just wrong that they . were auctioning off to kill a black rhino and we really got upset that . they were thinking this,' Carter said. The family run a nonprofit organization, One More Generation, which is dedicated to saving endangered species. The Dallas Safari Club has adopted a new definition of the ideal hunt-able male African lion as well as the rhino . 'There's less than 5,000 black rhinos . left on the planet and if our kids ever want to see . a rhino left in the wild, we can't be pulling the trigger on every one . we say is too old to breed,' Mr Ries said. Ben . Carter, executive director of the Safari Club, defended the auction. He . said all money raised will go toward rhino conservation efforts. He also said the rhino that the . winner will hunt is old, male and non breeding — and that the animal was . likely to be targeted for removal anyway because it was becoming . aggressive and threatening other wildlife. Mr Carter added that wildlife experts say culling a herd is an acceptable habitat management practice. 'In most cases, this animal is detrimental,' Mr Carter said. 'He's past his prime.' But . critics have questioned that logic. Officials from the Humane Society . and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have said that while . culling can be appropriate in abundant animal populations, all black . rhinos should be protected, given their endangered status. Critics have also said any hunting of a rhino sends a bad message to the public. This . auction is telling the world that an American will pay anything to kill . their species,' Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of . the Massachusetts-based IFAW, said earlier this week. 'This is, in fact, making a spectacle of killing an endangered species.' The . auction took place in downtown Dallas under tight security and behind . closed doors.

"United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann has challenged his players to take a leaf out of the books of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as they attempt to establish themselves on the international stage. The Americans won admirers at the World Cup finals in Brazil as they came close to dumping Belgium out of the competition and making it to the quarter-finals, a feat which attracted unprecedented support for the game back at home. However, Klinsmann admits the emotional toll on the men who fought so valiantly for the nation has been significant since, and that is the biggest lesson they have to learn as they continue their education. United States boss Jurgen Klinsmann wants his players to take a leaf out of the superstars' book . He said: 'I was asked how to do handle the roster coming out of the World Cup with all the emotional things that happened in our country and get these players back on track. It is not easy for these young people, but it is also now a tremendous learning experience. 'You see Cristiano Ronaldo and Messi - they have three weeks' vacation, they go back to their club teams and they rock the boat, they play like they didn't go on vacation. 'Our players, they went on vacation, they had a good time, they came back and they lost their spots at their clubs, or other players went back and because it was a six- to eight-week marathon that they went through, a very emotional marathon, they couldn't keep it up. 'They couldn't keep it to the highest level and the air is out for quite a while.' Robbie Brady (centre) is mobbed by his team-mates after scoring Ireland's fourth goal late on in the contest . Mikkel Diskerud (right) celebrates after his 39th-minute equaliser in Dublin against Republic of Ireland . Klinsmann's comments came after Tuesday night's 4-1 friendly defeat by the Republic of Ireland in Dublin, a game in which he tested the depth of his squad with goalkeeper Brad Guzan rested and DaMarcus Beasley, Jermaine Jones, DeAndre Yedlin and Lee Nguyen having been released ahead of vital MLS play-off fixtures. The USA enjoyed the better of the first half despite falling behind to Anthony Pilkington's seventh-minute opener and levelled before half-time through Mix Diskerud. However, a Robbie Brady double either side of substitute James McClean's deflected 82nd-minute strike condemned them to a defeat which extended their run to one win in five matches since their summer heroics. Klinsmann was understandably disappointed by the result, but insisted the experience of recent months would ultimately serve his players well. He said: 'It's a good learning curve. Is it fun? No, but we'll deal with it. Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi embrace ahead of their meeting at Old Trafford on Tuesday . 'The main objective this year was obviously the World Cup. It was all about the World Cup and I think we did a good job overall. 'After the World Cup, this is the time now to bring the youngsters in, to bring a new wave in and to see what they can do, and you do it obviously at the cost of some results. 'Also the learning curve - I mentioned that after the last two games - is also that they have to learn emotionally how to digest a World Cup, and a lot of our players really had big problems digesting those extreme emotions. 'They dropped 20, 30, even 40 per cent in performances in their club environment. Many of the Europeans [players at clubs in Europe] lost their starting spot, many other players in MLS or whatever went down 30, 40 per cent in their performances. 'This is because they didn't know how to deal with all these emotions and all that recognition and all the compliments in the world that came after the World Cup, and in a certain way, it's human, it's understandable.

At that point he didn't know it was a pellet, so he told us he thought he was going to die. 'Physically he has recovered from the incident but mentally he is terrified. He is scared to go out and he now sticks by me or his dad's side. 'He is worried he might have been specifically targeted. He knows the police have arrested people but he also knows they are not still locked up in the police station. 'He's scared if he goes out again they might attack again. 'I dread to think what could have happened if it would have been an inch or so lower - it would have changed his whole life. 'I think a lot of people aren't aware how dangerous air rifles can be. It's important that children are not left unsupervised with them.' Police have released a picture of the schoolboy's injury to raise awareness about the dangers of young children using air rifles. Detective Constable Andy Froggatt, said: 'Connor was standing next to the nets with some other boys watching a nearby rugby game when he felt what he thought was a stone hit his head. 'He ran to his dad because he could feel blood and his dad could see that a.22 pellet was lodged in Connor's forehead just above his left eye. 'This was a very serious incident. The photos clearly show how nasty the injury was, but it could have been much worse if the pellet had hit the Connor's eye. 'Thankfully Connor is recovering well now, but he was extremely upset by what happened. 'We are appealing to anyone who was at the football or rugby games that were being played on Saturday and witnessed the incident to contact police. 'We'd also like to remind people about the dangers of using air weapons in public places.'

"Chris Martin was honest to the point of bluntness. After a full Scotland debut he instantly wanted to forget, the Derby striker is simply left hoping he gets another chance to prove his worth. Martin had made four previous substitute appearances in dark blue before an ankle injury to Steven Fletcher opened the way for him to start against England on Tuesday night. The stage was set at Celtic Park — the ground his father Gerry used to visit as a fan — for the 26-year-old to properly announce his arrival. Ultimately, though, his individual display was emblematic of the collective ease with which Gordon Strachan’s side were swept aside in a 3-1 defeat. Chris Martin admitted he and Scotland struggled against England during Tuesday night's 3-1 defeat . Martin was utterly dominated by Gary Cahill and Chris Smalling, lasting just 45 minutes before Strachan withdrew him at half-time. His big night wasn’t supposed to be like this. Lamenting the loss of his club form when it truly mattered, the Suffolk-born forward knows he has to radically improve to threaten Fletcher’s spot at the apex of the national side. ‘It was a tough 45 minutes, both individually and as a team,’ admitted Martin. ‘We struggled a little bit. ‘Personally, I didn’t get hold of the ball and it is important that I learn from it. It was my first taste of starting at this sort of level against a very good side in England with some very good players. ‘I have to review it and see where I went wrong. That is all I can do. I am disappointed with myself. That is one of the worst games I have played for a long time. ‘I think I am better than that. I don’t want to be remembered for that game and I hope I get another chance to prove I am better than that and I will have to bide my time and wait and see.’ Martin keeps his eyes on the ball and manages to hold off the challenge of England defender Gary Cahill . A four-month shutdown for Scotland means Martin will have to wait until at least March, when Gibraltar visit on Euro 2016 business. Starring for Derby in the interim is all he can do. ‘Most players are probably their own biggest critics because that is how you improve as a person and player,’ added Martin. ‘Everyone has to do that. This was a big game for me against players performing week in, week out in the Champions League and that is a big step-up from what I am used to in the Championship with Derby. It is a great learning curve for me.’ Strachan’s decision to substitute Martin delivered a public verdict on his performance, but the former Norwich man admitted he had no complaints. ‘The manager wanted to win the game and felt he needed to change the team,’ he said. ‘I’m not going to take any offence to being taken off. He trusted me to start me but I obviously didn’t do enough to stay on the pitch. That’ s quite simple. ‘The manager wanted to change it to try to get back into the game. I respect that. ‘I’m not sure if I’ll speak to the manager in the months ahead. What I have to do is knuckle down and play well for Derby so I can get called up again. ‘Overall, the better team won. England played better than us and created more chances. We didn’t play as well as we have done, which is disappointing because it would have been nice to see how we matched up to them.’ Martin, pictured against Chris Smalling, admits he needs to knuckle down for Derby over the coming months . The ease with which England sampled success on their first trip north in 15 years provided a comedown after the ecstasy of Friday night’s 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifier victory over the Republic of Ireland. ‘You have to have the feeling that we won the game that mattered most,’ admitted Martin. ‘That’s not just because we lost this one and everyone wants to look back. ‘We won the big game against Ireland, where we picked up three points. But don’t get me wrong, we are all very disappointed with the performance tonight. We want to be better than that.’ Those feelings were echoed by captain Scott Brown, who insisted Scotland could not use the immense effort invested against the Irish as mitigation for last night’s display. ‘We got a good few days recovery in,’ said Brown. ‘That was no excuse. There are no excuses. ‘We just didn’t do enough on the ball or create chances. We didn’t put England under pressure. I feel like we let ourselves down. ‘We know we are a lot better than that and can play better. We know we have much more to offer. Martin expertly brings the ball down but only lasted until half-time before being replaced by Darren Fletcher . ‘We are aware we have let ourselves and the fans down. More than 100,000 have turned up in these two games and it was another great atmosphere. ‘The biggest problem is we know we can compete. We showed it at Wembley last year. It wasn’t a case of us underestimating England. ‘They are a great side. They have a squad full of world-class players, playing in the Premier League every week. But so do we, so there are no excuses.’ Once that anguish fades, Brown admitted he would happily accept a 2015 that displayed the same progress as the current year. ‘It’s been a great year but next year is even more important,’ he added. ‘We have got to try to maintain this level in 2015 and keep trying to get the wins to stay up the table. ‘It’s not a case of it being a reality check. We have really kicked on. ‘There is always going to be a stumble here or there and, thankfully, it came in a friendly match.’","Chris Martin was substituted at half-time during Scotland's defeat to England on Tuesday evening .

"Sainsbury's has been accused of 'blatant' hypocrisy today over plans to demolish a First World War war memorial while using an  advert honouring the Armed Forces to boost Christmas sales. The supermarket giant's controversial festive commercial features the famous Christmas Day truce of 1914 where British and German soldiers met in no man's land to exchange gifts and play football. But while working on the advert with the Royal British Legion the retailer has also been planning to knock down the Memorial Stadium in Bristol and replace it with a new store. Anger: Sainsbury's has been branded 'hypocritical' because it plans to remove this Bristol war memorial while running a Christmas campaign with the Royal British Legion . All change: The memorial, left, is part of the Memorial Stadium used by Bristol Rovers and Bristol rugby club until this year . The ground is currently home to Bristol Rovers Football Club, but was built in 1921 in memory of 300 local rugby players who died in the war. Campaigners say the supermarket is being 'blatantly hypocritical' and have accused it of a lack of respect for the historical sports ground. Sainsbury's insists it will build a new memorial within the new development using stone from the existing pillars and the inscribed gates. Jamie Carstairs, a campaigner against the new supermarket, said: 'Sainsbury's advert is slick, manipulative, artful film making - and also a tawdry, tasteless and inappropriate use of WW1 sacrifices and memories. 'The company has long planned and spent thousands preparing to destroy Bristol's famous war memorial sports ground in Bristol. 'They are reported to want to go ahead with their plans. So, yes, Sainsbury's are indeed being blatantly hypocritical. 'If only they would at least try to understand what the Memorial Ground is, before they destroy it. '(They) have failed to grasp a basic fact: that the gates on their own do not constitute the war memorial. 'Nor have they shown any understanding that this sports ground is not any old brown field site, it is a war memorial. 'Nor have they appreciated how utterly disgraceful and tawdry and insulting their plans are.' The stands and the dressing room at the Memorial Stadium were built on fields donated by a local businessman. It became the home for Bristol Rugby Club but ownership was passed on to Bristol Rovers Football Club in the 1990s. Vision: The new Sainsbury's store in Bristol will look like this - and the company says that it will contain a new memorial and a memorial square . Magic moment: A British and a German soldier meet in No Man's Land on Christmas Day in the new Sainsbury's advert unveiled last week . Drama: The young Briton is deep in thought and then, to shouts of fear and anger from his comrades, decided to climb above ground . Special: The story of the German and British soldiers enjoying a game of football during the First World War has become legendary . The side, which was relegated from the Football League last season, is trying to sell the ground so it can build a new stadium on the outskirts of Bristol. But in order to fund the move it needs to sell the Memorial Stadium and Sainsbury's obtained planning permission for a new store, homes and community facilities in January 2013. The redevelopment will involve demolishing the entire ground, along with the iconic Memorial Gates which are the scene of a Remembrance Service every November. Campaigners insist the entire ground represents a war memorial and are furious that the gates are being dismantled. The £40million project, including the construction of a 4,851 square metre supermarket, also faces opposition because of traffic and noise concerns. Diana Scrafton, a director at TRASHorfield, a group fighting to preserve the ground, added: 'While the nation watches the emotion-packed advert, the days are numbered for Bristol's largest war memorial. 'This inspiring and poignant sports-ground tribute to 300 soldier-sportsmen who played the 'Greater Game' is to be demolished by Sainsbury's and replaced by a giant superstore. 'How can Sainsbury's do this in the centenary years of the great war while exploiting the pathos of the Christmas truce of 1914?' Fresh start: The stadium that Bristol Rover hope to build after they sell the Memorial ground to Sainsbury's . But Sainsbury's claims it has acknowledged the importance of the ground and are working on plans to preserve the memorial aspect. A spokesman for the supermarket said: 'We absolutely refute we are operating double standards. 'We recognise that the site has historical importance which is why our plans preserve the memorial stone and also create a public square dedicated to the memory of former Bristol rugby players.' Sainsbury's reconstructed the trenches scenes with the help of a war historian to celebrate the supermarket's 20 years of support for the Royal British Legion, which runs the annual poppy campaign. While some called it moving and brilliant were saying it was a 'cynical' way for a big business to advertise itself. Juliette AdAstra added her concerns, saying: 'If there's anything more tasteless and cynical than the Sainsbury's Christmas advert, I've yet to see it'. Stephen Bellamy tweeted: 'The Sainsbury's Christmas advert feels somewhat manipulative' and Craig Lewis wrote: 'Companies using the the First World War as an effort to boost sales is disgusting and disrespectful to the fallen'.","New advert shows  WW1 soldiers in no man's land on Christmas Day 1914 .

"Convicted rapist Ched Evans will be offered a day job by his fiancee's millionaire father if his return to football is blocked, it emerged today. Last week the 25-year-old was offered the chance to train with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence. But the decision sparked a huge backlash from a series of high-profile supporters, including Jessica Ennis-Hill and presenter Charlie Webster, who quit as club patron. Evans was expected to start playing football again  last Tuesday, but is yet to turn up. Scroll down for video . Support: The father of Natasha Massey,left,  Ched Evans' fiancee, will offer him a job if his football comeback fails, it has emerged . Out and about: Evans took the rubbish out at home before going for a run as he again failed to go training with Sheffield United today . It has since been reported that the club may not offer the Welsh international a new contract because he is considered 'toxic'. The millionaire father of Evans' fiancee Natasha Massey will offer him a role at his empire, which includes high-end jewellers and a staff rewards ­business, if his football comeback fails, the Mirror said. A source told the paper that Karl Massey said there would always be a job for Evans at one of his firms. They added: 'He believes 100 per cent in Ched's ­innocence, otherwise he wouldn't ­sanction him still dating his daughter or have given them his blessing to marry.' It has been reported that Mr Massey, 50, has paid for a PR campaign which protests Evans' innocence. He is also said to have hired lawyers to present new evidence to the Criminal Cases Review ­Commission in a bid to overturn his conviction. Meanwhile Sheffield United have admitted they are 'appalled' by the abuse being aimed at people who have criticised the club's decision to allow convicted rapist Evans back to training. Twitter abuse was aimed at Olympic heptathlon champion and local hero Jessica Ennis-Hill, who said that to allow Evans back into the Blades squad would 'completely contradict' her beliefs of being a role model to young people. She asked for her name to removed from a stand at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground if the club takes back Evans. 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example,' she said. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Jessica Ennis-Hill, 27, has received rape threats on Twitter after she said she wanted her name removed from a stand at Sheffield United if Ched Evans is re-signed by the club . Last week the 25-year-old returned to training with his former club Sheffield United after he was released from jail last month, having served half his five-year rape sentence . Within hours she was taunted with several sick tweets including one saying: 'I hope he (Evans) rapes her.' The League One club have pledged to work with South Yorkshire Police who are investigating the abuse. People who send this kind of abuse on social media or when chanting at grounds should not feel safe to make these personal attacks, the club said. Ennis-Hill, a United fan, had a stand at Bramall Lane named in her honour after she won gold at the London 2012 Olympics. Campaigners against sexual violence have criticised the club's decision to allow Evans, 25, to train with the team. TV presenter Charlie Webster, Sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned as patrons of the club since Evans returned to training. Wales international Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The striker denied raping the woman, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train . Backlash: There has been huge support for a campaign to stop Evans returning to his former club, and other believe as he has only served half his five-year sentence a ban should last for at least that period . He was released from prison last month after serving half of the five-year sentence. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name. South Yorkshire Police said on Friday: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm they are investigating reports of abusive tweets. Officers are making efforts to contact the individual concerned, but have launched an investigation into the posts.'","Evans, 25, is allowed to start training with his former club Sheffield United .

"England batsman James Taylor is using Kevin Pietersen's criticism of him as motivation to win a place in the World Cup squad and dismissed him as 'one of those little people who doubts me'. Taylor made his Test debut in the series against South Africa in 2012 but has struggled for an England spot since, making just a single one-day appearance against Ireland in 2013. In his autobiography released last month, Pietersen wrote how he told then-coach Andy Flower that Taylor was too short for international cricket and how he 'didn't think he was up to it'. James Taylor (left) will use Kevin Pietersen's criticism as motivation on England's ODI tour to Sri Lanka . The 5ft 6in right-hander has earned a recall for England's upcoming one-day series in Sri Lanka and admits he will be using Pietersen's comments to drive him on. 'I took it nicely,' Taylor said with a smile on his face. Pietersen celebrates a half century at Headingley in 2012 as Taylor comes to congratulate him . 'Everybody is allowed their opinion and I've had plenty of people in the past saying things about me behind my back, that's just the way it is. 'We're all big enough and strong enough to take it - it motivates you. 'There are plenty of people who have doubted me in the past and he's just another one of those little people who doubts me. 'I've proven them wrong and I'll continue to do that - it spurs you on, proving people wrong is a big motivation for me.' Taylor, who is currently doing Movember, added: 'There's no anger. So many people doubt you all the time - especially with me being smaller than most. 'That doesn't bother me though - I pack a decent punch for my size. 'I've also scored runs in the past and hopefully I'll do that in the future in international cricket.' Taylor enjoyed an impressive domestic campaign for Nottinghamshire and scored four centuries in his last eight games for the club. England have been criticised for being tactically rigid in the one-day game but Taylor believes he can add some versatility to the side's batting line-up. 'I think that's my biggest strength - adapting to any given situation put in front of me,' Taylor said. Taylor posted this picture on Twitter on Friday showing his effort so far for Movember . 'I scored a few hundreds at the end of the season and every one was in a different situation. 'The tempo was different each time and I think we won every game bar one. 'So I'm winning games and that's what I want to do for England, win games and finish games and put in those match-winning performances.' After their seven-match series in Sri Lanka, England will play four matches in a Triangular Series with Australia and India. Taylor batting for England at Headingley in 2012 (left) and as captain of the Lions in the summer . The programme allows Alastair Cook's side time to establish some rhythm before the World Cup starts in February and Taylor is determined to show what he can do. 'There are seven ODIs for me to impress and show what I can do on and off the field so fingers crossed my name is in that World Cup squad,' Taylor said. 'It's like a new start for us. If you look down the squad and look at the names - the talent and match-winners we have with bat and ball is outstanding. 'There's a great mix of youth and experience. It's nice to be a part of.

Clarke was out for 11, caught behind when he gloved an attempted pull shot off Dale Steyn's bowling, and slowly left the field. It was the same problem that forced Clarke, who has a long history of lower back problems, out of the tri-series in Zimbabwe in September. George Bailey stepped in as captain for the remainder of the match, and is likely to retain the job for the ODI series if Clarke is out long-term.","Michael Clarke could miss Cricket World Cup after hamstring injury .

"Alice Powell's hopes of taking part in next weekend's Abu Dhabi Grand Prix look doomed, even though her grandfather is ready to dip into his savings to help her become a Formula One driver. Powell, 21, from Chipping Norton, was in the reckoning to drive in the first practice session for Caterham but the team's administrators told Sportsmail that they would sign two drivers for the full weekend rather than take on someone extra for one part of it. Alice Powell was in reckoning to make her Formula One debut for Caterham in Abu Dhabi next weekend . Powell's grandfather offered to pay £35,000 for her to race in the first practice session . Powell hoped to line up on the grid alongside fellow Brits Lewis Hamilton, Jenson Button and Max Chilton . Maria Teresa de Filippis: The Italian became the first female to race in F1 at 1958 Belgian Grand Prix. Lella Lombardi: Another Italian, raced 17 times in 1974-76 and only female to achieve a top-six finish. Divina Galica: The Brit was multi-talented, captaining women's Olympic ski team in 1968 and 1972 and driving in three grands prix. Desire Wilson: Qualified 16th for home grand prix in South Africa in 1981, but retired after her car was damaged. Giovanna Amati: Rose through F3 and F3000 ranks, though she never qualified for F1 grid. And the bid of £35,000 from Powell's grandfather is unlikely to be enough to secure her a race seat. 'We have had five people show real interest in driving,' said Finnbar O'Connell, of administrators Smith & Williamson. 'Whichever two are picked will be involved in each practice session.' While Powell's chance looks to have gone, the door may yet open for another young British driver. Jolyon Palmer, son of former F1 driver Dr Jonathan Palmer, is now a front-runner according to one well-placed source. Palmer, 23, certainly deserves his break after being crowned GP2 champion last month, making him the first British winner of Formula One's feeder series since Lewis Hamilton eight years ago. Caterham's administrators launched a 'crowdfunding' project last week in an attempt to raise enough money for the team to compete in Abu Dhabi after missing the past two races. They are over halfway towards their £2.35m target but time is running out with the cars due to be transported this weekend. O'Connell said: 'I do believe we will be in Abu Dhabi', adding that 'one individual and one group of investors have made contact about helping in the long term. Jolyon Palmer (centre), son of former F1 driver Dr Jonathan Palmer, is now a front-runner . Powell's management are still working to secure her FIA super-licence in the hope she could yet get her chance. Meanwhile, Marcus Ericsson has announced his departure from troubled Formula One team Caterham with immediate effect. Ericsson has already signed a contract to race for Sauber in the 2015 season and will not now compete in the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The Swede had been forced to sit out the previous two races due to Caterham going into administration, but the team is trying to crowd-source a return to the grid. In a statement posted on his official website, Ericsson said: 'Following recent events re Caterham Sports Limited and 1 MRT Sdn Bhd, my adviser Eje Elgh and I have decided to terminate, with immediate effect, all agreements connecting me to the Caterham F1 team.

"Willie le Roux had a scan on a suspected fractured cheekbone on Monday which could rule him out of the remainder of South Africa's European tour. The 25-year-old fullback was in sparkling form in the Springboks' 31-28 victory over England at Twickenham on Saturday and took a knock to the face as he off-loaded to scrum half Cobus Reinach to score a try just after half-time. Le Roux played on but severe swelling caused him to miss training in Padova on Monday and Springboks' team doctor Craig Roberts told reporters he would have an X-ray which would determine his availability for Saturday's test against Italy, as well as the final match of the tour against Wales. Willie le Roux of South Africa (left) is awaiting scans on his suspected fractured cheekbone . If it is a fracture, Le Roux will be ruled out for 'three to four weeks', said Roberts. If unavailable, Le Roux's full back place will be taken by either Pat Lambie, who started at fly half against England, or Johan Goosen. The only other injury concern for South Africa is prop Jannie du Plessis, who not only hyper-extended his knee in a ruck, but also strained a hamstring. Du Plessis is a serious doubt for the Italy test, with the Springboks having already called up a replacement in uncapped Lions prop Ruan Dreyer.

"Alastair Cook sat at a gloomy Lord’s yesterday and insisted that the dark clouds which have hovered over England since they sacked Kevin Pietersen have finally cleared. The publication of Pietersen’s book is seen by Cook as the last chapter in a miserable story which has dogged England ever since they were thrashed by Australia and he will travel to Sri Lanka tomorrow insisting the slate is now clean. ‘We’ve had a couple of weeks together and we haven’t felt the need to talk about it at all,’ insisted the England captain of KP’s book. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Kevin Pietersen (left) and Alastair Cook walk off in Melbourne after England's defeat in the fourth Ashes Test . Cook says England will focus on Sri Lanka and can move on from the Pietersen saga . ‘All the fall-out has happened now. I felt in the summer we were moving on as a team but we had this publication date hanging over us and everyone was talking about what was going to be said. Now it’s all in the open from his side, no more can come out, and we can build and look forward as a side.’ Cook knows that the best way for England to move on would be to end a run of five one-day series defeats in six when they play Sri Lanka seven times in the build-up to the World Cup. The England captain confounded the doubters in Test cricket this summer and has to do it again now in the face of questions over his position as one-day leader from former team-mate Graeme Swann and he was keen to hit back on Friday. Kevin Pietersen's book has dogged England since they were last thrashed by Australia . ‘Well, didn’t Michael Vaughan want me out as Test captain as well?’ said Cook. ‘He actually had to admit he was wrong. It would be great if people had to change their tune over the one-day game in five months time. ‘I’m convinced I can do the job. The only time England have been No 1 in one-day was when I was captain.’ That was two years ago when England looked like World Cup contenders, as they did in reaching the Champions Trophy final, but their one-day form has deteriorated since. ‘I think the priorities changed,’ said Cook, who admitted he has no idea what his best World Cup side is. ‘We had back-to-back Ashes series so a lot of the guys were rested from one-day cricket. But there are no excuses now. We have time to focus on the one-day game and there are guys who are desperate to get into the World Cup squad.’ Cook admits England still haven't decided who will travel to the World Cup which begins in February . Meanwhile, Cook’s former opening partner Nick Compton has left Somerset by mutual agreement to ‘relocate to south west London’. Australia recovered from Michael Clarke’s early injury to beat South Africa by 32 runs in the first one-day international in Perth.","Alastair Cook says all the fall out from the book has happened now .

"John McEnroe picked his words carefully as he considered Amelie Mauresmo’s tenure as Andy Murray’s coach but his sentiments were clear. ‘I would not call it a roaring success, that would be the simplest way of putting it,’ said the American as he assessed the first five months of the pair’s groundbreaking arrangement. ‘That doesn’t mean that it shouldn’t be given more time. When I played Ivan (Lendl) recently he said that for these things it needs a year or two. So if that’s true you’ve got to give her more time — if people believe that.’ Andy Murray looks dejected as he loses in straight sets against Roger Federer on Thursday night . Amelie Mauresmo (left) watches on as her charge Murray practices before the ATP World Tour Finals . Whoever came after Lendl was going to find that he cast a long shadow — we might call it David Moyes syndrome — but you had to wonder whether Murray would have capitulated so badly against Roger Federer on Thursday if the gnarled old Czech had been in his corner. Getting just one game off the Swiss master was an illustration of just how much ground he has lost to the trio of players who rule the men’s tour. Federer is not even the best any more. Novak Djokovic proved that title belongs to him on Friday when he thrashed Tomas Berdych 6-2, 6-2 to guarantee the year-end world No 1 slot and his place in Saturday’s semi-finals of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals. Murray will not be watching if he takes McEnroe’s advice to rest after the rigours of qualifying for the O2, which probably contributed to some flat performances. ‘If I was his coach I’d have him take a break,’ said the American. ‘He has played too much, he is on the verge of burn-out, I’d assume. Novak Djokovic (second left) receives his world No 1 trophy in the presence of a number of tennis legends including John McEnroe (third right) ‘If he learns anything from Roger, it would be to forget that match. Roger is magnificent at forgetting devastating losses. He shrugs it off and moves on.’ Murray will try to do that with Mauresmo in the off-season but if he thought scrutiny of their partnership would wear off after the initial burst of interest he would have been wrong. Greg Rusedski claimed in his television commentary that Murray has retreated into his comfort zone of playing more passively since teaming up with his French mentor in early June. In the wake of Thursday night’s one-sided defeat, Murray responded: ‘What do you want me to do? The guy was half- volleying the ball inside the baseline, so you had no time to react. ‘The ball was coming off the middle of his racket on every shot, so I’d have been interested to see how Greg would have approached it.’ Murray is indeed held to high standards, in part due to his achievements. Finishing as world No 6 in the season after back surgery is hardly a disgrace and once again he had a consistent year in the Grand Slams. Murray waves to the crowd as he leaves the court on Thursday night following a humiliating defeat . But the reason for him ending the year 0-9 against Djokovic, Federer and Rafael Nadal is that they have continually improved and evolved their games while he has not and therein lies Mauresmo’s challenge. She has to try to get him playing more aggressively rather than following his natural instinct of hanging back behind the baseline. Perhaps the embarrassment against Federer could serve a purpose if it convinces him of the need for change. Murray has said that it has taken about five months for a new coach to have an impact on him, so if it is working with Mauresmo we should see it inside the first half of next year. Of more concern should be the occasions this year when he has mentally dialled out of matches, something in evidence worryingly often. Stan Wawrinka celebrates as he beats Marin Cilic in three sets at the ATP World Tour Finals on Friday . The most recent instances have been against Djokovic, Kei Nishikori and Federer, but it goes back further, such as in disappointing defeats at Queen’s and Wimbledon. There have been glimpses of his pre-op Lendl form, such as the first two sets at the US Open against Djokovic, but there will need to be more than flashes of that if the consensual bedside manner of Mauresmo is to prove a success. Djokovic finishes the year as No 1 for the third consecutive time and will face Nishikori in the semi-finals. Federer will face Stan Wawrinka in the other. Wawrinka needed to win just three games on Friday night against Marin Cilic but made certain by winning 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. ATP Tour chief executive Chris Kermode  floated the idea on Friday of creating a world championship for under-21s as part of a review of the sport’s structure that includes business leaders such as designer Tommy Hilfiger.","John McEnroe says he would not call the partnership a 'roaring success'

"Rohit Sharma revealed he felt so fresh after his record-breaking 264 against Sri Lanka he could have stayed at the crease for another 50 overs. Sharma racked up the highest ever one-day international score on Thursday and became the first player to score two career double centuries in a 50-over match in the process. Prior to the match, the 27-year-old had been out for almost three months due to finger and shoulder injuries. But, rather than causing him to be rusty, Sharma suggested his time away may have actually aided his longevity at the crease. Rohit Sharma celebrates after reaching his century against Sri Lanka in the ODI in Kolkata . Sharma  became the first player to score two career double centuries in a 50-over match . 'The fact that I went on to play 50 overs, that was really pleasing to me because I've been working on it, to bat as long as possible. So finally to do that was really good.' 'After a few months' break, I'm not really tired, I was ready to bat another 50 overs,' he said. 'But yeah, jokes apart, I was determined and dedicated to getting a big one. Once I got to fifty, I knew that I had to convert, because it was a good batting wicket. 'The scores here, even 300-350, are easily chaseable. We wanted to get a big score and that made me stay there as long as possible.' Sharma's total came off 173 balls with 33 fours and nine sixes to help India reach 4004 for five in Kolkata. 1) ROHIT SHARMA (India) 264 (173 balls) v Sri Lanka, November 13, 2014 . 2) VIRENDER SEHWAG (India) 219 (149 ball) v West Indies, December 8, 2011 . 3) ROHIT SHARMA (India) 209 (158 balls) v Australia, November 2, 2013 . 4) SACHIN TENDULKAR (India) 200* (147 balls) v South Africa, February 24, 2010 . 5) CHARLES COVENTRY (Zimbabwe) 194* (156 balls) v Bangladesh, August 16, 2009 . 6) SAEED ANWAR (Pakistan) 194 (146 balls) v India, May 21, 1997 . 7) VIV RICHARDS (West Indies) 189* (170 balls) v England, May 31, 1984 . 8) MARTIN GUPTILL (New Zealand) 189* (155 balls) v England, June 2, 2013 . 9) SANATH JAYASURIYA  (Sri Lanka) 189 (161 balls) v India, October 29, 2000 . 10) GARY KIRSTEN (South Africa) 188* (159 balls) v UAE February 16, 1996 .

"Sean Lamont's memories of Scotland’s last encounter with Tonga can give him sleepless nights as he recalls the 21-15 defeat that would cost Andy Robinson his job. That cold day at Pittodrie two years ago was the low point in the 90-cap career of the Scotland utility back. So, on Saturday at Rugby Park, when he and his team-mates face-up to Tonga once again, Lamont is determined to bury some demons. That sense of guilt remains, the depth of despair still felt. All Scotland could muster that day were five Greig Laidlaw penalties while Tonga scored two tries on their way to a famous victory. Sean Lamont (centre) stands dejected after Scotland’s 21-15 defeat to Tonga at Pittodrie in 2012 . For half an hour after the final whistle Robinson walked up and down the Pittodrie touchline deep in private conversion with SRU chief executive Mark Dodson. Later that evening he had resigned after accepting responsibility for the defeat, which had followed hammerings by New Zealand and South Africa. ‘That Tonga match two years holds bad memories for me,’ said Lamont. ‘I have had some bad losses but that was the most horrendous. ‘Not just because we didn’t want to give Tonga their first win over Scotland but because it cost a man his job — a man I got on well with and liked. Lamont (right) puts in a fend on Sione Piukala but the Tongans would go on to claim victory in Aberdeen . ‘The buck stops somewhere, but it was the players on the day who didn’t turn up and that cost us the game. ‘What made that loss even worse was that we thought our mindset was right and we would beat them. ‘At the end of the game all the players went back to our clubs and that was it. We got the chance to rebuild at the Six Nations but our coach was gone.’ There is no danger that Scotland head coach Vern Cotter will suffer a similar fate if Scotland lose to Tonga. He has won four out of six games in charge and his team go into the match off the back of a fine win over Argentina and a fighting loss to world champions New Zealand. But Lamont, who looks set to partner his Glasgow Warriors team-mate Alex Dunbar in the centre after Mark Bennett was ruled out with a hamstring injury, believes those two performances will count for little if Tonga are not beaten. Lamont gets physical with All Blacks flanker Richie McCaw during Scotland's narrow loss last Saturday . ‘There have been times in the past when we have had a couple of good showings then have dropped off and that is not what we want to do this time,’ said the 33-year-old. ‘It is very important we don’t take a backwards step in terms of performance against Tonga after beating Argentina and then pushing the All Blacks close. For the good of Scottish rugby, we need to keep kicking on. ‘As a squad, the display against New Zealand especially helped our self-belief, which had always been a big issue in the past. ‘From playing around the world, I know Scottish players are harder on themselves than any other nation but we are getting better at accepting that errors happen and you have to dust yourself down and get on with it. Lamont puts in a great tackle on New Zealand winger Julian Savea at Murrayfield last weekend . ‘We are at a point where we can realise our potential as we have a good, exciting side but we have to back up our performances — otherwise it is just talk again. ‘I think we can do that as we have got real depth in the squad that we have not had for a long time. ‘There is pride and passion in wearing the jersey and, under the new head coach, we have gone back to the drawing board and had a good look at ourselves and how we can improve.’ Lamont needs another 10 caps to join the elite band of international centurions but accepts it won’t be easy getting them in the run-up to the 2015 Rugby World Cup. With Tommy Seymour and Sean Maitland first-choice wingers and Tim Visser and Dougie Fife also in contention, he knows it will be difficult to retain a place in the squad in his favoured position although his ability to play also in the centre — as he is likely to do against Tonga — gives him an extra string to his bow. ‘I will never declare myself available for Scotland, someone will do that for me,’ added the Scotland star. ‘I am not here to count caps, though. I am here to do whatever I can for Scotland. It would be a nice landmark to get to 100 caps and if I am playing well and get there, I deserve it. If someone is playing well and I don’t get there, so be it. It is whatever is best for Scotland. ‘I have gone from saying, “me first”, to making sure it is “Scotland first” That is why I will never say I will retire from international rugby. I will just become surplus to requirements. ‘If I am not used this weekend, that is fine. I will not be happy about it but if that is what the boss thinks is best for Scotland, then that is it.’","Scotland were defeated 21-15 by Tonga two seasons ago .

"Trainer Jonjo O’Neill says his only chance of landing the trainers’ championship means hitting every target with his precious ammunition, starting with Johns Spirit in Saturday’s Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham. With 56 winners, O’Neill leads the title race by £50,000 from Philip Hobbs but the engines are being stoked by powerhouses Nicky Henderson and Paul Nicholls and O’Neill concedes holding top slot will be tough. O’Neill, 52, a dual champion jockey, said: ‘We have got about half a dozen good horses but it is the back-up which is a problem. Last Saturday, we had two runners and Paul Nicholls had five winners. That’s the difference. Trainer Jonjo O'Neill (right) said it will not be easy to hang on to top spot in the trainers' championship . O'Neill (right) currently leads the championship by £50,000 ahead of Philip Hobbs . ‘We need to hit every target with the good horses and it is not easy to do. We are also hoping some of the young horses will shape up like More Of That last did last season. ‘I’d love to win the title. There is no point being in the game if you are not ambitious.’ O’Neill plans to return his 2014 World Hurdle winner More Of That to action in the Long Distance Hurdle at Newbury’s Hennessy fixture. Johns Spirit (above) will be running for O'Neill in the Paddy Power Gold Cup at Cheltenham on Saturday . Established stars Taquin De Seuil, who goes for the Betfair Chase at Haydock on November 22, and Holywell, due to run at Aintree two weeks later, could now be joined on the Cheltenham Gold Cup trail by Irish National winner Shutthefrontdoor after his impressive comeback at Carlisle on Monday, . O’Neill said: ‘We are looking at running in the Lexus Chase (at Leopardstown on December 28). That should tell us which way to go. If he does well, you would have to look at the Gold Cup.’ O’Neill, currently deprived of sidelined stable jockey AP McCoy, plans a dual assault on the Paddy Power Gold Cup, a race he won in 2006 with Exotic Dancer, with Eastlake joining Johns Spirit, the 2013 winner attempting to become the sixth horse to win the race twice. O'Neill (right) is currently deprived of stable Jockey AP McCoy (left), who is sidelined by a shoulder injury .

"Better late than never for Ian Poulter, who on Thursday produced what he considers his best round of a dreadful year at the penultimate tournament of the season. A dusted-off putter from better times made the difference, leaving him second in the Turkish Airlines Open after an eight-under-par round. By his own four-letter description, Poulter’s 2014 campaign has been woeful, with injuries, a missed cut at The Open, Twitter rows and an underwhelming Ryder Cup by his standards. In that time his world ranking tumbled from 12th to 44, leaving him in danger of slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since September 2006. But Thursday afternoon there were signs that the 38-year-old was somewhere close to his best, following a sixth-placed finish in China last week with a sublime round of seven birdies, an eagle and only one dropped shot. Ian Poulter insists he is 'feeling right now' after a year in which he has 'played s***' as he moves second . Miguel Angel Jimenez leads the Turkish Airlines Open on nine under par, a shot ahead of Poulter . He cited the new Titleist clubs he switched to after the Ryder Cup as well a putter he unearthed from the 2013 Open, in which he finished third. ‘I’d played s*** all year,’ Poulter said. ‘There’s no other word for it. It was disappointing. There was nothing good coming out of 2014. ‘It’s been tough to take, it really has. I thought I was doing the right things at the start of the year and took a massive step backwards with injuries and trying to play through them is not good. ‘That’s a horrible spiral to be in when you’ve got two tour cards to make sure you maintain. Thankfully I’m feeling right now.’ Poulter (left, taking an approach shot on the 11 and right, his reaction to the shot) is second on eight under par . Poulter added: ‘I am having a boost at the right time. Sometimes you get a new car and it makes you feel good. I got new sticks in the bag. It felt great to be able to do that and that they worked really quickly. ‘When you get something new you are excited to use it. I have been excited for the last couple of weeks. I am happy with everything.’ Miguel Angel Jimenez led by a stroke on a day that all but eliminated Jamie Donaldson’s chances of snatching the Race to Dubai from Rory McIlroy. The Welshman needs to win here and in Dubai next week while hoping McIlroy finishes outside the top five when he returns in the desert. But a level-par round of 72 left the Ryder Cup player nine shots behind Jimenez, while the other two Race contenders in Sergio Garcia and Victor Dubuisson were horribly off the pace, shooting rounds of 75 and 77 respectively. Meanwhile, Turkey insists it is still bidding to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, a day after announcing their withdrawal over environmental concerns. Wales' Jamie Donaldson is now highly unlikely to catch Rory McIlroy in the Race to Dubai . The Welshman had a poor day and will hope to recover at in Antalya over the next few rounds .","Ian Poulter sits second at Turkish Airlines Open after first round .

"The first step has been made in the inevitable disqualification of Saturday’s Badger Beer Chase winner The Young Master with the BHA lodging an objection to the result. Arrangements are being made to hold a disciplinary hearing on Thursday when runner-up Court By Surprise is expected to be promoted. The Young Master was an effortless winner of the £60,000 Wincanton race but it later emerged that he was not eligible to run. A computer error allowed The Young Master to enter and win the Badger Beer Chase while being ineligible . Race conditions stated that a novice must have previously contested three chases and The Young Master had only run in two. The BHA confirmed that their initial investigations have shown a ‘computer systems error’ was responsible for The Young Master’s entry being accepted. But it also suggested the horse’s trainer, Neil Mulholland, may face some censure for his part in the episode. The statement said: ‘It remains the trainer’s responsibility to ensure a horse is not declared for a race for which it is not qualified.’ The enquiry will also decide whether The Young Master should carry a penalty should he take up an entry at Cheltenham on Friday and whether his handicap mark should be adjusted even if he is stripped of the prize. Trainer Neil Mulholland could face some sort of punishment following a disciplinary hearing . It has been a bad two weeks for British jumps racing. Race times suggest the distance of the Charlie Hall Chase run at Wetherby the previous weekend may have been shorter than advertised. Officials were yesterday measuring the Yorkshire track, which races again on Saturday, and the results are expected on Tuesday. The BHA will be praying the treble doesn’t come up with a disaster at the weekend’s big Cheltenham fixture.","The Young Master won the Badger Beer Chase at Wincanton on Saturday .

"Having just become the highest scoring foreign born player in NBA history, Dirk Nowitzki would be forgiven for looking ahead to his next personal milestone. The Dallas Mavericks power forward leapfrogged Hakeem Olajuwon into ninth place on the NBA's all-time scoring list on Tuesday night, the highest among international players. It's an achievement that Nowitzki is proud of having spent his entire NBA career with Dallas after moving to the States from Germany when he was 20 years old. But his next goal is not surpassing Elvin Hayes in eighth place on the all-time scoring list, it's a second NBA title with the Mavericks. 'When you’re still playing it is more about winning and being on a good team,' he said. 'These other milestones are going to be great in 10 or 20 years when I look back at my career and show them to my daughter and maybe my grandkids one day. 'Right now I’m still working on playing at a high level and chasing my dream – which is another championship.' Dirk Nowitzki became the highest scoring international player in NBA history . The 36-year-old German is a 12-time NBA All Star and his individual accolades also include an MVP crown in 2007 and Finals MVP in 2011, the year Dallas beat the Miami Heat to be crowned NBA champions. Despite all he has achieved individually with both the Mavericks and Germany, that solitary NBA title remains Nowitzki's career highlight. It speaks volumes for a man who has become the ultimate team player and a legend in Dallas. 'I play in a team sport and winning a championship is the ultimate,' Nowitzki said. 'I worked so hard and in 2011 everything came together. We achieved our goal. 'I never wanted to see myself as a big-time scorer who shoots every ball. I want to be efficient and wanted to come through for my team when counted on. Hopefully I can still do that over the next couple years and play at a high level with a good team. The Dallas Mavericks forward moved above Hakeem Olajuwon into ninth place in the all-time scoring list . Nowitzki has spent his entire NBA career with Dallas and won the NBA title in 2011 . 1.

Elvin Hayes 27,313 . 9. Dirk Nowitzki 26,953* . 10. Hakeem Olajuwon 26,946 . *still active, as of Tuesday 11 November . 'The last couple of years after winning the championship have been tough. We didn’t even make the play-offs one year. That was one of the reasons why I took a huge pay cut this summer, so we can get a good team in here.' Nowitzki continued: 'I came here a long time ago not knowing what to expect when I was 20 years old and Dallas embraced me. The people here were always kind and supported me and it felt like a second home. 'I missed Germany a lot in the beginning, but I found a new home here and it would not have felt right to go and play somewhere else and put on a different uniform. I always wanted to be in Dallas. It has been a great ride and I wouldn’t have wanted to do it anywhere else but here. 'I lived with my parents for 20 years and when I came over I had a tough time adjusting and living by myself. It was a tough time but I had to get through it somehow. I just kept working to try and get better and learned some stuff from the older players. Mavericks fans celebrate Nowitzki's achievement against the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday . 'But if someone would have told me 17 years ago that I would pass Hakeem Olajuwon, I would have said “you’re absolutely crazy”. It has been a fun ride with some great people and great supporters and the fans have been great for me all over the world.' Nowitzki hit a jumper from just inside the three-point line early in the fourth quarter of Dallas' 106-98 win over Sacremento on Tuesday to pass Olajuwon, and he finished the night at 26,953 career points - seven more than the Nigerian. 'I was kind of was aware that I wasn’t too far away,' Nowitzki said. 'But once the game was going on I was solely focussing on the next shot and trying to help the team win. It wasn‘t really in my mind during the game but I was definitely aware of it before. 'When I made the big shot I saw the crowd give me a standing ovation and then realised that was it. It was a very special moment to do it at home in front of the fans who have supported me in my 17 years here. 'They gave me a standing ovation and at the next timeout they showed a video in the big screen in honour of me. I had goose bumps.'

Anthony Davis (23) in action for the New Orleans as the Pelicans stun NBA champion San Antonio Spurs . Davis, who finished with 27 points and 11 rebounds, has become an elite NBA superstar almost overnight. From battling injuries in his rookie year to being named an NBA All-Star in his second season, 'The Brow' has soared into MVP conversation in his third year with highlight after highlight and huge stat lines to back them up. Davis does not move like other athletes of his size (6ft 10in, 220lbs). He possesses a fluidity that belongs in a smaller body and he punctuates the flowing quality of his motion with short, violent, utterly startling athletic bursts. Never afraid of hyperbole, the 10-time All-Star told reporters before the game that the match was 'probably one of the biggest sporting events that's up there ever.' GOOD WEEK .

"Scotland striker Steven Fletcher is relishing the opportunity of taking on club-mate John O'Shea for real as the pair prepare to go head-to-head with precious Euro 2016 qualifying points at stake. The 27-year-old frontman and the Republic of Ireland defender spend much of their time on the training pitch at Sunderland trying to get the better of each other, but they are in line to lock horns in earnest at Celtic Park on Friday evening as the two nations meet in Group D. Fletcher heads into the game in good form after scoring twice in the Black Cats' 3-1 Barclays Premier League victory at Crystal Palace last Monday night and playing his part in a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Everton on Sunday, and he has warned 33-year-old O'Shea he will be doing him few favours with national pride at stake. Scotland's Steven Fletcher pictured at Mar Hall near Glasgow as he prepares to face Ireland . Fletcher (centre) has a shot on goal during the Euro 2016 qualifier against Germany in September . He said: 'I am looking forward to it, to be fair. I have been running rings around him in training, so if I could do it in the game, it would be fine. 'I was pleased with my performances with Scotland [last month]. I was unlucky not to get a goal, but I was happy the way I played, and hopefully I can keep my place for the next game.' Meanwhile, Celtic fan Shane Long is hoping to go some of the way towards fulfilling two dreams if he gets the chance to line up against Scotland. The striker, who reminded international boss Martin O'Neill of his ability with a match-winning double in Southampton's 2-0 Barclays Premier League victory over Leicester on Saturday, will make his first visit to Celtic Park as the Republic of Ireland attempt to maintain a fine start to their qualifying campaign.

The 27-year-old said: 'It is massive. We have kind of been unlucky with the draws we have been getting with groups - we have a very tough group. 'Going to Celtic Park to play Scotland is going to be a massive occasion, and one I am really eager to be a part of. It is going to be a tough game. Scotland have really upped their game the last couple of years and they will see this as a chance to get three points as well. 'It could - and I might be overreacting here - really make or break how we get on in this campaign.

"Wonga will remove their logo from all of Newcastle United’s replica shirts and training kit for children. The North East club signed a four-year multi-million-pound deal with the controversial loan company in October 2012 to make them their main sponsor. It was criticised heavily and striker Papiss Cisse refused to wear the logo on his shirt due to his Muslim faith, though he later reversed his decision. Newcastle United and loan company Wonga have agreed to remove their sponsorship from children's kits . The logo, which even appears on baby kits, will be removed from children's shirts from 2016-17 onwards . When the deal was struck, Newcastle’s former managing director Derek Llambias said Wonga’s ‘desire to invest in young playing talent’ was key. But from the start of the 2016-17 season Wonga’s logo will no longer appear on any children’s kit — up to the age of 13. The move was instigated by new Wonga chairman Andy Haste to ensure children are not influenced by the advertisement.

"A team of researchers in Adelaide are trying to develop a 'pain switch' in the human body to potentially eradicate the need for highly-addictive pain killers. Researchers from Flinders Medical Centre in Adelaide have spent three years looking at ways to turn off pain with a genetic switch that would be delivered up a person's spine via a harmless virus. Associate Professor Nick Spencer has been leading the research and is now using genetic therapies using harmless viruses to test the pain switch theory on animals. Associate Professor Nick Spencer has been leading the research and is now using genetic therapies using harmless viruses to test the pain switch theory on animals . The research was inspired by a Pakistani boy who used to walk on hot coals as he busked for money. Scientists who were curious to find out how he could do it pain free found he had a rare genetic mutation, which means he lacked the gene that notified the brain of any pain. Using that information, the team at Flinders Medical Centre are trying to locate all of the nerve endings in a body that detect pain from various organs. 'We know in humans that if you have an extremely rare mutation and lack this gene you don't feel pain at all,' Prof Spencer told the Advertiser. The research was inspired by a Pakistani boy who used to walk on hot coals without pain as he busked for money. Scientists found he had a rare genetic mutation that failed to notify the brain of any pain . 'The virus takes a molecule to shut down the gene, it shuts down the channels for pain. 'This is really exciting – we are not ready to move on to humans yet but it is very exciting.' The testing on animals has so far reduced pain by 75 percent from the gastrointestinal tract without affecting other organs in the body. 'Today if someone has severe pain they will probably be given an opioid like morphine that is very good at relieving pain but has a whole range of side effects,' Prof Spencer said. 'You can get sedated, addicted, build tolerance, suffer from withdrawal and constipation, you can't drive a vehicle or think straight – your whole body is affected – that's the big problem.'","Nick Spencer, an associate professor at Flinders Medical Centre, is researching ways to develop a pain switch .

"Rangers failed miserably to put pressure on Championship leaders Hearts as they were held to a 1-1 draw against Alloa at Ibrox. Kris Boyd and David Templeton missed great chances for the Light Blues in an otherwise limp first-half which ended with the home side being booed off. Ally McCoist's side continued to struggle after the break but it looked like they would escape with three points when skipper Lee McCulloch scored in the 78th minute following a Lewis Macleod corner. VIDEO Scroll down for Ally McCoist's post match comments . Rangers manager Ally McCoist looks on as his Rangers team fail to defeat Alloa at Ibrox . Lee McCulloch (right) celebrates putting Rangers ahead against Alloa at Ibrox in the 78th minute . But six minutes later, Liam Buchanan scored for Alloa to earn them a point against Rangers . However, Liam Buchanan dramatically levelled six minutes later and although the second-placed Light Blues narrowed the gap behind Hearts to three points the Gorgie side have the chance to increase their advantage when they play Falkirk later in the day. Rangers were boosted with the inclusion of Macleod who broke off from Scotland duty to take his place in the Gers midfield. The 20-year-old was called up for the first time to the senior squad by Gordon Strachan for the European Championship qualifying clash with Republic of Ireland at Celtic Park on Friday night and the friendly against England at the same venue. Strachan did not involve Macleod in the 1-0 win over the Irish allowing him to play against the Wasps but he was as uninspiring as his team mates in the dreadfully dull early stages. Midfielder Nicky Law did have the ball in the net after six minutes but looked up to see the flag being waved for offside. Fellow midfielder Ian Black found himself in referee Greg Aitken's book two minutes later for a foul on Mark Docherty on the halfway line. Nicky Law (left) had a goal ruled out for offside as well as a missed chance in the final minutes . The Alloa team go to applaud their fans after holding on for a draw against Rangers . Alloa manager Barry Smith (above) was certainly the happier of the two managers after the game . McCoist was raging when the official then allowed Alloa's Jonathan Tiffoney to boot the ball away after conceding a free-kick without taking any action. In between those two incidents, Michael Doyle forced Rangers keeper Steve Simonsen into a decent save at the expense of a fruitless corner after he was allowed to run 40 yards before despatching his shot from the edge of the box. The home side could not get going. In the 17th minute, however, Boyd should have opened the scoring when a Law through ball landed at his feet 14 yards from goal but the Ibrox striker blasted his shot straight at Alloa keeper Craig McDowall. Just after the half-hour mark, following good work by Macleod in midfield, Templeton missed a sitter when he headed Richard Foster's cross on the run from the right past the post from the centre of the goals. Moments later, Simonsen was called into action again to divert Kevin Cawley's 25-yard shot round the post, and the half-time whistle allowed the home fans the chance to vent some pent-up frustration. McCoist's side started the second-half with more of a tempo, Boyd diverting a driven cross from Macleod past the post with his head before the young playmaker drew a good save from McDowall with a drive from outside the penalty area. Law (right) of Rangers clashes with Mark Docherty (left) of Alloa before the referee intervenes . Rangers supporters booed the team off at half-time with the score 0-0 and were not happier at end of the game . However, the home side soon regressed and in the 59th minute McCoist replaced the ineffective Boyd with Irish striker Jon Daly before the injured Foster made way for Sebastien Faure. There was little improvement but growing disgruntlement from the home fans was put aside when, from Macleod's corner, the ball landed at McCulloch who hooked it into the net from eight yards. Instead of kicking on, though, Rangers found themselves pegged back six minutes later when Simonsen parried a drive from Cawley out to Buchanan who lashed it high into the net from close range. Nicky Clark was immediately brought on for Templeton with McCoist's last throw of the dice but although there was the expected late flurry, with Faure firing over in stoppage time from close range, there was to be no late goal to prevent the home side being jeered at the final whistle.","Rangers booed off at half-time with the scores goalless .

"Liverpool’s iconic captain Steven Gerrard has given his blessing to Jordan Henderson taking the job full-time after he retires and advised the key to good leadership is building one-to-one relationships with team-mates rather than screaming and shouting in an attempt to show authority. Gerrard, 34, expressed his delight that Henderson was last week named the club’s vice-captain with a view to eventually carrying the armband on a permanent basis. The current skipper believes he and 24-year-old Henderson share common values more significant than geography, with the younger man growing up in Sunderland 170 miles from Merseyside. Steven Gerrard speaks to manager Brendan Rodgers during Liverpool's defeat to West Ham . Gerrard insists he will have no concerns passing the Liverpool captaincy over to Jordan Henderson (L) Gerrard said: ‘I think I see a lot of similarities between myself and the way I go about things day-to-day, and how Jordan does it as well. ‘I’m not an in-your-face captain shouting for the sake of it in the dressing room. All these captains that rant and rave and try to knock the paint off a dressing room door, it is a load of nonsense. What matters is how you perform every day in training and matches, and what constructive information you can give your team mates one-to-one. That is what is important as a captain. ‘Jordan epitomises everything a captain is. He leads by example, never gives up and works just as hard without the ball as with it. ‘We are good mates on and off the pitch and I would love nothing better than passing over the armband to him when I call it a day here, not just because he’s a great player but also a top lad. ‘He comes from a great family, a similar family to mine, so it’ll be a very proud day when I hand it over.’ Henderson has won over Anfield doubters who questioned if he was worth £18million . Gerrard claims the pair share a lot of similarities in terms of leadership style . Position: Midfielder . Born: HJune 17, 1990, Sunderland . Clubs: Sunderland, Coventry (loan), Liverpool . Debut: Nov 1, 2008 Chelsea vs Sunderland . Apps: 230 . Goals: 19 . England debut vs France, Nov 2011 . Caps: 15 . Honours: League Cup winner 2012 . Gerrard’s career as a local Liverpool lad made good is legendary whereas Henderson went through a tough time when he arrived at Anfield in the summer of 2011. Initially, he was considered over-priced at £18million and former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson even mocked his running style. Gerrard thinks overcoming the difficult start, and winning over doubters in The Kop, have helped to prove Henderson has the qualities to be a captain. ‘He came to a huge football club like Liverpool as a young lad. He’s not the first person who has taken time to settle in,’ said Gerrard. ‘But I always knew watching him in and around the training ground that if he kept his head down, it would turn for him. Fans take to players who give 100 per cent even when things aren’t going well and eventually they come round. When the pressure was on Jordan and the fans were on his back, he dug deep and worked even harder. A lot of players give up and end up falling down the leagues and going to clubs that are not as big because they can’t handle the pressure. ‘But he showed through thick and thin that he is prepared to dig deep and go in where it hurts to turn these fans round.’ Henderson takes a shot against Ludogorets during Liverpool's opening Champions League victory . Henderson could also be in line to eventually replace Wayne Rooney as England captain . Henderson is also now an England regular and will be one of the candidates to captain his country after Wayne Rooney. Gerrard also gives his deputy credit for helping him to adapt to a deeper-lying midfield role. ‘Jordan has been great for me, especially at my age,’ he said. ‘What a story it will be if he becomes Liverpool’s full-time captain.’","Steven Gerrard has no concerns passing Liverpool captaincy over to Jordan Henderson .

"England's not-so-friendly friendly with  Scotland takes place at Celtic Park on Tuesday evening. It might not be a Euro 2016 qualifier but Roy Hodgson's men should be fired-up for the clash with their old rivals, particularly given the Three Lions' impressive record north of the border.

Paul Scholes' first-half goals proved decisive as he propelled England towards qualification for Euro 2000. Scholes silenced the home crowd in the 21st minute when he side-footed the ball past Neil Sullivan, having superbly controlled a cross from Sol Campbell.

"It was the summer of 2011 and Liverpool had launched an aggressive, expensive revolution of their playing squad. With Andy Carroll having arrived for £35million in January that year, along with £23million Luis Suarez, Kenny Dalglish was determined to bring in more quality and give Liverpool the options and depth they had been lacking. So in came Charlie Adam (£9million from Blackpool); Stewart Downing (£20million from Aston Villa) was the main priority to provide service from the flanks, while Jose Enrique (£7million from Newcastle) and Sebastian Coates (£7million from Nacional) came in to bolster the defence. Jordan Henderson arrived at Liverpool for £16m along with new signings Charlie Adam and Stewart Downing . Henderson was a talented youngster at Sunderland but many thought he was not ready for the step up . Henderson at his first press conference, the midfielder found it tough at first but is now vice-captain . Among all those transactions, however, one stood out. The decision to recruit a young midfielder from Sunderland for £16million left many wondering whether Liverpool had been spending lavishly for the sake of it. £16million for Jordan Henderson, they asked. Really? Look at him now. Of the group that arrived in 2011, Henderson is the only one who is a regular for Liverpool – Enrique is still at the club but his long-term prospects are hardly bright – and there are no longer questions about whether he is worth £16million. Quite the opposite, in fact. Henderson’s progress since he has been at Anfield is a prime example of what determination, hard work and a refusal to give up can achieve and Brendan Rodgers’ decision to make him vice-captain is his latest reward. Brendan Rodgers' decision to make Henderson second in command to Steven Gerrard was an easy one . Henderson has countless amounts of energy and is a mainstay in a successful team . Had Henderson wanted the easy life, he could have chosen to take up an offer from Fulham in August 2012, when they asked about his availability during negotiations with Liverpool over Clint Dempsey. He could have walked away from Merseyside and disappeared out of view. That, though, is not his style. Rodgers was delighted when Henderson told him he wanted to stay and fight and in the past two seasons he has grown from someone who could not hold down a place in Liverpool’s starting line-up to become one of the first names selected for club and country. ‘The first summer I came here, Jordan had the opportunity to leave,’ Rodgers recalled. ‘We were talking about it the other day. I did not push him out or ask him to go. But, like I do with all the players if a club comes in, I present them with the opportunity they may have. I said “listen, you have a chance to go to Fulham and you can go and play every week, or you can stay here. I can’t guarantee you a game straight away, but I know one thing for sure, I will improve you as a player.” He wanted to stay. ‘I felt that first period being out of the team helped him tactically as we could work on video and analyse his game. From that he has grown in confidence. You see now for club and country he holds himself really well, he’s got a great stature and I think he will be around here for years to come.’ Rodgers offered Henderson the chance to join Fulham when he first arrived, but he declined . Jordan Henderson and Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard share a joke with Brendan Rodgers at Melwood . It is why Rodgers decided late last week to make him Steven Gerrard’s deputy following Daniel Agger’s return to Brondby. Henderson is not the finished article yet but he is progressing at a rapid pace and there is no down he will be a long-term influence for Liverpool. ‘His attitude when I was at Liverpool was tremendous from day one,’ Comolli recently recalled. ‘He looked at what Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher were doing, how they behaved, what they did in training I’m not surprised he’s doing well to be honest. With Jordan it was just a question of time.’ His relentless energy, his strength and running power are vital components in this Liverpool team and it did not gone unnoticed how much of a difference his absence made when he was suspended for three games towards the end of last season. Henderson has been 'watching what Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher have been doing' Henderson and Gerrard celebrate the latter's goal from the penalty spot against Tottenham this season . That Henderson’s absence was lamented then showed where he has elevated himself to. The young man who was deemed to represent some of former Director of Football Damien Comolli’s excess is now likely to become a Liverpool stalwart. Put it another way: if they were now looking to buy an English midfielder, who was 24 with a history of being constantly fit and available for games and can pop up with goals, £16million wouldn’t come close to it. Looking back now, the fee Liverpool paid for Henderson actually appears to be a bargain.","Henderson arrived  at same time as Charlie Adam and Stewart Downing .

Argentina take on Portugal in a glamour friendly on Tuesday when the two greatest footballers on the planet at present, in Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, come head-to-head on the international stage. Portugal paper A Bola heightens the build-up of the spectacle with the headline 'Theatre of the Gods' in a reference to the match being played at Manchester United's Old Trafford - nicknamed the 'Theatre of Dreams'. In Portugal, Argentina's friendly against Portugal on Tuesday has been billed as 'Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo' (left) while Roma captain Francesco Totti reveals his desire to one day manage the club . The significance of the pair going face-to-face for their countries hasn't been lost on A Bola who notes the duo's personal accolades between them which includes six Ballon d'Or titles and six Golden Boot awards. Elsewhere in Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport leads with an interview from Roma captain Francisco Totti - where the 38-year-old reveals his desire to one day manage the capital club. Totti, who has played at the Stadio Olimpico throughout his career, adds that he plans to play for the club for three more years before trying his hand at management. On a domestic front, Corriere dello Sport looks at the state of Italian football with particular focus on it's second tier - Serie B.

"Welcome to England's future. On Tuesday, in Belo Horizonte, a game of football will be played. If  England lose, it means  nothing. If England win, it means nothing. If England draw - well, you get the idea. And not just because the World Cup is over for Roy Hodgson and his men. The FA decided on Friday, in the aftermath of an eight-day exit from meaningful tournament football in Brazil, that victory and defeat were very over-rated qualities when assessing the success of a sports team. Save me: England boss Roy Hodgson talks to Raheem Sterling at training on Monday . There were other factors, intangibles, concerning preparation and work across several years that had to be considered, too. 'If it doesn't matter who wins and who loses, then why do they keep score?' asked the great Green Bay Packers coach Vince Lombardi, a man with more quotable one-liners than Bill Shankly, yet England are moving beyond these earthbound measures of advancement. It is just as well, for the Costa Rica experience is destined to be repeated two years from here. The  qualification campaign for the 2016 European Championship, with the finals expanded and downgraded to 24 teams, means it will get no easier to ascertain English progress in the coming months. Team talk: England's manager Roy Hodgson with the players on Monday . Strength: John Terry and Rio Ferdinand formed an exceptional partnership . England must play Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino to qualify, knowing a top-two finish guarantees entry and third place affords a puncher's chance via the play-offs. The only high quality opposition England will face between now and June 2016, then, is in friendly games, and those results are  notoriously deceptive. England have defeated Italy and Spain in their most recent non-competitive meetings and won against Germany in a friendly in 2008. There will be no way of knowing England's true standing until their next competitive game in finals football in 2016. Everything that  happens until that date lacks substance. Coming here, the message was that England had battled through a difficult qualifying group, which allowed for false security. It was suspected that Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka were far from an exceptional pairing at centre-half, when compared to their predecessors: John Terry and Rio  Ferdinand, Tony Adams and Sol Campbell, with Ledley King in the role of fifth Beatle. Bottom line: England's whole defence struggled to cope in Brazil . Yet, England had only conceded four goals in qualifying, it was pointed out. Fewer than any country in Europe, bar Spain. Cahill and Jagielka were not perfect, but they could do a job. This wasn't true. England's centre-halves, the whole defence in fact, were below the standard required. That is why the World Cup, not the route to it, is the health check. Hodgson thinks it would be harsh to judge his work on two matches, but that is football's bottom line. Did Carlo Ancelotti become a better coach because he won a single match, and with it Real Madrid's 10th European Cup final? In a word: yes. The fear when Hodgson succeeded Fabio Capello was that he would turn England, not into Inter Milan, nor even his overachieving Fulham and Switzerland teams, but into West Bromwich Albion. Hodgson did a very good job at West Brom, but it was a job with limitations. West Brom do not  tolerate relegation, but they have no realistic ambitions of major success, either. If they finish safe and give it a go against the biggest clubs, it will be regarded as a good season. This is where England are now. High and mighty: Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti celebrates Champions League glory . For Premier League safety, read tournament qualification. Alex Horne, the general secretary, summed up the dismal reprogramming that has taken place at the FA when he announced before the tournament began that he believed Hodgson had done enough to justify seeing out his contract until 2016 just by getting to Brazil. The widespread acceptance of courageous defeat by Italy in Manaus is another sign that England now regard themselves as small and provincial, unable to challenge the elite. Hodgson's final season at West Bromwich Albion began with a home game against the champions, Manchester United. Wayne Rooney put United ahead, but David de Gea was inexperienced and vulnerable, and West Brom equalised through Shane Long. Limited success: Roy Hodgson made sure West Brom were safe from relegation . They gave United a real game from there but, with nine minutes to go, an Ashley Young cross that deflected once before going in off Steven Reid handed United victory. It was agreed that West Brom could have put more pressure on De Gea after half-time, but had done pretty well in the  circumstances and were perhaps unlucky not to earn a point against a classier team. There was  definitely cause for optimism. In . essence, that was the reaction to England's defeat by Italy. Even the . same scoreline against  Uruguay has produced no grand inquest. What . began as realism is now the meek acceptance of defeat. The impossible job, we are now told. It isn't. That is more expectation . management. If it is impossible then the incumbent should step aside to . make room for another candidate, who might entertain possibility. Others see the green shoots of recovery in the next generation. Yet . this presumes on several fronts. Any team that includes Phil Jones or . Chris Smalling  presumes they will train on and make the team regularly . at Manchester United under Louis van Gaal, in a way they have not over . the last three years. Any team that includes John Stones on the back of . 26 appearances for Everton, presumes he will grow up to be John Terry . not James Tomkins, who made 37 appearances for England at all levels . from Under 16 onwards, without quite fulfilling the outstanding promise . of his youth. In the previous three World Cups, the players with five caps or fewer are Michael Dawson, Stephen Warnock, Joe Hart, Aaron Lennon, Stewart Downing, Scott Carson, Theo Walcott, Wayne Bridge,  Darius Vassell and Trevor Sinclair. Not everybody delivers on that early promise. Any team that includes Jack Wilshere presumes he avoids injury, and any wholly youthful starting XI presumes depth below, as at all tournaments the law of averages dictates there will always be at least one significant injury, possibly more. Call up: Shaw and Jack Wilshere will get the chance to impress against Costa Rica on Tuesday . Go through the motions: England prepare for final group game against Costa Rica on Tuesday . VIDEO City Guide: Belo Horizonte . Yet here we are. Reimagining what constitutes success. The England of the future gets its kicks from logistical efficiency. 'The best prepared team at the World Cup,' we were told and that boast persists through back-to-back defeats. We wish to be judged on intangibles, when in sport there is a very finite measure of attainment. It's called the score. It is immune to spin, management, foresight, hindsight, revisionism, criticism or any form of external pressure.  By removing it from the equation, nothing is. Win, so what? Lose, so what? Glen Johnson came out of the lift at England's team hotel in Sao Conrado, in the aftermath of the defeat by Uruguay. A fellow countryman asked how he was feeling. Johnson shrugged philosophically. 'What can you do?' he asked. Actually, that shouldn't be a rhetorical question. There are books written on what you can do. Indexed, cross-referenced, alphabetised. There are videos and coaching sessions, debates and discussions, and plans A, B, C, probably through to Z. There is always something you can do. Yet England's right-back is a man of our times. What can you do, eh? He should have an FA blazer. He'd fit right in.","If England qualify for a tournament and and give it a go against the big sides, then it's regarded as a success .

Arsene Wenger's side let a three-goal lead slip at home to Anderlecht in the Champions League before leading but losing 2-1 at Swansea City in the Premier League.

'For me, the most important thing is to lead with confidence and remind the players how good they are,' Arteta told club website arsenal.com. 'When you see some faces with disappointment and doubts, it is not good. They are players of the top level, and after one, two or three performances it is natural - you get doubts, you are not happy with yourself, you get a bit down. 'But we cannot allow that to happen here. It is very demanding to play three or four times in 10 days and bad periods are going to affect the team. So you need everyone on their toes and ready to fight.'

"Ally McCoist expressed his delight at having Lewis Macleod available to face Alloa on Saturday– after Gordon Strachan agreed to temporarily excuse the player from Scotland duty. With Rangers’ Championship match with the Wasps going ahead in the middle of an international break, McCoist asked the national team boss to temporarily ‘loan’ the midfielder back to him – provided he wasn’t central to his plans for last night’s game with Ireland. With Hearts’ lead at the top of the table just four points, McCoist’s men have the chance to briefly cut that to a single point by virtue of the Gorgie side’s late kick-off at Falkirk. Lewis Macleod (front) trains with the Rangers squad on the eve of their Championship clash with Alloa . Ally McCoist is delighted to have Macleod back for the clash, who has been released from international duty . And the Ibrox manager feels having Macleod in his ranks heightens his side’s chances of ramping up the pressure on Robbie Neilson’s team ahead of next week’s capital showdown. ‘Lewis trained with us this morning and is in our squad for tomorrow,’ McCoist said on Friday. ‘I had a chat with Gordon. He has been pleased with Lewis and his contribution, but thankfully he’s in agreement that we’d like him to get a game at the weekend. I think he has a chance of being in our squad! ‘It’s safe to say he is in the Scotland squad for a reason, and the reason is that he has been doing well. ‘We are delighted he’s back in the squad because we want all our best players available. On current form, Lewis is certainly one of them. ‘I would imagine he would join back up with the Scotland squad on the Sunday (ahead of Tuesday’s game with England). I spoke to him and he has thoroughly enjoyed it.’ The next seven days promise to be pivotal as far as the race for the second tier’s one automatic promotion spot is concerned. Macleod has impressed Scotland manager Gordon Strachan (background) following his first senior call-up . Macleod scored in Rangers' 4-0 win over Falkirk last Saturday and has been a key figure in the team . But while acknowledging many minds are already drifting towards next weekend’s first-versus-second clash at Tynecastle, McCoist sees Saturday's scheduling as a prime chance to crank up the pressure on the league leaders. Speaking after rival Neilson insisted this week that he doesn’t look out for Rangers’ results, McCoist said: ‘I can’t speak for the Hearts players, but I can tell you - because there is no point lying - that I look for the Hearts result, the Hibs result, every result. That’s my job. 'But if they don’t look for our result, then fair enough, that’s up to them. I’d be staggered if our boys didn’t look for the Hearts and Hibs results because that’s part and parcel of football.’ Next week’s contest may briefly take the limelight away from the League Cup semi-final with Celtic in early February but a first meeting with the Parkhead men in three years is likely to hog the agenda thereafter. As if the Old Firm game doesn’t have enough sub-plots already, the fact it’s due to take place immediately after the closure of the January transfer window is another intriguing aspect. But McCoist insists his New Year wish list - in terms of players coming and going - will be motivated solely by his club’s long-term recovery as opposed to the chance to record a one-off famous victory over their ancient rivals. Ally McCoist celebrates during Rangers' clash with Falkirk, with the manager keen to make promotion priority . In a League Cup tie, Rangers will face Celtic for the first time since April 2012 when they lost 3-0 at Celtic Park . ‘I’m still speaking with the chairman (David Somers) and (consultant) Derek Llambias and my job is to keep winning games. ‘Those two gentlemen and myself know the importance of winning matches and getting out of the division. I still think in the grand scheme of things we have far more important league games. ‘I am not underselling the Celtic game at all or the transfer window, but I would rather strengthen to win the league than strengthen to beat Celtic. ‘Don’t think for a minute I am undermining the Celtic game, I am trying to totally focus on the most important thing which is trying to get out of the league.’ While Mike Ashley’s ambitions remain under wraps, one thing the Newcastle owner will not be doing is exercising the naming right he acquired to Ibrox. Despite having bought them for £1m from Charles Green, Ashley this week confirmed he had torn up that deal – a move that’s undoubtedly popular with the vast majority of supporters. McCoist fully understands the commercial pressures clubs are under and yet, as a lifelong Rangers fan, he was relieved to learn the name of Ibrox will remain unchanged. ‘I’m just glad we won’t get the opportunity to find that out,’ he said. Any good news is welcomed by the Rangers supporters and I think the majority see it that way. Mike Ashley will not be renaming Ibrox, which will come as a relief to the majority of Rangers supporters . ‘I can understand people trying to rename stadiums for financial purposes. But to the vast majority of supporters it will still remain Ibrox no matter what you put in front of it.’ With eight wins on the bounce and six clean sheets to boot, defender Darren McGregor believes a resounding win against Barry Smith’s men today will send out a message to Hearts – before they play Falkirk and ahead of next week’s showdown. ‘For me, this game is just as big as Hearts,’ he said. ‘We need to take three points and apply pressure. ‘Obviously with Hearts kicking off after us, it gives us a chance to do that. Of course it will put pressure on Hearts if we get it to within a point. ‘People will tell you they don’t look at papers or their closest contenders but the first thing you do after a game is look to see how your opposition have done. Hearts will be no different. ‘This will be the first time in the last couple of months where they might really feel the pressure. It’s a totally different ball game when the pressure is on. We’ll see how they deal with it.’","Rangers star Lewis Macleod can now face Alloa in Scottish Championship .

The 23-year-old praised manager Chris Coleman, but also predecessor Gary Speed, who Ramsey said laid the foundations. 'Chris has done really well,' he said. 'It was always difficult to come in after Gary Speed - whoever the manager was. 'To be fair to the gaffer, he was brave to take on the job.

They have come over in numbers this week and they stuck with us all through the game even when we weren’t playing great. Ramsey says former Wales manager, the late Gary Speed, laid the foundations for the country's current form . 'We’ve got a very important point. We were under pressure for large periods of the game, but I felt we stuck together and that is something we have improved on dramatically in this campaign. We are very hard to beat and to score against. 'We are going in the right direction and we have kept the momentum going in terms of getting the point and keeping the points ticking over. 'We are second in the group but we would have snapped anyone’s hand off if we were offered that before the campaign began. 'We will go to Israel now full of confidence and hopefully be more dangerous with the ball. Hopefully it will be a more comfortable game for us.'

"You can't be the England manager by default. You can’t be the England manager because the Football Association are out of ideas. You can’t be the England manager because we have  managed expectations down to a level where picking some new names while losing every game that matters constitutes level par. You can’t be the England manager without making it out of the World Cup’s group stage. Except now you can. Greg Dyke, FA chairman, confirmed it. Roy Hodgson will see out his contract until 2016, at least. The country, staring at its worst World Cup performance since 1994, and its first group-stage exit since 1958, must consider itself satisfied. This is as good as it gets. This is what we must expect. This is who we are now. The smiling idiots just happy to be at the party. But don’t forget to book that cab home for 11.30pm. Wouldn’t want to be out too late. Hodgson isn’t a turnip or a wally, but he isn’t the answer, either. Who is? The FA don’t know and are not interested in finding out. Dyke talks blithely of winning a World Cup in 2022 but his is an organisation devoid of ambition. The desire to be better, to progress, to go further, has deserted them. They are happy as they are. A new kit every year and out with Australia. They have settled. And that shouldn’t be. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Neil Ashton and Charles Sale deliver their verdict . Headscratching: The FA have decided to back Roy Hodgson until his contract expires in two years' time . Crashing out: England skipper Steven Gerrard is consoled by Liverpool team-mate Luis Suarez after a sorry display in Sao Paulo . Best manager experienced? Terry Venables gave the players confidence. We have never looked as comfortable on the ball since. Favourite England moment? England 4 Holland 1. That night it was possible to imagine England as European champions. Best player in your lifetime? I am still waiting for an England player who can match pre-injury Paul Gascoigne in 1990. There are no guarantees from here, even with change. There is no outstanding candidate, no English equivalent of Jose Mourinho or Arsene Wenger, no popular choice as there was in the days of Brian Clough. Yet that is not the point. We do not know what another manager would bring to the job until we offer that chance. We do not know whether, within Steve Bruce or Alan Pardew, or Gary Neville, Gareth Southgate, even Paul Clement, is an insight or a spark that could take this team forward. We know what Hodgson did with it, and it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t enough. The FA has a problem, though, and it is not just in its paltry list of suitable candidates. It is pregnant with West Bromwich Albion — eight months gone with a mid-table club that has somehow been allowed to take over the way English football is run. Hodgson is the manager, Dan Ashworth is the FA’s technical director, the friends of Ashworth are on the technical staff. What should always be a two-term cycle, at most, has been allowed to grow into a philosophical overhaul that makes regime change at the top even more daunting. Those at the head of Club England were looking for a quiet life after Fabio Capello and that is what Hodgson affords. They will claim to be nobly resisting a knee-jerk reaction now, yet there is nothing hasty or thoughtless in seeking a better way. The fall guy: Graham Taylor failed to get England out of the group at Euro 92 and did not qualify for the World Cup two years later . Water joke: Steve McClaren winces under his umbrella as England collapsed against Croatia . Costly: Fabio Capello was paid £6million-a-year yet could not transform England's fortunes . One day, the FA will alight on a manager who can bring more from a group of England players than is expected, just as Bruce exceeded expectations at Hull City last season or Sean Dyche did at Burnley. It happens. Appointing Tony Pulis was regarded as an exercise in futility at Crystal Palace, but it proved a stroke of genius. If anything, it is more negligent not to try, to simply presume that this is the way it has to be, with England unable to defeat an Italian side beaten by Costa Rica or deal with a half-fit Luis Suarez. Hodgson has not done a poor job, but results here have been below what was anticipated of the much-ballyhooed ‘best prepared team at the World Cup’. There is no shame, no dishonour. Step aside, let someone else have a go, see where they can take it. The small margins are up for discussion. Losing two games by the odd goal in three suggests England are nearly a good team. Yet if Hodgson had the key to that final leap of improvement, where was it in Brazil? Might another coach improve it? We will never know until we try. Expectations cannot be managed any lower. Alex Horne, the FA general secretary, said that Hodgson had done enough to see out his contract just by getting to the World Cup, but such meek, uncomplaining support is part of the problem. If there was a moment England were set on this dismal course, it was Dyke’s cut-throat gesture when the draw was made. Light-hearted it may have been, but it suggested that little would be presumed of England here, and chimed with the mistaken belief that Hodgson had already negotiated a tough qualifying group, seeing off the might of Ukraine, Poland and Montenegro. Perhaps it was this complacency that underscored the decision to leave John Terry in international retirement, when it was plain bigger challenges awaited in Brazil. The sight of England clinging on for dear life in Poland and Montenegro and at home to Ukraine should have rung alarm bells; instead we were told these were good draws that showed England’s defence could handle the pressure. It proved a significant misjudgment, like the exclusion of Ashley Cole. Dead in the water? Greg Dyke appeared not to fancy England's chances in Brazil at the World Cup draw . Signs of decline: England were fortunate to leave Wembley with a point against Ukraine . When Leighton Baines showed signs of weakness against Italy, if Cole had been named in the squad a change could have been made. Instead, all Hodgson had to play with was the untried Luke Shaw. Without doubt, England’s starting XI could have been stronger. Much is made of the absence of Englishmen at champions Manchester City, but the strongest attacking team last season were Liverpool, and the strongest defence was at Chelsea, and both elements had an English core. To put them together would then require the addition of four players: a goalkeeper, a right back, a wide midfielder and a  second forward. It is a better base on which to build than many  England managers have had. Hodgson deserves credit for introducing Raheem Sterling, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ross  Barkley, but it is not as if these selections were from left field. Without doubt Barkley and Oxlade-Chamberlain are among the best 20 footballers in England today and Sterling inside the top 10. A new manager would not  discard these figures or return English football to some dark age. With very few exceptions, all English coaches at Premier League level are trying to play in a sophisticated way. Bruce was captain of a brilliant Manchester United side, and took Hull to their first Wembley final playing a very open game. At their best, Pardew’s Newcastle United have played some lovely stuff, as did Tottenham Hotspur under Harry Redknapp. One imagines Gary Neville wouldn’t be a long-ball merchant, either, or Real Madrid’s Paul Clement beside him. It is not as if Hodgson’s methods are particularly radical. Others would carry them on, and pick many of the same players. They might, however, locate the 10 per cent improvement that Hodgson could not. England’s management cycle is out of . whack at the moment and has been since Steve McClaren was dismissed. The . World Cup is used to prepare for the European Championship. It should . be the other way around. If Hodgson sees out his deal in 2016, his . successor will get his first tournament in Russia in 2018. And the next . two years are largely meaningless anyway. Young guns: Both Raheem Sterling (left) and Ross Barkley are exciting footballers with the talent to shine in an England shirt . Learning the ropes: Gary Neville consoles Wayne Rooney after the defeat to Uruguay . The qualifying campaign for 2016 is a tap-in. Third place in a group comprising Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino might be enough. If England cannot make it through given those circumstances there is not a manager alive that can help them. What it means, though, is that the next time Hodgson will truly be tested is at the European Championship finals in France. And what if it brings more of the same? What if two years on, England are still  little more than youthful and lively? What if they are still beset by nerves at crucial moments, vulnerable at the back and prone to wastefulness in front of goal? What if Hodgson is still hunting that missing piece? Another tournament passes by. For whatever reason, some managers influence. Gary Cahill looks a better defender with Terry, but he also looks a better player for Chelsea, too, even when Terry is not by his side. So Mourinho gets more from him. When Uruguayan goalkeeper Fernando Muslera punted that goal-kick forward and Steven Gerrard rose to head it, Suarez gambled on the five per cent chance his Liverpool team-mate might not connect properly and began his run. Cahill was not alive to it. For Chelsea, for whatever reason, he would have been. For another England manager? Maybe. Maybe not. Either way, we’ll never know.","You can’t be the England manager without making it out of the World Cup’s group stage. Except now you can .

The Arsenal midfielder produced a man-of-the-match display as England recorded a fourth straight Euro 2016 qualifying victory after coming from behind to defeat Slovenia 3-1 at Wembley on Saturday.

'They will always say 'England-Scotland, that it is going to be a great atmosphere', so I want to play in that, of course I do.'

Johnson says 'the atmosphere  was fantastic and the crowd was there for us until the end' Jordan Henderson, meanwhile, says it is crucial Liverpool’s defending improves.

"Tick tock. Tick tock. In Roy Keane’s world, everything runs on time. A 10.30am press briefing means 10.30am and Keane arrived on the button in the Moyne Suite in the Portmarnock Hotel on Sunday. Straight-backed, eagle-eye stare in place, arms folded, Keano looked like he was braced for trouble. Maybe he was. Initially, everything ran smoothly. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roy Keane refuses to answer questions on hotel incident . Republic of Ireland assistant manager Roy Keane spoke to the media in the Portmarnock Hotel on Sunday . It only took a few minutes before the spat involving Keane and Frank Gillespie, in another part of the hotel, was pitched into the mix. Are you prepared to go into it (the incident)? ‘No, I’m not,’ said Keane firmly. Was it a distraction? ‘No,’ he said, clearly inviting another subject. In the room the FAI media folk let out a sigh of relief. Keane had kicked for touch, and found it. Tick tock. Tick tock. Perhaps lightening up, Keane gave an incisive insight into the performance on Friday, his annoyance at the concession of the goal, and what was needed from the players for the next six games if Ireland are to qualify. His appreciation of the challenge facing him and Martin O’Neill was flecked with nuggets as Keane plugged Robbie Keane’s abilities over Niall Quinn, and hailed the long-serving striker as ‘as good a professional as I have come across.’ Keane believes his namesake Robbie is a better frontman than former Ireland striker Niall Quinn . Keane also joked about being able to leave the hotel without any security baggage. ‘We’re not One Direction,’ he said with deadpan wit. He revisited his touchline spat with the referee in Celtic Park on Friday night. ‘I was surprised he came over. That’s our job to try to get instructions on to a player or to appeal a decision. I don’t think there was anything over the top,’ he said. ‘When a referee comes over and there’s a couple of photographs taken as usual it always looks 100 times worse than what it is, but it was no big thing.’ For over half-an-hour everything was calm, cordial and under control. Keane had a wee dig at Jack Grealish’s indecision about declaring for Ireland. Keane had a dig at Jack Grealish (left) over the Aston Villa youngster's indecision about declaring for Ireland . More seriously, he expressed concerns that Everton manager Roberto Martinez may be putting a squeeze on his Ireland players, specifically Seamus Coleman and James McCarthy. ‘It does seem to be that Seamus and James are under lots of pressure — they’re turning up, or they mightn’t turn up, or they’re struggling,’ he said. And then, Sportsmail asked Keane about all the distractions involving him over the last six months, most recently the hassle with Gillespie. Tick tock. Tick tock... boom. Roy Keane is concerned that Everton are putting pressure on players to pull out of international duty . Everton's James McCarthy has missed the Republic of Ireland's last three Euro 2016 qualifiers . Sportsmail: ‘I’d like your thoughts on this, between the Celtic link, Villa link, book being published, and the incident last week….’ Keane: ‘I’m not giving you any comment. Why would you think I have to give you an opinion on everything? Do you think you’ve a right to sit there and ask me anything you want, and get an answer? I think I’ve been more than fair with you.’ Sportsmail: ‘You have (been fair). But my point is Martin (O’Neill) has been asked about the distractions. Has he had enough of those distractions? Keane: ‘What are you asking me for? What are you talking about? What distractions? Can I do anything about the Celtic stuff?’ Sportsmail: ‘Yeah, Celtic and Villa.’ Keane: ‘Can I do anything about them things that come up? If I get approached about a job and I’m up front with the manager and the media, do you want me to… how is that a distraction? ‘What can I do about that? You’re making out I’m bringing all these distractions on.’ Keane claimed the media are making out he is bringing distractions to the Republic of Ireland squad . Sportsmail: ‘Just a coincidence?’ Keane: ‘Well, if a club approaches me, these things just happen, yeah. You think the book’s a distraction to a group of professional people? Do me a favour. ‘And then people all writing about the incident the other night, lies….and people have got pals and talking to them. ‘You think I’ve got to justify that to everyone? You all sit there and think I’ve got to answer to everything? Who in the hell do you think you are? I’ve got to answer to you? ‘I answer to the FAI and Martin. And if we don’t get the right results, I’ll be gone and you won’t lose a minute’s sleep, so don’t worry about distractions. The things you write about are distractions.’ Sportsmail: ‘We write about it, but it was an obvious thing to write about. There was an incident.’ Keane: ‘Exactly. But you’re on about Celtic and Aston Villa. What do you want me to do about them? If Celtic approached me, what did you want me to say? You couldn’t get enough of it. So what can I do about the Celtic situation?’ Keane was speaking at a press conference ahead of his team's match against USA on Tuesday . Sportsmail: ‘I don’t know. It was extraordinary that Martin brought it to our attention…’ Keane: ‘What other incident? The book? Do you think the book was a distraction? An agreement was made six months before it was out. Ask Martin. What’s he said?’ Sportsmail: ‘I think he’s had enough of these (distractions)?’ Keane: ‘Go and ask him. Go and see him in the lobby. You’re not brave enough to ask him?’ Sportsmail: ‘I am brave enough to ask him.’ Keane: ‘Go and ask him. You’re asking me what Martin O’Neill might be thinking? Why don’t you ask Martin? What if we qualified? Do you think it will be a distraction? Are you thinking it’s all a distraction from the result the other night?’ Keane accused the media of not being brave enough to ask  manager Martin O'Neill about the 'distractions' Sportsmail: ‘It was the build-up to the game for 24 hours. Everyone was talking about it.’ Keane: ‘What was the problem? Sportsmail: ‘We were all talking about it.’ Keane: ‘Talking about what? Talking about something you don’t have a clue about, and everyone writing lies. The usual nonsense.’ Tick tock. Tick tock.

"Today's international friendlies may often be humdrum affairs, with nothing resting on them other than club fans and managers desperate for their star players to avoid injury. Yet at Highbury, 80 years ago on Friday, an encounter between England and Italy not only decided who could call themselves world champions but was so violent that it stretched the meaning of the word ‘friendly’ beyond its limit. By the end, at least three players had suffered broken bones and moral outrage screamed off the pages of the British press. The Daily Mail even questioned whether international friendlies should be played at all. Eric Brook scored the first goal in the Battle of Highbury as England raced into a 3-0 lead . Benito Mussolini was Italian Prime Minister . How did one match come to spark such fierce debate? In 1934, England were not members of FIFA and hadn’t taken part in the first two World Cup tournaments. Italy had won the second of those, five months earlier in Rome, much to the delight of Benito Mussolini, who saw the triumph as a vindication of his fascist ideology. To English minds, though, Italy’s victory did not make them the world’s leading team. After all, England had yet to be defeated on home soil (that would not happen until 1949, when Ireland triumphed 2-0 at Goodison Park). And, as this was the Italians’ first match since defeating Czechoslovakia to win the Jules Rimet trophy, the stage was set for a mouth-watering encounter billed as the ‘real World Cup final’. Italy, coached by the meticulous Vittorio Pozzo, knew the stakes were high, with one of their journalists prophetically describing Highbury as a ‘theatre of international war’. It would later be claimed that their players had been offered huge inducements to defeat England. Win bonuses of £150 a man, an Alfa Romeo each and exemption from military service were some of the carrots dangled before the Italian players as Mussolini eyed a victory of sporting and political significance. England’s team did not feature a single player with more than 10 caps. The starting line-up was dominated by Arsenal, the undisputed leading English team of the day. Seven Gunners (Frank Moss, George Male, Eddie Hapgood, Wilf Copping, Ray Bowden, Ted Drake and Cliff Bastin) started for England — a record that still stands. Hapgood, who had belted a clearance into the lap of a visibly irate Mussolini during a friendly against Italy in Rome 18 months earlier, was captain. Completing the XI were a young Stanley Matthews, winning his second cap, Everton’s Cliff Britton, Derby County’s Jack Barker and Eric Brook of Manchester City. A crowd of 56,044 crammed into Highbury. Mussolini was in Switzerland and demanded regular updates from London. Italy’s start was catastrophic. England raced into a 3-0 lead after 12 minutes, thanks to two goals from Brook — who had missed a penalty in the opening minute — and one from Drake. Worse still for Italy, their midfield general Luis Monti suffered a broken foot in the second minute in a challenge by Drake. He stayed on until the 15th minute after which the Italians played with 10 men, as substitutes were not allowed at the time. Eddie Hapgood has his wounds tended after the game, which Mussolini was desperate to win . Arsenal trainer Tom Whittaker gives treatment to Wilf Copping in the Highbury treatment room . How the Daily Mail reported the match 80 years ago . The loss of Monti lit the fuse, with the visitors believing Drake had deliberately injured the defender. Incensed, the Italians sought retribution and the challenges flew in — but later, Italy coach Pozzo admitted that Monti, in trying to turn quickly, had stubbed the toe of his boot in the ground. ‘The Italians had gone berserk and were kicking everybody and everything in sight,’ noted Hapgood in his autobiography. The numbers were temporarily evened up when Hapgood suffered a broken nose following an elbow to the face. When he returned to the field, after a few quick stitches, an England victory seemed a certainty. But the Italians mounted a comeback, albeit accompanied by violence. Shoulder-charging and two-footed challenges from both sides were rife but two classy goals from Giuseppe Meazza in four second-half minutes punctuated the chaos. England were suddenly clinging on and injuries were mounting. Brook had a broken arm, suffered in the first half, and Drake was nursing a swollen jaw, having been struck in the face. Bowden had an injured ankle. One England player was able to rise above the carnage: Wilf Copping. Known as ‘The Iron Man’, Copping was a former miner whose match-day motto was ‘first man into a tackle never gets hurt’. The Yorkshireman formed a crucial part of the rearguard action, hurling himself into challenges in midfield. England captain Hapgood introduces his team-mates to Prince Arthur of Connaught and the Italian Ambassador Signor Grandi before the game at Highbury . The Duke of Connaught meets the Italian players . ‘Wilf Copping enjoyed himself that afternoon,’ joked Hapgood later. ‘For the first time in their lives the Italians were given a sample of real, honest shoulder-charging.’ Yet even a man down, the Italians were subjecting England to a relentless onslaught. Meazza, on a hat-trick, struck the bar and was also denied by Moss. Then, at the death, the Italians fashioned a great opening but a team-mate chose not to square the ball to Meazza, who was unmarked. The Inter Milan legend, a winner of three Italian titles and two World Cups, would later cite the missed opportunity as the greatest regret of his life. Italy’s chance had gone and England had their famous 3-2 victory. Incredibly, despite the violence, the teams went ahead with a banquet in the evening, attended by both sets of players with the walking wounded observing the pleasantries. Hapgood, sporting his broken nose and feeling groggy, recalled locking eyes with his assailant, who smiled back at him before letting out a raucous laugh. ‘I’m glad I am a pretty even-tempered fellow or I would have gone across the table at him,’ said the Arsenal man. ‘But he wasn’t worth it.’ The Daily Mail match report the next day, by Frank Carruthers, was headlined ‘England beat Italy — but should these games be played?’ Far from wanting to hail a famous victory, he wrote: ‘From the point of view of football as I understand it, I hope to forget it.’ Carruthers, like many of his Fleet Street counterparts, claimed the differences between the styles of British and Continental teams meant international friendlies should be put on hold ‘until there is a better understanding of the methods which may and may not be employed.’ As for the Italians’ tackling, Carruthers lamented: ‘They are not greatly concerned with the ball.’ In Italy, the defeat was claimed as a moral victory and their players were hailed as ‘The Lions of Highbury.’ Italy would have to wait until 1973 for their first win over England.","England beat Italy 3-2 in 'Battle of Highbury' in 1934 .

"Roy Hodgson will award Wayne Rooney his 100th England cap against Slovenia next Saturday — but admits he fears the responsibility of being captain for club and country may eventually tell on the Manchester United striker. Rooney is closing in on a range of historic landmarks — winning his 100th cap at 29 puts him well within sight of David Beckham’s record number of 115 England appearances as an outfield player and means he could ultimately surpass Peter Shilton’s all-time record of 125. He is also closing in on Sir Bobby Charlton’s goal-scoring records for both England and Manchester United, with Rooney on 43 and 219 compared to Charlton’s 49 and 249. Wayne Rooney of Manchester United in action during the  Premier League match against Crystal Palace . Roy Hodgson has expressed his fear about the level of responsibility on Rooney's shoulders . The Euro 2014 qualifier against Slovenia at Wembley will be a celebration for Rooney but having been made captain of both England and Manchester United in recent months, Hodgson says he will need to ensure the burdens placed on him are not too great. ‘Since he has been made captain, I think he has taken a further step, both at Manchester United and with us,’ said Hodgson. ‘The big question is, of course, as one of the few seniors left in the team, absolutely guaranteed a place in the team and the same at Manchester United, I worry the sense of responsibility is going to weigh him down. ‘Myself and the coaching staff do all we can to make sure that will not happen with us, but it is all very well telling someone to leave your problems behind and don’t worry about them, to get on with your life; it is easy to say, but very hard to do sometimes. England boss Hodgson will award Rooney his 100th England cap against Slovenia next weekend . The cap will make Rooney become the youngest player to reach 100 caps at the age of 29 . ‘At the moment I think he’s coping with it well but we’ll have to keep an eye on the situation, as will Louis (van Gaal), to make sure it doesn’t weigh him down. But until that time comes we’ve just got to get on with it and be glad that he’s doing the job that we as coaching staff want him to do. And ensure that the other players know their job so well that they’re not relying on him to get them out of trouble. ‘He’s really taken on this job as captain with enormous seriousness. He’s studied and talked a lot with Steven Gerrard, because Steven was in a similar position really: he hadn’t had a lot captaincy before I decided to make him captain, so he had a lot of chats with him about what’s needed.’","Roy Hodgson expresses fears about responsibility of Wayne Rooney .

"Joe Root has a knack for niggle when it comes to Sri Lanka but is focusing only on upsetting the odds when it comes to England’s one-day future. A combination of five defeats in six limited-overs series, injuries to key men and the fact that not a single Englishman made the International Cricket Council’s one-day team of the year does not bode well. However, Root - who got under the skin of both Mahela Jayawardene and Angelo Mathews in past skirmishes - is adamant they can launch a genuine bid for a first 50-over World Cup, starting on their seven-match tour of Sri Lanka later this month. Joe Root believes England can win next year's World Cup to be held in Australia and New Zealand . ‘There’s not an expectation for us to do well, which could work out for us,’ Root said. ‘We know we have the squad of players to do really good things and a lot of young, exciting players. Not a lot of people have seen what they can do yet. Again, that could play into our hands.’ One man who believes Root’s optimism is misplaced is India legend Sachin Tendulkar. He was at Lord’s on Friday to launch his autobiography and, when asked if England had a chance to lift the World Cup - which begins on February 14 in Australia and New Zealand - said: ‘Anything is possible in this sport but going by current form I don’t think England will be that competitive.’ Root (right) will be part of the England squad touring Sri Lanka in November .

"Pakistan's top-order batsmen continued their superb form in the United Arab Emirates as they reached 269 for one on day one of the first Test against New Zealand. Following a 2-0 series win over Australia in which Younus Khan averaged 156, Misbah-ul-Haq hit Test cricket's joint-fastest century and Sarfraz Ahmed, Azhar Ali and Ahmed Shehzad also made hundreds, Misbah's side picked up where they left off on their adopted home territory in Abu Dhabi. Mohammad Hafeez joined in with 96 in an opening stand of 178 with Shehzad, who went on to 126 not out and found further strong support from Azhar with 46no.

Shehzad is congratulated on reaching his century by his Pakistan batting partner Azhar Ali in the first Test . Pakistan captain Misbah ul-Haq (left) won the toss and put his side into bat against New Zealand in Abu Dhabi . Misbah won the toss and chose to bat and Hafeez clipped the third ball of the day for four - and when Shehzad did likewise from the eighth, the 'hosts' were quickly into a familiar routine. Spin had been successful in the Australia series and New Zealand introduced Mark Craig and Ish Sodhi in the 10th and 11th overs. The scoring rate was slow but Pakistan were unruffled, reaching 31 without loss in 15 almost chanceless overs, but BJ Watling then missed the opportunity to stump Shehzad on 16. The batsman punished him with a boundary to bring up Pakistan's half-century and then struck back-to-back fours off Corey Anderson. It was 85 for no wicket at lunch and Hafeez moved past 50 soon after the restart, pulling Tim Southee for his fourth four in 91 balls. He then steered three off Trent Boult to take his side to three figures before Shehzad followed him to 50 from 148 deliveries, with five fours. Corey Anderson (left) struck for New Zealand's only wicket when he caught and bowled Mohammed Hafeez . It was a hard opening day for New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum (above), as his side only took one wicket . Ali (right) finished the day with an unbeaten 46 as Pakistan took control of the first test on day one . Four fours in two overs from the spinners signalled an acceleration, 50 runs coming in the hour after lunch. A Shehzad boundary brought up the 150 but as Hafeez neared three figures, he was deceived by Anderson's slower ball and popped up a return catch. After the boundary to take him to 51, he had added another 45 runs in 46 balls. Shehzad was on 89 at tea in a total of 194 for one and though he was almost bowled by Sodhi as he inside-edged for four, his third Test century came up from 221 balls with 12 boundaries. Captain Brendon McCullum's occasional medium pace yielded some reverse swing but no wickets, though Craig almost had Azhar when Watling brilliantly anticipated a reverse sweep but could not hang on. Southee and Boult could make no headway with the new ball, with the second-wicket stand nearing three figures by the close.","Ahmed Shehzad ends day one with an unbeaten 126 on day one for Pakistan .

"Last week, it was the turn of England captain Wayne Rooney to celebrate his 100th international cap, but Tuesday night belonged to his former Manchester United team-mate John O'Shea. The Sunderland centre-back won his 100th cap in Gelsenkirchen last month, scoring in the dying embers of the game against Germany to earn Ireland a draw in their Euro 2016 qualifying match. A fitting way to celebrate his ton. On Tuesday night, Ireland were back on home soil, playing against the USA in a friendly at the Aviva Stadium in Dublin.

O'Shea made his international debut on 15 August 2001, when he came on as an 84th minute substitute against Croatia, unfortunately conceding a penalty in the short time he was on the pitch.

"Croatia coach Niko Kovac has apologised for the ugly scenes in the crowd that marred his side's 1-1 draw with Italy in Milan on Sunday. The 2016 European qualifier at the San Siro was temporarily stopped in both halves by Dutch referee Bjorn Kuipers after visiting fans threw fireworks and smoke bombs onto the pitch.

It was the second time in the match they had used flares, with some being thrown on during the first half as well - with the match interrupted for three minutes after Croatia scored. 'I apologise to everyone, especially the Italians, for our supporters' behaviour,' Kovac said. 'I was disappointed and helpless, there are no right words for this.

Of course, Croatia will face sanctions, but I think there is no reason for any point deductions.' The result left the two sides level on 10 points at the top of Group H after four games with both teams having gone into the encounter on the back of three straight wins in qualifying.

The Chelsea stopper has warned his team-mates Wales could 'crush' them if they don't improve . ‘I don’t think we should be happy with the 3-1 victory,’ he said. ‘We created a lot of chances, but we also gave away a lot of space. ‘Some players weren’t doing their defensive job. If we play like this on Sunday against Wales, we’ll get crushed. ‘That’s what I told the manager straight after the game. I told him who didn’t do their job. I know it was only a friendly, but the guys should always be willing to run. If not, then they should be put on the bench.’ Afterwards, he came back and added context to his quotes. ‘I’m not having a go at my defenders, I’m talking about the whole team. Because a good defence starts in front. I just want what’s best for the group and for Belgium.’ Manager Marc Wilmots said the 22-year-old should have kept his complaints in-house but also offered words of protection. Courtois and his team mates will face a Gareth Bale-powered Wales side in their European qualifier . ‘Maybe he should’ve kept that criticism inside the group, but it’s no problem for me. He was coming right off the pitch and was still pumped up.’ Courtois may have to make further saves against Wales, with Bale eager to earn his side a positive result. The last time the pair faced each other was the Champions League final, when Bale scored a decisive goal in extra time. ‘I hope he does the same,’ said Wales No 1 Wayne Hennessey. ‘Bale is just an unbelievable talent. We’ve all seen how he can punish people and get goals from all angles. He practises all the time and that’s why he’s so good. Courtois will have done his homework on Bale.’ Bale tried his hand in goal during Wales training in Cardiff this week – but Hennessey is not having any sleepless nights. ‘I wouldn’t be threatened if I saw him in goal,’ laughed the Crystal Palace goalkeeper. ‘But I’m sure he’s not a bad keeper. He probably fancies himself. He can play any position on the field.’ There is an additional Courtois quote worth including, can we weave in on point that if Belgium defend badly again Bale will punish... 'Bale is very fast and there must be at least one defender back. We need to be careful.'","Belgium beat Iceland 3-1 on Wednesday night .

"Reeva Steenkamp's mother believes Oscar Pistorius 'would have killed someone sooner or later' and that her daughter's 'bad luck' conspired against her. June Steenkamp insists that the Paralympian was destined to kill and his character traits made that clear. In a high-profile trial lasting six months in his native South Africa, Pistorius was cleared of murdering his girlfriend but found guilty of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years in prison - as well as a concurrent three-year suspended incarceration for a previous reckless endangerment conviction. June Steenkamp, mother of Reeva, has claimed that Oscar Pistorius 'would have killed someone sooner or later', and that her daughter's 'bad luck' meant it was her . Reeva, pictured with Oscar Pistorius, at the South African sports awards ceremony in Johannesburg . In an interview with The Times Magazine on Saturday, which is serialising her soon-to-be-released book Reeva: a Mother's Story, June Steenkamp explained: 'It was Reeva's bad luck that she met him, because sooner or later he would have killed someone. I do believe that.' Miss Steenkamp's mother also describes Pistorius as: 'moody', 'volatile', 'arrogant', 'combustible', as well as 'trigger-happy', 'possessive', 'gun-toting', 'vague', 'shifty' and 'evasive'. And she struggles to believe that shooting someone on multiple occasions can be classed as accidental. When asked about whether or not Pistorius was culpable for her daughter's death, she replied: 'What? (Shooting someone) four times an accident?' Pistorius arrives at the High Court in Pretoria on October 21, 2014, to learn his fate . The athlete was jailed for five years for the culpable homicide of Reeva Steenkamp in February 2013 . And her daughter's death haunts her at night - she even regularly wakes up at around 3am, the time Reeva died at Pistorius' home. Interestingly though, neither June Steenkamp nor her husband, Barry, have met Pistorius before - despite having received 6,000 rand (£340) a month from the athlete dubbed 'Blade Runner' since March 2013. Neither parent would know what to say should they eventually meet, however. 'I am not entirely sure what I am going to say. I know how I fell, but its in my head and it must stay there until that time that we meet.' Steenkamp, left, began her relationship with the athlete Oscar Pistorius in November 2012 . Pistorius was known as the blade runner during his successful years as an athlete . The Steenkamps and their lawyer, Dup de Bruyn, are also adamant that the money they have received from Pistorius is ethically sound. In fact, June Steenkamp believes Reeva would have wanted them to survive from the royalties of such things as the book and also the interviews both parents have done with various news outlets. She continued: 'I think she would have wanted us to have some money. Imagine going through this and you are having no money for anything. Imagine going through the trauma, suffering, pain and having no money.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Oscar Pistorius was given a five-year prison sentence after being found guilty of culpable homicide in the death of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp .

"Liverpool's strikers have now astonishingly racked up almost 1,000 minutes between them without scoring a Premier League goal this season. The trio of Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are yet to find the back of the net in the league this season, with the Reds currently languishing in 11th position.

"Police are investigating abusive tweets about Jessica Ennis-Hill after the Olympic gold medallist said Sheffield United should not re-sign convicted rapist Ched Evans. Ennis-Hill issued a statement saying she would want her name removed from a stand at the Bramall Lane ground if the League One club welcomed the Welsh international back following his conviction for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room. South Yorkshire Police said: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm they are investigating reports of abusive tweets. Officers are making efforts to contact the individual concerned, but have launched an investigation into the posts.' Jessica Ennis-Hill will ask for her name to be removed if Ched Evans is offered a deal at Sheffield United . Ennis-Hill won heptathlon gold at the London Olympics two years ago . Sheffield athlete Ennis-Hill has her name on a stand at Bramall Lane . The investigation was announced as Prime Minister David Cameron said he understood Ennis-Hill's stance. Mr Cameron said: 'I quite understand why she's said what she's said and done what's she done.' The heptathlete had a stand at Bramall Lane named in her honour after her triumph at the London 2012 Games. She issued a statement in the wake of the Blades' decision to allow Evans to train at the club to help him regain his fitness. Ennis-Hill said she would want her name removed if Evans was offered a contract, adding: 'I believe being a role model to young people is a huge honour and those in positions of influence in communities should respect the role they play in young people's lives and set a good example. 'If Evans was to be re-signed by the club, it would completely contradict these beliefs.' Campaigners against sexual violence have criticised the club's decision to allow Evans, 25, to train with the team. TV presenter Charlie Webster, left , has resigned from her role as Sheffield United patron, followed by Lindsay Graham, right, after the club decided to allow convicted rapist Ched Evans to train . TV presenter Charlie Webster, Sixties pop star Dave Berry and Sheffield businesswoman Lindsay Graham have all resigned as patrons of the club since Evans returned to training. Welsh international Evans was jailed in April 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales. The striker denied raping her, saying the sex was consensual, but he was found guilty by a jury at Caernarfon Crown Court. He was released from prison last month after serving half of a five-year sentence. An appeal against his conviction was rejected by three judges at the Court of Appeal in 2012. His case is due to be looked at by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. After his release, Evans put a video on his website protesting his innocence and vowing to clear his name. Ched Evans and his fiancée, Natasha Massey, were seen emerging in exercise clothes near their Cheshire home on Thursday as it was revealed the convicted rapist did not rejoin former team-mates at United . Evans and Massey became engaged following the footballer's release from prison where he served half of a sentence over the rape of a teenager in Wales. Their outing came as patrons of the club resigned . Evans failed to appear at Sheffield United's training grounds despite being told he could return to train with former team-mates, instead emerging in exercise clothing in Cheshire with his partner Natasha Massey . Out and about: Evans was out in Cheshire close to the family home of partner Natasha, right yesterday, who was wearing her engagement ring . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, a Sheffield MP, said that if it was his decision, he would not have let Evans return to his former side. But Mr Clegg indicated that he believed the Welsh international should be allowed to resume his career, possibly with a foreign club. Football Association chairman Greg Dyke last night refused to comment on Evans, insisting he was on BBC2's Newsnight to discuss Fifa's investigation into World Cup bidding. Asked if Evans should be allowed to play for Sheffield United again, Mr Dyke replied: 'I don't want to get into that tonight. I don't think that's what I am here for.' Asked if he should take a lead on the issue, Mr Dyke said: 'Here's the straightforward question - are people who go to prison entitled to come out of prison and to try and rebuild their lives or aren't they? Or is what they've done so bad and because they're in an industry where their image is important - and that's the dilemma and it's not clear cut.'

"Wayne Rooney has revealed how he once stood amongst Arsenal fans in the away end at Anfield to cheer on his mate Francis Jeffers. The 17-year-old had just burst onto the scene with Everton when he went behind enemy lines to watch the Liverpool vs Arsenal clash in January 2003. Rooney and Jeffers both went to Our Lady and St Swithin's primary school in Croxteth, Liverpool and both came through the youth ranks at Everton. Wayne Rooney has revealed how he watched mate Francis Jeffers at Anfield when he played for Arsenal . Rooney and Jeffers on their England debut in the February 2003 friendly match with Australia at Upton Park . Jeffers moved to Arsenal in 2001 and was an unused substitute at Anfield that day as the Premier League match ended 2-2. Speaking ahead of England's Tuesday night friendly with Scotland in Glasgow, captain Rooney was recalling the games he'd watched down the years as a fan. He said: 'I've done it with Everton, at Ibrox and at Anfield, watching Liverpool vs Arsenal, when Franny Jeffers was there.' When asked if he had to go to Anfield incognito, he replied: 'Not really. I didn't go in disguise.' Rooney won his 100th international cap on Saturday in England's 3-1 European Championship qualifying win over Slovenia.

"England's clash with Slovenia hosted the biggest Wembley crowd since Roy Hodgson's World Cup nightmare but Pointless Celebrities had a bigger peak television audience than the Euro 2016 qualifier. ITV peaked during the broadcast at 6.3 million, while the BBC quiz show, which was on at the same time, peaked at 7.26 million just before Strictly Come Dancing. The England match averaged more viewers when the programmes went head-to-head, 5.6 million with a 27 per cent share of audience, while Pointless Celebrities averaged 5 million viewers with a 24 per cent share. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's International Big Match Stats: England vs Slovenia . Viewing figures for Pointless Celebrities peaked higher than they did for England's clash with Slovenia . More than 6.3million people tuned in to watch England, but the BBC quiz show peaked at 7.26m . Former sprinter and hurdler Kriss Akabusi was one of the Pointless Celebrities taking part in the show . That means that over the 90 minutes of the match, more people watched Slovenia's demise than Kriss Akabusi's on the quiz show. And the Wembley attendance figures do at least suggest fans' faith in England is returning after a rocky post-World Cup period. More than 82,000 fans were inside Wembley (90,000 capacity) to watch the Three Lions come from behind in their Group E clash. A penalty from Wayne Rooney and a Danny Welbeck brace ensured the crowd went home happy. The crowd inside the stadium reached 82,000, more than double the amount that watched the Norway clash . The attendance was the third highest in a year, only games against Peru and  Germany attracted more fans . Only 40,000 fans watched England beat Norway at Wembley, the smallest crowd since its redevelopment . It was the third time Wembley had hosted an international game since Hodgson's men crashed out of the group stages in South America, and each time the crowd has increased in size. In the friendly against Norway in September, just 40,000 fans attended the game - making it Wembley's smallest crowd since its redevelopment in 2007. The following game, a Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino, saw a small rise. But at 56,000 Wembley was still only 60 per cent full.

Modric looks certain to miss Real Madrid's game against Eibar on Sunday, while Carlo Ancelotti's side also have games against Basle and Ludogorets in the Champions League over the next month. The Italian will hope to have his midfielder back in action by the time he takes Real to Morocco for the Club World Cup in December. The Champions League holders will face either Cruz Azul or Western Sydney Wanderers in a semi-final on December 16 ahead of a potential final four days later. If Modric's injury is as serious as feared he would miss the trip to Africa as well as league fixtures against Malaga, Celta Vigo and Almeria.

"Manchester United are considering a lucrative post-season tour to Asia to make up for the absence of Champions League football this year. The Premier League club will reveal the exact cost of last season’s disastrous campaign under David Moyes when they release their quarterly figures. However the drop in annual revenue is expected to be in the region of £45m after United failed to make the cut for European football of any kind. Manchester United - pictured on tour in the USA - are considering a lucrative post-season trip to Asia . Wayne Rooney and Co's failure to qualify for the Champions League will hit the club's revenue . Now it can be revealed that United are discussing a ground-breaking tour of the Far East to supplement an expected visit to the Middle East in January. Neither projects have yet been rubber-stamped by the United board or by manager Louis van Gaal but the club are aware that there are gaps in the calendar that would enable them to make the trips. With United set to return to America for the next summer’s pre-season tour, a post-season venture in May – lasting a week – would bring the clubs some revenue and help sate the appetite of millions of Asian fans who haven’t seen the club’s star players in the flesh since Moyes and his squad travelled to Thailand, Australia and Japan in the July of 2013. In terms of a January game, the Middle East remains the most likely venue for a fixture, possibly against AC Milan, but it is understood United have a number of options open to them in terms of a staging venue and opponents and that no decision has yet been made on whether to pursue a game which could be worth in the region of £3m to the club.

"The shaking of Welsh heads said it all. Warren Gatland’s side trudged off the field at the Millennium Stadium after a victory that felt more like defeat. Such a performance against the All Blacks next week will only end one way. The Kiwis will provide a far more brutal assessment of Welsh mettle than this spirited Fijian bunch who survive on a shoe-string budget and almost snatched a famous victory – despite playing just under half an hour with 14-men after a red card to Campese Ma’afu. If Warren Gatland and his selection panel were using this fixture as a trial ahead of the New Zealand Test, then only full back Liam Williams put his hand up. Too many of his colleagues in the red jersey were anonymous and the big guns – notably Sam Warburton and Alun Wyn Jones – will be welcomed back to the starting XV with open arms.

Referee: Pascal Gauzere (France). Attendance: 61,326 . ‘It had the potential to be a bit of a blowout but ended up being a dogfight,’ said Gatland. ‘There was a big opportunity for a number of players in terms of stepping up and putting a marker down. ‘Now we’ve got to look forwards and be excited about next week. The All Blacks made 13 changes for Scotland and they will probably make another 13 changes against us. They will come fully loaded.’ Whether Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard will be among those retuning remains unclear. The British Lion left camp in a protective boot on Tuesday but declared himself fit to play against Harlequins on Friday night. His decision riled the Welsh coaches and stern words will be had tomorrow morning. ‘He was in a boot earlier in the week and wasn’t available for selection, so he needs to go back to Gloucester,’ said Gatland. ‘It was a surprise to us that, on Wednesday, he presents himself to Gloucester as being fit to go on the bench. Sometimes the player needs to be stronger and that’s the conversation we’ll have next week.’ His jersey was filled by Scott Baldwin and the Ospreys hooker triggered the line-out that set up the opening try. Wales dominated the catch and drive throughout, a rare positive from the performance, and provided the platform for the first try from George North in the seventh minute. Rhys Priestland missed the kick and it was not the nerve-settler the Wales No 10 had hoped for, following the booing of the low-confidence player against Australia last week. His dropped ball five minutes later almost allowed Fiji through to level the score, but the presence of North was enough to force a knock on from 6ft5in winger Waisea Nayacalevu.

Wales survived and within the opening quarter they were two tries ahead. Mike Phillips took a quick penalty and it was finished by Alex Cuthbert.. Then any structure in play quickly disintegrated. Fiji have become the forgotten team in the ‘group of death’, but there were reminders in Cardiff that they should not be taken lightly. In the first half, they won eight turnovers to nil against the hosts and, following a snipe from scrum half Nikola Matawalu, they narrowed the deficit with two penalties from giant centre Nemani Nadolo. ‘We’ve only been together for a short time but we’ll have a 35-day camp leading up to the World Cup,’ said Fiji coach John McKee. ‘We will get better and better with the more time we spend together.’ It was a closer contest than many had expected. Fiji had limited preparation and their squad, many of whom smoke, earn just £80 a day while playing in the white jersey. Next week’s opponents, New Zealand, pocket more than £1,000 a day on their tour of the northern hemisphere. They almost narrowed the deficit even further, but Nadolo scuffed his third kick on goal. Campese Ma’afu, the younger brother younger brother of Wallaby prop Salesi, was shown a yellow card in the 37th minute. The 20-stone forward hit the side of a driving maul and a penalty try was awarded to leave the half time score at 17-6. The Islanders managed not to concede during Ma’afu’s sin-bin period, after his re-introduction, the Nottingham player was shown a second yellow for taking out Bradley Davies at the lineout. Fiji put up a spirited resistance with 14-men and, after Taulupe Faletau’s try was overruled, Nadolo landed one last blow with an 80-metre interception try to set up a twitchy finale.

"Do any of these sentences sound remotely like anything related to the Nani who left Manchester United on loan in August? 'Nani has had a very good attitude to his training,' his manager at Sporting Lisbon Marco Silva is quoted as saying in Portuguese newspaper Record. In a poll run by the popular publication last month, 71 per cent voted the winger as the best player in Portugal's top-flight so far this season. Nani has been in impressive form for Sporting Lisbon since rejoining his former side on loan . Nani, pictured with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho, has scored five goals in 16 matches for Sporting . The Portugal forward was shipped out of Old Trafford following Louis van Gaal's arrival . Record for Sporting Lisbon this season . Matches: 13 . Goals: 5 . Also played once as a sub for Manchester United in 2014-15 . Manchester United record . Matches: 219 . Goals: 40 . 'I hope to continue giving joy to my colleagues,' Nani, 28, said after starring in their 4-2 Champions League win against Schalke. Is this the same man who left Old Trafford in the summer? Who made just 22 Premier League appearances and struggled with injury in the last two seasons? Have United actually sent some eager, motivated, determined teenage hopeful over in a Nani body suit instead? United are still paying his £120,000 per week wages in full and received no loan fee, although it is understood the move was integral to the signing of Marcos Rojo. Cristiano Ronaldo versus Lionel Messi will be the main event when Portugal face Argentina at Old Trafford on Tuesday night, but Nani's appearance on the undercard will be equally as interesting for United fans. Even if he impresses yet again, they will have to wait until the end of the season to see him back there permanently. According to another Portuguese paper O Jogo, Nani has rejected the chance to return to Manchester in January and wants to continue the rebuilding job on his reputation in Portugal. He has already scored five goals in 13 matches. They haven't just been any old goals, either. Against Gil Vicente, he flicked the ball over his head, nodded it to an opponent then hit the return pass first-time into the bottom left corner from 25 yards. Manchester United used Nani as bait to land Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo in the summer . Nani has been gearing up for Portugal's upcoming friendly match against Argentina at Old Trafford . Cristiano Ronaldo will also return to his former stomping ground for his side's friendly against Argentina . Versus Penafiel he passed out wide, continued his run into the box then flicked the ball first-time over the opponents' goalkeeper from a tight angle. His first for the club, against Maribor, was a wonderful left-footed effort which curled powerfully into the bottom left corner from the edge of the box. The 28-year-old is becoming a match-winner for them, scoring and starring in their 4-2 Champions League victory against Schalke. He scored the third goal to swing the tie in their favour, also got an assist and won the free-kick for another with a cheeky step-over. Confidence was spilling out of his boots as he juggled the ball shortly before being substituted at the end to a standing ovation. This isn't necessarily the Nani of old. In England he has never performed like this. It's more the Nani that Nani has been telling everyone about since Nani moved over in 2007. It is the Nani that Sir Alex Ferguson envisaged when he signed him for £25.5million from Sporting Lisbon seven years ago. 'With Nani we were buying pure raw material,' Ferguson wrote in his latest autobiography. 'He was immature, inconsistent, but with a wonderful instinct for football. 'When you buy a player with all those talents, the trick is to put them in order. He was a bit disorganised and needed to be more consistent. 'What attracted me to Nani was his pace, strength and aerial ability. He had two fine feet. Gymnastic, too. His athletic read-outs were always first-class. So the foundations were there.' Silva is confident he will be able to carry this current form into any club, even one as big as Manchester United. 'Good players always have a big influence,' he added. 'Nani, big player that he is, has a major influence, as he would in any team. At the level he is now, he has a huge influence.' This could just be a case of a big fish in a small pond, but Nani only signed a new five-year deal last year so he is contracted to United until 2018 and has plenty of time to become a Premier League shark. Sir Alex Ferguson signed Nani in 2007 in hope that he could fill the legendary boots of Ryan Giggs .","Nani has impressed for Sporting Lisbon since rejoining his former side .

"Manchester United's defensive problems have worsened with news that the utility man Daley Blind could be sidelined for several weeks after being forced off against Latvia. The Manchester United summer signing, who has been entrusted to screen his side's defence since sealing a move to Old Trafford, is an important player for Louis van Gaal's side due to his ability to fill in at centre back or left back. Manchester United have had 39 injuries since Van Gaal took over the reins at the Premier League outfit in the summer. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Holland vs Latvia . Manchester United midfielder Daley Blind sustained a knee injury during Holland's win against Latvia . Blind goes down in agony after a collision with Eduards Visnakovs during the first half . Blind is helped off the field by a member of Holland's medical team during the game against Latvia .

Rafael: Muscular injury . Ashley Young: Groin/Pelvis injury . Phil Jones: Calf/Shin injury . Radamel Falcao: Calf/Shin injury . Jonny Evans: Ankle/Foot injury . Jesse Lingard: Knee injury . He has been particularly short of defenders after losing Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra. The Dutchman brought in Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo to fill the void left by the experienced trio but it has been costly injuries to the likes of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans which have hampered Manchester United's hopes of challenging for the Premier League title. Van Gaal has been forced into calling on the services of inexperienced defenders such as Tyler Blackett and Paddy McNair in the absence of his first choice defenders. The 63-year-old has also had to deploy the likes of Michael Carrick, Antonio Valencia and Blind out of position to fill in for his wounded stars. Here's a timeline of Manchester United's defensive problems since March: . March 5: Inter Milan confirm they have agreed a deal to sign Serbia defender Nemanja Vidic from United. He leaves at the end of the 2013-14 season. May 12: United confirm Rio Ferdinand, a key component of the Red Devils' back line for 12 years, will leave in the summer. June 27: Left back Luke Shaw is signed for £27million plus add-ons. Former Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic announced he was leaving the club in March . Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra also moved on to pastures new at the end of last season . July 21: Patrice Evra also exits the club, joining Juventus, even though he signed a one-year contract extension at United in May. July 29: United boss Louis van Gaal announces he has had to devise a special training programme for Shaw, whom he describes as 'not very fit'. August 13: United confirm Shaw will miss first four weeks of the season with a hamstring injury. August 20: Argentina defender Rojo, who played at full back for his country at the 2014 World Cup, moves to Old Trafford from Sporting Lisbon. Marcos Rojo, who joined  United in the summer, was carried off on a stretcher against Manchester City . August 24: Smalling suffers a groin injury in the 1-1 draw at Sunderland. September 1: Blind, who can play in defence or in midfield, is signed on deadline day from Ajax. The window closes with United having spent around £150million on new players but no recognised central defender. September 12: Versatile defender Phil Jones is ruled out for up to a month with a hamstring injury. Phil Jones has been plagued by a range of different injuries during his Manchester United career . September 21: Defender Jonny Evans suffers a foot injury in a calamitous 5-3 defeat at Leicester, with Smalling replacing him as he made his own return from the groin problem sustained in August. Another defender, Tyler Blackett, is sent off and therefore suspended. September 24: Smalling suffers a new injury - this time to his thigh - in training. September 25: United manager Van Gaal confirms he is now down to just one fit centre-back - Rojo - for the game against West Ham. September 27: Nineteen-year-old Paddy McNair is drafted in for a senior debut against the Hammers. He also features against Everton, Manchester City and Crystal Palace. Paddy McNair, pictured closing down Crystal Palace's Yannick Bolasie, made his debut against West Ham . October 26: Van Gaal reveals Jones is suffering from shin splints which caused him to miss the 1-1 draw with Chelsea, in which Smalling made his return from injury. Jones also missed the Manchester derby. November 2: Smalling sent off for two bookable offences against Manchester City, while Rojo suffers a suspected dislocated shoulder. Brazilian full back Rafael misses the match due to injury so winger Valencia is forced to fill in. United end the match with McNair and Carrick occupying the central defensive positions. November 16: Blind suffers suspected torn knee ligaments while playing for Holland against Latvia. A scan will determine the extent of the problem - but Dutch manager Guus Hiddink suggests Blind could be facing up to six weeks of rehabilitation. Chris Smalling was sent off for two bookable offences against local rivals Manchester City .","Red Devils midfielder Daley Blind is expected to be out for several weeks .

"Scotland flanker Blair Cowan insists the Dark Blues' narrow loss to New Zealand proves Vern Cotter's men are on the verge of something 'special'. A sold-out BT Murrayfield crowd thought they were witnessing history on Saturday as the Scots pushed the world champion All Blacks close. Skipper Greig Laidlaw fluffed a penalty 13 minutes from time which would have put the hosts on course for their very first win against the Kiwis after 109 years of trying. Scotland flanker Blair Cowan (right) feels the full force of Sonny Bill Williams's tackle at Murrayfield . But with that let off, Steve Hansen's Southern Hemisphere giants romped down to the pitch and grabbed what proved to be the winning try when Jeremy Thursh found a rare gap in the Scottish defence to seal a 24-16 win. It was cruel luck for Scotland but having shipped 100 points and 13 tries in their previous two encounters against New Zealand, the evidence of progress under Kiwi coach Cotter is clear to see. It was also the first time the Dark Blues had come within 10 points of the All Blacks since losing the 1991 World Cup third-place play-off. Greig Laidlaw missed a late penalty that would have given Scotland the lead with 10 minutes remaining . Now London Irish back-rower Cowan believes that with another World Cup around the corner next year, Scotland can start dreaming of another run to the latter stages. They have one final chance to hone their game plan before the RBS 6 Nations gets under way in February when they take on Tonga at Kilmarnock's Rugby Park on Saturday but Cowan insists there is no holding back Cotter's side. He said: 'You have got to be real about it, it was still a loss on Saturday. If you are going to accept defeats then you may as well give up there. All Blacks lock Jeremy Thrush crossed for a try soon after to seal New Zealand's narrow victory . 'We are bitterly disappointed with the loss but there are a lot of positives we can build on. It's not a negative loss if you want to put it that way. 'There is a sense that something is growing in this squad. It's very special and perfectly-timed with the Six Nations and World Cup coming up. 'But as quickly as things are built, they can be dismantled. 'We have to stay clear-headed and keep progressing. We have a big game next week against Tonga, so we have to get back to work quickly. 'We feel we are heading towards something special. We are a team on the up. New Zealand-born flanker Cowan admitted it was an emotional experience facing the haka last Saturday . 'The unity amongst the squad and the sense that we are going somewhere is amazing.' Saturday's match pulled at Cowan's heart strings. Born and raised in the small town of Upper Hutt, near Wellington, the 28-year-old turned his back on his hopes of ever pulling on an All Black jersey during the summer when he was called up to represent the land of his Argyll-born mother Joan. In the days before the second autumn Test with New Zealand, he spoke about how tough it would be to stare down the haka while wearing a Scotland shirt. But Cowan revealed he worked hard all week in the build-up focusing his mind not to let the emotions take over. 'There were all sorts of things gong through my head before the kick-off,' he said. 'It was an amazing experience for me - a lot of pride in myself for getting to where I am now. 'As I watched the haka, it was a bit of home coming at me and it was something I will cherish for the rest of my life. 'But once the game kicked-off I never let the emotions take off. It was big for me personally and I had a lot of family there too, so it was something I was clear about all week. 'I just tried to remember all the jobs I had to do. You do want to use some of the emotion but as soon as your mind lets the emotion take over is when you start making silly mistakes.'","Scotland pushed New Zealand close before losing 24-16 at Murrayfield .

"Quade Cooper believes Australia must find a new 'identity' under Michael Cheika to move on from the Kurtley Beale saga. The Queensland Reds fly-half said utility back Beale has been welcomed back into the Wallabies squad with open arms after his much-publicised absence. Beale's clashes with Di Patston led to the Wallabies business manager quitting her post, before coach Ewen McKenzie followed suit last month. Australia fly half Quade Cooper gets in some stretching before his side's clash with France last week . Cooper (left) is thrilled that Kurtley Beale has linked up with the Wallabies following his suspension . New boss Michael Cheika has drafted Beale back into the squad following a fine totalling almost £25,000 for sending Patston a lewd text, and the 25-year-old could line up against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday. Cooper admitted sympathy for McKenzie's plight, but challenged the Wallabies to complete a bout of soul searching on their northern hemisphere tour. 'From a team point of view he (Beale) offers a lot, everyone's happy to have him here,' said Cooper. New Wallabies coach Michael Cheika previously led Leinster to a Heineken Cup title back in 2008 . 'Cheiks speaks highly of him and knows his ability as a player. 'None of us are here to play politicians, or politics, we're all here with the same focus of improving as a rugby team, and improving as rugby players. 'From a professional point of view we're focusing on beating Ireland this week - we know it's going to be a tough encounter. 'Kurtley is fine, he's in good spirits and he's keen to get out there, train and be a part of the squad. Beale (left) dives from clutches of Alex Cuthburt to score a try against Wales in Cardiff in 2013 . 'Of course, I think with the ups and downs we've had through the past season it's great to be on tour for five weeks and have five games. 'It's a great opportunity for us to find our identity as a team, and that's something we're working very hard at. 'This is an interesting tour, we had a good start against the Barbarians and a tough game against the French, so we're just aiming to improve.' Cooper himself is back in the Wallabies squad after a protracted absence, teaming up with Will Genia in the half-back cordon for the first time in a year against the Barbarians at the start of the month. The 26-year-old has enjoying boxing sparring sessions with new coach Cheika in training - and admitted his quest for personal improvement is mirrored by the entire squad. Beale speaks to the Australian media in Sydney before flying out to join the Wallabies squad last week . 'When you see someone step down you feel for them but you've got to respect their decision around that,' said Cooper of McKenzie. 'In terms of everything else I've been excited with the opportunity to grow under a new coach. 'Also I'm just happy to be back in and around the squad, being able to contribute to the team. 'If I can contribute in any way, holding pads, being out on the field or giving advice, I'll continue to do that. 'That's my sole focus, to become a better person, a better player and a better team-mate.' Waratahs utility back Beale could line up against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday . Cooper said former Leinster coach Cheika is excited to be back on Irish soil, while at the same time demanding a new 'mental edge' from his Wallabies. 'The way he talks about the game, he's very passionate about being physical,' said Cooper. 'Training is very intense, very physical, there's no time to take a breath. 'That's what this team must build on the back of. 'The identity of the team, we're all heading in the same direction. 'If we can continue to follow his guidance, we'll be a lot better for it. 'Mental edge is something he talks about a lot. 'Mental preparation, each individual making sure we cover everything in the week, leaving nothing to chance.

"Kellie Maloney stopped breathing for more than an hour during facial reconstruction surgery and was kept alive on an emergency respirator, it has been reported. Maloney, formerly fight promoter Frank Maloney, shocked the world of boxing when it was revealed in August she was undergoing a sex change but, 18 months into the transition, she is believed to have suffered a heart murmur triggered by a reaction to the anaesthetic she was under. Maloney's final operation was scheduled for January 13 but it is understood medics have cancelled the genital and breast surgery, warning it is too dangerous. Kellie Maloney reportedly stopped breathing during facial reconstruction surgery and had to be kept alive . A source told the The Sun: 'She can't go ahead with the sex change now. She's in utter turmoil.' Under NHS guidelines, transsexuals have to live as a woman for two years before they are allowed corrective surgery. Private clinics recommend one year to ensure that their patients can cope with the change. Maloney already received hormone therapy, hours of hair removal electrolysis, voice coaching and counselling. Her final operation was for 'the realignment of her male genitalia to become female genitalia' as well as having breast implants. Eleven days ago, Maloney travelled to Belgium to undergo facial surgery but she is said to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic which meant she could not breathe on her own. She is now recovering with her family in Maidstone, Kent. MailOnline has contacted Ms Maloney's representatives for comment.

"The pomp and ceremony surrounding the presentation of Wayne Rooney's golden cap was typically English, but looking at the Wembley pitch you may have thought the game was taking place across the Atlantic.

In a week where Real Madrid revealed they send their groundsman to inspect pitches before playing on them to prevent injuries, Premier League bosses will be unimpressed their England stars were forced to play on such a poor quality surface. Politicians and Wembley bosses have struggled to hide their glee at the prospect of an NFL franchise playing regularly at the home of English football, but perhaps some could do with reminding this pitch was designed and built at great cost for English, not American, football. The Slovenian team even lodged a complaint about the conditions prior to the match. England boss Roy Hodgson admitted he was surprised they had done so, telling ITV: 'I was out there now and it didn't look that bad to me to be honest. 'Talking about the pitch and making a lot of statements about it before the game is a strange thing to do. We'll see how the game goes and the result first before talking about that.' His comments, though, were in contrast to the opinion he voiced earlier in the week when he said: 'I can't pretend that (the NFL clash at Wembley) is something that makes me leap for joy.

"Five-time European champions Bayern Munich are looking to take on Premier League clubs and grab some of the growing market for soccer in the United States by setting up a US registered company. FC Bayern Munich LLC recently opened an office in New York and on Wednesday announced a partnership with a leading youth soccer organisation. Bayern has teamed up with Massachusetts-based Global Premier Soccer, which organises youth coaching and development programmes, and will provide assistance from coaches and technical staff from the Bundesliga club. Bundesliga giants Bayern Munich are keen on improving their fanbase in America . Bayern hope star players such as Manuel Neuer and Robert Lewandowski, pictured, can help to attract fans . 'This is the first of many initiatives we will be undertaking to foster a deeper connection with soccer fans in the United States,' said managing director of Bayern's United States division Rudolf Vidal. Bayern toured the United States during the summer this year and played against the Major League Soccer All-Stars. 'The Bayern Munich brand has become very well known in the last few years with the team reaching three Champions League finals in four years and the Champions League is the best soccer product in the US. 'We were also lucky to have seven Bayern players who became champions at the World Cup,' he added, referring to Germany's triumph in Brazil earlier this year. The 24-times German champions already have launched a US specific website and online store to help drive merchandise sales to American fans. Bayern are currently top of the Bundesliga and remain unbeaten since the start of the league campaign . 'We have done professional market research and found we have one million converted fans in the US. People who are not only interested but who are really focused and supporting Bayern Munich,' said Vidal, who noted the large number of Americans with German ancestry provide another pool of potential fans. The most committed Bayern fans are members of the 28 Bayern supporter clubs dotted around the United States, part of a growing trend of Americans 'adopting' European clubs to support. But while English clubs such as Manchester United, Liverpool and Arsenal have gained strong footholds in the United States along with Spanish giants Barcelona and Real Madrid, Bundesliga teams have a less visible presence. Vidal, however, believes that will change when a television deal kicks in next season and Bundesliga games will move from the sometimes hard to find cable channel Gol TV to the more mainstream Fox Sports network.

"Peter Crouch has poked fun at FIFA in the wake of the report into World Cup corruption by revealing he was sure of 'problems' at football's governing body after being omitted from the Ballon d'Or shortlist. FIFA have come in for criticism after findings of an investigation into the World Cup bidding process for 2018 and 2022 only found fault with the losing bids, including England's. And now Stoke striker Crouch has taken a jibe at the organisation by suggesting corruption within FIFA is to blame for his failure to be selected alongside the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi to be in with a shot of winning football's top individual prize. Peter Crouch (above) took to Twiter on Friday morning to make the joke at FIFA's expense . The 33-year-old (far left) said when he was left off the Ballon d'Or shortlist he knew their were problems . Crouch suggested he should have joined the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and Lionel Messi on the shortlist . 'I knew there was problems with decision making at FIFA when I didn't make the ballon d'Or shortlist,' the 33-year-old Tweeted. The joke went down well with the former England international's 40,000 followers and the Tweet received almost 12,000 Retweets in its first few hours. Stoke responded to Crouch's disappointment at missing out on the award by rewarding the striker with his very own custom trophy. 'We were shocked too... So, we have got you a special 'Crouch-on d'Or' waiting for you in the office!'

"Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has claimed it is 'grossly unfair' for England to have borne the brunt of criticism in a FIFA ethics investigation into World Cup bidding. Pressure is growing for FIFA to publish the full report by investigator Michael Garcia, who on Thursday announced he is to challenge the decision by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to clear Qatar and Russia to host the 2022 and 2018 World Cups. Eckert's findings said there was no reason to re-run the bidding - and criticised England 2018 for its relationship with disgraced former FIFA executive member Jack Warner. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore has expressed his feelings about FIFAs ethics report . Hans-Joachim Eckert (left) will speak with Michael Garcia (left) about his decision to appeal the investigation . Scudamore has joined calls for the Garcia report to be published and told Sky Sports News: 'It tells you a little bit about international football politics that the people who were singled out for most criticism in the report were the English. I think that's probably grossly unfair. 'It is really unfair to pick on the English, but clearly the whole process has not been great and we need to somehow get the way these things are done changed for the future.' Click here to read the full 42-page FIFA statement . Scudamore was part of the England 2018 bid delegation who attended the vote in December 2010. He added: 'The Garcia report should be out there in full, it's the only way that we are in any way going to be able to move on really. If there is a report that has been done by an eminent investigator, really that report should be published in full so that we can all see it.' Eckert said he planned to hold talks with Garcia but admitted he was surprised by the American lawyer's reaction. Eckert told Press Association Sport: 'Yes I was surprised. I will talk to Garcia but until then I will make no more statements.' Meanwhile two other senior FIFA executive members have joined Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce in calling for the Garcia report to be made public - something Eckert said in a statement on Thursday that he would not do. England are being criticised for trying to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner . Qatar were named as the host nation for the 2022 World Cup back in 2010 . American FIFA member Sunil Gulati and FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb from the Cayman Islands issued a joint statement saying: 'Given the disagreement between the two chairmen of the investigatory and adjudicatory chambers of the ethics committee and to ensure complete transparency we believe the full report conducted by the FIFA ethics committee into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be made public as soon as possible. 'This can be done with appropriate redaction to protect any confidentiality required by the FIFA code of ethics. Providing the entire independent report for inspection is in the best interest of the game and FIFA.' Garcia said he will go to FIFA's appeals committee because Eckert's summary of his investigation contained 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions'. The FA are set to come under fire for their dealings with former FIFA vice president Warner (second left) He will also have the opportunity to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, even though it is not exactly clear what he is specifically appealing against. Meanwhile, Scudamore said the Premier League remained totally opposed to the Qatar 2022 World Cup being played in January - and that November/December should be 'the very latest' if it is moved to avoid high summer temperatures. He said: 'If the Qatar World Cup is going to change - and we still believe that it is a summer tournament and it should be played in May, June, July or August - then our view is very simple: if we're going to have to stop and start our season the sooner we do that the better. 'We would rather it be played in September, or October, or November - December at the very, very latest. It's going to be huge interruption to our season and a huge interruption to every season quite frankly across Europe, and we hope that if there's still any way that FIFA can avoid that interruption, that would be our preferred choice.'","Richard Scudamore says FIFA investigation is unfair to pick on English .

"Wembley's managing director has admitted the state of the pitch at the national stadium is below its usual standard and says it could be March before it is back to its best. Roger Maslin, however, defended the decision to host NFL games at the stadium just six days before an England qualifier, saying the cause of the pitch problems was not the American football matches but too much top-soil being placed on the surface during the summer. England manager Roy Hodgson last week questioned the Football Association's decision to host NFL games at Wembley so close to national team matches - the Three Lions host Slovenia in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Saturday six days after the Dallas Cowboys played the Jacksonville Jaguars. Loose dirt flies flies up at Wembley as Dallas Cowboys' Dwayne Harris returns the ball against Jacksonville . Getting straight to work the Wembley groundstaff race to prepare the pitch for England's clash with Slovenia . Maslin told the FA's website: 'We strive to deliver the best possible surface, so I'm slightly disappointed that the surface isn't as good as it should be but I'm confident it will be back to its pristine state after a winter renovation. 'This isn't so much a problem of the NFL but of our summer renovation and I am confident the renovation will get it back to how it's been ever since we switched over to Desso in 2010. 'However, due to slightly too much topsoil during the summer renovation there's more marking and scarring on the pitch than we'd want.' The Desso surface has artificial fibres woven into the natural grass providing greater durability and since 2010 there have been few of the problems which dogged the Wembley pitch before then. England boss Roy Hodgson didn't seem extremely .pleased with the NFL match taking place at Wembley . The Wembley surface is visibly cut up as the NFL stars go through their paces on Sunday night . Groundstaff try their best to remove divots from the pitch at half-time during the NFL match . Hodgson met Maslin for talks after his comments last week and the Wembley chief will meet the England boss again later this week. Maslin added: 'Roy is totally entitled to his opinion. We have a very good working relationship with the England team and we'll be working closely with them this week to ensure we deliver the best possible playing surface for the game on Saturday. 'I met Roy at the end of last week and no doubt we'll pick up with the team on Thursday and Friday this week too. 'While the pitch will not be of the very highest standard we want for the Slovenia game, it will still be a good playing surface.

"HIV was born in a 'perfect storm' of bustling trade routes and migrant workers in 1920s central Africa, a study has claimed. Scientists from Oxford University and Belgium analysed the genetic history behind the virus, which killed 1.5million people last year alone, and painstakingly traced it back to the city of Kinshasa. Now the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Belgian colonial rulers had made Kinshasa a thriving trade hub with modern railways which allowed the virus to travel thousands of miles. Melting pot: Today's HIV pandemic had its roots in 1920s Kinshasa, a study has claimed. Now the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the city (pictured in 1955 when it was called Leopoldville) had busy rail routes . That combined with urban growth, migrant workers and changes to sexual habits and the sex trade, formed a 'perfect storm' which allowed the virus to spread unnoticed until it was too late to stop it. The researchers combined genetic analysis with statistical data on historical factors, such as how the population of central Africa was distributed at the time. They focused on HIV-1 Group M, which was just one of several strains which were passed at some point from primates into humans. Unlike the other strains, HIV-1 Group M proved more devastating, and is the strain which affects most of the 35million people affected around the world today. Despite Kinshasa being a melting-pot, HIV was seemingly slow to spread beyond the city's borders. It took as long as 30 years for it to crop up in three other cities in the vast nation - Mbuji-Mayi, Lubumbashi and Kisangani, as far as 1,000 miles away. How times change: Kinshasa today. The virus has long since spread worldwide, killing up to 40million people . It stayed in the Congo - which is the size of all of western Europe combined - until spreading to the U.S. and around the world from the 1960s onwards, before the number of cases exploded in the 1980s. Because HIV exists 'silently' before causing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), it was only identified as the virus behind the condition in 1983. By then thousands of people had already died of AIDS-related illnesses. Since then scientists have been engaged in a long battle to improve treatment with antiretroviral drugs, which slow the course of HIV and allow some patients to live healthily for decades. Deadly: HIV seen in false colour through a microscope. Only one strain turned into a pandemic . Thanks to their efforts and education about safe sex, AIDS deaths have slowly been declining since 2005 - when they peaked at 2.3million worldwide - to 1.5million last year. Professor Oliver Pybus of Oxford University, a leader of the new study in the journal Science, said it was the most comprehensive genetic analysis so far of HIV. He said: 'For the first time, we have analysed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques, which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from. 'This means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the HIV pandemic originated.' Professor Philippe Lemey of Belgium's University of Leuven said 'it became evident that the early spread of HIV-1 from Kinshasa to other population centres followed predictable patterns.' A key factor, he added, was the fact Belgian colonisers had made Kinshasa one of central Africa's best-connected cities. Nuno Faria of Oxford University added: 'Data from colonial archives tells us that by the end of 1940s over one million people were traveling through Kinshasa on the railways each year. 'We think it is likely that the social changes around the independence in 1960 saw the virus break out from small groups of infected people to infect the wider population and eventually the world'. Since the HIV/AIDS pandemic began it has killed up to 40million people around the world. It is spread in blood, semen and breast milk, often via unsafe sex or contaminated needles.","Oxford University and Belgian scientists studied virus's genetic history .

"The humpback whale carcass that made headlines around the world when an Australian man became stranded on it after climbing on board has been taken to its final resting place at a garbage landfill. Council workers at the City of Scarborough in Western Australia have been working since Monday to remove the carcass when it washed up on the beach. It was a tough job for the workers who took part in the 'massive engineering operation' which ended in a slow one-and-a-half drive to the Tamala Park landfill - in Perth's north - from Scarborough Beach. Scroll down for video . Council workers at the City of Scarborough in Western Australia had been working since Monday to remove the carcass . A council spokeswoman said the 30-tonne whale was put on the back of a 40-tonne mining truck and was escorted by police to the landfill. She added it had taken two days to remove the 17-metre carcass from the beach because there were fears it would fall apart. It is the same whale that Harrison Williams, from Quinns Rocks near Perth, climbed on top of after he jumped off a boat on Saturday afternoon. He became stranded when sharks started to circle the dead whale. It took two days to remove the 17-metre carcass from the beach because there were fears it would fall apart . The whale washed up on shore on Sunday, just before 6pm, and the beach had remained closed until its removal . Looking back on the stunt, Mr Williams told Daily Mail Australia on Sunday that he wanted to help it because it looked like it was in distress but was obviously too late. The whale washed up on shore on Sunday, just before 6pm, and the beach had remained closed until its removal.

"Leighton Baines could return to Premier League action next weekend after the hamstring injury that forced him to withdraw from England's squad was found to be less serious than first feared. The Everton defender will not play any part in England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on Saturday or next week's international friendly against Scotland after picking up the injury during training on Friday. However, the Toffees have confirmed that the 29-year-old is expected to be back against West Ham on Saturday 22 November. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Leighton Baines (L) picked up a hamstring strain during training with England on Friday . Baines speaks with England manager Roy Hodgson (C) and Everton teammate Phil Jagielka (R) A statement of the Everton official website said: 'Leighton Baines could be in contention to face West Ham United next weekend after scans revealed the full-back's hamstring injury is not as serious as first feared. 'He returned to Finch Farm for an assessment which has since showed that he has sustained a 'grade one' hamstring injury – the least significant on the scale of such injuries. 'Baines will continue to be monitored by Everton's medical team and, although he remains a doubt for next Saturday, he has not yet been ruled out of the game against Sam Allardyce's Hammers.' Arsenal full-back Kieran Gibbs will replace Baines for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia . Arsenal left-back Kieran Gibbs is the only option to replace Baines as manager Roy Hodgson did not name Manchester United's Luke Shaw in his squad listed with UEFA by the deadline on Friday. Hodgson said: 'Kieran Gibbs is the one to come in as unfortunately we had given our squad at 11 o'clock as we are duty-bound to do to UEFA and, because there were three left backs, I left him [Shaw] out of the 23 as we had 24 players at the time. As it turns out now we can't use him.' The England manager conceded that he was aware of the rule, but had hoped UEFA would show some leniency by allowing him to call up Shaw as Baines' injury occurred within half an hour of the squad list being submitted. United defender Luke Shaw was not included in Hodgson's original 23-man squad to face Slovenia . Hodgson had hoped that UEFA would show some flexibility by allowing him to call up Shaw . He said: 'I can't pretend that I think it's a great idea that you have to name 23 players almost 36 hours before the game because training injuries do occur and people do get injuries and fall sick. 'I would like to think that if you are allowed to have 23 players in your squad that you should at least have the right [to] a little bit longer than 36 hours ahead of the game. 'Having said that, I did know about the rule. My hope was that because we were only 25 minutes late when we applied to bring Luke back into the squad that maybe UEFA would look at that and say, 'It's a reasonable request and we can show some flexibility,' but they decided that wasn't possible, that the rule is the rule, and that 11 o'clock is the deadline and because the injury occurred 25 minutes past 11 we missed it.'

While the symbol may now be associated with Nazis, it was in fact an ancient symbol used for more than 3,000 years to depict prosperity and power. For example, in Indo-European culture a swastika was a mark made on people to give them good luck. The word itself is derived from the Sanskrit 'svastika' and means 'good to be'. After finding the geoglyphs on Google Earth, archaeologists from Kostanay University in Kazakhstan and Vilnius University in Lithuania have been using radar to better understand the structure.

"Michael Klanja, 30, died when a wall collapsed at a Melbourne building site during strong winds on Monday . A Melbourne family is mourning the death of loving father Michael Klanja who was tragically killed by a brick wall which was toppled over by a gust of wind on Monday. It is believed the builder left the upper storey of a townhouse development because he thought it would be safer working on the ground level when strong winds lashed Melbourne. But the 30-year-old died after being trapped under a rubble of a partly-built brick garage wall in Melbourne's Brighton East. It's the second tragic accident to strike the Klanja family, after Mr Klanja's mother died in a car crash. A co-worker frantically tried to rescue the father-of-two from the debris but paramedics could not revive him. Mr Klanja's family said he was a generous and loving man who was loved by all. 'Michael Klanja, husband to Isabel and father to two beautiful boys, will be dearly missed,' his family said in a statement. 'He goes to meet his mother also taken by an accident as tragic as this. 'A life that was taken too early but a life that will stay with us forever.' Scroll down for video . The 30-year-old died after being trapped under a rubble of a partly-built brick garage wall at a construction site in Melbourne's Brighton East . It is believed the builder left the upper storey of a townhouse development because he thought it would be safer working on the ground level . Mr Klanja's mother reportedly died in a car accident about five years ago. Mr Klanja was working on a two-storey townhouse development in Brighton East when strong winds hit Melbourne on Monday morning. His supervisor and family friend, Stan Bilic, was devastated to see Mr Klanja die after knowing him for so long. 'I knew the day when he was born and I (saw) it when he died as well, which is really hard for me,' Mr Bilic told reporters. Detective Sergeant Gerry Richardson said the two workers decided not to work on the upper floor due to high winds. 'They came down from the upper storey level that they were working on and they decided it would be safer to work on the rear of the construction site,' Detective Sergeant Richardson told reporters. 'They moved from the upper storey level to the rear of the premises because of the wind.' Detective Sergeant Richardson said police would investigate how the wind brought down the wall. 'We've got to look at how the wall was braced in regards to that, whether that was part of the factor of why the wall collapsed,' he said. A co-worker frantically tried to rescue the father-of-two from the debris but paramedics could not revive him . Detective Sergeant Richardson said paramedics arrived soon after the collapse but were unable to revive the man when he was freed from the rubble. Neighbour Leala Sawicki said she was lying in bed when she heard the wall collapse, but thought it was just normal sounds from the building site. 'I heard a really loud bang. I didn't think anything because I'd been hearing noises all the time,' Mrs Sawicki said. 'By the time I got up, they (emergency services) were already here.' Mrs Sawicki said she saw her neighbour trying to talk with Mr Klanja but he didn't seem to be responding. 'I could see my neighbour talking to the guy, he looked terrible.' Three pedestrians died when a building site wall collapsed in Melbourne's CBD in March 2013.","Michael Klanja was working on a townhouse development site in Brighton East on Monday morning .

"For years, websites have been criticised for carrying out hidden - and in some cases - underhand techniques to lure in customers. And despite a number of high-profile reports, involving sites such as Amazon and Staples, a new study has revealed many of these personalisation methods are still taking place. Researchers examined prices across 16 different retailers and found that some show different prices to different users based on where they live, whether they’re searching on a PC or phone, and even based on what they have paid for items previously. Scroll down for video . Researchers from Northeastern University in Boston studied prices on ten major US retailers and six hotel and rental car sites including Walmart, Home Depot and Expedia. They discovered evidence of price discrimination and steering, based on a user's location of browsing history . It is not known whether the practice is a worldwide phenomenon or whether the results observed in the study are confined to businesses in the US. ‘People have a mental model of shopping that is based on experiences from brick-and-mortar stores,’ explained Christo Wilson, assistant professor of Computer and Information Science at Northeastern University on The Conversation. ‘Many people assume this same mental model of shopping applies just as well to e-commerce websites. However, as we are discovering, this is not the case.’ In 2010, Amazon’s chief executive Jeff Bezos admitted an experiment, in which the site charged different users different prices for the same DVD, was ‘a mistake.’ It’s a practice known as price discrimination or price differentiation. To avoid price differences, researchers advise searching for products using a private or incognito browser window on a PC or mobile. This means companies don’t know what sites and products have previously been searched for, or how much users paid for items. It also means they don’t know what platform is being used to search the sites. By deleting cache and stored cookie data also removes personalisation options. To make sure websites don't track future cookies they can also be disabled through a browser's settings menu. Be aware that removing cookies will also mean stored passwords, personalised adverts and choices won't appear. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal revealed Staples was charging users different prices based on their geographic location. It also reported that travel retailer Orbitz was showing more expensive hotels to users browsing from Mac computers, known as price steering. To see if these practices are still being used, and how extensively, Assistant Professor Wilson and his colleagues examined ten major US retailers along with six hotel and rental car sites. This included Best Buy, CDW, HomeDepot, JC Penney, Macy’s Newegg, Office Depot, Sears, Staples, Walmart, Cheaptickets, Expedia, Hotels.com, Orbitz, Priceline and Travelocity. They then recruited 300 people to run product searches on the 16 sites. The researchers paired each of these real users, who each had their own real, browser history, with an automated browser that ran the same searches at the same time as the real users, but did not store any cookies. By comparing the search results shown to these automated controls, and to the real users, they identified a number of cases of personalisation. ‘We saw price steering from Sears, with the order of search results varying from user to user,' said the study. Researchers examined ten major US retailers along with six hotel and rental car sites. They then recruited 300 people to run product searches on 16 sites. Cheaptickets (pictured) presented different results to guests (top), and unadvertised 'Members Only' prices to logged-in users (bottom) This chart reveals which sites showed products with different prices. A desktop user searching Home Depot, for example, typically received 24 search results, with an average price per item of $120 (£75). Mobile users received 48 search results, with an average price per item of $230 (£143) ‘[And] we saw price discrimination from Home Depot, Sears, Cheaptickets, Orbitz, Priceline, Expedia, and Travelocity, with product prices varying from user to user.’ To figure out what, in particular, was being used to personalise results, the researchers conducted a second experiment, using fake accounts. In 2010, Amazon’s chief executive Jeff Bezos admitted an experiment, in which the site charged different users different prices for the same DVD, was ‘a mistake.’ It’s a practice known as price discrimination or price differentiation. In 2012, the Wall Street Journal revealed Staples was charging users different prices based on their geographic location. It also reported that travel retailer Orbitz was showing more expensive hotels to users browsing from Mac computers, known as price steering. There is also a technique known as A/B testing. By dividing visitors into different groups, companies are able to use these tests to see how users respond to new website features and algorithms. During tests, for example, visitors to Expedia and Hotels.com were randomly assigned to groups A, B, or C based on the cookies stored on their computers, said the researchers. Users in groups A and B were shown hotels with an average price of $187 per night (£116) while users in group C were shown hotels with an average price of $170 per night (£106). They tested personalisation using a range of browsers, including Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer as well as different platforms, including Windows, OS X, iOS and Android. They also tried searching for deals while logged into an account, and as guests. Using one account, the researchers booked cheap hotels and rentals cars, while the other booked more expensive rooms and cars. ‘Our fake accounts uncovered many different personalisation strategies employed by sites,’ said the researchers. For example, Travelocity reduced the prices on 5 per cent of hotel rooms shown in search results by around $15 (£9) per night when searched for on iOS or Android. Cheaptickets and Orbitz gave unadvertised ‘Members Only’ discounts of about $12 (£7.50) per night on 5 per cent of hotels rooms to users who were logged in to their accounts on the site. Meanwhile, Expedia and Hotels.com used what marketers and engineers call ‘A/B tests’ to steer certain users towards more expensive hotels. By dividing visitors into different groups, companies are able to use these tests to see how users respond to new website features and algorithms. In this case, for example, visitors to Expedia and Hotels.com were randomly assigned to groups A, B, or C based on the cookies stored on their computers, said the researchers. Users in groups A and B were shown hotels with an average price of $187 per night (£116) while users in group C were shown hotels with an average price of $170 per night (£106). Home Depot served almost completely different products to users on desktops versus mobile devices. A desktop user searching Home Depot typically received 24 search results, with an average price per item of $120 (£75). In contrast, mobile users receive 48 search results, with an average price per item of $230 (£143). Many personalisation techniques are based on cookies. Cookies are small files stored on a user's computer or phone, filled with data about that particular person. They are used to set prices and show adverts, for example. Cookies are also used by sites such as Netflix (pictured) to personalise what films and shows are prioritised . Products were also 41 cents (25p) more expensive, on average, for Android users. ‘Initially, we assumed the sites would not personalise content, given the extremely negative PR that Amazon, Staples, and Orbitz received when earlier cases were revealed,’ continued the researchers. ‘To our surprise, this was not the case. Unfortunately, the business logic underlying much of this personalisation remains a mystery. Many personalisation techniques used by websites are based on cookies. Cookies are small files stored on a user's computer or phone, filled with data about that particular person. When a user visits a website that tracks cookies, the site scans this data to learn more about the potential customer. Websites legally have to inform users if they use cookies, and these cookies can be removed or disabled using a browser's settings. It isn't just used to set prices and show adverts, for example. The cookies are also used by sites such as Netflix to personalise what films and shows are prioritised. Some store login details so people don't have to enter their username and password each time they visit the site. ‘None of the discounts we located in our experiments were advertised on sites' homepages, so the deals do not appear to be part of marketing campaigns.’ Orbitz and Expedia confirmed the researcher’s findings, but did not explain why their websites are designed in this way. Travelocity confirmed it offers deals for mobile users, with the goal being to motivate them to use the site more and install the Travelocity app. ‘What is clear from our study is that price discrimination and steering on e-commerce sites is becoming more prevalent, and more sophisticated,’ added Assistant Professor Wilson. ‘As a user, it’s almost impossible to know if the prices you are being shown have been altered, or if cheaper products have been hidden from search results.’ The researchers advise searching for products in a desktop browser, or using a private or incognito browser window on a PC or mobile browser. This means companies don’t know what sites and products have previously been searched for, or how much users paid for items. It also means they don’t know what platform is being used to search the sites. ‘Companies are constantly experimenting with new personalisation techniques, so in the future, an entirely different attribute may trigger personalisation,’concluded the researchers. ‘Ultimately, we hope that our study will encourage companies to be more transparent about how they personalise prices and search results. ‘Rather than using opaque and creepy algorithms to secretly alter content, companies could stick to the kinds of real-world incentives that shoppers already know and love, like coupons and sales.’","Researchers studied prices on ten retail and six hotel and rental car sites .

"Finishing a project early and handing it in before it’s due might seem like a good idea, but a study claims there’s no benefit to doing so. In fact, researchers say that people don’t care if you finish scheduled work before a deadline - but they do care if it’s late. In the research they found that while breaking a promise was costly, exceeding it was not worth the additional effort. Researchers at the University of California and University of Chicago say breaking promises is more important than working hard and exceeding them (stock image shown). In research they found people were not impressed by overachievers. And they were very annoyed when a promise was not kept to . The study was carried out by Dr Ayelet Gneezy from the University of California at San Diego and Dr Nicholas Epley from the University of Chicago. Having plants in your office can make staff happier and more productive, researchers have claimed. They said a bit of greenery can boost productivity by 15% . Researchers say their study is the first to examine the effects of 'green' vs 'lean' or minimalist offices with little furniture. They studied the effects of greenery on staff's perceptions of air quality, concentration, and workplace satisfaction, and monitored productivity levels over subsequent months in two large commercial offices in the UK and The Netherlands. Lead researcher Marlon Nieuwenhuis, from Cardiff University's School of Psychology, said: 'Our research suggests that investing in landscaping the office with plants will pay off through an increase in office workers quality of life and productivity.' 'Simply enriching a previously Spartan space with plants served to increase productivity by 15% - a figure that aligns closely with findings in previously conducted laboratory studies. They examined people’s responses to a promise being broken, kept and exceeded. And they say this is due to people overvaluing kept promises, which suggests ‘a general tendency in social systems to discourage selfishness and reward cooperation,’ they write. In one of several experiments carried out by the researchers they paired up participants and tasked one with solving 40 puzzles. For each puzzle solved, they would receive a monetary reward. However the other in the pair, the ‘promise-maker’, was tasked to offer their help in solving ten of them. When the promise-maker exceeded their task by solving 15 puzzles, the promise-receivers did not value that much more than when they stuck to the original ten. However, when help was only offered on five puzzles, the promise-receiver viewed their partner much more negatively. A similar study, which gave participants better or worse seats to a concert, elicited similar responses. ‘Breaking one’s promise is costly, but exceeding it does not appear worth the effort,’ the researchers conclude. The study suggests that finishing a project early does not earn you much praise. But failing to stick to a deadline can prove to be much more costly. In one experiment people were not particularly impressed when concert tickets were upgraded, but were annoyed if they were downgraded (stock image shown)","Researchers at the University of California and University of Chicago say breaking promises is more important than exceeding them .

"A mysterious series of glowing 'rocks' spotted from New Mexico to Montana has been identified as a Russian spy satellite. Witnesses described it as three 'rocks' with glowing red and orange streaks and saw the bright object break apart as it moved slowly northward across the night sky. Experts today said it was part of a Russian spy satellite that fell from orbit and burned up over Colorado and Wyoming - even though Russian officials have denied the claims. This Animation of frames acquired by the Cloudbait Observatory at the DMNS Location clearly shows the south-to-north motion of the object . The object probably was a piece of Russia's Cosmos 2495 reconnaissance satellite, launched in May, said Charles Vick, an aerospace analyst with military information website Globalsecurity.org. Cosmos 2495 was designed to shoot reconnaissance photos and send the film back to Earth in capsules. It delivered film to Russia as intended, but some pieces of the craft remained in orbit until falling over the Rockies. They say it was part of a Russian spy satellite that fell from orbit and burned up over Colorado and Wyoming. More than three dozen witnesses filed reports about the unusual sighting, which happened around 10:30 p.m. MDT on Sept. 2. 'A meteor would have burned too quickly to be seen over such a vast area', said Mike Hankey, the American Meteor Society's operations manager. He added that fragments from the object were even big enough to show up as a weather event on radar just east of Cheyenne.

Cosmos 2495 was designed to shoot reconnaissance photos and send the film back to Earth in capsules. It delivered film to Russia as intended, but some pieces of the craft remained in orbit until falling over the Rockies, Vick said. The U.S. Strategic Command, responsible for American nuclear warfighting forces, confirmed that Cosmos 2495 re-entered the atmosphere and was removed from the U.S. satellite catalog Sept. 3. Social media has been full of unexplained sightings in recent weekends, including this one seen over the . The satellites are designed to keep an eye on the same things they kept an eye on during the Cold War, said John Pike, director of Globalsecurity.org. 'Deployed hardware, airplanes, ships, tanks, factories, new intelligence facilities, all that stuff,' he said. The satellites are looking for targets for their nuclear weapons, Pike said. What is it? The meteor was the latest in a string of unexplained sightings. This object light lit up the sky from the West Coast of the country to the East Coast last weekend . 'They're looking for the same things that our spy satellites are looking for.' Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, estimates that there are 98 operating spy satellites in orbit, launched by at least six nations. The mysterious series of glowing 'rocks' was spotted from New Mexico to Montana (pictured is Signal Mountain in Wyoming) Of those, 37 are from the United States, 30 from China and just three from Russia, he said. Many of those satellites are old, and probably half are in full operation, McDowell said. Gen. William L. Shelton, former head of the U.S. Space Command, has said about 1,100 satellites orbit the Earth, and the U.S. Defense Department operates fewer than 100. Russia has more than 100 satellites — including reconnaissance, weather and communications. Their military satellites have been operating normally, a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman told the ITAR-TASS news agency Sept. 9. 'One can only guess about the condition representatives of the so-called American Meteor Society were in when they identified a luminescent phenomenon high up in the sky as a Russian military satellite,' said the spokesman, Igor Konashenkov.","Witnesses described it as three 'rocks' with glowing red and orange streaks .

"The world's longest neutrino experiment has begun its probe into the mysteries of 'ghostly' particles that may hold the key to understanding the universe. The machine, called Nova, is made up of two huge detectors – placed 500 miles (800km) apart – to study one of nature's most elusive subatomic particles. Scientists believe that a better understanding of neutrinos, one of the most abundant and difficult-to-study particles, may lead to a clearer picture of the inner workings of the universe. Scroll down for video . The world's longest neutrino experiment has begun its probe into the mysteries of ghostly particles that may hold the key to understanding the universe.The machine, called Nova, is made up of two huge detectors – placed 500 miles (800km) apart – to study one of nature's most elusive subatomic particle . Using the world's most powerful beam of neutrinos, generated at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, the machine can precisely record a neutrinos tell-tale traces. Tiny and nearly mass-less, neutrinos are everywhere and about 100 trillion pass through us harmlessly each second. They were created by the Big Bang and form in the sun and our own bodies, but they move so fast and small that scientists have barely detected them for study. 'Of the known particles, the neutrinos as a group are the most oddball,' said Steven Ritz of the University of California, Santa Cruz. Neutrinos are a group because they come in three types, or ""flavours"",and they can shift from one type to another, but scientists don't quite know why. Nova's particle detectors were constructed in the path of the neutrino beam sent from Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois to Minnesota. Pictured is a view across the top of the Novafar detector in Ash River, Minnesota . Neutrinos interact so weakly with other matter that billions of them pass through our bodies every second without leaving a trace. They are the most mysterious of the known particles in the universe and could help unravel huge mysteries, such as why the cosmos is made of matter. But these elusive particles may also help scientists solve puzzles closer to home - including where exactly nuclear weapons are being made. Scientists at the College of Science at Virginia Tech are investigating just how accurate neutrinos are when detecting nuclear activity. It follows previous studies, such as a project by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory, that created prototype neutrino detectors to sniff out nuclear weapons. Neutrinos are produced by the decay of radioactive elements, and nuclear reactors produce large amounts of neutrinos that cannot be shielded or disguised. Measuring neutrino emissions allows scientists to know the plutonium content of a reactor from outside the building, according to the researchers. 'By making moderate improvements in existing neutrino-detector technology, we can fit a detector system into a standard 20ft (7 metre) shipping container to monitor the Iranian heavy water reactor at Arak as part of a non-proliferation measure,' said Patrick Huber, an associate professor of physics at Virgin Tech. If a neutrino is eventually beamed from Chicago, 'it starts out as a chocolate milkshake, but it's partly strawberry by the time it gets to South Dakota,' said Joe Lykken, a particle theorist at Fermi National Accelerator Lab. Neutrinos could give scientists clues about the mysterious dark matter of outer space and other strange astrophysical phenomena. Nova's particle detectors were both constructed in the path of the neutrino beam sent from Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, to northern Minnesota. The 300-ton near detector, installed underground at the laboratory, observes the neutrinos as they embark on their near-light-speed journey through the Earth. The 14,000-ton far detector spots those neutrinos after their 500-mile trip and allows scientists to analyse how they change over that long distance. For the next six years, Fermilab will send tens of thousands of billions of neutrinos every second in a beam aimed at both detectors, and scientists expect to catch only a few each day in the far detector, so rarely do neutrinos interact with matter. From this data, scientists hope to learn more about how and why neutrinos change between one type and another. The far detector in Minnesota is believed to be the largest free-standing plastic structure in the world, at 200ft (60 metres) long, 50ft (15 metres) high and 50ft (15 metres) wide. Both detectors are constructed from PVC and filled with a scintillating liquid that gives off light when a neutrino interacts with it. Fiber optic cables transmit that light to a computer, which creates 3D pictures of those interactions for scientists to analyse. Scientists will also probe the still-unknown masses of the three types of neutrinos in an attempt to determine which is the heaviest. This massive pivoting machine moves one block of the Nova far detector across the hall in Ash River, Minnesota, to connect it with the rest of the detector. Both detectors are constructed from PVC and filled with a scintillating liquid that gives off light when a neutrino interacts with it .

"Catalonians live for the weekend, which means that a Friday or Saturday night out lasts well into the following day - and beyond. For some peace and quiet in the mornings, the lofty Hotel Arts on the seafront keeps you away from the throng, but is still only a pleasant 40-minute walk from the historical centre. What’s more, the neatly curved, man-made beaches, crafted for the 1992 Olympics, are right on your doorstep. Up all night to get arty: Barcelona is a city that treats the idea of sleep as an optional extra . This formerly edgy industrial area has . responded brilliantly to the ultimate facelift. Promenade along the . waterfront on a Sunday and there are beach volleyball matches, surfers, . roller skaters, families looking their best, food stalls and a feeling . of festivity. Further along is the attractive old fishing village, La Barceloneta. This triangle of streets was built on land reclaimed from the sea in the 18th century. It’s now a buzzing area and a good spot for a cerveza (beer) in a local bar. Right next door is El Born, the famously hippy cultural enclave, where you can buy elegant jewellery from Spanish designer Helena Rohner, visit the Picasso Museum or admire the Gothic cathedral. The latter 13th-century wonder draws crowds who wander the vaulted interior with iPads before them like holy visions. I even see a monk snapping away with a digital SLR. The ceiling is misty with incense from the morning service, and the dark drama of the interior is enough to keep you on the straight and narrow. So, too, is the curious Frederic Mares Museum around the corner. This cavernous place, with a collection to rival the ultimate hoarder, is almost deserted. The first floor is given over to wooden crucifixes — an arresting sight. Then there are combs, cigarette cards, crowns, lanterns, ceramics, gold plates, pocket watches, canes, reliquaries and more. It is not for everyone. A city old and new: The Placa Reial at the heart of the Barri Gotic (left); the Hotel Arts on the waterfront (right) But Frederic Mares, a Barcelonian sculptor and a man of voracious energy who travelled widely, must have had deep pockets. A calmer option is the Picasso Museum. His avant-garde work is well known, but it is fascinating to see the early talent of the teenage painter. The museum is (unfashionably) arranged chronologically - and, as a result, is brilliant. The portrait of his father, painted in 1896 when Picasso would have been 15, is a sensitive masterwork. Then there are the attractive pastel landscapes which mark his time in Horta de Sant Joan, a village south-west of Barcelona; and the pigeon series (really), painted in 1957 in the South of France, and reminiscent of Matisse’s bright, patterned works. While on Barcelona’s artistic greats, it would be inconceivable to leave out the wildly imaginative Antonio Gaudi. His Sagrada Familia cathedral - set for completion in 2026 - is covered in cranes. But if you want to see a complete building, La Pedrera is the other favourite. We arrive early and are rewarded by no queues. People live in this curvaceous apartment building that is astonishing in its attention to detail and every bit as art nouveau as the sadly damaged Glasgow School of Art. Barcelona's waterfront was transformed from industrial zone to urban beach in time for the 1992 Olympics . The roof is like a surrealist desert painting by Giorgio de Chirico, and the interior is filled with lovely things - from a retro phone to specially designed floor tiles. The other great Barcelona tradition - aside from tapas - is brunch. You can snack in the Boqueria, the indoor food market that sells razor clams by the bushel, cured meat on a stick and freshly squeezed juices. Or make a day of it at the Hotel Arts - where it’s a five-course extravaganza - including cuttlefish risotto and eggs benedict followed by a deep snooze.

"Is crack-smoking Rob Ford actually in rehab? That is the question troubling Toronto after their embattled mayor decided to break his silence one week after taking a leave of absence to deal with alcohol and drug addiction. Despite declaring rehab to be 'amazing', citizens of Canada's largest city are dubious their mayor is where he says he is, with sightings of Ford around town reaching fevered level as members of the public upload pictures to Twitter. Indeed, by speaking to the media Ford has inadvertently fanned the flames of speculation as to his whereabouts, especially after the confusion surrounding his flight to Chicago. Scroll Down for Video . Where are you? Rob Ford is pictured above on May 1, a day after he announced his leave of absence. He has now spoken out about rehab, calling it the best thing he ever did . Reports suggested that Ford did fly to the United States to seek rehab as expected, but instead returned to Canada after withdrawing his application, after which the media lost track of the drug-addled mayor. And his apparent upbeat demeanor in Wednesday's interview, in which he compared rehab to his childhood football camp, just days after hitting rock bottom as sparked huge rumors on social media that he is not telling the truth. The very fact he is giving media interviews and claims to be calling constituents has caused many to doubt his claims of treatment, considering the strict conditions of entry imposed by many rehabilitation facilities. These usually include the removal of cell phones and for a period all contact with the outside world. Anyone seen him? These posters are beginning to spring up around Toronto as the city deals with the latest chapter in the Rob Ford saga . His refusal to give up his location too has led to doubt that he seeking help for his problems and ridicule online. 'Sounds like Ford is having an awesome time in rehab. Which (sic) exactly how I imagined week 1 of battling a serious alcohol addiction would be,' wrote one commenter to Twitter on Wednesday. However, Ford's brother, Doug, has refuted all claims the mayor is not in rehab. He told reporters on Tuesday that Rob Ford is 'in rehab facility, 100 percent,' but would not divulge where out of respect for the other patients. However, Doug Ford was also quoted by reporters as having said his brother is in a 'rehabilitation program.' Doug Ford told reporters his brother is not in any kind of out-patient program. Conflicting opinions: The citizens of Toronto are divided on whether or not Rob Ford is actually in rehab . Furthermore, Doug Ford claims he received a phone call from his brother's doctor on  Wednesday asking the media to calm down. However, while it is evident the media do not know where Rob Ford is, it is not clear what they are supposed to be backing off from. 'This is not about just Rob, this is about all the other patients. You can't put their jeopardy at stake here of their recovery,' said Doug Ford at Toronto's city hall on Wednesday. The frenzy about Ford's whereabouts hit new levels earlier this week when a young woman updated Twitter on Tuesday that she had seen the mayor at a Tim Horton's in Toronto's west end. She told CP24 on Wednesday she is adamant it was Rob Ford and that he changed his clothes in the coffee shop bathroom, . 'When he went into the store he was wearing a black suit but when he came out he was wearing a grey, track suit,' she said. Two Tim Horton's workers also told CBC News they saw him. Rash of sightings: Cayla Clarkson reported to Twitter that she had seen the embattled mayor in a Tim Hortons . Again, rushing to his brother's aid, Doug Ford told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that it was actually him at the Tim Hortons and not Rob Ford. 'That was me at the Junction. That was me that pulled over,' said Councillor Ford at city hall Wednesday. 'I was taking pictures and handing out T-shirts. That was me on my way down here. So, please, do your due diligence.' Adding to the speculation as to Rob Ford's whereabouts was Aaron Spivak, a hockey player who tweeted he saw the mayor in Richmond Hill and uploaded a picture. Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, a Ford family ally said that Toronto deserves to know where its mayor is. 'I would say to you right now that at the very least the city should know the city that he's in for treatment, and with some verification that he is in fact being treated,' he said. Driving: This picture of a man with a resemblance to Rob Ford taken in Richmond Hills was uploaded to Twitter on Wednesday . Speaking from his undisclosed location, Ford said that there's no timeline for his return to office, but Ford has assured his supporters he'll be back in time to gain re-election later this year. 'Of course, I am coming back and I am going to kick butt,' he told the newspaper. 'I will be on the ballot for mayor in October, guaranteed, and I will do well.' He joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' Ford said the rehab center treats 'addictions to alcohol and other things' and is 'worth every penny.' After a week of being clean and sober, the mayor said he's starting to come to terms with what has happened over the past year but he said he is hopeful he can right his wrongs. Back to drugs: Ford's announcement follows the emergence of yet another video showing him smoking what appears to be crack. A still from the new video released by the Globe and Mail, above . 'At first, I was mad. I was mad at myself and saying, ""Why me?""' he told the Sun. 'But then I realized it could have been a whole lot worse.' He said the very public fall from grace was possibly what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better.' Ford refused to reveal the name of the treatment center he's checked into, out of respect for the other patients, and he wouldn't even confirm it was in Canada. He said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city pub. He said he woke up and 'I told Dougie, 'I am going away' and then started looking up rehab and treatment centers.' Infamous: Since the original crack video scandal, Ford has been the center of scandal after scandal. Pictured at a news conference with wife Renata (left) on November 14 . Ford told the Sun his family knows where he is and he's been speaking to his children regularly, though they don't know why he's getting help. He said the past week has been tough but he described going into rehab as the 'best decision' he has ever made and said he wishes he'd done it sooner. 'I said to myself, ""Am I going to try to cover it up for the rest of your life or deal with it and go to professional help?""' Ford recalled. 'I decided to get help.' Ford's lawyer said last week that the mayor had left Toronto for rehab after a video surfaced that appeared to show him smoking a crack pipe late last month — nearly a year after reports of an initial video that appeared show him smoking the drug. The last time Ford visited the United States was in early March, when he appeared on the ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" television show in Los Angeles. 'The most important thing, everyone who is concerned if he's in rehab, the answer is yes,' Doug Ford told the AP. 'As for his whereabouts that's personal and that should stay with Rob.' Getting help: The mayor is seeking treatment for alcohol addition. Pictured above arriving at his home early Thursday morning after announcing his leave of absence . Doug Ford said he has spoken with his brother since he entered the program and that he is doing well. 'He's feeling great actually. He's feeling good. He's bought into the program and he's getting the support he needs,' Doug Ford said. City councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong said Doug Ford spoke to Rob again on Tuesday and the mayor was on the phone when Doug passed the phone to him. Minnan-Wong said the mayor is in 'good spirits' and is 'working out.' 'He told me he was in rehab,' Minnan-Wong said. 'I think Rob misses council and he would like to be here.' Shelley Carroll, a Toronto city councilor, said Ford's location should be made public. 'I'm not buying that it can't be divulged,' Carroll said. Councilor Giorgio Mammoliti said the mayor should provide a doctor's note.","Toronto public question why Rob Ford is giving interviews to the media from rehab .

"The Gredos mountains situated between the Avila, Caceres and Salamanca provinces in Castille, central Spain, are something of a secret. Certainly none of my friends have heard of this lovely spot, crossed by the Duero and Tajo rivers, and only two hours west of Madrid. ‘What people do not realise about Gredos,’ says Maria Elena Dendaluce, who runs her own horse riding company here, with sparky energy, ‘is that this is not typical Castille — not flatlands.’ It is a place with open landscape, snow-capped mountains and a special quality to the light. Pastoral perfection: The Sierra de Gredos is one of Spain's less known, and yet most beautiful, areas . I’m staying in Spain’s first Parador, as a base for a three-day riding trip and general explore. It is a  comfortable hunting lodge, built in 1928, in Castilian granite, by King Alfonso XIII. It still attracts well-heeled Spanish hunters who are allowed to shoot Ibex in the mountains. And it was in this hotel that the post-Franco government drew up the Spanish constitution. What overwhelms me about Gredos is the peace. I once read an article claiming yellow helps lift depression. If that’s true, then Gredos must trump Prozac. Yellow broom gilds the mountains (there are 12 different varieties). And, at Easter, villagers even decorate their houses with the stuff. In the saddle: The rivers and bridges of the Sierra de Gredos make the perfect setting for equine adventure . Gredos is a . destination for road cyclists, mountaineers, para gliders, . bird-watchers and astronomers (it has recently secured ‘dark sky’ status . for its unpolluted atmosphere). It is also ideal for active families as . well as those who like to do nada. And, it is perfection for horse riders. Before saddling up, I walk beside the Tormes river. There were glaciers here 12,000 years ago, and today, wild flowers abound: asphodel, white heather and crimson orchids. I’m with Juan Francisco Redondo Sanchez, a botanist who knows his mushrooms - of which Gredos boasts 350 varieties. In autumn, you can pick them by the kilo. The sun shines on Equiberia’s stables and its well-schooled horses (Andalucians, Arabs, crosses). The rides are for ‘experienced but not necessarily expert’ riders, and I’m delighted with Arturo, my Andalucian bay -  the equivalent of a handsome bachelor who dines out often. Tucking in: Even the horses join in with the holiday spirit . Most rides last a week and go through pine forests, cross the Tormes and stop at Barbellido gorge with its 14th-century bridge (some of us brave a swim). When the horses push through the broom, the sweet scent of vanilla is released. Nothing is more calming than listening as we ride: cow-bells, the size of small saucepans, sound like someone doing gentle washing up, leather saddles creak and the ‘ssshh’ of flowing water is soporific. You ride for five hours a day with aperitif stops. A table with a white cloth is laid with almonds, cherries, cured hams and local wine - all this before an excellent lunch. On the last day, an exhilarating gallop ends beside Laguna Canada del Gallo, surrounded by snow-capped mountains. We feel we have dismounted in paradise and the sublime picnic that materialises out of Roberto Garcia’s black van proves it. Ride . World Wide (0183782544, www.rideworldwide.com) offers seven-night rides . from £1,410 per person - including riding, twin hotel accommodation, most meals, . mid-morning aperitifs, and airport transfers to Madrid.

"Scotland's Highland Council has shocked locals and visitors with a proposed 'tourist tax' on overnight stays as part of a plan to slash regional spending by £64million. The controversial proposition to charge a fee, which could be £1 per room per night, is just one of many money-saving motions being considered as the local authority attempts to balance its books. The 'tourist tax' would be imposed at hotels, guesthouses and B&Bs, and the levy would be used to pay for infrastructure used by holidaymakers. Highland Council has shocked locals and visitors by announcing a proposed 'tourism tax' on overnight stays . The £1 per night per room tax would be imposed at hotels, guesthouses and B&Bs in the region . However, the Scottish government and tourism body, VisitScotland, aren't so sure that it would be beneficial. They fear that the tax could badly damage the Highlands' tourism industry, which is largely considered to be the area's lifeblood. Local Councillor Maxine Smith said: 'This is going out to consultation to see if it's something that the public would be favourable towards. 'If so, we would have talks with the Scottish government to get permission to go ahead.' Tourism agency VisitScotland and the Scottish government are urging the council to drop the idea . Tourism is vital to the Highlands' economy and critics fear such a tax would have a  negative impact . But VisitScotland has already publicly urged the council to drop the idea. Regional director, Scott Armstrong, said: 'The introduction of this tax would be detrimental to the tourism industry and is not something we would support.' Tourism is hugely important to the Scottish economy and especially to the Highlands, where millions of visitors flock to from all over the world every year. Mr Armstrong added: 'An initiative like this is likely to resort in higher prices for visitors and have a negative impact on the sector.' Stewart Nicol, chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, agrees: 'I understand the challenges being faced by the council, but I am not sure that a tourism tax would be an appropriate way of raising finance.' Mr Nicol also pointed out that many tourism-focused businesses already pay a levy through the Inverness and Loch Ness Tourism Business Improvement District. 'This idea means that we would not be looking for ways to develop tourism business or the experience in the Highlands,' he added. 'It is a way to pay for services that are already there.' Willie Cameron, of Loch Ness Marketing, said he is against a tax being administered by the council. He added that if such a scheme was allowed it should be run by communities with the money going towards local initiatives to improve tourism. Currently, tourist-focused businesses in the Highlands already pay a levy. Pictured: Aberdeen Harbour . David Richardson, development manager of the Federation of Small Businesses, also spoke out against the proposed tax: 'The FSB understands the challenges faced by Highland Council. However, where a tourism tax has been discussed elsewhere in Scotland, specifically Edinburgh, it has consistently been rejected.' Mr Richardson also questions how such a tax could be administered cost-effectively and fairly, where the money would be spent, and what the impact would be on local businesses in terms of their long-term competitiveness in the tourism sector. 'These are the sorts of questions that need to be answered before this proposal can go any further,' he said. Aberdeen and Edinburgh have rejected similar proposals. Pictured: Loch Shin, Sutherland . Four years ago, Aberdeen City Council included plans for a bed tax on hotels in its draft budget - but the idea was quickly dropped after hotel operators said it could put them out of business. As of now, the Scottish government does not see such a Highlands 'tourism tax' moving forward. A spokeswoman for the government said: 'The Scottish government has no plans to add any new tax burdens on the tourism sector and there are no existing legal powers for local authorities to levy a local bed tax or tourism tax. 'We would not support the introduction of new taxes on tourists.'","Fee proposed at £1 per room per night on all hotels and B&Bs .

"Scroll down for video . Tiger Woods’ ex-wife Elin Nordegren has taken the uncharacteristic move of speaking out in public and talked about the hurdles in her personal life after being selected as the commencement speaker for her college graduation. The Swedish model-turned-American citizen graduated with a degree in psychology from Rollins College in Florida after working through classes over the past nine years. Nordegren, who is notoriously private and shied away from the media during the fallout of Woods’ cheating scandal and their ensuing divorce, talked about how her academic pursuits ‘offered me a place of peace in the wild storm of my personal life’. Honored: Elin Nordegren was selected as the Hamilton Holt Outstanding Senior and gave the commencement speech at Rollins College on Saturday . The 34-year-old mother-of-two spoke about  the changes that have swirled around her during her pursuit of her degree. She said that when she started studying as part of the school’s evening program, she ‘was married without children. Today nine years later, I'm a proud American with two beautiful children, but I am no longer married.’ ‘Many of us, like myself, took a long time to graduate,’ she said. ‘If I can inspire even one mom to go back and get her degree with the message that it's never too late, then I am happy. College graduate: Nordegren now has a degree in psychology from Rollins College . Turbulent times: Nordegren, now 34, talked about how she was married without kids when she started her degree nine years ago and now is divorced and has two children . ‘When you told me stories about your full-time day jobs, about coming home to cook dinner for your families, and about making sure your children were cared for while you were attending classes, you inspired me. Hints: There were several points in the speech where Nordegren referred to her widely-publicized split from Tiger Woods . ‘Whatever obstacle I was facing at the time, your stories and sharing helped me put things in perspective.’ She went on to talk about how certain classes came at pivotal times in her personal life, like how she was enrolled in a class on developmental psychology when her now-5-year-old daughter Sam Alexis was born. Other classes, however, came at more chaotic times in her life. ‘It was right after I had taken communication in the media, I was unexpectedly thrust into the media limelight. I probably should have taken more notes in that class!’ she said in allusion to the cheating scandal that was exposed in late 2009 leading to her 2010 divorce from the golf superstar. ‘My psychology in law class helped me through one of the most challenging times of my life that involved legal matters.’ Nordegren was selected as the commencement speaker when she was awarded the school’s top honor of being named the Hamilton Holt Outstanding Senior. Family support: Elin was flanked by her father and her children, daughter Sam and son Charlie, during the Saturday ceremony . Timely: Though she was not spotted at the ceremony, Elin paid tribute to her mother- a governor in her home country of Sweden- in honor of Mother's Day on Sunday . Getting along: Nordegren (in the black hat and blue shirt) was recently seen at one of her children's games sitting alongside her ex and his new girlfriend Lindsey Vonn . She wrapped up her eloquent speech with a timely tribute to all of the mothers in the audience, saying that she drew inspiration from her own mother, Barbro Holmberg. ‘My mother waited to put her career in a higher gear so that she could be with me and my siblings when we were little. She showed me that it is possible to have a career later in life, and today she's a governor in Sweden,’ Elin said. ‘My hope is that today I am showing my children, Sam and Charlie- who is sleeping in his chair, that it is never too late to follow your dream.’","Tiger Woods' ex was given the Outstanding Senior Award and spoke at her Rollins College commencement ceremony on Saturday .

The tests were designed to show how Brimstone’s dual mode Semi-Active Laser and Active mmW radar seekers work in tandem to ensure direct hits, even against high speed and maneuvering targets. MBDA, the firm which makes the missile, says that when launched from a drone, 'Brimstone can now provide reaper crews with a weapon that reduces collateral damage risk and demonstrates first pass, single shot lethality against high speed maneuvering targets on land and at sea and in complex environments.' an artist's impression of the missile in flight: It has already been used in Afghanistan and Libya by UK forces .

"Never-before-seen private letters from Jackie Kennedy have revealed her despair over JFK’s wandering eye. In missives sent to Joseph Leonard, a Vincentian priest in Dublin, between 1950 and 1964, she likens her husband’s womanizing to that of her father, John ‘Black Jack’ Vernou Bouvier. In one of her earlier letters to Leonard in 1952, she said of JFK: ‘He’s like my father in a way – loves the chase and is bored with the conquest – and once married needs proof he’s still attractive, so flirts with other women and resents you. I saw how that nearly killed Mummy.’ Private letters: Jackie Kennedy pictured with Father Joseph Leonard in Dublin, Ireland, in 1950. They would only meet once more before he died in 1964, but their 14-year correspondence would shed fresh light on Jackie's most private thoughts . Never seen before: Philip Sheppard of Sheppard's Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, says that the letters came from 'a private source' The letters, all handwritten on personalized stationery, also offer fascinating insight into her early days among Washington D.C.’s smart set and even before. In on she described her breakup after a brief engagement to John Husted, the man she was supposed to marry in 1952. 'I’m ashamed that we both went into it so quickly and gaily but I think the suffering it brought us both for awhile afterwards was the best thing,' she wrote. 'We both needed something of shock to make us grow up.' In 1953, the year she married JFK, she wrote: 'Maybe I’m just dazzled and picture myself in a glittering world of crowned heads and Men of Destiny – and not just a sad little housewife . . . 'That world can be very glamorous from the outside - but if you're in it - and you're lonely -  it could be a Hell' 'That world can be very glamorous from the outside – but if you’re in it – and you're lonely – it could be a Hell.' She says that her relationship with JFK had given her ‘an amazing insight on politicians – they really are a breed apart,’ and admitted that he was consumed by ambition ‘like Macbeth.’ But despite her fears over JFK's womanizing ways, Jackie tells Leonard in 1954: ‘I love being married much more than I did even in the beginning.’ At one point she describes her mother-in-law Rose Kennedy, 'I don’t think Jack’s mother is too bright – and she would rather say a rosary than read a book.' Young love: JFK and Jackie pictured in the early days of their courtship. At this point, Jackie was already writing to Leonard, likening her future husband's womanizing ways to those of her father . Newlyweds: The couple married in 1953. A year later, Jackie writes in a letter to Leonard: 'I love being married much more than I did even in the beginning' Letters . following JFK’s tragic assassination in 1963 reveal the extent of her . heartbreak, to the extent that she even questioned her Catholic faith. 'God will have a bit of explaining to do to me if I ever see Him' She . admitted to Leonard that she had become 'bitter against God,' although, . she added, 'I have to think there is a God – or I have no hope of . finding Jack again.' 'I think God must have taken Jack to show the world how lost we would be without him,' she wrote, even injecting a note of humor. 'But that is a strange way of thinking to me – and god will have a bit of explaining to do to me if I ever see him.' Jackie met Leonard in 1950, when she was 21 and he was 73. She and her step-brother, Hugh Dudley Auchincloss III, toured Europe during the summer and her step uncle, W.S. Lewis, who had met Leonard in the 1920s, recommended they meet up with the priest. They would only meet in person once more, when she and JFK (then a U.S. senator) travelled to Dublin in 1955. Over the years he wrote her back and would send her books. 'It seems to me you know everything and from all you’ve read and learned you can pick and choose the most lovely things for me,' she wrote. 'Does it give you a sense of power to think you’re molding someone else mind and taste? I hope it does and certainly no one ever had a more willing piece of putty to work with.' Shaken faith: Jackie, pictured with her young children at JFK's funeral in November 1963, shares her heartbreak with Leonard, admitting that she had become 'bitter against God' Despite the fact they only met once the affection in their . correspondence is clear to see. Jackie addresses Leonard as ‘Father L’, . and each letter is signed off, ‘XO’. She concluded one letter to him: ‘I REALLY must stop now Father L — but bushels, barrels carts & lorry loads of love to YOU — Jacqueline. XO.’ The 33 letters will be auctioned at Sheppard’s Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, on June 10th, along with an enagement announcement, a Christmas card signed by both Jackie and JFK and a note of condolence that she sent to Leonard’s rectory after his death at the age of 87 in 1964. The collective archive is expected to fetch over €1million. Longstanding friendship: Father Leonard and Jackie, pictured in 1950 during their initial meeting, corresponded faithfully over the course of 15 years . Philip Sheppard of Sheppard’s Irish Auction House in Durrow, Co Laois, says that the letters came from ‘a private source’ and told The Irish Times: . ‘They are, in effect, her autobiography for the years 1950-1964.’ He added that they include ‘simply astounding fresh insights that transform our understanding of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.’","The letters were sent to Joseph Leonard, a Vincentian priest in Dublin, between 1950 and 1964 .

"'We should get it wright': Lord Patten admitted the BBC review is a result of complaints of bias . A BBC review of ‘the breadth of opinion’ reflected in its coverage of immigration, religion and the EU was triggered by complaints of liberal bias, Lord Patten has admitted. The BBC Trust chairman said the investigation had been ‘prompted’ by accusations that elements of the broadcaster’s news, current affairs and factual programming had been unbalanced. The move could signal a greater range of voices and experts being included. In a speech to the Broadcasting Press Guild, Lord Patten said: ‘It’s an acceptance that these are areas where people  are particularly concerned that we should get it right. ‘We’ve been criticised in those areas and we think it’s very important to listen to  that criticism, not necessarily because it’s right but because it reflects real and interesting concerns.’ The BBC has repeatedly been accused of taking a ‘pro-Europe’ approach to its coverage of issues facing the EU. Similarly its reporting of immigration has been questioned, with some critics claiming it has tried to underplay the arguments against mass migration. Even former director general Mark Thompson conceded that the BBC had been ‘reticent talking about immigration’. The new review will be published in 2013 and will take in audience research and views from the industry, as well as analysing content of programmes. BBC Trustee David Liddiment said: ‘The BBC’s reputation for and commitment to impartiality is part of its DNA. 'This review will help to ensure it continues to meet audience expectations in this area, looking at how the BBC builds an understanding of breadth of opinion into its approach to its journalism. Bias: The review of the BBC is a result of accusations that elements of its news, current affairs and factual shows has been unbalanced . ‘Part of the review will look at coverage of immigration, religion and the EU – not because we are anticipating a problem there, but because they are subjects on which there are obviously a range of opinions and which will make a valuable contribution to the review.’ The BBC Trust, the broadcaster’s governing body, conceded that if the review uncovered issues then it would lead to ‘behavioural change’ in programming. Led by former ITV and Sky executive Stuart Prebble, the review will investigate whether the broadcaster is doing ‘all it can’ to ensure impartiality. Mr Prebble will investigate whether decisions to ‘include or omit perspectives in news and current affairs coverage have been reasonable and carefully reached’. New move: The probe into the practices of the BBC will be published in 2013 . He will also look at whether ‘due weight’ was given to a range of perspectives. The new investigation will also ‘check up’ on the progress the BBC has made on the recommendations in a 2007 report which examined the impact of social and technological change on impartiality. In a statement, the BBC Trust said: ‘The review will focus on the BBC’s news, current affairs and factual output. ‘The content analysis will include an analysis of the BBC’s coverage of immigration, religion and the EU, by comparing some coverage from 2007 with coverage from 2012/13.’ It insisted that views held by the minority should not necessarily be given the same weight as the ‘prevailing consensus’. The review will assess phone-in interviews and user-generated content to see whether they are given ‘appropriate significance’ and whether the use of such material is balanced. Recent reviews have examined issues including the corporation’s coverage of science and the Arab Spring.","Lord Patten admits the investigation into the BBC's practices was triggered by complaints .

"Think of a jetpack and you may imagine flying over a futuristic city, inspired by scenes  in sci-fi films. But the technology could also be used to enable soldiers to run faster in warzones in a matter of years. US engineers have created a working prototype that attaches to people's backs and helps them to run a mile in a much shorter space of time – despite carrying the large metal pack. The project is the military's latest effort to create exoskeletons for US soldiers to give them super-human strength, speed and other advantages on the battlefield. Scroll down for video . Full metal jacket: US engineers have created a working prototype jetpack (pictured) that attaches onto a person’s back and helps them run a mile faster – despite carrying the large metal pack . The goal behind Arizona State University’s 4MM (four minute mile) project is to enhance the speed and agility of the wearer of a jetpack so they can run a four minute mile with ease. Jason Kerestes, an engineering student at the university explained: ‘We reduced the amount of force so we’re not able to fly with our jet pack but we have instantaneous thrust and can trigger it to allow for faster movements.’ He and his mentor are working with the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) to develop the idea for military purposes. The goal behind Arizona State University’s 4MM (four minute mile) project is to enhance the speed and agility of the wearer of a jetpack so they can run a four minute mile with ease. In 200 metre trials, runners decreased their times and used less energy, the experts said. The equipment they have developed is pictured . ‘Our goal is to get any soldier – or subject wearing the jetpack – to be able to run a four minute mile, who was not capable of doing so before,’ he said. When Mr Kerestes and his mentor Professor Thomas Sugar were first asked by Darpa to design a way to allow soldier to run faster without using any more effort, they experimented with a system allowing a person to be pulled along, but quickly settled on a jetpack for propulsion. Currently, a volunteer wearing the pack can shave seconds off their best time – despite carrying the 11lbs (5kg) metal pack. In one test, a runner was able to reduce their personal best for a mile from five minutes 20 seconds, to five minutes and two seconds. In 200 metre trials, runners decreased their times and used less energy, the experts said. Mr Kerestes said: ‘In the warfare arena this [the ability to run faster] could be the difference between life and death.’ ‘Devices can help soldiers succeed in their missions and potentially save human lives.’ Mr Kerestes said: ‘In the warfare arena this [the ability to run faster] could be the difference between life and death.’ Here, a soldier from the US Army runs across open ground to avoid sniper fire in Afghanistan . The U.S. Special Operations Command has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films like Iron Man (pictured) The Tactical Assault Light Operator Suit (Talos) would effectively give its wearer superpowers, such as the ability to see in the dark, super-human strength and a way of deflecting bullets, but its is a work in progress. The U.S. Special Operations Command (Ussocom) has called on scientists to develop a suit reminiscent of the one seen in the films that uses nanotechnology. Such a suit would probably build upon work done by an MIT professor who is developing 'liquid armour', which captured the imagination of U.S. armed forces scientists who are looking for a way of protecting their troops from intensive combat situations in Iraq and Afghanistan. At a conference in May 2013, U.S. Navy Admiral Bill McRaven challenged scientists to build a suit that would function as a 'practical exoskeleton' and protect soldiers from shrapnel and bullets using Kevlar and nanotechnology. He said that the suit should be light enough for soldiers to wear in battle but also suitable for surveillance missions and the idea has captured people's imaginations - as seen in the animated video below. Once fully developed, the armour could transform from a more liquid form to a solid in a fraction of a second under the influence of a magnetic field or electric current as well as being able to monitor a soldier's heart rate, hydration levels and core temperature, Dvice reported. It is thought a suit would respond to the data, supplied by an on-board computer hooked up to sensors, to keep a soldier in the best conditions for battle. Ussocom has asked academics, entrepreneurs and private laboratories to submit white papers detailing how its Talos suit could be built and how they could help make their designs a reality, while other reports suggest that Google Glass could be utilised to provide soldiers with information on the battle field. Exoskeletons to give people super-human strength and night vision already exist, but the challenge is building the technology into a lightweight suit.","Engineers from Arizona State University have created a working prototype jetpack that attaches to a soldier's back and helps them run faster .

"One morning single mother Lucy Rocca awoke in a hospital bed with no recollection of how she'd got there. The shocking truth was the then 35 year old had collapsed on her doorstep the night before while smoking a cigarette after downing three bottles of wine. She was rushed to A&E thanks to a friend who happened to be passing her house in Sheffield and spotted her slumped body. Beat the booze: Lucy Rocca says she's happier now she no longer drinks and wants to help other people beat alcohol addiction . The fact that she had drunk so much on a night at home alone was not unusual. Lucy told the MailOnline she had become accustomed to drinking two to two-and-half bottles of wine on an evening at home or when out with friends. But her trip to hospital was the wake up call she needed to change her ways. She said: 'I grew up with the Nineties ladette culture. Going out and getting drunk was the norm in my twenties and continued into my thirties. I could never have just one or two drinks. 'As I got older and had a daughter and then divorced, drinking became a coping mechanism for stress release. Some nights I would drink more than two bottles of wine. 'Waking up in hospital was the wake up call I needed. I couldn't carry on the way I was' Lucy realised she had become too dependent on alcohol and sought help for her addiction. However, aside from Alcoholics Anonymous, which she didn't want to join, she found there was little support for women like her. Hitting the bottle: An increasing number of women aged 30-50 are dependent on alcohol to cope with modern life (posed by model) She said: 'The AA works for some people but you have to commit to attending meetings and as a single mum, I couldn't do that. It wasn't right for me, especially as I didn't feel I had a hardcore addiction.' With the support of a friend, who also gave up alcohol at the same time and a new partner, Lucy was able to beat her addiction. She said: 'I found other activities to fill my time. I stopped going to the pub and I took up running which became my stress release. I broke the habits I had formed around drinking.' Lucy found the more she avoided alcohol the better she felt about herself and she became a better parent to her daughter, now aged 14. She said: 'It wasn't a case of her . being neglected. She rarely saw me drunk as it was always in the . evenings but it still had an insidious effect. I was always hungover so I . was grumpy and had no energy to do things like help her with her . homework or take her swimming. I was always muddling through with a . hangover. I'm a much better parent now.' Problem: Some users seeking help from the website Soberistas, many of whom are mothers, are consuming two to three bottles of wine a night . But Lucy, now 37, still found the process . of battling the bottle could sometimes be a lonely experience. She began . to write a blog in April 2011 sharing her feelings and then the idea . was born to launch a website where people like her could come together . and support one another. She launched Soberistas last November as a place for 'people who . are trying to resolve their problematic drinking patterns, and people . who have successfully kicked the booze'. A . forum, blog and articles offering advice and support are all available . to members - many of whom are middle-aged, middle class mothers. More . than 1,500 members have already signed up and Lucy . believes 90 per cent of them are mothers aged 30-50 who are in a similar . place to where she once was. As . well as increasing their risk of a drunken accident that could result . in them waking up in hospital like Lucy did two years ago, these women . are also in . danger of ruining their long-term health with alcohol abuse raising . their chance of getting a serious illness like liver disease. Support: The website aims to help people via their forum, blog and articles . The . Soberistas forum is also rife with the experiences of those who have . lost their jobs or damaged their relationships with friends and family . due to their alcohol dependency. The NHS recommend that women should . not regularly drink more than 2 to 3 units of alcohol a day. But many . are exceeding these guidelines on nights out or when drinking alone at . home. Soberistas aims to . help these people by giving them a place where they can 'talk, write, . offload, and share' their experiences with like-minded people. Lucy, who no longer drinks any . alcohol, hopes the website can help people create a better life for . themselves like she has done. She said: 'You can't stay that way, you have to have an open mind to change and open yourself up to new experiences. 'I enjoy not drinking now, I have . grown as a person and discovered there is much more to life than getting . drunk. I don't miss drinking at all.'","Drinking to excess was the norm for mother Lucy Rocca in her twenties and thirties .

She found there was little support to help her kick the habit so she set up her own website, Soberistas, where addicts can meet to  'resolve their problematic drinking patterns'

"Anti-discrimination campaigners Kick It Out have criticised Wigan for appointing Malky Mackay as manager before the Football Association have finished their investigation into his conduct and have called on the governing body to reveal their findings. Sportsmail broke the news that the FA had been handed a dossier of evidence accusing Mackay and Iain Moody of sending a shocking series of racist, anti-semitic, sexist and homophobic text messages in August. But Mackay, the former Cardiff manager, has been handed a route back into football just three months later after he was appointed as Wigan manager – while the FA's investigation is still on-going. VIDEO Scroll down to see Dave Whelan defend the appointment of Malky Mackay . Anti-discrimination campaigners Kick It Out have criticised Malky Mackay's appointment as Wigan boss . Mackay (left) is unveiled as the new manager at the DW Stadium by club chairman Dave Whelan . Malky Mackay will be a controversial appointment at Wigan, definitely, but he does have a proven track record as a manager at Championship level. He took Watford into the Premier League through the play-offs and was promoted with Cardiff too, as well as taking them to the League Cup final when they were unlucky to lose to Liverpool. Mackay is a big manager for Wigan and I’m sure he won’t give us a bad name. We are a small team and we’ve always punched above our weight. I think he deserved a second chance and it’s a good appointment. I don’t think there will be any protests by our fans on Saturday. There may be some chants from the away end but no complaints from us. A Kick It Out spokesman said: 'The Football Association began investigating in August alleged racist, anti-semitic, sexist and homophobic comments made by Malky Mackay and Iain Moody, and we are still yet to hear whether this is near to reaching its conclusion almost three months on. 'Where does the case now lie and how close are we to seeing whether The FA will take the appropriate action? 'Wigan Athletic have disregarded the on-going investigation being undertaken by The FA, and any potential punishment Mackay may face, by taking the decision to appoint him. 'We need to see leadership, and a respect for the processes in place, shown by football club owners to demonstrate how seriously they take tackling issues of exclusion, prejudice and discrimination.' The scandal cost Moody his job as Crystal Palace's director of football and caused Mackay to pull out of the running for the Palace managers job. Mackay is under investigation by the Football Association over alleged offensive text messages sent to Iain Moody (left) when they worked together at Cardiff City . Wigan chairman Dave Whelan (right) said he believes Mackay 'deserves a fair hearing' But Kick It Out have been left bemused by Wigan owner Dave Whelan's decision to put Mackay in charge of the club. 'It remains to be seen if Wigan’s position is one which the FA and all of football’s so-called ‘family’ are happy with,' the spokesman added. 'The FA now needs to move swiftly to let everybody know whether they agree with Wigan’s position or whether they will reinforce their own zero-tolerance stance on all such matters of equality and diversity. We await The FA’s response before commenting further.'","Kick It Out criticised Wigan after Malky Mackay announced as manager .

"Two of the three people who died when a hot air balloon burst into flames shortly after takeoff Friday night have been identified as coaches for the University of Richmond women's basketball team. Natalie Lewis, 24, the director of basketball operations, and associate head coach Ginny Doyle, 44, died along with their still-unidentified pilot after the horrific accident, authorities said. Doyle tweeted earlier in the day that their takeoff was initially scheduled for the morning but pushed back due to fog before later writing 'getting ready to go up' only minutes before she died when the balloon she was in burst into flames. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'Getting ready to go up!': Natalie Lewis (left) and Ginny Doyle (right) pictured the morning before their deadly balloon flight in a foggy test run. The pilot pictured here was not the one who went up with them on Friday afternoon . Awaiting her final ride: Doyle pictured alone in front of the hot air balloon's basket . Dead too soon: The 24-year-old Lewis shown not long before dying . The two women were originally supposed to liftoff in one of three balloons scheduled for a 6.30 a.m. voyage, Doyle said on Twitter. That trip was delayed until around 4.00 p.m. because of heavy fog. 'Getting ready to go up!' Doyle tweeted at 3.45 p.m. along with a picture of her and Lewis in front of the balloon that would eventually take their lives. Their balloon was one of three in the air at the time of the incident, according to the Henrico Citizen. The first two landed, but they struck a power line and burst into flames. Horrified onlookers heard the women screaming for help as they desperately jumped from the basket to escape the flames. 'Help me, help me, sweet Jesus, help. I'm going to die. Oh my God, I'm going to die,' witnesses reported hearing one of them scream as the basket and balloon separated. The remains of both the pilot and Doyle have been found, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Lewis' remains have not yet been found, but her parents have arrived from Buffalo, New York, to help in the search effort despite teams suspending operations until Sunday due to darkness, the paper reported. 'The search continues for our beloved daughter and we remain hopeful and ask for your continued prayers,' parents Patricia and Evan Lewis Sr. said in a statement. The doomed flight was part of a VIP event Friday night meant to kick off the first balloon festival in the region in decades, according to the Times-Dispatch. Fiery crash: This hot air balloon carrying at least three people caught fire mid-flight and went down in Virginia . Frantic: The pilot reportedly started taking the necessary security precautions like trying to open the top of the balloon because the fire would cause the balloon to travel higher faster . Before the split: At one point after the explosion, the basket and the balloon separated . 'Because of . the time that has transpired since the hot air balloon crash Friday . evening and the fact that we have not been able to make any contact with . any of the three occupants that were in the hot air balloon we are now . transitioning from a rescue operation to a recovery operation at this . time,' State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said Saturday morning. Under investigation: Heidi Moats, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator, briefed on the recovery operation Saturday afternoon . The discovery of the second body came a few hours after the press conference. 'Just before midnight we were able to locate one of the occupants. 'We . do know who was on the - the two passengers and the pilot- we have been . in contact with their families overnight but at this point we are not . going to identify which one of those occupants has been recovered.' Heidi Moats, a National Transportation Safety Board investigator, briefed on the recovery operation Saturday afternoon. The names of the individuals have not been officially released, but local newspaper The Henrico Citizen has reported that the two passengers were members of the University of Richmond women's basketball coaching staff. The team's website names the male head coach and five female assistant coaches. The . incident took place at around 8pm at the Meadow Event Park in Caroline . County - the site of the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival. An . eyewitness reported seeing one or two balloons drifting into power . lines and bursting into flames in the skies over Carmel Church Road. Three . balloons took off at the same time and the first two had no issues with . their landing, but that wasn't the case for the third. 'As . the third balloon made its descent, it made contact with a live . utility wire. That in turn sparked a fire with the hot air balloon,' Ms . Geller said. Final moments: Festival goer Nancy Johnson posted this image on her Instagram account showing the explosive balloon (far left) before the fire . Desperate: The balloon that caught fire was the third in a group of three that were due to land at a festival but after the other two made safe descents, the third balloon hit a utility wire and caught fire . 'The . fire spread quickly the pilot of the hot air balloon, based on witness . accounts and the other pilots who were on the ground, began doing his . various safety maneuvers and trying to manage the fire.' She . said that witnesses saw the pilot 'try to open up the top of the . balloon which is standard procedure because the added heat and intensity . of the fire will actually make the balloon rise faster so he was taking . every effort he could to manage and extinguish the fire.' People who were present at the event recalled seeing some passengers leaping from the basket. 'According . to witnesses they say they heard an explosion and it was after that . that the basket and the balloon actually separated,' Ms Geller said. 'We are still in the process- and we spent all night- searching for the wreckage, the basket, the balloon.' Carrie . Hager-Bradley said she saw the balloon in flames on her way home from . the grocery store and heard people yelling, according to WWBT TV. Search continues: Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corine Geller (left) said that the search went on through the night with helicopters (right) and will continue through Saturday with the aid of hundreds of state troopers . 'They were just screaming for anybody to help them,' the station quoted her as saying. ‘We saw black smoke coming from an object,’ eyewitness Cole Holocker told NBC News. ‘Couldn't tell what it was. We thought it might be exhaust from a . helicopter around the base and then, when we came close to it, we could . see it was a balloon.’ The . 18-year-old college student added that he saw the structure of the . balloon collapse before it plummeted to the ground, landing behind the . tree line. Festival goer Nancy Johnson posted a photo on her Instagram account showing the ill-fated balloon right before the fire. Some hot air balloons landed . safely in Debra Ferguson's yard, she was quoted by The Free Lance-Star . of Fredericksburg, Virginia, as saying. She said one of the men in the balloons pointed up at another still in the air and said he thought it might be in trouble. Investigators gather near a farm in Virginia as they were searching for missing hot air balloon on Friday night . 'As soon as we looked up, the thing blew up right there,' the newspaper quoted Ferguson as saying. ""All I heard was, ""Oh my God, Oh my God,"" and all you saw was the top of the balloon still flying, but all of the basket was gone. All of the flames just disappeared. ... It was like a match — poof — and then it was gone.' Caroline County resident Paula Dustin said she and her family and a friend were watching the balloons inflate and take off when they saw one in the distance that appeared to be in distress. 'We saw a glow, and you could tell the bottom of the balloon was in flames,' Dustin was quoted by the newspaper as saying. A . website dedicated to the Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival said Saturday was intended to be a special  'happy hour' for up to 1,500 advanced ticket . holders to watch balloon teams take off. The festival that was supposed to take place for . the first time Saturday and Sunday was instead canceled. The . park where the event was supposed to take place was previously best-known for being . the birthplace of Triple Crown winning racing horse Secretariat.

"Manchester City's teenage left-back Angelino has spoken about the dream moment he got to mark Lionel Messi. Angelino, full name Jose Angel Esmoris Tasende, was one of a number of City's elite development squad invited to make up the numbers in a training session with Argentina ahead of their friendly with Portugal at Old Trafford this week. The World Cup finalists have been training at City's Carrington complex and 17-year-old Angelino was asked to match up against arguably the world's best player in a practice match at the weekend. Manchester City youngster Jose Angel Tasende has been marking megastar Lionel Messi in training . Messi and his Argentina team-mates have been using City's Carrington base to prepare for Portugal friendly . The Spaniard, who turned down Barcelona and Real Madrid to join City two years ago, impressed observers including members of the Argentina coach staff. And Messi took time out afterwards to give him a few words of advice. Angelino said: 'I couldn't believe I was defending against Messi. I didn't tackle him as I didn't want to injure him! 'It was great experience for me to train with one of the best players in the world. We didn't expect this. To see all those big stars playing with us.' The youngster, whose idol is former Brazil left-back Roberto Carlos, was too awestruck to ask Messi for an autograph but the four-time Ballon D'Or winner took time out to speak to him afterwards. Angelino added: 'He was talking to me about my family and then the Argentina left-back was talking to me about my positioning and when I need to go forward or not. I didn't get anything signed, I didn't ask for it. 'Afterwards we were all talking about Messi because he got the ball at one point and dribbled past six or seven players. We were all impressed. 'Here at City I've trained against some of the best players in the world with our first team so I wasn't really nervous but it helps a lot as a young player to come up against someone like him. It's a different style, different class and they've all been where we've been before. I just hope someone took a photograph!' Angelino's teammate George Evans took his opportunity; asking Messi to pose for a picture that he posted on his Twitter feed. The 19-year-old midfielder is mixing in different circles today however as he is training with Championship strugglers Blackpool ahead of a loan move. Jose Angel Esmoris Tasende is a Spanish left back who has been at Manchester City for a couple of years after arriving as a first-year scholar in 2013. Angelino is a highly-rated left-back in Manchester City's academy . The defender is known as 'Angelino' and has been likened to German World Cup star Mario Gotze because of his looks. He already has the obligatory footballer's tattoo sleeve on his right arm. Angelino started his career at Deportivo La Coruna and his exploits with the Spanish side soon caught the attention of City. He moved to England aged just 15 and his performances for City's academy side have earned him international recognition. Angelino has been likened to German World Cup star Mario Gotze due to their resemblance .","Spanish defender handed daunting task of marking superstar Lionel Messi .

"Roma captain Francesco Totti has launched an astonishing attack on Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli, saying he 'doesn't listen to anyone.' Totti was sent off kicking out at the then-Inter Milan striker four years ago as his Roma side lost the Coppa Italia final 1-0. And it appears his opinion hasn't changed as he was quoted as saying: 'I would not give advice to Balotelli. Everyone tries to, but he does not listen to anyone.'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers (right) has failed to get the best out of Balotelli (left) since his arrival . He echoed the thoughts of Italy coach Antonio Conte, who told Raisport before the friendly against Albania: 'I'm not so arrogant as to claim that I'm different from the great coaches, but the past tells us that they failed to change Balotelli. 'It'll be up to the player, but I don't have much time and I need certain things.' Balotelli has struggled to impress at Liverpool since his transfer from AC Milan in August. He has only scored twice, once in the Champions League and once in the League Cup, and he has floundered in his attempts to lead Liverpool's attack in the absence of Daniel Sturridge. Balotelli's woes were compounded last week when he was ruled out of Italy's Euro 2016 qualifier against Croatia with a muscle injury, but is expected to be fit to play for Liverpool against Crystal Palace on Sunday.

"Manchester United winger Nani has revealed his loan spell at Sporting Lisbon has rekindled his love for the game. After finding first-team action hard to come by over the last few seasons, the 28-year-old returned to his home country in August to get some game-time under his belt - and it seems to have done the trick.

"Newcastle manager Alan Pardew admits the past fortnight has not been kind to his squad as he prepares a makeshift defence for Saturday’s visit of QPR. The Magpies – who have not conceded for nearly six hours – have lost skipper Fabricio Coloccini to a calf injury and defensive sidekick Steven Taylor is struggling with a knee problem. That means Pardew will start with Paul Dummett and Mike Williamson at the heart of his rearguard at the weekend.

Pardew is preparing his side for their Premier League encounter against QPR at St James' Park . Williamson himself has been missing because of injury in recent weeks, while Dummett has operated at left back for the large part. And Pardew, who has also lost midfielders Mehdi Abeid (broken toe) and Rolando Aarons (hamstring) and remains without Cheick Tiote (calf), said: ‘It seems like a very long time since we last played. We had some great results but we've also suffered some injuries. ‘We are still missing some on Saturday, but hopefully we can keep the run going.’ Academy graduate Dummett has emerged as a surprise star in recent weeks, and Pardew added: ‘Paul Dummett has done brilliantly for us and he will play there (centre back) again. Newcatle utility man Ryan Taylor practises free-kicks ahead of his side's match against QPR . Sammy Ameobi will be hoping to keep his place in Pardew's starting line-up when his side take on QPR . ‘And if he carries on the way he has then we will be absolutely fine.’ Pardew, whose side have won five on the spin, went on: ‘Considering our start to the season we have done really well. ‘The mood in the camp is buoyant and although we've had injuries during the winning spell we've managed to overcome them. Our youngsters deserve a lot of credit as do the senior guys. ‘There's a bit more expectation on us than in previous weeks and the QPR match is a different kind of hurdle for our young players.’","Newcastle could be without Fabricio Coloccini and Steven Taylor against QPR on Saturday .

"To many they are a symbol of old, rural ways – a traditional way of heating a home and conserving fuel. But the woodburning stove has become the new badge of middle-class success – with more and more families spending upwards of £3,000 to have one fitted. At least 175,000 households are installing a woodburner each year, five times more than in 2007, according to Hetas, the industry regulatory body. And the trend has led to an increase in the number of installers registered with Hetas, up from 791 in 2007 to 3,252 today. Trending: Agas were the must-have appliance, but woodburners have had a re-vamp to cater for high demand . Experts say sales of woodburners began to increase at the height of the recession as homeowners tried to reduce energy bills. But they have also become a trendy centre-piece in the homes of many families – with new designs featuring bright colours, sleek and modern shapes and big glass windows. The endorsement of woodburners by celebrities including pop star Lily Allen, celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, and the property developer and television presenter Sarah Beeny, have also helped to sustain the stove as a ‘must-have’ in home-decoration. They are also becoming increasingly fashionable in towns and cities. ‘Until recently, stoves were very much a backwater. They were for people who lived in big draughty homes in the country,’ said Paul Chesney of Chesney’s, a woodburner supplier. ‘That has changed radically. In particular, we are seeing a new metropolitan, urban taste for woodburners.’ Chesney’s sold more than 600 stoves in central London last year. One man saw such a market in them that he gave up his £100,000-a-year IT job in 2011 to found Windsor and Eton Stoves, a woodburner supplier. High-end: Burners started as a low-cost way to cut bills. Now they cost around £3,000 to buy and install . Mary Berry is very proud of her 20-year-old Aga. But it looks like she is out of fashion, based on sales statistics . Chris Croft said he expects turnover will triple this year compared with 2012 and intends to open a shop in London in time for Christmas. ‘It’s a quality of life thing and the industry is really growing,’ he said. ‘Are woodburners the new Aga? Probably, yes.’ The cost of buying and installing a woodburner begins at about £3,000 but can cost in excess of £10,000 for some of the more modern or ornate designs. David Webb and his wife Jamie, who have two children Jacob, seven, and Sydney, two, recently spent £6,100 on buying and installing a woodburner in their barn conversion in Charlton Kings, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. ‘We wanted a woodburner because we are traditionalists at heart,’ said Mr Webb, director of an IT company. ‘Our dream was to have the kids opening their presents by the burning fire at Christmas.’ Despite the installation costs, wood for a stove can be cheaper to burn than other fuels. Burning wood costs an average of 4p a kilowatt hour compared with 5p for gas and oil and 15p for electricity. It also emits less carbon dioxide, a factor that attracts those concerned about the environment. ‘Most of the new models now . . . give out such low emissions that you can burn wood legally in smoke-free zones in towns and cities,’ said Cedric Wells, of stove manufacturer Charnwood. ‘This has really opened up the product to city and urban areas — the southeast has been the area of growth recently and some of our stockists are now booked up until Christmas.’ A growing number of people are spotting a gap in the market and training to become chimney sweeps. The National Association of Chimney Sweeps has seen the number of participants at its training courses is up 36per cent since the beginning of the year. ‘We are taking on all sorts of people — from a BAE Systems engineer to ex-teachers,’ said Martin Glynn, the president of the association. Estate agents in London estimate a woodburner could increase the value of a property by up to 5per cent.","Trend started at the height of recession as a way to reduce energy bills .

"The International Rugby Board is considering introducing strict new anti-corruption measures which would see mobile phones banned from team dressing rooms. The sport’s governing body is eager to protect rugby from the illegal gambling and match-fixing scandals which have dogged other sports including horse racing, cricket and, in recent times, football. On Monday, IRB chief executive Brett Gosper revealed new rules could be introduced which would see players required to hand in their phones on arrival at the ground on match-days. The IRB is considering strict new anti-corruption measures by banning mobile phones from dressing rooms . ‘The integrity of sport, whether it be gambling and anti-doping, is an issue for all sports and like all other sports we’re looking at options in terms of what can be the right protocols to ensure that there might not be issues that can lead to gambling,’ Gosper said. ‘That’s on the table to be investigated, we haven’t yet made a call. We’re comparing some of the protocols in other sports and we will make a call on it in the next few months. ‘We don’t want to apply anything that’s overly draconian or doesn’t take into account the normal way players use their phones but to a certain extent we have to ensure we are not taking any risks in the gambling area.’ The aim of the ban is to prevent corruption and match-fixing from players during the game .","International Rugby Board is considering new anti-corruption measures .

"Monica Lewinsky, pictured, who has just turned 40, has never been married and does not have any children . He is a revered global statesman, courted by prime ministers and rock stars for his good works. She is on course to be the first woman president of the United States. Few would bet against what is mockingly being called the ‘Clinton Restoration’ to the White House. Political pundits have little doubt that Democrat Hillary Clinton will be powered to victory by her popular and politically brilliant husband, Bill, next year and the country that supposedly rejected monarchy centuries ago will have their royal family back on the throne. When even Republican contenders are loath to throw their hats into the ring, fearing they will lose, who would dare rock the Clinton boat? The answer came this week when a blast from the past has reappeared to cause damage — perhaps irreparable — to both of them. Monica Lewinsky, the ‘other woman’ who embroiled the Clintons in one of the biggest political scandals of the last century, has broken more than a decade of silence. In a long essay for Vanity Fair magazine, she has reminded America of an episode in Clinton history that was anything but glorious. Between 1995 and 1997, President Clinton — then turning 50 — and the White House intern in her early 20s had an affair which ranged all over the White House. Their trysts took place in bathrooms, hallways, even the pantry. Then, Lewinsky foolishly confided in a colleague, who advised the naive intern to preserve any evidence of the affair — including, infamously, a stained blue dress — and record her conversations with the President. Clinton famously denied ‘sexual relations with that woman’, then humiliatingly had to admit that he had lied. Monica Lewinsky, left, broke her media silence over her relationship with President Bill Clinton, right, in an interview with Vanity Fair . He became only the second U.S. president to have impeachment proceedings launched against him, but the Senate acquitted him of lying under oath and obstruction of justice. Remarkably, his marriage survived. Previously unpopular with voters, Mrs Clinton leapt in the polls as she played the loyal wife. Miss Lewinsky, meanwhile, became the punchline for a thousand smutty jokes. Ever since, she now claims, she has been saddled with a reputation as the ultimate  office slut. She says she was made a scapegoat by the Clinton camp who labelled her ‘the Unstable Stalker’. She is clearly still haunted by the scandal. In the Vanity Fair article, she reveals how, overcome by ‘the shame, the scorn and the fear’ that had been ‘thrown’ at her, she contemplated suicide several times in the years following the revelations. Her mother would stay by her bed, night after night, to watch her. The Clinton administration demonised her so successfully, she writes, that she has never been able to leave the affair behind. Now 40 and with a masters degree in psychology from the London School of Economics, she still cannot find a decent job because of her notoriety. ‘I wish [the Clintons] no ill,’ she announces at the end of her 4,300-word screed in Vanity Fair. But she cannot possibly wish them well. The tone of her piece, which is illustrated with a come-hitherish shot of her lounging on a sofa, is supremely self-pitying, even if you can sympathise with at least some of her complaints. It must have been painful to have watched the Clintons breeze from success to success while she is still seen as the voluptuous vixen who almost brought down a President. Interestingly, she directs most of her fire not on the man she says ‘took advantage of me’, but on the wife who stood by him. Is this surprising? Not to many  U.S. political observers, especially Republicans, who see her intervention as a blatant attempt to derail Hillary’s bid for the White House. Hillary Clinton is being widely tipped as a strong candidate to run for president in 2016 . The timing is suspicious. Mrs Clinton has a new memoir out next month — the perfect moment, many believe, to announce that she will indeed run in 2016. If she does, her husband, whose electioneering skills are second to none, is expected to be a crucial part of her campaign. Following Ms Lewinsky’s latest sally, however, the U.S. media are asking about Monica, not Hillary. Miss Lewinsky says she refused numerous interview offers during Mrs Clinton’s 2008 presidential run against Obama, because as a ‘conscientious Democrat’, she feared she would be used to damage the party. Six years on, however, it’s no more Miss Nice Guy. ‘I turned 40 last year, and it is time to stop tiptoeing around my past — and other people’s futures,’ she writes. But there’s another reason why she might suddenly have become less sensitive about hurting the Clintons, and Hillary in particular. As Miss Lewinsky recounts, previously unpublished papers revealed in February that Mrs Clinton had made some choice remarks about her love rival to her best friend, Diane Blair. Although Mrs . Clinton found her husband’s ‘lapse’ with Lewinsky inexcusable, she praised him for ‘trying to manage someone who was clearly a “narcissistic loony toon” ’. Mrs Clinton also revealed she partly blamed herself for her husband’s philandering because she had been ‘inattentive to his needs’. Bill Clinton, pictured, was only the second president to face impeachment while in office . Miss Lewinsky writes that Mrs Clinton’s description of her made her ‘bristle’. Worse, she adds, it began to ‘gnaw’ at her that Mrs Clinton had wanted her uncharitable comments to come out, as she had encouraged Diane Blair to keep a record of their chats for posterity. ‘Hillary Clinton wanted it on record that she was lashing out at her husband’s mistress,’ Monica gripes in Vanity Fair. ‘But I find her impulse to blame The Woman — not only me, but herself — troubling.’ Given that Mrs Clinton’s presidential ambitions largely rely on appealing to women voters, accusing her of betraying the sisterhood is about the most politically damaging accusation Miss Lewinsky could have made. She also takes aim at other women, particularly feminists, whom she had expected to rally to her side as the Washington establishment portrayed her as a husband-stealing flirt, but who failed to do so. With no one to fight her cause, she claims, she was left to slink off into the shadows. Well, not quite. Despite her tales of financial woes and endless job rejections, Lewinsky exploited her notoriety effectively. She co-operated with a biography written by Andrew Morton and — trading on her name — started designing expensive knitted handbags. She also appeared in a string of TV shows, including a dating show and a stint as a U.S. correspondent for Channel 5 in Britain. In 2005, she moved to London to study at the LSE to reinvent herself. The staff and students were ‘wonderful — welcoming and respectful’, she says now. But moving back to the U.S., she reveals her attempts to carve out a career have been dogged by her notoriety. ‘Because of what potential employers so tactfully referred to as my “history”, I was never “quite right” for the position,’ she writes. Her love life has been similarly blighted. ‘With every man I date, I go through some degree of 1998 whiplash,’ says Lewinsky, who has never married or had children. As for the Clintons, she sniffs that she ‘understands that what has happened to me and the issue of my future do not matter to them’. She ‘deeply regrets’ the affair, criticising her lover’s ‘gross, inappropriate behaviour’, but concedes it was a ‘consensual’ relationship. Many Republicans, keen to find anything that can stop the seemingly unstoppable Clinton juggernaut, had been dredging up the Lewinksy affair long before the Vanity Fair article. In February, potential Republican White House contender Rand Paul accused the Democrats of hypocrisy for claiming to support women’s rights while exonerating Mr Clinton of his ‘predatory’ behaviour. Some Republicans have cautioned against resorting to dirty tactics, so there is widespread delight that Monica has done it for them. Has she finally exacted the ultimate revenge? ‘Like many other Americans, I’ve been thinking about Hillary Clinton,’ she muses. ‘What might happen if she does run in 2016?’ One thing’s guaranteed. The Clintons won’t be allowed to forget the biggest blot in their copy-book.","Monica Lewinsky broke her decade-long media silence in Vanity Fair .

"A nine-year-old beekeeper was astonished to find that the insects in her father's hives had made a peace sign on a honeycomb. Meesha Benefer, nine, found the symbol made by a colony at her father's bee farm in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Her 38-year-old father Peter, who runs the beekeeping business on the side with the help of his young daughter said he was 'totally taken aback' when Meesha found the peace sign. Buzz for peace: Meesha Benefer, nine, found a peace symbol in the honeycomb in her bee hive . Keen apiarist Meesha made the astonishing discovery while helping her dad at Benefer's Bee Farm in Leeds, West Yorkshire. Meesha said: 'Every Saturday me and my dad go to the hives to check on the bees and always hope to see honey building up in the comb. 'It means I have to pull the big heavy frames out and if we are lucky and its the right time of year, we drain it together to collect honey to sell and  have it in our porridge for breakfast. 'Last Saturday I was pulling out one of the frames and noticed there was a weird sign on one side. 'I thought it was the Volkswagen sign because I'd seen it before on my Grandad's car. But Dad was really amazed and said the circle with the three lines inside meant world peace.' 'Pollen' their leg: Meesha first associated the sign with that of Volkswagen, but was told of its true meaning by her father while they worked at the family bee farm . The father-daughter team have been running Benefer's Bee Farm for three years, and balance it on the side of schoolwork and Mr Benefer's job in recruitment. Mr Benefer said: 'I was totally taken aback by the symbol that one of our colonies left in the honeycomb. 'Bees are known to be highly intelligent creatures and have very sophisticated means of communicating to each other. 'Obviously this is an incredible coincidence - but I have to say a little bit of me did wonder if they were trying to leave us a message.' The avid aphiarist who spends his free time with daughter Meesha reading up on honey bees' behaviour, said: 'I've read all sorts of incredible things bees have been known to do, but never anything like this. Family buzz-ness: Meesha and father Peter Benefer, 38, found the symbol while working on their apiarist business, Benefer's Bee Farm . 'I've read lots of those stories about people seeing Jesus' face in slices of toast and their dead relatives in naan breads and whatnot, and I've always thought they're just a ploy for attention seekers. 'But when I saw this there's no way someone could have created that. 'Bees fill each cell in a piece of comb with honey and cap it off, but sometimes a few holes or large patches will just get missed and left uncapped. 'I'm amazed the they've missed out all the cells to make any sort of picture at all, let alone one which has a deep significance.' Meesha, who stays with Peter at weekends after her parents separated, said they have kept the honeycomb to put in a frame on her bedroom wall. Peter added the two would continue to run their farm in the Headingley area of Leeds, which produces honey for the city's Double Tree Hilton hotel.","Nine-year-old Meesha Benefer found peace symbol in her honeycomb .

"The former chief executive of JJB Sports has been convicted after accepting more than £1 million in backhanders from suppliers. Christopher Ronnie, 52, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, showed no emotion as he was found guilty of fraud over three six-figure cash payments from companies who were doing business with the sportswear giant while he was in charge in 2007 and 2008. Southwark Crown Court in London heard the payments, some of which he used to buy property in Florida, were not disclosed to the company board by Ronnie, who was £11 million in debt to Icelandic banks at the time. Former chief executive of JJB Sports Christopher Ronnie, 52, (pictured) has been convicted after accepting more than £1 million in backhanders from suppliers while he was in charge in 2007 and 2008 . The businessman, who did not give evidence in his own defence, was convicted of three counts of fraud, and two of furnishing false information bout his assets to try and avoid repaying a £11 million debt to an Icelandic bank. The trial lasted more than eight weeks and it took the jury nearly 35 hours of deliberations to deliver its unanimous guilty verdicts against him. Ronnie, a Labour party donor, was chief executive of JJB Sports between August 2007 and March 2009. His co-defendants, business partners David Ball and David Barrington - who both worked for two firms supplying stock to JJB Sports - were convicted today of helping to cover his tracks. The case, which the Serious Fraud Office had been working on since 2009, centered on three large loans of several hundred thousand pounds each which Ronnie received in 2008. A JJB Sports closing down sale in Ealing Broadway shopping arcade - Christopher Ronnie has been found guilty of fraud for receiving undisclosed payments while he was chief executive of the company . Jurors heard that Ronnie's company Seacroft received a payment of £650,000 in February 2008 from Performance Brands - a sports goods supplier with which Ball and Barrington were both associated. In June that year he received 380,000 US dollars - about £197,000 - from Fashion and Sport - another supplier the pair were linked to. A third payment, again from Fashion and Sport, was made to Ronnie later that year, this time of 250,000 US dollars - about £134,000. The court heard that Ronnie owed £11 million to Icelandic bank Kaupthing Singer Friedlander, and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets. But he falsified information about his assets and liabilities over these loans when he bought shares in JJB Sports. The court heard Ball and Barrington also covered up a series of emails relating to the loans. The court heard the pair later asked a computer engineer to wipe any trace of the emails, but he was so concerned about what he found that he kept a copy for himself and contacted the SFO. Ball, 54, from Sutton, Surrey, an accountant and supplier to JJB, was cleared of two counts of furnishing false information. Southwark Crown Court (pictured above) heard that Ronnie owed £11 million to Icelandic bank Kaupthing Singer Friedlander and agreed he would provide it with documents about his loans and assets . But he was convicted of two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice, as was Barrington, 52, from Sale, Cheshire. The three men were silent and showed no emotion as the verdicts were handed down. Although jury members were given the option of returning a majority verdict - rather than coming to a consensus - in respect of one false information allegation against Ball, they were unable to reach a verdict. Ronnie, Ball and Barrington will all be sentenced on December 12. Prosecutors have indicated that as part of his sentence, they will seek to bar Ronnie from sitting as a company director for a period of time. 'I'm granting you bail to give you an opportunity to get your affairs in order,' Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told the men. He also praised the jurors for their close attention during the weeks-long trial, telling them: 'Thank you very much for being the easiest jury I have ever had to look after.'","Former  chief executive Christopher Ronnie has been found guilty of fraud .

"German art collector Cornelius Gurlitt, who owned more than a thousand pieces of valuable art . A landscape by Claude Monet has been found in a suitcase the late German collector Cornelius Gurlitt had with him during a hospital stay, becoming the latest piece to emerge from his long-hidden art trove. The suitcase was left at the hospital for unknown reasons, and was handed over earlier this week to the court-appointed administrator of Gurlitt's estate, the task force investigating the piece's origin said today. The find comes after officials reported finding a few more works at Gurlitt's Munich apartment in July, including a sculpture apparently by Edgar Degas. Like the Monet, they were not among 1,280 pieces authorities seized from the apartment in 2012 while investigating a tax case, a collection that included works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall. It was not immediately clear where the Monet was kept and why it was not seized. The task force said it will check whether the Monet was stolen by the Nazis, as it is doing with many other works in Gurlitt's collection. It said it appears after initial examination that the light-blue landscape, painted on paper, may have been produced around 1864. The subject appears very similar to the French artist's 'Garden of Sainte-Adresse'. Gurlitt died at home in May after spending weeks in a hospital following heart surgery. News of the art trove's seizure emerged only in November. Authorities had discovered the works while investigating Gurlitt for suspected import tax evasion. Claude Monet's 'Garden of Sainte Adresse' - to which the discovered painting is said to be similar . Paintings by Henri Matisse (left) and Marc Chagall (right) which were discovered at Gurlitt's apartment . He inherited the collection from his father Hildebrand, an art dealer who traded in works confiscated by the Nazis. Gurlitt designated Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern as sole heir to his collection. The museum is considering whether to accept the bequest. Shortly before he died, Gurlitt reached a deal with the German government to check whether hundreds of the works had been looted from Jewish owners by the Nazis. Cornelius Gurlitt was a notorious German art hoarder who died in May aged 81. His father, Hildebrand, was Adolf Hitler's art dealer, and dealt in works confiscated by the Nazis from Jews or museums. His vast collection  was seized from his Munich apartment after a tax inquiry in 2012 - 1,280 pieces were found, including works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Max Liebermann. Gurlitt was investigated for tax reasons when he was found carrying huge wads of cash while on a train from Switzerland. The incredible array of art was estimated to be worth around £850million. Depite the value of his assets, Gurlitt did not have an extravagant lifestyle, only selling a painting when he needed money.","Painting is the latest unearthed from Cornelius Gurlitt's art treasure trove .

"Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has revealed  he will hold talks with the top brass at the club about whether to swoop for Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus. The German champions almost signed the 25-year-old when he joined Dortmund two years ago and would not be put off by his buy-out clause, believed to be in the region of £20million. Bayern have signed Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski from Dortmund in the last two summers and Rummenigge has  confirmed the Bundesliga champions are weighing up whether to launch a bid for the playmaker, who is being monitored by a host of Premier League clubs, including Manchester City, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United. Bayern Munich are considering making a bid for Borussia Dortmund's Germany star Marco Reus . The midfielder has also attracted interest from Premier League clubs including Manchester City and Arsenal . Reus is comforted by manager Jurgen Klopp  after Dortmund's 2-1 defeat against Cologne on Saturday . 'To be honest, we'll discuss the matter internally and calmly. Then we will come to a decision,' Rummenigge was quoted as saying on Goal.com. 'At the end of the day, the player has to decide too. His release clause is well known. There's nothing more to say.' Speculation about Reus joining Pep Guardiola's team intensified after Gotze said last week that he 'would be really happy if he [Reus] would come here'.

"Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp is hoping to bring in some new additions when the January transfer window opens who 'could make the difference' in terms of Barclays Premier League survival. The west London club, promoted back to the top flight after winning the Sky Bet Championship play-off at Wembley, are second from bottom of the table, but only a point behind 17th-placed Crystal Palace. QPR have been linked with a move for former England striker Jermain Defoe, who is with Toronto in the MLS. QPR manager Harry Redknapp has revealed the club are looking to sign one or two players in January . Redknapp believes chairman Tony Fernandes will back him in the transfer market provided the Hoops are not way off the pace in the relegation scrap. 'We are trying, we felt we have to make sure we are still in there,' Redknapp said on talkSPORT. 'If you are cut adrift at Christmas, you don't want to be going and getting yourself into trouble, but if we are still in there with a chance, which I think we will be, then the chairman will go out and let us get one or two players who could make the difference for us. 'We have got one or two targets, and are just waiting to see if we can get them over the line.' QPR, who drew 2-2 at home with champions Manchester City before the international break, host Newcastle on Saturday, with the Magpies now very much on the up having at one time looked set for a survival battle themselves. Jermain Defoe has been consistently linked with a move to QPR where he could reunite with his former boss . Redknapp added 'I look at the table and think there are going to be seven or eight teams involved in that scrap. 'Burnley had a win last week, there is no-one cut adrift yet, it is too early, and if anyone could get back-to-back wins like Newcastle have done, it could all turn quickly. 'We brought a few new players in and it took them time to settle, but they are finding their feet at the club now. 'I think we we have deserved more points with the form we are in, but I would rather play poorly and pick up a few wins.' Redknapp said that Tony Fernandes will let him sign players if QPR are not too far behind in the league .","QPR are currently 19th in the Premier League table .

"How Gareth Southgate would settle for this next summer. England playing with swagger, passing and moving with purpose and putting Portugal to the sword. These two nations will meet again on June 18, in the Czech town of Uherske Hradste, to begin the proceedings of Group B in Euro 2015. Inevitably, the sides will look a little different but if the result is the same, the Under 21 head coach will be over the moon. England ran out 3-1 convincing winners, thanks to goals Danny Ings (two) and Carl Jenkinson, pleasing Southgate in the process. Having secured their place at the tournament impressively against Croatia last month, here was another step forward in the right direction.

Subs Not Used: Daniel Fernandes, Paulo Oliveira, Ruben Vezo. Goals: Bernardo Silva 48. Att: 10,711 . Ref: Sebastian Coltescu (Romania). Southgate is not someone who gets carried away but even he would accept that the numbers England are putting together ahead of their defining test are impressive: this was their eleventh straight success and the 13th unbeaten game on his watch. Portugal were unbeaten in 15 games prior to Thursday night, and more tests beckons against France – in Brest next Monday – before the Czech Republic and Germany await in March. But the confidence which is currently in this group is sending them a long way. Every member is desperate to make an impression. ‘I was very pleased, particularly given the quality of the opposition,’ said Southgate. ‘The result was important because they are the best team that we have played. There are some things that we can improve but we looked a threat.’ With Saido Berahino on senior duty and Harry Kane starting on the bench, Ings grasped his opportunity on home turf to make an impression, going close in the first attack with a flashing header before he opening the scoring in the sixth minute, turning in a cross from Tom Ince. Ings, the Burnley striker, has struggled for regular starts at this level but his performance was full of energy and endeavour and he kept trying to stretch Portugal, with his runs in behind their defence. His work ethic was to be admired. ‘I’m delighted for him,’ said Southgate. ‘It is great that we have got three Premier League strikers to choose from. His first contribution was beating five men and nearly scoring with a header. Danny was excellent.’ For all their superiority, though, England’s second goal didn’t arrive until the stroke of half-time. Again they opened Portugal up with quick interchanges, the move culminating when Will Hughes picked out Jenkinson, who confidently finished from 12 yards. Portugal, to their credit, came out with intent in the second period and took advantage of a weak header by Luke Garbutt in the 48th minute when Bernardo Silva waltzed through, firing his shot between Jack Butland’s legs. Any chance that Portugal would stage a rally, however, were soon snuffed out when Ings capped a fine evening, bundling in from close range after Norwich winger Nathan Redmond had scurried to the byline and picked him out. It was a fitting end to a satisfying night. Ings is joined by other team-mates after his sixth-minute goal for Gareth Southgate's side .

"A new video has emerged of troubled Toronto mayor Rob Ford where he is seen stumbling around drunk in a bar and ranting: 'No one better f*** with me....I'm going to kick you in the f****** head.' The latest shaming clip emerged as Doug Ford announced that he will end speculation today over the whereabouts of his brother who has not been seen for a week since taking a leave of absence to deal with his alcohol and crack-smoking addictions. The new video, which was posted on the Toronto Sun's website, was reportedly shot in a Toronto bar on April 27 - in the same three-day period where videos also emerged of Ford making lewd, drunken remarks about a female politician in a bar and another of him smoking a purported crack pipe in his sister's basement. Scroll down for video . A new video has emerged of Toronto mayor Rob Ford rambling drunkenly and making idle threats to 'kick you in the f****** head' in a bar . Where are you? Rob Ford is pictured above on May 1, a day after he announced his leave of absence. He has now spoken out about rehab, calling it the best thing he ever did . Despite . declaring rehab to be 'amazing', citizens of Canada's largest city are . dubious their mayor is where he says he is, with sightings of Ford . around town reaching fevered level as members of the public upload . pictures to Twitter. Indeed, . by speaking to the media Ford has inadvertently fanned the flames of . speculation as to his whereabouts, especially after the confusion . surrounding his flight to Chicago. Reports suggested that Ford did fly to the U.S. to seek rehab as expected but instead returned to Canada after withdrawing his application, after which the media lost track of the drug-addled mayor. And his apparent upbeat demeanor in Wednesday's interview, in which he compared rehab to his childhood football camp, just days after hitting rock bottom as sparked huge rumors on social media that he is not telling the truth. The very fact he is giving media interviews and claims to be calling constituents has caused many to doubt his claims of treatment, considering the strict conditions of entry imposed by many rehabilitation facilities. These usually include the removal of cell phones and for a period all contact with the outside world. Anyone seen him? These posters are beginning to spring up around Toronto as the city deals with the latest chapter in the Rob Ford saga . Back to drugs: Ford's announcement follows the emergence of yet another video showing him smoking what appears to be crack. A still from the new video released by the Globe and Mail, above . His refusal to give up his location too has led to doubt that he seeking help for his problems and ridicule online. 'Sounds like Ford is having an awesome time in rehab. Which (sic) exactly how I imagined week 1 of battling a serious alcohol addiction would be,' wrote one commenter to Twitter on Wednesday. However, Ford's brother, Doug, has refuted all claims the mayor is not in rehab. He told reporters on Tuesday that Rob Ford is 'in rehab facility, 100 percent,' but would not divulge where out of respect for the other patients. However, Doug Ford was also quoted by reporters as having said his brother is in a 'rehabilitation program.' Doug Ford told reporters his brother is not in any kind of out-patient program. Conflicting opinions: The citizens of Toronto are divided on whether or not Rob Ford is actually in rehab . Furthermore, Doug Ford claims he received a phone call from his brother's doctor on  Wednesday asking the media to calm down. However, while it is evident the media do not know where Rob Ford is, it is not clear what they are supposed to be backing off from. 'This is not about just Rob, this is about all the other patients. You can't put their jeopardy at stake here of their recovery,' said Doug Ford at Toronto's city hall on Wednesday. The frenzy about Ford's whereabouts hit new levels earlier this week when a young woman updated Twitter on Tuesday that she had seen the mayor at a Tim Horton's in Toronto's west end. She told CP24 on Wednesday she is adamant it was Rob Ford and that he changed his clothes in the coffee shop bathroom, . 'When he went into the store he was wearing a black suit but when he came out he was wearing a grey, track suit,' she said. Two Tim Horton's workers also told CBC News they saw him. Again, rushing to his brother's aid, Doug Ford told reporters on Wednesday afternoon that it was actually him at the Tim Hortons and not Rob Ford. 'That was me at the Junction. That was me that pulled over,' said Councillor Ford at city hall Wednesday. 'I was taking pictures and handing out T-shirts. That was me on my way down here. So, please, do your due diligence.' Adding to the speculation as to Rob Ford's whereabouts was Aaron Spivak, a hockey player who tweeted he saw the mayor in Richmond Hill and uploaded a picture. Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, a Ford family ally said that Toronto deserves to know where its mayor is. 'I would say to you right now that at the very least the city should know the city that he's in for treatment, and with some verification that he is in fact being treated,' he said. Driving: This picture of a man with a resemblance to Rob Ford taken in Richmond Hills was uploaded to Twitter on Wednesday . Speaking from his undisclosed location, Ford said that there's no timeline for his return to office, but Ford has assured his supporters he'll be back in time to gain re-election later this year. 'Of course, I am coming back and I am going to kick butt,' he told the newspaper. 'I will be on the ballot for mayor in October, guaranteed, and I will do well.' He joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.' Ford said the rehab center treats 'addictions to alcohol and other things' and is 'worth every penny.' After a week of being clean and sober, the mayor said he's starting to come to terms with what has happened over the past year but he said he is hopeful he can right his wrongs. 'At first, I was mad. I was mad at myself and saying, ""Why me?""' he told the Sun. 'But then I realized it could have been a whole lot worse.' He said the very public fall from grace was possibly what he needed to shake him into action. 'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better.' Ford refused to reveal the name of the treatment center he's checked into, out of respect for the other patients, and he wouldn't even confirm it was in Canada. He said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city pub. He said he woke up and 'I told Dougie, 'I am going away' and then started looking up rehab and treatment centers.' Infamous: Since the original crack video scandal, Ford has been the center of scandal after scandal. Pictured at a news conference with wife Renata (left) on November 14 . Ford told the Sun his family knows where he is and he's been speaking to his children regularly, though they don't know why he's getting help. He said the past week has been tough but he described going into rehab as the 'best decision' he has ever made and said he wishes he'd done it sooner. 'I said to myself, ""Am I going to try to cover it up for the rest of your life or deal with it and go to professional help?""' Ford recalled. 'I decided to get help.' Ford's lawyer said last week that the mayor had left Toronto for rehab after a video surfaced that appeared to show him smoking a crack pipe late last month — nearly a year after reports of an initial video that appeared show him smoking the drug. The last time Ford visited the United States was in early March, when he appeared on the ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" television show in Los Angeles. 'The most important thing, everyone who is concerned if he's in rehab, the answer is yes,' Doug Ford told the AP. 'As for his whereabouts that's personal and that should stay with Rob.' Doug Ford said he has spoken with his brother since he entered the program and that he is doing well. 'He's feeling great actually. He's feeling good. He's bought into the program and he's getting the support he needs,' Doug Ford said. City councilor Denzil Minnan-Wong said Doug Ford spoke to Rob again on Tuesday and the mayor was on the phone when Doug passed the phone to him. Minnan-Wong said the mayor is in 'good spirits' and is 'working out.' 'He told me he was in rehab,' Minnan-Wong said. 'I think Rob misses council and he would like to be here.' Shelley Carroll, a Toronto city councilor, said Ford's location should be made public. 'I'm not buying that it can't be divulged,' Carroll said. Councilor Giorgio Mammoliti said the mayor should provide a doctor's note.","A new video shows Toronto mayor stumbling around a bar on April 27 - just before he was filmed allegedly smoking crack at his sister's home .

"A baby orangutan needs certain skills to survive in the wild, right? But how will it learn the essentials without its mother to teach it? This heartwarming video tells the story of an emaciated orangutan called Simanis who is rescued from a well-meaning farmer in Borneo who has kept him as a pet. The orphaned orangutan is one of many being rescued and taken to a sanctuary specially designed to teach apes what they need to survive. Tied up all day and fed a diet of tofu and rice the orangutan has become malnourished. So International Animal Aid sends a team to rehouse the great ape at the Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilition Centre in Sungai Awan, Indonesia. At the sanctuary little Simanis joins a group of other orangutan babies to learn survival skills over the next three years before being released into the wild. Tied up: Simanis has been kept as a pet by a  farmer in Borneo but he is clearly emaciated . The ape is led away by his rescuer, but moments later jumps and clings to the man's leg like a toddler . The video shows the cute youngster clinging onto his rescuer before he is transported to the centre which will care for him over the next three years. One adorable shot shows him being popped into a wheelbarrow with a group of other baby orangutans as they are carted off to their new enclosure. All together now: The newest recruit is joined with other orphans and taken to their new home . Staff at the centre, including vets, local volunteers and workers from all over the world care for the apes and teach them the skills they need such as feeding themselves, grooming themselves and each other and finding safe places to sleep and play. In Borneo, orangutan mothers are killed by poachers who catch and sell their infants as pets, condemning them to years behind bars or in chains. Some orangutans end up being smuggled abroad and imprisoned as exhibits in rundown zoos, private collections or even hotels. International Animal Rescue is a charity which rescues the orphans and ensures they are rehabilitated into the wild.","Orphaned orangutan is rescued from  farmer in Borneo keeping him as a pet .

"Gareth Southgate insists complacency will not jeopardise England’s preparations for Euro 2015 as he urged his Under-21 squad to make another statement of intent. They will be aiming to secure a 12th consecutive victory under Southgate on Monday night when they travel to Brest to face France in a game the head coach believes will provide another step up in their preparations. England’s performances have consistently improved this season and their 3-1 win against Portugal last Thursday was the particularly satisfying for Southgate, as it was secured without a number of players who would be considered first-choice starters. The England Under-21 side will be looking for a 12th consecutive victory under Gareth Southgate . Southgate is confident his players will not get complacent as a result of their impressive form . Long winning sprees at this level, however, can occasionally provide false hope. England, for instance, went to Euro 2013 on the back of nine straight victories without conceding a goal only to flop in the tournament, losing all three games in Israel. But Southgate does not believe a sudden dip will be an issue for this group, as he is certain their preparation — which includes games against the Czech Republic and Germany next March — will not leave them undercooked for the European Championships. ‘We don’t have (complacency) — we certainly wouldn’t tolerate or allow it,’ said Southgate. ‘We ramp up the challenge for them each time and the fixtures will naturally do that. We have not got fixtures between now and the summer that will allow us to take our foot off the gas. Danny Ings (right) celebrates scoring for England against Portugal at Turf Moor last week . ‘Competition for places does that also. A run like the one we have been on would only give you false hope if you were playing teams like we faced in our group. We have covered a lot of things they may face and it will help before we get to the tournament.’ Southgate has a fair idea of which players he will include in his squad next summer and he has again stressed that he will not be looking to flood his 23-man party with some of the big names that are still eligible for selection. The game against Portugal showed the team can function as Southgate wants even when key individuals are absent and the performance at Turf Moor showed how his methods have been taken on board over the last 15 months. ‘That is one of the most pleasing things, really,’ said Southgate. ‘Everyone who comes in knows what we want and that is reflected in the players that we pick.’ Carl Jenkinson wheels away in celebration as the defender, on loan from Arsenal, bags England's second .

"Liverpool left-back Alberto Moreno insists he and his team-mates must get their season back on track to repay the 'amazing' support Reds fans have shown them this season. Moreno, a £12million acquisition from Sevilla in the summer, made a bright start to life in the Barclays Premier League when he scored a spectacular solo goal during Liverpool's 3-0 victory at Tottenham. However, he has since been unable to add to his tally as Liverpool have struggled to replicate the form that saw them finish runners-up to Manchester City last season, with the Merseysiders 11th in the league standings ahead of Sunday's trip to Crystal Palace. Spanish full-back Alberto Moreno joined Liverpool from Sevilla during the summer in a £12million deal . Moreno has paid tribute to Liverpool fans and admits their loyal support gives him extra motivation to improve the club's fortunes on the pitch. 'For me, these supporters are one of the few sets of fans - in fact the best - at really supporting and getting behind their team that I have seen at a football ground,' the 22-year-old Spain international told his club's website. 'It's amazing and my hairs really stand on end every time I hear them cheering us on. I especially love the fact that in spite of these defeats we've had of late, they never stop or tire of supporting the team and are always there for us. The Spain international revealed the supporters at Anfield made his 'hairs stand on end when they cheer us' 'I don't think they'll ever let us down. That's why we really have to turn things around, for that set of supporters that we have, always driving us on, we have to do it for them.' Moreno has quickly settled into life at Liverpool and hopes to remain with the club for many years. 'To be totally honest, I am extremely happy here,' he said. 'I'm overjoyed with how things are going. 'It has really flown by. I think that's important for a player - the months passing by quickly - as it means that things are going well, you are playing regularly and performing quite well. I really hope that I can stay here for a long time to come.'

"With a sad shake of the head, Chris Sutton laments that the foreign legion has taken over English football. In his own Blackburn Rovers' heyday — up front alongside Alan Shearer — the talk on Match of the Day was very much centred on 'the SAS'. The goals of Sutton and Shearer, quickly earning them that tag, ultimately captured the league flag for Kenny Dalglish's Blackburn in 1994-1995, their first title win in 81 years. Chris Sutton (right), pictured holding the Premier League trophy with Alan Shearer, believes there are too many foreign players in England's top-flight . But the English top-flight scene of 2014 is now all about Spain's Diego Costa at Chelsea, Manchester City's Argentinian Sergio Aguero and Alexis Sanchez of Arsenal and Chile. And Sutton believes an over reliance on foreign recruits has driven down the standard of local players, rendering this England side 'underwhelming'. A lacerating pitch-side pundit with BT Sports, Sutton is unconvinced by goalkeeper Joe Hart and defender Phil Jagielka. He also thinks midfielder Fabian Delph is no Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard. Ultimately, though, Sutton blames the English Premier League and its obsession with overseas talent for the roar of the Three Lions being replaced by a whimper. Sutton is unconvinced that Phil Jagielka (right) is good enough to play international football . 'English football is a great watch, it's box office — but it's not English players we are raving about,' said former Norwich, Chelsea and Celtic striker Sutton, who picked up just one cap for England. 'On a Saturday night, when people watch Match Of the Day, they talk about Diego Costa. You don't hear them talking about English players and I think that is a big problem. 'Young English players are finding it harder to get their chance and that has an effect on the national team. 'People talk about changing the manager but Roy Hodgson can only work with what is available to him. 'I don't think there are enough good English players and the current England team is underwhelming. 'They have issues all over the pitch. At the back, I think Joe Hart is under pressure. I like Fraser Forster and I think he deserves an opportunity. Ex-Chelsea striker Sutton thinks it's a shame that people talk about Diego Costa (right) and not English players . 'There are also problems at centre-half. I don't believe Jagielka is good enough to play international football. 'In midfield, they are toying with players to replace Lampard and Gerrard and bringing in the likes of Delph who, to me, isn't an England player. 'Up front, I still like Wayne Rooney. I think he has a big effect on the team and that he gets unfair criticism. But they need to get Daniel Sturridge fit. 'England have a lot to do. I don't think they are up with the best teams in the world, not by a long shot.' In Brazil last summer, England's endured their worst-ever World Cup, finishing bottom of a group that included Italy, Uruguay and Costa Rica. Under Hodgson, they have won four out of four in an admittedly weak qualifying group and are on the brink of reaching Euro 2016 in double-quick time. Sutton, pictured during his time as Lincoln manager, believes England aren't up there with the world's best . But major finals are where England are judged and Sutton wants affirmative action in their Premier League to help restore the national team's fortunes. 'At the World Cup, there was all this stuff about England in the group of death but I still expected them to qualify. 'You must hit the ground running in big tournaments.

"Shuffling feet, buck passing, red faces... welcome to the latest twist in Liverpool’s striker saga. Brendan Rodgers, a manager who apparently could do no wrong last season, now appears unable to get anything right. The Anfield boss thought Daniel Sturridge, Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini would fulfil his team’s goal needs after allowing Luis Suarez to head to Barcelona. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Belgium 3-1 Iceland: Divock Origi goal . Divock Origi, in action against Leighton Baines, is on loan at Lille, but Liverpool want him back at the club . Origi was on target for Belgium in their 3-1 victory against Iceland earlier this week . Origi (No 17) is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after netting against Iceland on Wednesday . Divock Origi has scored five goals for club and country this season - but was poor at Everton last month and has not scored in his last seven matches. Sturridge, 24 goals last season, fair enough and Rodgers was not to know he would be injured so early in the season. Sturridge’s one goal, against Southampton, was way back in August. But £16million Balotelli was always going to be a gamble, Lambert a steady-eddie from the bench and, as for Borini, he has only ever been seen as a make-weight. The trio have not scored in 998 minutes of Premier League action between them and that puts a question mark on another Rodgers decision. He sanctioned a £10million splurge on Belgian teenager Divock Origi from Lille then loaned him back to the French club for the whole of this season. £16million striker Mario Balotelli, in action against Chelsea, is yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League . Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert, a summer signing from Southampton, have struggled this season . Now Rodgers wants the 19-year-old, who became the youngest scorer in Belgian World Cup history in the summer, for Liverpool. But there is one stumbling block – Lille will want compensation for cutting short the loan agreement. Surely Liverpool should have thought of that before allowing him to go back? A call-back option in January is hardly unusual in these circumstances. Origi was not cheap at the initial price but his purchase could now be very expensive indeed, more money needlessly spent. The exciting young talent of Kenyan descent was being chased by the Africans earlier this year before Marc Wilmots stepped in and selected him for Brazil 2014. Daniel Sturridge, in the stands for Liverpool's defeat against Chelsea, is closing in on a return to action . Luis Suarez moved to Barcelona in the summer and Liverpool are sorely missing his services . Brendan Rodgers is enduring a difficult season . Pre-World Cup the talk was all about Romelu Lukaku and the injured Christian Benteke but it was Origi who caught the eye on the biggest stage of all. This year he has scored five goals in French football and netted for his country in Belgium’s 3-1 win over Iceland this week. And that makes him a valuable commodity on Merseyside right now, where things are going from bad to worse for Rodgers. Compare Origi with the current Liverpool crop. Balotelli has two goals this season, neither of them in 685 minutes of league action. He has started in eight of his nine league appearances this season. Last year the Italian scored 14 goals, which is not a bad return in Serie A, but it appears to have been a flash in the pan judging by his efforts so far for Liverpool. Talking about flash in the pan, Borini, 23, first appeared on the radar in 2011 with six goals in nine appearances on loan at Swansea. Liverpool paid £10.5m to Parma for his services but he was never going to get a look-in with Suarez and Sturridge in full cry. On loan at Sunderland last season, Borini netted nine goals for a struggling side. So far he has been a substitute in three of his four matches. England winger Raheem Sterling is Liverpool's top scorer this season with three goals to his name . Lambert, 32, will be feeling the most wretched. He is a lifelong Liverpool fan and must have thought all his dreams had come true with his £4m switch from Southampton. The England forward scored 14 goals for Saints last season but has been forced to take a back seat at Anfield. He has come on as a substitute in three of his four matches. Last year Rodgers was in charge of a team who were title contenders thanks to the most devastating striking partnership in the Premier League. Filling the hole left by Suarez was always going to be a big ask. But the fact of the matter is that Liverpool’s top scorer in the League so far is winger Raheem Sterling, with three goals and December approaching. Time to send out an SOS to Origi?","Brendan Rodgers sanctioned £10m move for Origi but sent him out on loan .

"FIFA are diseased and corrupt. These monsters always get away with it... The FIFA World Cup corruption saga took another twist on Tuesday night when football’s world governing body lodged a criminal complaint in Switzerland over the misconduct of certain unnamed individuals. It follows the recommendation of ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to FIFA president Sepp Blatter that the shadowy international transfer of assets to Switzerland in isolated cases was serious enough to be reported to the Office of the Attorney General in Bern. The decision by Eckert, chairman of FIFA’s ethics adjudicatory chamber, comes less than a week after his summary of colleague Michael Garcia’s investigation into the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes, which took nearly two years, was widely discredited as a ‘whitewash’. FIFA president Sepp Blatter announces Qatar as the hosts for the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 . Michael Garcia (left) and Hans-Joachim Eckhart have been tarnished by FIFA's probe into the World Cup vote . The report was also disowned by Garcia, who is taking his case of misrepresentation to the FIFA appeals committee. Eckert’s conclusions ridiculously apportioned a lot of the blame to England’s doomed 2018 bid that gleaned only two votes. But there was no suggestion even in his skewed findings that England’s bid team had illegally transferred assets into Switzerland. Michael Garcia (left), former US Attorney for New York and Hans-Joachim Eckert (right), the German judge . Football's world governing body has come under enormous scrutiny after its handling of the World Cup vote . And although FIFA would not speculate, the only conclusion to be drawn is that the criminal complaints allegedly involve FIFA’s two former executive committee rogues - Jack Warner and Mohamed Bin Hammam. Both are outside football’s jurisdiction with Warner, almost omnipresent in incidents of World Cup bid-related corruption, having resigned all his positions in the game and Bin Hammam having been banned for life after his cash-for-votes attempt to bribe his way to the FIFA presidency. Eckert also reiterated, to FIFA’s website, that Russia and Qatar are clear to host the next two World Cups, adding ‘there was insufficient clear evidence of illegal or irregular conduct that would call into question the integrity of the award process’.

The fall-out has been extensive since FIFA on Thursday published a report investigating the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Here are the events since the release of a 42-page report by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's independent ethics committee, in his ruling on Michael Garcia's investigation. NOVEMBER 12, 2014 . FIFA announces the initial findings of the investigation into the bidding process for the next two World Cups will be published on Thursday morning, with England expected to come in for some criticism for the attempt to woo former FIFA vice-president Jack Warner. NOVEMBER 13 . England are indeed condemned for rules violations in their bid for the 2018 tournament, but Russia and Qatar are effectively confirmed as hosts for 2018 and 2022 respectively, the report stating any rule breaches by them were 'of very limited scope'. The Football Association rejects 'any criticism' of England's bid, with a spokesman saying: 'We conducted a transparent bid and, as the report demonstrates with its reference to the England bid team's 'full and valuable co-operation', willingly complied with the investigation.' FIFA's chief ethics investigator Garcia announces he will appeal against the findings, saying the report contains 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions' in his original report. NOVEMBER 14 . Eckert admits his 'surprise' at Garcia's plans to appeal and adds: 'I will talk to Garcia but until then I will make no more statements.' Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore claims it is 'grossly unfair' for England to have borne the brunt of criticism and adds: 'The Garcia report should be out there in full.' American FIFA member Sunil Gulati and FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb from the Cayman Islands issue a joint statement also calling for Garcia's report to be published in full. FIFA confirms receipt of Garcia's intention to appeal. NOVEMBER 16 . Former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson claims FIFA ran a 'Wild West' bidding process for the two tournaments which encouraged would-be hosts to enter into inappropriate behaviour. NOVEMBER 17 . Football Association chairman Greg Dyke writes to FIFA executive committee members calling for 'urgent action' to ensure Garcia's report is published in full, claiming public confidence in FIFA has hit a new low and that there is 'compelling evidence' of wrongdoing. Phaedra Almajid and Bonita Mersiades, members of the Qatar and Australia 2022 bid teams respectively and key whistleblowers in the original corruption allegations, register separate complaints against Eckert claiming his report breached promises of confidentiality. Almajid's statement labels Eckert's report 'a crude, cynical and fundamentally erroneous description of me and the information and materials I provided the investigation'. Former Football Association chairman David Bernstein urges European nations to boycott the 2018 World Cup unless FIFA undergoes serious reform - including Sepp Blatter not standing for re-election as president. NOVEMBER 18 . FIFA lodges a criminal complaint with the Swiss attorney general over 'possible misconduct' by individuals in connection with the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. The move follows a recommendation by FIFA's ethics judge Eckert as part of his findings into the Garcia investigation on World Cup bidding. FIFA president Blatter has insisted however that the lodging of the criminal complaint does not affect Eckert's statement last week that the investigation into the bidding process for the two World Cups is concluded.

"Wigan have been urged not to appoint Malky Mackay as their new manager by local MP Lisa Nandy. The former Cardiff City boss has emerged as a front-runner to replace Uwe Rosler, who was sacked by Wigan owner Dave Whelan on Thursday. Sportsmail’s exclusive revelations surrounding the exchange of racist, homophobic and sexist texts and email messages by Mackay and former head of recruitment Iain Moody while at Cardiff have left some Wigan supporters threatening to stop attending games if the Scot is appointed. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Malky Mackay 'I'm not racist, homophobic, sexist or anti-Semitic' Wigan have been urged not to appoint Malky Mackay as their new manager by their local MP . Lisa Nandy (left) wrote a letter directly to the club and chairman Dave Whelan (right) about the unrest . Uwe Rosler was sacked as boss on Thursday, but fans could boycott games should Mackay be appointed . MP Lisa Nandy sent this letter to Wigan chairman Dave Whelan after being contacted about Malky Mackay . Disgruntled fans — including at least one shareholder and long-term season-ticket holders — have emailed and written to Wigan stating they plan to boycott matches. Nandy — MP for Wigan — wrote to Whelan having been contacted by a number of concerned constituents and Wigan fans. She wrote: ‘Whoever is appointed will be an ambassador for this town and based on the work your club has done to tackle discrimination over the years I am confident you would seek to ensure that they share these values. ‘I am sure that Wigan Athletic would not appoint anyone without ensuring first that they have respect for other people, regardless of gender, sexuality, ethnicity or religion.’ However, Wigan issued a statement insisting they were not close to making any decision. It read: ‘Since (announcing the decision to axe Rosler) we have not discussed any individual or drawn up a short list, never mind actually contacting any potential candidates or their agents. Sportsmail revealed the exchange of 'racist, homophobic and sexist' texts and email messages by Mackay and Iain Moody (right) while at Cardiff . ‘As such, I can categorically deny that any one candidate is ahead of any other as regards being appointed as the next manager of Wigan Athletic.’ Mackay, 42, is still under investigation by the FA, with disciplinary chiefs struggling with the issue over what is deemed private and public communication. Show Racism the Red Card patron and ambassador Leroy Rosenior said: ‘I don’t understand how Malky Mackay can be considered for the Wigan job while still under investigation for sending racist and offensive messages. ‘Sadly, I am not surprised, as it has long been my view that football as a whole does not seem to believe that racism is a problem and chairmen are always more concerned with issues on the pitch than anything that happens off it.’ The Scottish boss was sacked as Cardiff manager last season and has yet to return to football . May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City. June 2011: After Dave Jones is sacked following a Championship play-off semi-final defeat, Malky Mackay is appointed manager. February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time. May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post. Tan controversially decides that the club’s shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon — causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters. September 2012: Tan replaces the club’s chief executive, Alan Whiteley (left), with associate Simon Lim. April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship. August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment. October 2013: Mackay’s head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov (right), reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds. December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘a single penny’ for transfers. December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked. December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager ‘for the foreseeable future’. December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan. December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager.","Lisa Nandy says she has been contacted by many fans voicing their unrest .

"Liverpool have been dealt a blow in their bid to bring Divock Origi back from Lille after the striker confirmed he will remain in France for the remainder of the season. Brendan Rodgers had given the green light to pay an increase on the £10million fee they agreed with Lille to accelerate Origi’s release in January. The Belgium forward, whom Rodgers believes will be a ‘world-class striker’, joined Liverpool in August but was immediately loaned back to Lille to continue his development before heading to Anfield next summer. Divock Origi (No 17) is congratulated by his Belgium team-mates after scoring against Iceland on Wednesday . The 20-year-old, scoring against Iceland, is staying with French side Lille until the end of the season . But such is Liverpool’s keenness to bring Origi in to the fold they were ready to pay a premium to get him in the new year. But Origi confirmed on Friday afternoon that he won’t return to the Anfield club until the end of the current campaign. ‘I just wanted to clarify after today's press reports that I will continue to give my all and 100 per cent for Lille over the coming months,’ Origi said via his Twitter account. ‘I am very much looking forward to joining Liverpool from next season.’ Rodgers’ side have been desperately short of goals, with Daniel Sturridge missing 14 games through injury and Rickie Lambert, Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini struggling. The trio have failed to find the net in 998 minutes of Premier League action. The 20-year-old, pictured in action against Origi, but the Belgian will not play in the Premier League this term . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers wanted to bring Lille back into the Liverpool fold in the new year . Lille gave no indication that they would be willing to re-jig the original terms of the deal, which meant Origi would stay the full season in France, and hand the striker to Liverpool early - even if the 19-year-old admitted earlier this week that he would be happy to move in January. ‘It is not me who makes the decisions but if the club choose to let me go in January I would go, I would like to join Liverpool then,’ said Origi, who scored for Belgium in their 3-1 win over Iceland on Wednesday. ‘I said I would stay for the whole season and I wish to remain honourable in that, of course. But if there was a decision by the clubs, I would not say I wouldn’t like to go to Liverpool in January. Brendan Rodgers is in contact, he (speaks) regularly, he wants to know how I am feeling. ‘It makes me feel very good and wanted. Also the medical staff, they stay in touch for the same reason – to keep me involved, telling me that they are looking forward to me coming to the club.

"Malky Mackay is the outstanding favourite for the Wigan Athletic job with an appointment expected to be made soon. The former Cardiff manager has been out of the game since he was sacked from the South Wales club last Christmas and is currently under investigation by the FA after Sportsmail revealed details of offensive texts exchanged between the Scot and his former head of recruitment at Cardiff Iain Moody. Now, however, Mackay looks set for a way back after positive dialogue with Wigan chairman and owner Dave Whelan. Malky Mackay is the favourite to become the new manager of Wigan Athletic despite an ongoing investigation by the Football Association into offensive text messages exchanged with Iain Moody . Whelan said: 'I believe he deserves a fair hearing. 'We’ve had over 20 applications and started interviews on Tuesday. Hopefully we can make an appointment before the game this weekend against Middlesbrough. 'It’s an important job and I don’t like to mess around when I think I’ve got the right person. 'All the fans in Wigan, they all have total trust in me. Because I have one thing in my heart, that is Wigan Athletic. So they have trust in me and I would say to them all, you can trust me on this one. I have investigated every single aspect I can, I think Malky has been so unlucky. 'He has done a little bit wrong and has apologised for it. But to all fans, I want them to trust me. This gentleman is in my opinion exactly the man we are looking for. It is awful when you have to sack a manager, I had a terrible week last week, it hurt me a lot because he (Rosler) is such a nice guy. 'Football is a cruel game, I am sure Malky has found the little thing he did wrong, he has had plenty of stick for it.' It is understood that Mackay and Whelan have already met and that the Wigan owner has been impressed by the 42-year-old’s plans for the club. Wigan chairman Dave Whelan said he believes Mackay 'deserves a fair hearing' Mackay led Cardiff to a Carling Cup Final and from the Championship in to the Barclays Premier League during his time there. The Welsh club were never in the bottom three of the Premier League on his watch but went down once he was replaced at the start of the year by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. However, the former West Ham, Norwich and Celtic defender’s reputation hit rock bottom earlier this season when Sportsmail revealed texts between him and Moody contained racist, sexist and homophobic material. He could still be charged by the FA – something that could cause a problem for Wigan – but it is thought the Association are struggling to discipline him under the terms of its own rules because the texts were deemed to be private. Mackay is under investigation over alleged offensive text message sent to Iain Moody (left) when they worked together at Cardiff City . Uwe Rosler was sacked as Wigan manager last week following a poor start to the season . Wigan captain Gary Caldwell has said he would back Mackay if appointed. He told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast on talkSPORT: 'Oh yeah. I know Malky from playing with him for Scotland and he’s a great guy, and a stand-up, honest man. I would have no problems working with him and no problems at all speaking to him. 'He’s done a great job since he’s been a manager. He’s had that experience of promotion with Cardiff and we want people at the club who know how to get success and get us back to where we want to be, and that’s the Premier League.'","Malky Mackay is the favourite for the vacant Wigan job .

"For most women pregnancy might be tough – but it is also a time of great hope and expectation. For Marlen von Roth, however, it became a recurring ordeal as she defied doctors’ warnings that her babies could be born with Down’s syndrome. When the 33-year-old account manager became pregnant with her first two children, she was told both times after routine tests that her babies may have the condition. But after she refused to undergo invasive further screening due to the risk of miscarriage, Lukas, now five, and two-year-old Sophia were born with no abnormalities. Miss von Roth said the routine Down’s tests had ‘ruined’ her pregnancies and urged other women to think seriously before having them. Indeed, when she became pregnant for a third time with daughter Anna, now eight months, she decided not to undergo screening at all. Scroll down for video . Safe and sound: Marien von Roth with her children, Sophia, two, Lukas, five, and eight-month-old Anna . The initial test, offered to all pregnant women at 12 weeks, measures hormones in the blood. This is assessed along with an ultrasound scan to work out if a baby has a heightened chance of Down’s. During Miss von Roth’s first pregnancy, she and her managing director husband Paul Freshwater, 41, were told there was a one in 700 likelihood that Lukas had the condition. With Sophia, the chance was one in 24. For healthy pregnant women in their 20s, the risk of Down’s is usually lower than one in 1,000. Miss von Roth claims each time doctors put her under pressure to have Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS), an invasive further test. But due to the risk of miscarriage caused by CVS – during which fluid is taken from the umbilical cord for analysis – she refused. Miss von Roth, who lives in Ashtead, Surrey, said: ‘After being given such drastic news – which turned out to be wrong – I spent my whole pregnancies obsessed my children might not be healthy. I couldn’t just relax and enjoy the experience.’ Recalling her pregnancy with Lukas, she said: ‘I was devastated when I got a phone call saying the test showed a higher risk of having a baby with Down’s syndrome. ‘Doctors wanted me to undergo a CVS test, but I refused because by then I’d discovered the risk of miscarriage – around one to two babies in 100 – was higher than my chance of having a baby with Down’s.’ Lukas was born healthy in July 2009. But the nightmare recurred with Sophia two years later. ‘Medical staff were very negative when I refused [a CVS],’ Miss von Roth said. ‘It shocked me how keen they were for me to go in so fast for an invasive test that could have caused a miscarriage, simply so I could be “reassured”. ‘I couldn’t have lived with myself if that had resulted in me losing my precious daughter.’ By the time she became pregnant with Anna, she decided not to have the test. ‘Paul and I felt even if we were having a baby with Down’s we would not terminate the pregnancy,’ she said. ‘I am shocked at the thought that so many women must have further tests to be “reassured” only to lose a healthy baby.’","Marien von Roth defied doctors' warnings that her babies could be born with Down's syndrome .

"The mother of a child with Down's syndrome has created a range of baskets filled with gifts and information designed to be given to new parents when their baby is diagnosed with the condition. Carissa Carroll, a mother of two from Shoreview, Minnesota, came up with the idea as a way to help other parents come to terms with the often intimidating idea of bringing up a child with the disorder. Mrs Carroll named the packages 'Jack's Baskets' as she thought of the idea around the time of her son's first birthday. Each one comes with a selection of presents for the baby, as well as a welcome letter that congratulates the new parents and gives them practical information on the condition. Inspiration: Carissa Carroll (right) named the packages 'Jack's Baskets' as she thought of the idea around the time of the first birthday of her son Jack (pictured right in her arms, and left with his brother Luke) Packages: Mrs Carroll, from Shoreview, Minnesota, hopes the baskets will help other parents come to terms with the often intimidating idea of bringing up a child with Down's syndrome . Mrs Carroll's baby baskets are intended to bring joy and relief to families at a moment in their lives where they may be experiencing anxiety over the prospect of raising a child with Down's syndrome. Although each basket costs the Carroll family $60 to make, they have proved so popular that donations have started pouring in. So far there is enough money in the pot to make a further 130 baskets to bring comfort and happiness to families across America. The letter Mrs Carroll writes to new families reads: 'Hello, my name is Carissa and I would love to be one of the first people to congratulate you on your newest addition to your family. Congratulations! I also want you to know I have also experienced receiving unexpected news. 'My husband and I welcomed our son, Jack, and were told at birth that he was born with an extra chromosome and has Down syndrome. There were moments of confusion, grief of what we thought our lives would be like, and fear. Please know that you are not alone in your feelings,' she adds. The letter - a version of which appears on Mrs Caroll's blog - Strength for the Climb - goes on to describe the ways in which her son has brought joy into the lives of his family members. Celebration: Carissa Carroll said her son Jack has made her see life in a 'much more beautiful way' Newborn: The baby baskets are intended to bring joy and relief to families at a moment in their lives where they may be experiencing anxiety over the sudden prospect of raising a child with Down's syndrome . Speaking of her decision to create Jack's Baskets, Mrs Carroll told ABC News: 'One of the things that helped me so much in those early days were the words of encouragement from parents of kids with Down syndrome that are thriving and wouldn't change their children for the world.' 'I've not met a family that has not been positively affected by their loved one with Down syndrome. But nine out of 10 people have a terrible experience in the hospital' she added. 'We need to bridge the gap between medical professionals and families,' she went on to say. As well as her letter of congratulations and information about the U.S. Down Syndrome Diagnosis Network, Mrs Carroll also includes a number of her son's favourite toys in the baskets. Each one is delivered to the parents without warning, giving them a positive surprise to match the often scary and sudden news that their newborn child has Down's.

There is now enough money in the pot to make a further 130 baskets . Heather Ellis, who received one of Jack's Baskets for her newborn son Dylan earlier this week said: 'It was such a nice surprise to be given this wonderful gift from a family who is raising a son with Down syndrome and could share their story with us. 'With not having any close friends or family members that have kids with Down syndrome, we didn't know what to expect or who we could talk to,' added Ms Ellis, who had no idea that Dylan had the condition until after he was born.

"A replica of one of the most complete examples of early man has gone on display in South Africa. The Iziko Museum in Cape Town is hosting the standing model of an Australopithecus sediba this week, which was donated by a university in Johannesburg. It is the first museum in Africa to exhibit a cast of the find. Ancient: The replica is of a species believed to have walked the earth almost 2million years ago . Comparison: The skeleton is thought to represent an ancestor of modern man. Pictured are skulls of other examples of early man . Australopithecus sediba is from the same biology family as Homo sapiens - humankind - and some experts theorise that the animal eventually evolved into present-day versions of humanity. The species is thought to have walked the earth around 2million years ago, and could be a crucial step along the evolutionary path to modern man. The replica skeleton on display - known as 'Karabo' is believed to have belonged to a juvenile male. An adult male, an adult female and three infant skeletons have also been found. Although the find dates only from 2008, though it was kept secret by researchers for two years until its existence was announced in 2010. Dsiplay: Tke skeleton replica is being exhibited at Iziko Museum in Cape Town, South Africa . Lee Berger, a paleontologist, was walking with his nine-year-old son Matthew at a dig site near Johannesburg when he found a buried collarbone. On further digging, researchers found parts of a skull, teeth and most of the rest of the body of the young skeleton, which stands just over 4ft tall. The fossilised bones, which are remarkably well-preserved, are thought to have been buried when Karabo fell into a deep pit with a soft, sandy bottom which could have buried him.","Australopithecus sediba is going on display at Iziko Museum in Cape Town .

"The woman who cheated on a Chelsea footballer with his teammate claims she only had the affair after her boyfriend strayed with another woman. Rumours about a love-triangle between Caroline Lijnen, Kevin de Bruyne and Thibaut Courtois - all Belgians - first began in April 2013, but Miss Lijnen has now given her side of the story.

She claims Courtois wined and dined her in the Spanish capital and provided her with the engaging company that De Bruyne could not during their three-year relationship. Speaking to Story Magazine in Belgium she said: 'Kevin cheated on me. I did not say anything for months because I couldn't say anything, as Kevin's parents said they would take legal action if I gave my story. I was under pressure and I could not have contact with Kevin. 'I respected everything. But in his book Keep It Simple, Kevin wrote a passage about my affair with Thibaut. So, I decided to remain silent no longer. 'In the summer of 2012, Kevin told me that he had an affair with my old best friend. I gave him the choice: her or me. I was ready to give him another chance, but our relationship was never the same afterwards. '[I then went to Madrid, and even] Kevin thought that this trip was a good idea. I asked him beforehand. But then something happened that should never have happened. 'That evening, Thibaut offered me what I had not received during a three-year relationship with Kevin.

Defending champion Djokovic will play the winner of Saturday night's remaining semi-final between Swiss compatriots Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka.

Djokovic at full stretch to return a forehand to Nishikori during the semi-final match at the O2 Arena . Djokovic was bidding for revenge in his first meeting with Nishikori since losing an epic four-set match in the semi-finals of the US Open in September. And in fitting with the theme of the tournament so far, Djokovic claimed an early break for 3-1 as Nishikori put a volley wide and then raced to the opening set in 23 minutes, dropping just two points on serve. Things looked ominous for Nishikori as he was broken in the opening game of the second set but it was at this point the match turned. Djokovic played a poor service game as he attempted to consolidate, hitting a double fault to gift the break back and then sarcastically applauded the crowd as they cheered.

"James Taylor is used to wisecracks about his height. But when Kevin Pietersen’s scattergun autobiography took aim and pulled the trigger, the 5ft5in Taylor looked likely to become just another piece of collateral damage in English cricket’s civil war. Now, as he prepares for England’s seven-match one-day series in Sri Lanka — a tour that will help the selectors finalise their plans for the World Cup — Taylor is in the mood to fire a few shots of his own. Pietersen’s disregard for Taylor’s ability stems from his Test debut against South Africa at Headingley in 2012. In the first innings, while Pietersen was crashing a sensational 149, Taylor made 34. Kevin Pietersen was critical of the way James Taylor batted against South Africa at Headingley in 2012 . It was a quiet but crucial innings. The pair added 147. Pietersen, though, had made up his mind. In KP: The Autobiography, he writes: ‘His dad was a jockey and James is built for the same gig. We were facing the fiercest bowling attack in the world. I didn’t think he was up to it.’ Pietersen took his concerns to coach Andy Flower, and — after Taylor was out — told next batsman, Matt Prior: ‘Listen, batting is easy. Taylor was just making it look hard. The South Africans were laughing at him. Just relax.’ There is some dispute about whether Pietersen belittled Taylor in the dressing room. But one thing is clear: a ringing endorsement it was not. In his autobiography, Pietersen (right) said that Taylor was 'built for the same gig' as his dad - a jockey . Taylor has only played two Tests for England, both against South Africa during the summer of 2012 . Taylor was dropped after making 10 and four in the next game at Lord’s and has not played Test cricket since. He said: ‘Plenty of people have slagged me off behind my back and he is just another one of them. It is plenty of years ago. ‘I haven’t spoken to him since and it doesn’t really bother me.’ Asked about their relationship now, Taylor said with a smile: ‘Me and Kevin are friends — we had a nice exchange on Twitter.’ What he may find genuinely amusing, however, was Pietersen’s attempts to justify his contempt. ‘The poor guy has never been seen again,’ writes Pietersen. ‘So I was wrong about Taylor, was I?’ Taylor’s performances for Nottinghamshire in last season’s 50-over Royal London One-Day Cup suggest Pietersen might have crowed too early. Taylor scored three hundreds and averaged 88 for Nottinghamshire in the Royal London Cup last season . Taylor's only two one-day international appearances to date have both been against Ireland . In seven innings Taylor crashed three hundreds, averaged 88 and had a strike-rate of 96. Only Kent’s talented wicketkeeper-batsman Sam Billings hit more than his 15 sixes. And every time one of Nottinghamshire’s games was televised, Taylor seemed to rise to the occasion. ‘As you have seen more over the last six months I can hit the ball as far as anybody and as cleanly as most,’ said Taylor, who was speaking to promote Royal London’s sponsorship of the PCA’s Benevolent Fund. ‘In my eyes my height has never proved a problem. Sachin (Tendulkar) is not that tall (he is also 5ft5in). I can pack a good punch and I can perform in pressure situations.’ He might also have added that, at the age of just 24, he has already made 12 List A centuries, from 97 innings. Pietersen has 15 from 233, and averages 40 to Taylor’s 53. Now he will have the chance to take his game to the next level. Aside from those two Tests against the world’s best pace attack, Taylor has played only two one-day internationals, both against Ireland. The experience has added to his drive. ‘I have been frustrated to say the least that I haven’t had a more consistent shot,’ he said. India's little master Sachin Tendulkar is widely regarded as the best batsman ever despite his height . ‘I didn’t get told an official reason. The only thing I got told was to go away and score more runs, which I consistently did in all three formats.Everybody can say they are mentally strong but I think that is one of my strengths. ‘I have been knocked down plenty of times and I will be knocked down plenty more. It is how you bounce back. ‘A big thing that spurs me on is proving people wrong. With my size I am going to have plenty of doubters. I have proved them wrong over the years and I will prove plenty more people wrong over the next few months and years.’ If the process begins in Sri Lanka, the selectors may just be able to pencil in a middle-order name for the World Cup.","James Taylor returns to England side for one-day series in Sri Lanka .

"On a hotel terrace in Rio de Janeiro, Fabio Capello was asked for his opinion on the state of Italy’s team. Then the England manager, the Italian shook his head before expressing what a pity it was that their brightest young player was such a troublesome individual. Capello appeared to see it as something of a national tragedy, and something that would undermine Italy’s chances of success there in Brazil three years later. Mario Balotelli was 21 at the time, and younger still when Jose Mourinho all but wrote him off too. The precociously gifted striker, Mourinho had concluded in their time together at Inter Milan, was ‘unmanageable’. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers speaks with Reds striker Mario Balotelli during training on Wednesday . The Liverpool frontman has struggled for form during the first three months of the his career at Anfield . The Italy international has long had a reputation for being a talented but troublesome individual . Former England boss Fabio Capello felt Italy's chances of World Cup glory would be undermined by Balotelli . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was in charge of Balotelli at Inter  but claimed the striker was 'unmanageable' Balotelli scored his first goal in nine matches for the Reds against Swansea in the League Cup on Wednesday . Quite how Balotelli responds to such damning verdicts I couldn’t say. He’s not a player I’ve had the opportunity to interview. But I suspect even the most cocksure young man, one trying to make his way in a tough profession, would be sensitive to the opinions of two of the finest football managers in Europe. I’d consider it more likely such words would cut deep, given that rejection has been such a central theme in Balotelli’s life. As we know, his childhood was spent mostly in foster care. And even if those foster parents were as wonderful as he says, so wonderful he eventually adopted their surname, those formative years must have been tough when the authorities had to place him in care when he was three-years-old. To begin with he would spend weekends with his biological parents and siblings, but eventually that stopped too. It was not until his 18th birthday that Balotelli was able to apply for Italian citizenship. But he did so because he felt more Balotelli than Barwuah, his biological Ghanaian family name.

League appearances: 7 Goals: 0 . *Balotelli's two goals for the Reds so far this season have come against Ludogorets in the Champions League and Swansea in the Capital One Cup . He had rejected a senior international call-up from Ghana when he was just 16, opting instead to play for Italy and eventually making his debut two days before his 20th birthday. If he adopted Italy not everyone in Italy was quite so keen to adopt him. As an 18-year-old playing for Inter he was racially abused by Juventus supporters, and suffered further abuse from supporters of other clubs the following season. None of this necessarily excuses his behaviour these past few years but it might go some way to explaining why he can pose problems even for skilled man-managers of the pedigree of Mourinho. Balotelli’s behaviour has exposed not only a lack of maturity but a lack of judgement. He can be surly, selfish, unruly, and a huge frustration to his coaches given how brilliant he so often is in training. But does that mean he should be dismissed as a lost cause? Does that mean every manager out there should consider him more trouble than he’s worth? Or do you attempt to harness that considerable potential, attempt to show him some understanding and hope that, in time, a player who is still only 24 can mature into a proper professional? It is abundantly clear Balotelli was not at the top of the shopping list Brendan Rodgers scribbled down after losing Luis Suarez to Barcelona. Liverpool’s manager admitted it was ‘a calculated risk’, even if £16million might amount to a fairly expensive risk. But a swapped shirt, a flicked ear and some indifferent appearances aside, just how big a headache has he so far proved for his latest employers? Balotelli was not one of Brendan Rodgers' top targets but joined the club in a £16million deal from AC Milan . The Italian swapped shirts with Real Madrid's Pepe as the Reds trailed at half-time in the Champions League . I’m told he hasn’t been fined and he hasn’t once been late for training, even if Rodgers has taken steps to make sure he is always punctual by having a driver take him to and from his new home in Formby on Merseyside. He has not been a nuisance in training. On the contrary, he appears to be popular among his team-mates and committed to working hard. This week Daniel Sturridge said as much. If Rodgers says he wants to change Balotelli, it is more in the way he plays than in the way he conducts himself. Liverpool manager Rodgers is keen to help and improve the former Manchester City frontman . VIDEO Mario isn't to blame - Rodgers . He wants to see more movement and he wants to see him occupy a role that will create an effective partnership with Sturridge once the England striker has returned from injury. In a newspaper column Michael Owen suggests Rodgers is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, but let’s see. Rodgers will work with Balotelli and at the same time he wants Balotelli to work with Dr Steve Peters, in the hope that the prominent sports psychiatrist can help him develop into the player Liverpool’s manager sincerely hopes he can become. Peters is not a miracle worker, and earlier this year far too much emphasis was put on the role that he plays. To the point, in fact, where it all became nonsensical and rather unfair. Rodgers wants Balotelli to work with Dr. Steve Peters, hoping the sports psychiatrist can help the striker . Peters, pictured with Sir Trevor Brooking and Roy Hodgson, worked with the England team at the World Cup . When Liverpool lost out on the title, it was somehow Peters’ fault. When Ronnie O’Sullivan lost the world snooker final, again it was Peters’ fault. Indeed when England followed a spirited display against Italy (albeit one devalued by a Balotelli goal) with two utterly woeful performances, it was Peters’ fault. Never mind that Peters had only a few weeks with the players. Any apparent mental weakness was down to him. All Peters can ever do is give an athlete the tools he believes can help them achieve their goals. After that it still very much remains up to the athlete. But ask Jonathan Trott how important a role Peters has played in enabling him to overcome a stress-related illness and return to top class cricket. This week he was invited to tour with the England Lions this winter. Ask O’Sullivan how Peters guided him back from the brink of premature retirement and helped him to win more world titles. Ask Sir Bradley Wiggins and Victoria Pendleton the extent to which Peters helped them achieve their success. Asked Sir Dave Brailsford why Peters is such a valued member of his staff. Balotelli climbs above Gary Cahill to power a header past Joe Hart as Italy beat England 1-0 in Group D . Balotelli celebrates after heading past former Man City team-mate Hart during the World Cup in Brazil . Suarez did not work with Peters as much as Rodgers would have liked, and it might help explain why a season when he appeared to be making such progress concluded with him biting another opponent at the World Cup. But I only have to listen to Trott to believe that if anyone can help Balotelli conquer whatever demons might still be troubling him, it is Peters. It might not work, and what Rodgers is trying to do might not work either. But let’s at least give them a bit of time.","Mario Balotelli has struggled for form since moving to Anfield .

"Two men have been arrested in New Jersey on charges that they took part in kidnapping an Orthodox Jewish husband to force him to grant his wife a religious divorce. The thugs beat him and shocked him with a stun gun on his fingers and genitals. David Aryeh Epstein, 39, and Chaim Baruch Rubin, 32, of Lakewood are charged with kidnapping. Like father, like son: Last year Rabbi Mendel Epstein was arrested for allegedly offering to kidnap and torture husbands so they'd grant their wives divorces. Now his son, David Aryeh Epstein, 39, is accused of the exact same thing . Epstein is the son of Mendel Epstein, a 68-year-old Brooklyn rabbi who was accused of similar charges last fall. According to court documents unsealed Thursday, the uncooperative husband in the most recent case was also engaged in a contested divorce. During the summer of 2009, the husband separated from his wife and moved out of the family’s  Brooklyn home. In November of the same year, as the victim walked to his car one evening after staying late at work, he was attacked by a group of men, the complaint says. The two suspects then abducted the husband dragging him into a van, bound with duct tape and zip ties before being brutally beaten and shocked with a stun gun. They they used an electric cattle prod on his genitals until he granted his estranged wife a Jewish divorce. Investigation: The arrests come after a lengthy investigation that started more than two years ago in the ultra-Orthodox community in Lakewood, New Jersey . Under Orthodox Jewish law, a wife cannot get a religious divorce unless the husband agrees to give her a 'get,' a document she needs for the divorce to go through. The men told the husband they 'were willing to do whatever needed to be done,' according to the affidavit, including breaking his bones. To show they were serious, they used a cattle prod to shock the husband's fingers and genitals. At some point during the beating, Rubin got in the front seat of the van. In January, the victim saw a photo of David Epstein and identified him as one of the men who attacked him. The complaint says a rabbi pointed a video camera at the victim, telling him to repeat the words needed for a get. After the victim refused, the driver began stomping on the victim until he agreed. The husband 'relented and recited the words as directed by the rabbi,' according to court documents. The victim, no longer religiously married, was driven to another location and tossed from the van. After finding his way to a house nearby, he called for help. He was taken to a local emergency room where he was treated for broken ribs, a bruised spine and other injuries. If convicted, the defendants face a maximum potential penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine. Charged: David Aryeh Epstein, 39, and Chaim Baruch Rubin, 32, of Lakewood are charged with kidnapping . Both men appeared Thursday in federal court in Trenton and were released on $500,000 bail with home detention and electronic monitoring. David Epstein's father, Mendel Epstein, was charged in October 2013 with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, along with nine other people, accused of plotting to kidnap and torture an Orthodox Jewish man to force a religious divorce. Mendel and David Epstein were also implicated in the May 6 guilty plea of David Wax to similar charges. Wax, 51, of Lakewood pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiracy to commit kidnapping in a 2010 case, authorities said. The . arrests come after a lengthy investigation that started more than two . years ago in the ultra-Orthodox community in Lakewood, New Jersey.","David Aryeh Epstein, 39, and Chaim Baruch Rubin, 32, are charged with kidnapping .

Compton joined Somerset for the 2010 season after representing Middlesex - whose home ground of Lord's has a stand named after his grandfather, Denis - between 2004 and 2009. The move was a success and he was given a Test call in 2012, going on to play nine Tests. However, Compton did not feature in the 2013 Ashes series and he has seen the likes of Adam Lyth, Sam Robson and Alex Lees move ahead of him in the queue for a Test place. Compton's international future was not done any favours by his omission last month from the Lions squad for the forthcoming tour of South Africa. He continued: 'I appreciate Somerset's understanding of my wish to balance both my personal and professional life. 'The club will always have a special place in my heart and I owe (former Somerset director of cricket) Brian Rose a huge debt of gratitude for the privileged opportunity he gave me to become a Somerset cricketer, which in turn has enabled me to fulfil a number of cricketing goals. 'Thanks to everybody who has made me so welcome in the last five years. 'I have been part of some exceptional teams, experienced the warmth of Somerset's amazing supporters who make it such a great club to play for, and wish everybody connected with Somerset Cricket continued success.' Compton's decision to leave Somerset will come as a blow to the Taunton-based club . The news is certainly a setback for Somerset. Compton topped their Championship batting averages in 2013 and has scored 5,140 first-class runs for the county an average of nearly 56. Somerset chief executive Guy Lavender said: 'We would like to acknowledge the contribution Nick has made to Somerset during his five years with the club. 'He will be missed and we are disappointed he has decided to leave. He departs with our very best wishes for the future and with our thanks for his outstanding contributions on and off the field.' The county's current director of cricket Matt Maynard added: 'I am sorry to see Nick depart as he is a quality cricketer. 'But it is fundamentally important that he, or any player for that matter, wants to be here and is able to perform to the best of their ability. Sadly this is not something Nick feels able to achieve at this time.'","Somerset batsman Nick Compton is keen on returning to London .

"Bangladesh are on course to whitewash Zimbabwe in their Test series despite some late-in-the-day resolve from the tourists. Declaring their second innings on 319-5, Bangladesh set a fanciful target of 449 that looked even more improbable when Zimbabwe lost Brian Chari four runs into their chase on day four. But Sikandar Raza (43 not out) and Hamilton Masakadza (26 no) got the visitors to 71-1 at the close, meaning Bangladesh will at least have to dig deep to wrap up a 3-0 clean sweep. Bangladesh batsman Mominul Haque (above) scored an unbeaten 131 on the fourth day against Zimbabwe . A fourth Test hundred from rising star Mominul Haque did for them in Chittagong on Saturday, the 23-year-old posting a fourth century in only 12 Tests. He was unbeaten on 131 when his side were called in, having done more than enough damage. Resuming on 23 without loss, Bangladesh were keen to crack on and so they did, despite Imrul Kayes going for 15, edging Tinashe Panyangara behind. Bangladesh batsman Mominul Haque (above) scored an unbeaten 131 on the fourth day against Zimbabwe . That brought Mominul to the crease and he and Tamim Iqbal put on 113 for the second wicket in just over 30 overs. Tamim, a first-innings centurion, made a well-crafted 65 before he was cleaned up by Natsai M'shangwe. Mohammad Mahmudullah joined Mominul and they added a 50 stand, before he went for 30, the second man to nick Panyangara to the keeper. Shakib Al Hasan added 17 and departed to M'shangwe, but it mattered little as Mominul continued, reaching his hundred off 156 balls. Bangladesh's Tamim Iqbal plays a shot as the hosts made their way to 319-5 before declaring . Mushfiqur Rahim made a rapid 46 from 30 balls alongside him but after he went, the captain was in no mood to see Shuvagata Hom build a stand and soon called his men back in. Mominul ended with 131 from 189 balls and was soon celebrating with his team-mates in the field as Rubel Hossain trapped Chari leg before for a five-ball duck. Raza and Masakadza at least made for a more comfortable night's sleep, but the writing appears to be on the wall.","Bangladesh set Zimbabwe a target of 449 to win after declaring on 319-5 .

"Tennis fans' have slammed London's O2 Arena for banning them from taking sweets and snacks inside to watch the ATP Finals over terror fears. Angry ticket holders branded the decision 'security gone mad' and a 'disgrace,' as they were forced to dump food they had bought with them on arrival. Attendees described seeing bins full of food at the turnstiles and questioned whether the rules were part of a money making scheme. London's 02 Arena has been hosting the ATP Finals which will conclude on Sunday . Bosses at the O2 arena said that fans' had been warned about the 'additional security' measures before arriving at the event. Martin Allpress took to Twitter to expressed his dismay after security guards tried to confiscate his packet of wine gums. He posted: 'The security guards even tried to take my sweets, what security risk are wine gums? #jobsworths.' A tennis fan (left) is searched at the entrance to the 02 Arena.

Tennis fan Kate Millin, who suffers from coeliac disease, was forced to hand over her snacks, but said that no gluten free food was being sold within the arena.

The O2 Arena and ATP World Tour said in a statement: 'The event's policy on food and beverages being brought into the arena is one of a number of additional security measures being implemented this year.

"Owais Shah has been cleared of any wrongdoing in connection with the IPL spot-fixing scandal, according to reports in India. The former England batsman had issued a statement on Friday expressing his ‘distress’ after his name — along with Indian all-rounder Stuart Binny and West Indies leg-spinner Samuel Badree — was inadvertently read out by an Indian judge at the Supreme Court in Delhi. But it has emerged that all three cricketers have in fact been cleared by the Mudgal Report into corruption at the 2013 IPL, the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament. Owais Shah was cleared of any wrongdoing in connection with the IPL spot-fixing scandal, according to reports . N Srinivasan was named by the highest court in India in connection with the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal .

According to ESPNcricinfo, Shah was investigated following an incident involving the Royals, but was exonerated by the report.

"Tim Henman believes Andy Murray's game is lacking identity and thinks he should question his coaching relationship with Amelie Mauresmo. In an ATP World Tour Finals of ridiculously one-sided matches there has been no more crushing defeat than the one handed to Murray by Roger Federer on Thursday. Murray was fortunate simply to win a game against a player he has frequently beaten in the past. Andy Murray looks on in anguish after a night to forget against the Swiss master Roger Federer . The world No 2 came out all guns blazing and won the opening six games in just 24 minutes on Thursday night . It was a dispiriting way to end a tough season and former British No 1 Henman, a good friend of Murray's, was frustrated by his lack of aggression. 'When you reflect on the match, for me his game had no identity,' said the 40-year-old BBC pundit. 'What was the plan out there? It was really the Federer show. 'Roger played fantastically well, but, for Andy to have an impact, he has to be proactive, and the thing that is always exciting about Andy is there's no shot in tennis that he can't hit. 'If he's got all these shots in his armoury, my question is why doesn't he use them? 'He has to look at the way that he can be more offensive and more proactive instead of letting these players dictate to him. He's got as good a two-handed backhand as Djokovic, but he doesn't use it as much. I'd be looking for him to really crunch the ball. The 27-year-old had to win in straight sets to progress but he failed to win a single game in the first set . Tim Henman believes Murray's game is lacking identity under his current coach Amelie Mauresmo . 'This is about him making his opponents do the running. He's a great athlete, but he does too much running and, when he's doing too much running, he's not dictating enough. 'It's about clarity of thought and that's when you've got to take a step back and look at the whole set-up, the whole team and his whole lifestyle and see whether that is working as well as it can. At the end of the day, he's the only one that can answer that.' Murray turned to Mauresmo in a ground-breaking partnership after Ivan Lendl brought an end to their hugely successful association in March. The Scot appeared to have turned a corner after the US Open when he won three tournaments in five weeks, saving a combined 10 match points in two finals against Tommy Robredo. Murray was applauded for his fighting spirit, but Henman did not see the matches as a positive. Of the Mauresmo partnership, he said: 'I haven't seen them practise but, to me, I don't think he has been playing the right way. 'He had those 'fantastic matches' against Robredo - and Robredo is someone who is absolutely maximising his potential and he's had a great career - but Andy's in a different class to him. 'Andy should be dominating him and beating him 6-3 6-3. Three hours and 20 minutes on an indoor court? Something's wrong. 'Because Andy's such a good player, he's capable of winning the wrong way. It's a great asset, but, when you come up against the very best guys, you can't just turn it on. He's got to play the right way all the time.' The chastening straight sets defeat brought the curtain down on Murray's 2014 campaign . Murray and Mauresmo have not had much chance to work together away from tournaments yet and the off-season should give the Frenchwoman the opportunity to have a greater impact on his game. Murray has said the success or otherwise of their association should not be judged until the Australian Open and it is certain to be under intense scrutiny in Melbourne. Despite his disappointment with Murray's performances, Henman thinks he can turn things around in time for the new season. The former world No 4, who agrees with John McEnroe that Murray should take a break rather than get straight back on to the practice court, said: 'The great thing about Andy is he's his own harshest critic. 'He sets the bar high. We're questioning where he's at and he's qualified for the World Tour Finals, which is an incredible achievement. 'So you have to keep perspective, but Andy's career right now is about contending at majors and, having had the disappointment of the last match of the year, I think it could be a great catalyst for next year.' So does Henman expect Murray to be challenging for the Australian Open title? 'Absolutely; 100 per cent.'","Andy Murray crashed out of the ATP World Tour Finals in London on Thursday night after losing in straight sets to Roger Federer .

"The credibility of international cricket suffered yet another huge blow today when ICC chairman N Srinivasan was named by the highest court in India in connection with the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal. Srinivasan, who earlier this year was forced to step down as president of the Indian board while investigations into the scandal continued, also heads up the ICC’s rejigged anti-corruption unit – calling into question the governing body’s capacity to police itself, let alone an entire sport. Invited by Sportsmail to comment on the news, the ICC replied: ‘The ICC has no comment at this stage.’ N Srinivasan was named by the highest court in India in connection with the 2013 IPL spot-fixing scandal . Also named as being involved in ‘some misdemeanour’ relating to the corruption that blighted last year’s IPL, which led to the arrest and imprisonment of three Rajasthan Royals players, were Srinivasan’s son-in-law Gurunath Meiyappan, the league’s COO Sundar Raman, and Rajasthan co-owner Raj Kundra. It has been reported in India that three cricketers were inadvertently named by the court in connection to the investigation: former England Test batsman Owais Shah, Indian all-rounder Stuart Binny, and West Indies leg-spinner Samuel Badree. No charge is yet to be brought. Owais Shah was inadvertently named by the court . Shah later released a statement saying: 'I have heard today that I have been named as implicated in the Mudgal Report presented to the Indian Supreme Court. 'Prior to the news this morning, I had no knowledge that I was under investigation or suspicion. I have not heard from, been interviewed by or received any form of correspondence from the Mudgal Inquiry or the Indian Supreme Court or anyone connected with it. 'I have no idea what allegations have been levelled at me or what case, if any, I am expected to answer. 'I would have hoped to have received some explanation from the Court that named me, but they have said nothing and made no attempt to explain themselves or to contact me, which is disappointing. 'Needless to say, this is very distressing as I have as much information as those seeking comment from me. Consequently, I will be making no further statement beyond this one and giving no interviews until I have established exactly what is going on and why I have been named.' That leaves six players still to be named from the 13 who were investigated by the panel, led by Justice Mukul Mudgal and appointed last year by the Supreme Court. The next hearing will take place on November 24. The judges said: ‘We have the seen the report. It does suggest some misdemeanour. We can’t withhold the report. For the present, we will keep the players out and will disclose only the non-players.’ Srinivasan, who owns IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings, has maintained all along that he has had nothing to do with the corruption scandal that overshadowed the 2013 edition of the world’s richest Twenty20 tournament. Yet despite being instructed to step down from the presidency of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Srinivasan rose to the chairmanship of the ICC, the world game’s governing body, in June – a position with a two-year tenure. He also headed up the takeover of the ICC earlier this year by the boards of India, England and Australia. In private, the ECB have insisted all along that chairman Giles Clarke was dealing with the BCCI as a whole rather than one individual. But many others queried the ECB’s wisdom in working so closely with Srinivasan while question marks remained about his probity. Quite how long the ICC will tolerate the name of their sport being dragged through the mud by the alleged ‘misdemeanours’ of their own chairman is another matter.

"The late, great Ian Wooldridge was ringside for Muhammad Ali's Rumble in the Jungle against George Foreman in Zaire in 1974. Here is his dispatch from Kinshasa the morning after the fight before. The sun had the audacity to rise over Central Africa yesterday while Mr Muhammad Ali was still speaking. His message was really quite trivial. He will require $10million, he informed the universe, to perform his next miracle in the boxing ring. This works out at something slightly over £4m an hour, or, alternatively, precisely twice as much as he received for exposing George Foreman as not quite the immovable object we thought. Muhammad Ali stands over George Foreman after knocking him out in round eight in Zaire . Ian Wooldridge was a legendary sports writer who worked for the Daily Mail for almost 50 years. He was named Sports Writer of the Year at the British Press Awards in 1972, 74, 81 and 89 and won the same award from the SJA in 86, 87 and 95. Ian died of cancer in 2007. Naturally, we shall pay for it. We shall rob banks, surrender life policies, shortchange widows and sell the new dishwasher to raise it. His recapture of the world heavyweight title here, on a morning the memory of which I shall take to the grave, entitles him to name his own price. By the eighth and providently last round he had, according to a communal roundup of statistics, hit Foreman 65 times flush on the face. It was then, from an entrenched and contemplative position, that he saw an opening which lasted as long as it takes to fire a hair-trigger pistol. Ali's Rope-a-dope tactic was to soak up the blows as Foreman tired himself out punching . Ali was pinned to the ropes by Foreman for lengthy spells during the Rumble in the Jungle . Foreman is a man of ingenuous honesty. 'A boxer,' he said when his mind was functioning again, 'never sees the big one that hits him.' What hit him, in fact, was a Bren-gun burst of quick blows, a left hook that spun him round into the real line of fire and a right that put him on the floor for the first time in his professional career. He sprawled there, blinking and subconsciously mouthing the count to himself. He had not one chance in 50 of getting up again. It was like watching a tank going over the edge of a bridge in slow motion. He became so confused by Ali's tactics that he finished the fourth round hurling wild swings into the air, and later missed so badly with the punch that was meant to finish it all that he almost went through the ropes. Ali talked to Foreman throughout the fight and chatted to a reporter in between rounds . Foreman hit the ground for the first time in his career when Ali floored him in the eighth round . Ali slapped him on the bottom. Throughout the fight he talked to Foreman in all the clinches and carried on a running conversation with a black American reporter in between rounds. In the fifth round he indulged in a piece of exhibitionism so dangerous that it would not be tried by the resident professional fighting farmhands in a fairground boxing booth. He sagged back so far on the ropes that he was almost in the laps of the TV commentators. And there he stayed for well over a minute, defending himself from Foreman's frantic hitting only with his forearms and cupped gloves. Ali took the wildest liberties and still rode back to the world title he regards as personal property with a performance of total genius allied to immense physical courage. The fight that was reckoned to be his $5m retirement pay-off went precisely as he bragged it would. Referee Zack Clayton sends Ali to the corner as Foreman lies on the canvas . Ali speaks to reporters after beating Foreman in the eighth round of their epic battle in Zaire . 'I shall be the matador and Foreman the bull,' he told his Zairois brothers last week. The metaphor was exact. Ali went down, too. Ten seconds after Foreman was counted out, he was knocked down as his faithful leaped into the ring. From then, long into the dawn, he was besieged. 'I'm going to haunt boxing for the next six months,' he shouted. 'I'll talk to the man who first offers me 10 million dollars.' You may say a man requires supernatural powers to command such a sum. But maybe Ali has. At breakfast the sun went in and the rainy season started. This is an abridged version of a report taken from the book: Searching for Heroes: 50 Years of Sporting Encounters by Ian Wooldridge.

"Chris Henry faces an uncertain playing future after the shocking news he has suffered blockage in a blood vessel in his brain.

It was initially suggested the cause was a severe migraine, but the Ireland management revealed yesterday it was far more serious than that. Chris Henry (right) was withdrawn on the morning of the game against South Africa with suspected migraine . ‘Chris Henry suffered some weakness on the morning of the South Africa game and a viral illness was suspected. ‘He recovered quickly and the initial diagnosis was of severe migraine,’ read a statement. ‘Further tests, however, have shown he suffered a temporary blockage of a small blood vessel in his brain. ‘He is at home now and is well but needs further investigation and specialist opinion.’ The news will inevitably raise questions about Henry’s playing future, given the understandable vigilance with which brain conditions are treated in professional sport. The flanker became a regular during last season's six nations, but his future is now in doubt . Ireland put in a superb display in Henry's absence to beat the Springboks at the Aviva Stadium .

"Ian Poulter weathered one storm but could not hold off another on Friday as he charged to the top of the leaderboard at the Turkish Airlines Open. The Englishman blew away overnight leader Miguel Angel Jimenez with six birdies and only one dropped shot in 14 holes to take his tally to 13-under-par for the tournament. But a huge thunder and lightning storm meant the early abandonment of play and forced tournament organisers to contemplate the possibility of a reduced format in the penultimate event of the European Tour season. Ian Poulter tees off on the fifth hole at the Montgomerie Maxx Royal on his way to grabbing the lead . With more storms expected on Saturday, there is a race to conclude the second and third rounds in the space of a day, though on current form that is unlikely to disrupt Poulter. The 39-year-old, who was five under for the day when he was called off, continues to thrive after the equipment change made in the wake of a disappointing Ryder Cup. His mediocre Cup showing was the latest lowpoint in a year dominated by injuries and poor form, which saw him slide from 12th to 44th in the rankings – leaving him at risk of his lowest year-end ranking since September 2006. Ryder Cup star Victor Dubuisson was spotted with tissue stuffed up his nose to stem the flow of a nosebleed . The enigmatic Frenchman made for an unusual sight as he was forced to play with the tissue up his nostril . But having finished sixth in China last week, he has used a dusted-off old putter from two years ago to open up a three-shot lead over Brendon de Jonge. His putting has been impressive this week, but his scorching form on the par fives has made the difference, with nine shots gained from the nine long holes he’s played so far. Poulter, who on Thursday reflected on a ‘****’ season in which ‘there was no good’, said on Friday: ‘I’m playing great and to be on the top of the leaderboard is always nice. It would have been nice to finish the round off but I guess it wasn't meant to be. ‘The weather was perfect for a while until we got onto the 11th green and then things changed quite significantly. The wind switched 180 degrees and really started to blow 20, 30 miles‑an‑hour. It was tricky for probably two holes and then obviously the storm come in pretty quick from there. Miguel Angel Jimenez lost his place on top of the leaderboard to an in-form Poulter . ‘I’m playing well. It's obviously a great feeling to be on the golf course when you're playing like that, and making birdies is always fun. Right now I'm pretty happy. ‘Saturday is just going to be a longer day, so rest up, get to bed nice and early, come out again.’ The slim chance of a player snatching the Race to Dubai crown from Rory McIlroy appears all but gone. Only Welshman Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia or Victor Dubuisson – who had to stuff a tissue up his nose on Friday to stop a persistent nosebleed - are still able to usurp the Northern Irishman but would need to win both here and in Dubai next week while hoping McIlroy fails to finish in the top five in the season-ending event. However, none of that trio sits inside the top 55 here in Turkey.

"James Haskell accepts England should be toppling the southern hemisphere giants and takes no pride in being 'plucky runners-up'. Successive defeats by New Zealand and South Africa have elevated the remaining two QBE Internationals against Samoa and Australia into matches that Stuart Lancaster's under-pressure team dare not lose. Haskell is set to win his 51st cap at Twickenham on Saturday as one of the changes Lancaster is expected to make, and while he remembers a time when three-point defeats to the All Blacks and Springboks were tolerable, he insists those days are now long gone. England star James Haskell admits Stuart Lancaster's side should be beating southern hemisphere giants . England's players look deflated after losing to South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday . Wasps flanker Haskell looks set to earn a recall to the England back row against the Samoans . Bath fly half George Ford looks set to start at number 10 on Saturday with Owen Farrell moving to centre . Northampton Saints centre Luther Burrell (centre) looks fresh in training at Pennyhill Park on training . Billy Twelvetrees has found himself out of favour with England despite featuring heavily last season . 'I have been involved with England when we were getting beaten heavily by these sides and when a narrow loss would have been acceptable,' Haskell said. 'But this side has now developed to a point where we have beaten the world champions and where we ultimately should be beating these teams and be right up there. 'It's very easy to see us as plucky runners-up, but not one person in this entire environment has ever said that is the case. 'No one is satisfied to only be pushing those teams close. We realise we want to be beating them, we should be beating them and we are doing all the things in our power to make that happen. 'As players we are our own biggest critics. I don't really read the papers because I know what I have done wrong. I don't need a mark out of 10 to tell me I have done something wrong.' South Africa's Jan Serfontein celebrates on his way to scoring the opening try against England . Head coach Stuart Lancaster has now watched his side lose five consecutive games . New Zealand and South Africa have stormed Twickenham on successive weekends to extend England's losing run to five matches, with just 10 months left until next year's home World Cup is launched. Losing to the sport's dominant forces at the venue where all but three of the knockout games will be staged would appear to be a significant setback, but Haskell disagrees. 'Frankly, players don't sit here now talking about the World Cup, what we're going to do when we get there and how we're going to do it, because the rugby landscape changes dramatically from month to month,' the Wasps back row said. 'There's so much rugby to be played, so yes these games are important and it would be great to have those wins in the bank, but my view is they don't have any bearing. 'Just because we lost on Saturday doesn't mean we're going to lose at the World Cup. Haskell is expected to replace Tom Wood (right) at blindside flanker against Samoa this weekend . 'We're aware that we have to develop and we're working hard to do that. I have every confidence we'll push those teams and get the results.' Haskell is expected to replace Tom Wood at blindside flanker against Samoa on Saturday, with Ben Morgan relieving Billy Vunipola at number eight in a new-look back row that will see Chris Robshaw as the sole survivor. England have been described as a team in crisis and Samoa and Australia must be dispatched if they are to salvage a measure of respect from a disappointing campaign. Haskell has urged his team-mates to be bold against the Pacific Islanders . 'I hope we don't go into our shell, that's certainly not the impression of what will happen that I'm getting from the guys. There will be boys coming into the team who want to put their hands up,' Haskell said. 'Our nature and game plan isn't about going into our shell. That just doesn't work and I've got every confidence that won't happen.'","England face Samoa at Twickenham on Saturday after two defeats .

"Javier Ballesteros, the eldest son of the late former Open champion Seve, has decided to turn professional. The 24-year-old Spaniard accepted he would face a challenge to emulate the achievements of his father, who died following brain cancer aged 54 in May 2011. 'I have taken the decision of turning professional. This is something I have always wanted. Whether I will succeed or not, time will tell. However, I do not want to regret not having tried my best, and must give it a go,' he said in a statement. Javier Ballesteros faces a huge challenge to live up to his name on the professional golf tour . The 24-year-old insisted he did not want to live with the regret of not giving it a go . 'I know it will not be easy and I am aware of the hard work required, but I must try. 'My father had a long and difficult start in golf. Mine is a bit easier, although I have a disadvantage in that sense - everyone will always compare us and will expect from me, not what my dad achieved, but half of it, which is already a lot. 'I have set myself no goals. I will go step by step, and will start at the Alps Tour's Qualifying School. As we say in golf: one shot at a time and living the present.

I have a lot of self-confidence. 'Today, my dad comes specially to my mind. He taught me everything or almost everything I know about golf and I would have loved him see me turning pro. I am sure he would be very proud and happy'. As well as wining The Open three times, in 1979, 1984 and 1988, Seve Ballesteros claimed the US Masters title twice and captained Europe to Ryder Cup victory at Valderrama in 1997.","Golf legend Seve Ballesteros' son Javier has decided to turn professional .

"It was either a piece of audacious skill or simply outrageous luck but England Under 18 captain Ryan Ledson wasn't going to quibble. The rising star curled home a quite ridiculous 40-yard free-kick in England's 4-1 win over Poland on Monday to enhance his burgeoning reputation. With the scored in Gdansk locked at 1-1 in the 49th minute, Everton star Ledson stepped up to deliver a free-kick wide on the left. Ryan Ledson (No 6) celebrates his spectacular free-kick in England Under 18's 4-1 win over Poland . Ledson is congratulated by team-mate Jake Clarke-Salter after scoring his 40-yard free-kick . England (4-1-2-1-2): Sam Howes (West Ham United), Callum Connolly (Everton), Taylor Moore (RC Lens), Jake Clarke-Salter (Chelsea), Max Lowe (Derby County); Liam Walsh (Everton); Ryan Ledson (captain; Everton), Josh Onomah (Tottenham Hotspur); Sheyi Ojo (Liverpool), Adam Armstrong (Newcastle United), Dominic Solanke (Chelsea). Substitutions: Karlan Ahearne-Grant (Charlton Athletic) for Armstrong 58; Ainsley Maitland-Niles (Arsenal) for Ledson 72; Kyle Walker-Peters (Tottenham Hotspur) for Connolly 72; Marcus Rashford (Manchester United) for Ojo 83; Josh Sims (Southampton) for Onomah 83 . Substitutes not used: Fred Woodman (Newcastle United), Tosin Adarabioyo (Manchester City) Scorers: Solanke 11; Ledson 50; Ojo 52, 71 . There were plenty of his white-shirted team-mates inside the box but Ledson struck the ball with such venom and swerve that it went over them all and left goalkeeper Mateusz Piechowiak red-faced as it flew over him. Ledson, 17, was born and bred in Liverpool has been at Everton since the age of five. He captained England's Under 17 team to victory in the European Championships earlier this year and earned a call-up to Neil Dewsnip's Under 18s at the start of this season. The match was his fourth appearance at this standard and the free-kick was his first goal. Roberto Martinez twice named Ledson on the Everton bench towards the end of last season - against Southampton and Manchester City - though he didn't make an appearance. He has, however, been a regular for the club's under 21 side over the last couple of years, maintaining his high standards despite coming up against players much older than him. Ledson likens his style to England legend Frank Lampard - which can be no bad thing - and rates Leighton Baines as the Everton player he most enjoys watching. England's 4-1 win at the MOSiR Lechia Gdansk stadium completed back-to-back successes over over Poland this week. Dominic Solanke celebrates after drawing England level during the early stages of the match in Gdansk . Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo crosses the ball during the friendly match - he scored two goals .

The hosts took the lead after 10 minutes when Kevin Pytlik thundered home a 30-yard strike after England failed to properly clear a corner. England levelled within a minute, however, when Chelsea forward Dominic Solanke raced onto a rebound and found the net from a tight angle despite the attentions of three covering defenders. The Young Lions seized control of the contest but didn't go in front until Ledson's free-kick sailed in five minutes after the break. After that, it was the turn of another Merseyside-based player, Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo, to shine. He first won a penalty after Piechowiak tripped him in the box and converted it himself. Then, on 71 minutes, he fired into the bottom corner from 20 yards to set the seal on England's impressive win. England coach Neil Dewsnip points the way during the friendly match .

"Hull's injury problems are beginning to ease, with Allan McGregor, Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic likely to return after the international break. The Tigers have been hit by a number of injuries down the spine of the team in recent weeks but positive signs are starting to emerge. Head of medical services Rob Price gave a comprehensive fitness update to the club's official website and gave optimistic news on the first-choice trio. Nikica Jelavic could return to action against Tottenham after the international break after knee surgery . Number one goalkeeper McGregor is back in full training and deemed 'available for selection' after a shoulder problem that has kept him out since the end of September. Four-goal striker Jelavic and defender Dawson were both injured at Arsenal on October 18, the former during the warm-up and the latter in the closing stages. They are both picking up pace in their rehabilitation and could be in contention to return against Tottenham a week on Sunday. Defender Michael Dawson is also recovering well from injury and could be fit to face his former club Spurs . Price wrote: 'Nikica is three-and-a-half weeks post-medial meniscectomy and he has stepped up his rehab this week. We are aiming for him to return to training next week. At this stage, his knee has reacted extremely well to rehab. 'Michael is now three-and-a-half weeks on from a lateral ankle ligament rupture and he is scheduled to return to first team training this week.' Alex Bruce is back running following a grade two hamstring injury, but question marks remain over captain Curtis Davies following a back injury suffered in the 1-0 defeat at Burnley. 'Curtis was withdrawn at Burnley last weekend with back pain. The symptoms are settling nicely although it is too early to give a full assessment,' said Price. Goalkeeper Allan McGregor is already back in training after suffering a serious shoulder injury . 'Curtis was withdrawn at Burnley last weekend with back pain.

"Leonardo Ulloa believes Leicester need to display more physical and mental strength if they are to avoid relegation this season. A decent start to life in the top flight has quickly tapered off, with Nigel Pearson's promoted side without a win since September 21. Furthermore, the goals have dried up since that memorable 5-3 defeat of Manchester United, with Saturday's 2-0 defeat at high-flying Southampton the fifth game out of six they have failed to score in. Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa battles for possession against Nathaniel Clyne in the 2-0 loss to Southampton . Ulloa, a summer arrival from Brighton, wants to see more fight and desire from his Leicester team . The poor form means Leicester will be in the relegation zone during the upcoming international break - a time Ulloa knows will require renewed focus at the training ground. 'It is a difficult situation,' the Argentinian said. 'We knew that this game would be difficult, but we need to be thinking about the next game now. 'At moments we played well but they created more chances. We think positively and ahead to the next game. 'The first half we played okay enough with the ball and defended. The second half started well and after they had the ball they created chances. 'We need to think about the next game.'

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson shouts instructions to his team in the game at Southampton on Saturday . Kasper Schmeichel (above) claps the Leicester fans, after the team's winless run  continues from September . '[The international break] is important for us,' Ulloa said. 'We need to forget about this game and the last games. 'We will think about the next game, just the next game. We need more mentally and physically.' In contrast to Leicester, many connected with Saints will see this international break as unfortunately timed.

It has helped Southampton continue their best-ever start to a top-flight campaign - success which has surprised many onlookers, but not summer signing Dusan Tadic.

"Andrew Robertson’s rise to prominence has been as rapid as it has been remarkable. On Tuesday, the 20-year-old is expected to start for Scotland against England at Celtic Park. The last time the Auld Enemies met, at Wembley in August 2013, the young left back had only 180 competitive minutes of professional football under his belt with Dundee United. Released by Celtic at the age of 15 for the depressingly familiar crime of being too small, he was forced to rebuild his career in the Scottish fourth tier as a part-timer with Hampden Park-based Queen’s Park. VIDEO Scroll down for Scotland vs England: Sportsmail's international friendly preview . Celtic released Andrew Robertson when he was 15, but he looks like becoming a regular for Scotland . Fast forward five years and Robertson looks set to be the first-choice Scotland left back for years to come and one of the first names on the Hull City team-sheet. The Scot’s fairytale journey even caught the eye of Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany. The pair’s paths first crossed two years ago when Robertson worked evenings dishing out programmes for international games at Hampden and Kompany was on a spying trip for Belgium before they faced the Scots in qualification for the World Cup. After Robertson was called up for the first time by Gordon Strachan, Kompany tweeted a good luck message to the young Scot: ‘Andy Robertson, stories like yours are inspiring! Wish you all the best!’ Robertson recalls: ‘I went to plenty of Scotland games as a kid and then from 16 I worked at Hampden. Part of my job was to give out programmes in the private lounges before the games. It wasn’t the worst job in the world as you got into all the matches for free. Robertson worked his way up from the fourth tier of Scottish football to the Premier League . ‘I met Kompany and got my picture taken with him, although I didn’t really speak to him. He was massive and I looked pretty small beside him. ‘When I got released from Celtic I was 15, I hadn’t really grown, I wasn’t strong enough. I knew I had a lot to improve. I needed to move on to the next level when I left Queen’s Park and luckily Dundee United provided me with that chance. ‘I knew it was a big leap to go from handing out programmes but I was confident in my ability.’ Robertson’s form at Tannadice saw him outshine the likes of Ryan Gauld, who won a £3million move to Sporting Lisbon, in a season of entertaining football that ended in a 2-0 Scottish Cup final defeat by St Johnstone in May. Robertson has worked his way up from playing amateur football with Queen's Park to the Premier League . Former Dundee United man Robertson was hugely impressive in Scotland's recent clash against Ireland . Dundee United are producing some major talent. Sunderland last season had a £600,000 bid accepted for defender John Souttar, but the 18-year-old decided to stay at Tannadice. Midfielders Stuart Armstrong, 22, and Ryan Dow, 23, are also tipped for big things. Their reputation is largely down to a coach, Ian Cathro, who ran his own soccer school. Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein made the then-unknown coach the head of United’s youth academy at the age of 22. Cathro was fast-tracked into the SFA, put in charge of the regional performance school in Dundee and has gone on to become assistant coach at Valencia. Stevie Campbell is the current United youth director and Under 20 coach and, with assistant Dave Bowman, United's youth set-up is now the envy of Scotland. For Robertson, Scotland Under 21 recognition soon followed his thrilling appearances for United and his break came when Strachan asked a number of young players to help his senior squad prepare to face the USA last October. Robertson impressed Gordon Strachan after being invited to join in a training session with the senior team . Robertson impressed Strachan in training and with his attitude, and he has started both of Scotland’s home Euro 2016 qualifiers against Georgia and Ireland. At club level, Robertson has made swapping the Scottish top flight for the Barclays Premier League look easy after a £2.85m move to Hull. ‘He’s totally and utterly shocked me with his ability to step in,’ said Hull boss Steve Bruce. ‘He’s 20 years old and playing at the highest level and he’s going to have a big future. He’s a fantastic talent, a humble lad and as quick as I’ve seen any full back.’ Robertson added to his reputation on Friday night when he gave Ireland duo Aiden McGeady and Seamus Coleman a torrid evening down the left in a vital 1-0 win. Born in 1994, he harbours only hazy memories of the last time Scotland reached a major finals. ‘My auntie had a big party for the opening game of the 1998 World Cup against Brazil,’ he says. ‘I remember more about the actual party than the game.’ Scotland duo Robertson and Johnny Russell on the Celtic Park pitch before their recent game against Ireland . JAMIE REDKNAPP: I played Scotland three times in my career and the games were always fast, furious and aggressive, but I’ll never forget walking out at Hampden Park. We felt like gladiators heading into the arena — we were waiting for the lions to be unleashed because it felt like we were about to be eaten alive. That was the first half of a play-off to reach Euro 2000, so it was a massive game. JOHN WARK: You can’t call Scotland v England games friendlies. I had team-mates at Ipswich who I would play with and then against. You wanted to kick lumps out of each other, and that is what happened in those days. Mick Mills was our captain at Ipswich, but (with England) he was against us. You want to beat England and vice versa, that won’t change. But after the game we went on holiday together... and are still talking about it to this day.","Scotland host England at Celtic park on Tuesday night .

"Newcastle manager Alan Pardew is to ease the workload on his players after admitting they have been pushed to the limit. The Magpies have put together a run of five successive victories, four of them in the Barclays Premier League, to completely change the complexion of their season. However, they have lost men along the way to injury, some of them on the training ground, and that is something the manager and his coaching staff will look to address as they attempt to strike a balance between achieving the highest possible fitness levels and the demands that places on the squad. Alan Pardew has admitted to pushing Newcastle players 'to the limit' in training recently . Newcastle celebrate Ayoze Perez's winner against Liverpool earlier this month - one of five victories in a row . Pardew told the Shields Gazette: 'I met my staff and we are going to change one or two things. We are pushing these players to the limit. We're trying to get the maximum we can out of them, and if you do that, you are going to lose players here and there. 'The other players, you can tell, are really super-fit, and we're strong. But we still need a few more bodies back. 'As a group, we have to make sure we protect the players and give them the best possible chance to be at their maximum on a Saturday. 'We're pushing the players, and we're going to get injuries. We're pushing them because we want them to be fitter and stronger than everybody else, and so you've got a balance there. Pardew watches on from the touchline during the 2-0 win over West Brom at the Hawthorns . 'We've just got to make sure we get that right, because we lost one or two that perhaps we shouldn't have.'

"Morgan Schneiderlin sat in a room at Strasbourg's academy surrounded by 39 other youth players watching Liverpool's miracle comeback against AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League final. The atmosphere was charged and excitement buzzed between the bodies. Schneiderlin was 16 at the time and just playing in the Barclays Premier League was a dream, let alone a Champions League final. 'In France when you watch TV you have to choose between Liverpool and Manchester United and I chose Liverpool,' Schneiderlin told Sportsmail in 2012. 'I used to and still love Steven Gerrard as a player.' Southampton's Morgan Schneiderlin puts in a typically full-bloodied challenge on Leicester's Jamie Vardy . The Frenchman has been an unheralded but consistent performer as Southampton rose from League One . Schneiderlin in training with Paul Pogba as France prepare for their friendlies with Albania and Sweden . But with Southampton flying in the top-flight, sitting second in the league, and Arsenal and Tottenham waiting in the wings, playing in European football's elite competition is surely not far off. When the 25-year-old joined Southampton for £1.2million in 2008, playing in the Championship was a long way from the heady heights of today. 'When I first came I had no-one who spoke French so it took me a bit longer to adapt to the style,' Schneiderlin added, 'because if you have a good lifestyle it will give you more confidence to play on the pitch. 'My target was always to play in the Premier League. Of course France is my country and I love it, I miss it a bit, but England is my second home.' Schneiderlin was an ever-present in the side who were relegated to League One two years after joining them, were bottom of the league and docked 10 points. It was the lowest, darkest moment in the club's history. It was even further from his ambitions. Schneiderlin celebrates scoring in Southampton's 3-1 win at West Ham back in August . The France midfielder scored twice in the Saints' 3-1 victory over West Ham. He has three goals this season . Yet those experiences have moulded the Frenchman into the tough midfield general he has become. Even after helping the south coast club secure back-to-back promotions, his displays were often overshadowed by his team-mates in the top flight. But Schneiderlin was always there, always helping the them tick along and was never one to let the lack of spotlight knock his confidence on the pitch. Ahead of facing Liverpool in December of their first season back in the top flight, Schneiderlin said: 'I want to confront him and see what I can do against him. He's one of the best players in the world and that's who I want to play against every game, the best in the world. 'If I have to tackle I do it. In the Premier League you play against better players so you need to be more aware. You need to put the effort in otherwise you get beaten. You need to be on your toes all the time. I'm a very bad loser.' Ronald Koeman has made an excellent start as Southampton manager, taking them to second in the table . Schneiderlin scores in the home match with Liverpool back in March 2013. It ended in a 3-1 win for Saints . Schneiderlin with a robust challenge on West Ham's Mohamed Diame during their meeting last season . The Frenchman goes toe-to-toe with Gareth Bale when the Welshman was still at Tottenham . Following the departures of Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Dejan Lovren and Calum Chambers, it is Schneiderlin who has emerged as one of the most effective midfielders in not only Southampton's team, but the whole league. Crystal Palace's Mile Jedinak is the only midfielder to make more than his 43 tackles this campaign. His 766 passes puts him fifth amongst his counterparts, behind Ki Sung-Yeung, Daley Blind, Yaya Toure and Eden Hazard. Of those, he has completed 89 per cent. And he has weighed in with three goals already. Before Schneiderlin, who now has six caps for France, played at Anfield for the first time, in that match in 2012 which they lost 1-0, friends back in France rang him to see if he would get Gerrard's shirt after the match. If he starts playing Champions League football, it will be Schneiderlin's shirt they're all after.","Morgan Schneiderlin has been consistently good as Southampton lifted themselves from the depth of League One to second in Premier League .

"Sadio Mane believes Southampton can continue their astonishing start to the season and qualify for the Champions League. Many expected this to be a season of struggle and strife on the south coast given several stars of the last campaign left the club over the summer. However, Ronald Koeman's side have confounded the naysayers  in some style, with Saints second in the Premier League after their best-ever start to a top-flight campaign. Sadio Mane (right) believes Southampton can qualify for next season's Champions League . Mane, pictured scoring in Southampton's 8-0 win against Sunderland, has scored two goals for the Saints . A miserly defence complemented by exciting attacking options have made them one of the stories of the season and summer signing Mane believes they can maintain this fine form. 'I hope and I am confident that we can hold this pace and level of playing football,' the winger told www.fifa.com. 'Obviously, in the Premier League there are always the three, four or five big teams which can be found at the top of the table, but I am glad that so far, there are some teams up there that could be called a little surprise, including us. 'However, we have to stay realistic. It will be hard to remain where we are today. We will give our best to defend this place, and I have no doubt we have the potential and will.' The Senegal international has revealed he joined Southampton because of new boss Ronald Koeman . Southampton is the latest stop on the Senegal international's European tour, following spells with French club Metz and Red Bull Salzburg of Austria. Saints forked out in the region of £10million to sign the pacy winger, who is glad to have turned down other offers in favour of a move to St Mary's. 'Southampton is a big Premier League team with a long football tradition,' Mane said. 'I always dreamed of playing in the Premier League, and I had a very good feeling about Southampton from the first contact. 'The entire philosophy, the smart way they progressively improved the team with dedicated transfers, the entire club environment and last but not least the highly professional and experienced coach, Ronald Koeman - that's why I chose Southampton as my next big challenge.'","Summer signing Sadio Mane believes Southampton can carry on impressive start to the season .

"Out-of-favour West Brom defender Gareth McAuley hopes his role in Northern Ireland's record breaking start to Euro 2016 qualifying will provide him with a 'shop window' for his talents. The 34-year-old is a fan favourite at The Hawthorns, as well as a two-time player of the year, but has not managed to win over current Baggies boss Alan Irvine. McAuley has yet to play in the Barclays Premier League this season, with the preferred pairing of Joleon Lescott and Craig Dawson restricting him to just three Capital One Cup outings. VIDEO Scroll down to watch O'Neil and McAuley discuss Northern Ireland's clash with Romania . Gareth McAuley celebrates scoring for Northern Ireland against the Faroe Islands in their Euro 2016 qualifier . His most enjoyable moments of the campaign so far have come on international duty, where three consecutive wins have catapulted Michael O'Neill's side to top spot in Group F. He will captain his country for the fourth time against second-placed Romania on Friday night, deputising for the injured Steven Davis, and get another chance to remind Irvine - or other suitors - of his qualities. 'Coming away with Northern Ireland is always good and playing for the international team is also a shop window, either to impress my club manager or, if things don't work out, for another club in the future,' he said. 'I will give my best for Northern Ireland and when I get back to West Brom I will do exactly the same and hopefully things will change for me. McAuley played 32 times in the Premier League last season but has not made a single appearance in 2014-15 . 'My club situation has not been ideal this season but I've been in the game long enough to know things can change very quickly. 'I picked up an injury in pre-season and then missed the start of the season and lost my place in the team. 'That's the first time that has happened to me in my career but I'm experienced enough to know how to deal with it. I've been working hard to try to get my place back and have been doing a lot of extra training. 'I have experienced highs and lows in my career and don't get carried away either way.' O'Neill did not hesitate in offering his defensive rock the armband when Davis lost his battle with a hamstring injury. Michael O'Neill's side are currently top of their European Champions qualifying group . McAuley had turned down the opportunity to lead the team out in Greece last month on the occasion of his 50th cap, instead preferring Davis to continue following wins over Hungary and the Faroe Islands. It was a decision that simply reaffirmed O'Neill's respect for the player. 'I think Gareth made a very unselfish act in turning down the captaincy on his 50th cap in Greece,' said O'Neill. 'Normally a player who reaches that milestone would captain the side but Gareth didn't want to upset the momentum we had so he passed over that opportunity. 'He has natural leadership qualities and the respect of every member of the squad.' Returning Romania manager Anghel Iordanescu, back for a third stint in charge, labelled Northern Ireland 'the surprise team of the competition' and the game 'our most important of the year'.","Gareth McAuley is yet to play for West Brom in the league this season .

"Arsenal will look to solve the problem of their poor form by signing Porto's attacking duo Jackson Martinez and Juan Quintero, according to reports in Portugal. Portuguese newspaper A Bola claim the Gunners are willing to spend up to €75million (£60) on the Colombian pair. The story was also reported in another Iberian paper, Record. The move would certainly come as a surprise to Arsenal fans, most of whom are clamouring for defensive, not offensive, reinforcements. Portuguese newspaper A Bola claims Arsenal want Porto pair Jackson Martinez and Juan Quintero . The Spanish press, meanwhile, have chosen to largely ignore their nation's 1-0 defeat at the hands of world champions Germany, and focus instead of some comments from Lionel Messi. Both Mundo Deportivo and Sport report that the Argentine forward may not, as previously thought, remain at Barcelona for the duration of his career. According to the papers, Messi said: 'I'd stay for ever but sometimes you don't always get what you want.' It is the first time the three-time Ballon d'Or winner has even hinted at the possibility of leaving Spain. The Spanish press have run with Lionel Messi's quotes about possibly leaving Barcelona in the future . Italy may have won five of their six games since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, but that doesn't mean Azzurri boss Antonio Conte doesn't have any worries. As with Brendan Rodgers, Conte is concerned with Mario Balotelli's underwhelming form, but the former Juventus boss says he doesn't have time to address the issue. La Gazzetta dello Sport reports the Conte claimed Italian football doesn't teach hard work, he doesn't have time for Balotelli and he doesn't have enough time with the national squad.
