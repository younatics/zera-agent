A four-year-old girl has launched an appeal to raise £25,000 to help her best friend walk - something she will never do herself. Casey Burke, four, suffers from cerebral palsy as does her best friend Matilda Duncan, five. Casey will never be able to walk herself, but her friend Matilda could be able to if she undergoes a pioneering procedure. Best friends: Casey Burke, four, (left) has helped launch a fundraising drive so her best friend Matilda Duncan, five, (right) can undergo pioneering treatment which will enable her to walk . Her family are unable to afford the £25,000 treatment but a fundraising appeal has been launched in the hope that 25,000 will pledge £1. Casey is leading the campaign drive to raise the funds to get her friend walking. The four-year-old said: 'Matilda is only five and so doesn’t have enough money in her piggy bank. So me and my mummy are helping Matilda and her mummy to raise the money. 'We need to ask 25,648 people for £1 each, but I don’t know that many people. I don’t mind that I can’t have the operation - I just want my best friend to be okay. 'If everyone could give me just a few pennies then Tilly will be able to walk. I don’t want a lot from one person, just a little from many.' Her friend Matilda said: 'Casey is my best friend and we both have cerebral palsy. She can’t have an operation but the doctors say that I can. I love her for helping me. I will always help her too.' Best friends: Casey, four, (right) uses a wheelchair and will never be able to walk. Her friend Matilda will be able to walk if her family can raise £25,000 for her to undergo treatment . The girls, who became friends after meeting at nursery, were both born prematurely and both have perfectly healthy twins. Casey and her twin Carmel live with their older brother Luca, five, and parents Suzanne and Mike, in Eastcote, west London. Matilda currently uses a walking frame and callipers to get around while Casey uses a wheelchair. Matilda and her twin brother Matthew live with their mother Rachel Knowles, 41, and their project manager father Matthew Duncan, 41, in Hayes, west London. Her family discovered she was eligible for the revolutionary procedure, known as Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy, just before Christmas. Rachel, a shop assistant, said: 'After loads of tests, Great Ormond Street Hospital send us a letter saying that Matilda was eligible for the operation. Best friends: Casey (left) and Matilda (right) met each other because they go to the same nursery in west London . Fundraisers: Casey and Matilda, who have cerebral palsy, both have healthy twin siblings. Pictured (left to right) are Carmel Burke, four, Matthew Duncan, five, Casey Burke, four, and Matilda Duncan, five . Fundraising drive: Casey and Matilda are pictured (right) along with their twins Carmel and Matthew (left) 'They said they could pay for the cost of the operation, but we would need to pay £25,648 for pre and post-op care. 'I don’t have a problem with being asked to pay towards our daughter’s care, but we could simply never be able to afford such a great expense.' Mother: Rachel Knowles with her daughter Matilda Duncan . The revolutionary spinal operation will require Matilda to stay in hospital for a week, and undergo weeks of intensive physiotherapy. Casey’s mother Suzanne, 43, said: 'The operation is a very rare and complicated procedure which only a few Cerebral Palsy sufferers can benefit from. 'Unfortunately, Casey’s condition is too severe for her to be able to have the operation herself. 'She suffers from hip dysplasia, and has already had two operations that removed her legs and pinned them back in the correct position. 'Casey never complains - she’s an absolute angel. I’m so proud.' Casey’s campaign has already raised nearly £3,500 for her best friend, and she hopes that Matilda will have enough money by the end of 2014 to pay for the operation. Selective dorsal rhizotomy concentrates on the lower part of the spinal cord and involves cutting the nerves that cause the symptoms of cerebral palsy. The operation, which was pioneered in America, was first carried out in Britain in 2011. However, NHS trusts have struggled to fully fund the procedure. To donate, please visit www.justgiving.com/walking-Matilda or text the code MPJS50 followed by £1, £2 or £10 to 70070. The campaign is backed by children’s charity Tree Of Hope and all funds will go to help Matilda.","Casey Burke, four, has helped launch a drive to raise money so her friend Matilda Duncan can have a pioneering operation .

A gym-loving benefit cheat who stole £21,000 after claiming she was too disabled to dress herself has been prosecuted after she was filmed working out. Anne Bird, 60, was seen running, jumping and bending by investigators tipped off that the claimant had been going to circuit training, Spinning classes and Pilates for six years. Bird was handed a 12 week suspended jail sentence at Walsall Magistrates Court. Investigators set up a surveillance operation to monitor her exercise regime before prosecuting her, and found that she enjoyed strenuous exercise. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Keeping active: Benefit cheat Anne Bird, 60 (front) is seen here rolling on a Swiss ball, despite telling the DWP that she was too disabled to dress herself or get out of a bath . Bird, who suffers from a degenerative condition and has admitted her fraud, had previously been a Royal Mail delivery worker, but left in 2008 due to health problems. Nimble: The 60-year-old was seen exercising with a skipping rope at this leisure centre session, stretching her back, arms and legs . Maggie Meakin, prosecuting, told Walsall Magistrates Court that the defendant was overpaid by a total of £21,109 after making false declaration on claim forms to obtain disability allowance. 'It was confirmed by a doctor that she has osteoarthritis and that she needs help to bathe and dress, and needed help to walk,' she said. 'She then applied for the higher rate of disability living allowance claiming at this point that she needed help as she had problems with her knees and hips. 'The department was made aware that from October 2006 to August 2012 she was attending Bloxwich Leisure Centre and was participating in group exercise including pilates and circuit training. She then upgraded her membership to sessions which included aerobics. 'In witness statements the staff said they were aware she had problems with her knee, but she took part in spinning bike classes.' Bird, of Pleck, suffers from osteoarthritis in her legs and rheumatoid arthritis in her hands. She was entitled to some benefits, but not the full amount that was paid to her. She had previously denied two counts of dishonestly making a false statement to obtain a benefit, but changed to guilty pleas earlier this week ahead of the matter going to trial. In sentencing her on Wednesday, magistrates jailed her for 12 weeks suspended for 12 months and handed her a six-month supervision order with probation. Shame: The cheat was also filmed doing rigorous sit-ups and press ups while balancing on a fitness ball . Spared prison: Bird was handed a suspended sentence . She was also ordered to pay £300 costs and victims' surcharge £80. Lee . Preston, defending, said she had already repaid the money. 'She . borrowed and also used her pension lump sum to repay the money. 'Her condition is degenerative. She will get less and less mobile as time goes on. 'The sums have long been repaid. She was following advice from her doctor and physiotherapist to exercise as much as possible. 'It is unlikely that she will ever appear before the courts again.' Zaynab Tarajia, representing the probation service, said Bird was unsuitable for carrying out unpaid work in the community due to her continuing health issues. She told the court Bird had explained that she had followed her GP's advice to exercise. She said: 'She admits that on occasion she exercised more than she needed to do and admits that she should have told the DWP about her improved health as she would have been entitled to benefits, but less than she received. She is extremely remorseful of her actions.' Bird is in receipt of carers' allowance regarding her husband's care and is now set to get advice over the correct benefits that she should be claiming for her own illness.","Anne Bird was seen running, jumping, stretching and bending in classes .

"By . Anonymous . PUBLISHED: . 21:02 EST, 9 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 06:50 EST, 10 January 2014 . She's brilliant in her latest film... apparently: Cate Blanchett . Next month, all eyes will turn to the Royal Opera House in London’s Covent Garden for the glittering annual Bafta film awards ceremony. On February 16, the great and the good of the film world will walk the (usually somewhat soggy) red carpet, and prizes will be handed out for Best Actor and Actress, Best Director and, the biggie, the Best  Film of 2013. A Bafta is one of the most prestigious prizes in the business, and winning one represents the pinnacle of most people’s careers. Even being nominated can catapult you into the major league. And so you would imagine that the 6,500-strong voting membership of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts has a thoughtful, fair and well-considered procedure for choosing the five nominees in each category (announced last Wednesday) and then for picking the ultimate winner. You might be surprised. As a Bafta voter for many years I can reveal that the voting process is based less on artistic merit than on a combination of coercion, trend-following and pot luck. Here’s how it works. Maybe 100 films released over the past 12 months have a realistic chance of winning a Bafta, and probably 70 to 80 of those are released in the last two months of the year. Distributors seem to think Bafta voters have short memories and, given the average age of the Bafta voter — there are a lot of retired film people in the Academy — they might be right. So, around November, you start getting invited to screenings and Q&A sessions with cast and crew. Gone are the days of the lavish dinners and all-expenses-paid jollies — but you are certainly looked after. A Mayfair hotel. A complimentary glass of champagne. Not an inducement, of course. But we hope you enjoyed the film. These events are expensive to put on. So already the field of competitors is being narrowed down to the Hollywood studios with their big marketing budgets. They will spend hundreds of thousands of dollars putting adverts in the trade press, targeting voters with what are known as ‘For Your Consideration’ ads — inviting academy members to consider voting for their films and their stars. How can a low-budget independent film compete against that? And while everyone wants to see films on the big screen, that’s not always possible. Not everyone lives in London, for one thing. So, as the year draws to a close, you start receiving ‘screeners’. These DVDs are one of the great perks of being a Bafta member, and mean you can watch the main awards contenders in the comfort of your own home. Previous winners: Emma Thompson and Dame Judy Dench who have both won Baftas . But still, you now have 50 or 60 films to get through. In less than a month. With Christmas in the middle. And a deadline of January 3 to vote for your five nominations in each category. It’s just not possible to watch them all. So which ones rise to the top of the pile? The ones you’ve already heard about. And the ones that have already started winning. From late November onwards, reviewers and film critic groups start to publish their ‘Top 10’ lists. The New York Film Critics Circle is an early big one at the start of December, followed by the American National Board Of Review a few days later, and the Golden Globe nominations a week after that. (Can you see a pattern emerging? The Americans are already setting the pace.)This year, films such as 12 Years A Slave, Gravity and American Hustle got a lot of early momentum. Other much-hyped films such as The Great Gatsby or August: Osage County started to fall away. Lupita Nyong’o from 12 Years A Slave was hailed early on as a shoo-in for Best Supporting Actress, and now looks set to claim the Bafta. Old favourite Bruce Dern was hailed the comeback king for his Best Actor role in the little-seen Nebraska, and sure enough he has bagged a Bafta nomination. So, very quickly, the front-runners are anointed. And they ride that wave all the way to the Baftas and beyond. The point is clear. We’re sheep. And we follow the sheep in front of us. And the little guys fall by the wayside. But the days are still ticking by, and you still have all these films to watch, and you’ve been meaning to get to them but you can’t, and there are all these obvious front-runners . . . And so you do it. You vote for a film you haven’t seen. Let’s be clear. Bafta voting guidelines state explicitly that you must only vote for films you have seen. Which makes perfect sense. But I’ve done it. And I bet everyone else has, too. You vote for the ones you think are going to win. It’s why the same old names appear year after year. On February 16, the great and the good of the film world will walk the red carpet, before Bafta awards are handed out . Judi Dench could blow her nose and she’d get nominated (she famously won a Bafta for her eight minutes of screen time as Elizabeth I in Shakespeare In Love). Emma Thompson, check. Tom Hanks, check. Kate Winslet, hmm, she wasn’t in a movie this year, can I vote for her anyway? Are these really the crowning performances of their careers? No, but they’ll get nominated anyway. And because we’re British we’ll throw a few bones to British films such as Philomena (about a woman’s search for her long-lost son) or the motor-racing drama Rush — both wonderful movies, as it happens, but a little national pride goes a long way at the Baftas. Voting is done online now, and it takes five minutes. Click, click, click. I voted for Cate Blanchett because apparently she’s amazing in Woody Allen’s Blue Jasmine. And it’ll be great if she turns up to the awards. And having Woody films on the shortlist makes Bafta look smarter. Cate’s practically British anyway. And I’m sure I’ll get round to seeing it one day. I voted for Martin Scorsese. I haven’t seen The Wolf Of Wall Street but everyone knows Scorsese is a film-making genius and I have no doubt that his latest is up to his usual breathtakingly high standard. Click, click, send. It’s that easy. You back winners, and winners are the ones with momentum, and momentum is generated by marketing muscle, pure and simple. Hang on, you say. How does The Artist, a French black-and-white film with no dialogue, win the Bafta for Best Picture in 2012? Exactly the same way, with momentum. The king of the ‘Awards Push’ is American mogul Harvey Weinstein, who, along with his brother Bob, has helped his films win 75 Oscars in the past 20 years. He saw The Artist, bought it, and ran a textbook campaign, pitching it as ‘The Little Film That Could’. Boy, could it ever. There are two problems at play here. The first is this insistence on pushing out every quality movie in the last two months of the year. It overloads us, and leaves cinemas empty of decent material the rest of the time. The Olivier Theatre Awards, the Costa Book Awards, the Turner Prize for art can all take a year’s worth of work and examine it in a more considered fashion, and with an element of perspective. Can’t the film industry do the same? But the second is more worrying. Bafta is still happy — desperate even — to be seen as the Oscars’ younger brother, the penultimate awards ceremony in a months-long bandwagon leading up to the big daddy. So Hollywood stars turn up to a ceremony they might otherwise avoid, and TV ratings boom. It’s why we work to these crazy timelines, why we still vote for so many American movies in the British Academy Awards, and why relatively few home-grown films get recognised. Surely we are a big enough country to define for ourselves what is worthy of praise, rather than following the lead of the Americans? But maybe the system does work, after all. I voted for 12 Years A Slave in several categories and I confidently predict it will win big at both the Baftas and the Oscars. As it should — considering it’s the best film of the year. At least, so I’m told.","The Baftas will take place on February 16 .

Tyson Foods announced on Wednesday that they will be improving their animal care policies after shocking undercover footage of abuse at a supplying pig farm surfaced from an animal rights group. Tyson food sent out letters on Wednesday to farms requiring that they stop employing 'blunt force euthanasia' as a means of killing piglets. They also told farms to use 'pain mitigation techniques' when castrating the piglets and when removing a part of the tail. NBC reports that Tyson wrote in their letter that they understood how using blunt force to kill pigs 'has been historically acceptable' for some time in the meat industry but may not match the expectations of today’s customers or consumers.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO -- WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Horrible: This man violently shakes an innocent piglet . Pregnant and abused: This pig is too fat to move, so workers kick it down the walkway . Even though the letter strongly encourages that all farms end blunt force euthanasia, the only farms forced to adhere to the new policies are farms that have contracts with Tyson and where Tyson owns some of the animals. Farms not under contact can choose to apply the new standards or not to. 'We’re trying to balance the expectations of consumers with the realities of today’s hog farming business,' said the letter signed by a senior vice president and the vice president who runs the company’s Animal Well-Being Programs. 'We look forward to working with you on our current challenges,' it said. The Executive Director of the animal rights group who filmed the video, Nathan Runkle was encouraged and appreciative of Tyson's efforts. 'The announcement that Tyson is making significant animal welfare improvements, including urging its pork producers to move away from inherently cruel and restrictive gestation crates, signals an important new era and direction for the company,' said Runkle. 'We urge Tyson to add more teeth to the new guidelines by making them a mandate for all of its pork producers, rather than a mere recommendation.' The appalling video . aired by NBC in November was shot at West Coast Farms between September and October by an . activist with Mercy for Animals and shows pigs being punched, kicked, . smashed into concrete and locked in cages so small they can’t even move. The undercover worker who shot the video named 'Pete' told NBC news that the abuse was 'commonplace' at the farm. West Coast Farms, in Oklahoma, supplied meat for Tyson, according to Mercy for Animals. Tyson severed all ties after the video was made public. ‘We’re extremely disappointed by the mistreatment shown in the video and will not tolerate this kind of animal mishandling,’ a Tyson spokesperson told The Daily Dot following the incident. ‘We are immediately terminating our contract with this farmer and will take possession of the animals remaining on the farm,’ he added. No anesthesia provided: Piglets have their tails cut and testicles removed without the benefit of any medication to dull the pain . Appaling: This worker sits on the pig, repeatedly punching it . No big deal: A former hog farm worker commented on Reddit that the pigs don't even feel the punches . Despicable: This piglet is kicked by an out-of-control farmhand . Over the top: It is not uncommon for animals to be hit, the former farmhand said, but it usually never approaches this level of violence . Farm owner Lonnie Herring reportedly fired all employees involved in the video, but their faces were often obscured from sight. The . disturbing footage begins with a montage of animals being hit with . wooden boards, kicked, beaten and lying in pools of blood or locked in . cages. The deplorable physical abuse didn’t just stop at kicking and punching the defenseless pigs. Piglets . also endured being violently shaken, thrown through the air only to be . spiked on to the concrete floor like footballs or even held by the tail . and swung repeatedly into the floor. A walkway is shown with several bloody piglets on the ground having seizures or writhing in agony, blood is splattered everywhere. Multiple piglets have their tails removed either with a shovel swung violently down on the tail, severing it, or with a pair of shears – no painkillers are administered. Another unfortunate piglet is also shown being held by their hind legs and having their testicles removed, again without painkillers or anesthesia. The suffering causes it to let out a loud squeal and violently shake. A pregnant pig too fat to move is kicked, punched and has clumps of hair ripped out. Horrifying: This pig is still alive, but has begun to rot after being tossed on a pile of other dead pigs . Even live pigs are left to starve and rot amongst corpses . This is not right: Piglets writhe in agony after being slammed onto the concrete floor, some have seizures . Not uncommon, but being done wrong: Ill or infirm piglets are often slammed into the ground to instantly kill them, according to a former pig farm employee . One pig had a bowling ball thrown at its head, other had their eyes gouged out or their ears violently pulled. Pigs barely clinging to life are tossed in piles of dead pigs, they start to rot even though they are still living. A Reddit user who once worked on a hog farm commenting that the abuse shown in the video is far from uncommon, but that this farm took it too far. ‘Piglets are killed by having their heads smashed against the concrete because it’s quick and if done properly (which those guys aren’t doing) the piglets are dead before they even know what happened,’ said legless_kraig. Close quarters: Pregnant pigs are kept in tightly-packed pens that provide no room to move . Waiting to die: The miserable pigs have nothing to live for, they are stripped of their dignity several times a day . Dead inside: The sad images show pigs suffering from depression, malnourishment and a host of other issues . ‘Pulling by the ears to get them to move somewhere specific was common and kicking in the back end was too but realistically the pigs feel nothing from the kicking,’ he continued. ‘Gouging of the eyes was something that was done to the adult pigs when they weren't moving down the aisles or being stubborn and hard to handle,’ the Redditor further explained. The pigs are miserable. They are mistreated, malnourished and then sent to slaughter – if they endure the torture long enough to be that lucky. Most of the employees are miserable too, legless_kraig wrote. ‘It wasn't a job I felt proud of doing but I was young and needed a way to get money… that last year was a struggle every day to just drive to work.’ The owner of the farm, Lonnie Herring, said he was also shocked by the video. 'I was stunned that anyone could be that callous in their treatment of . any animal,' said Lonnie Herring to NBC. 'After viewing the video, I . immediately returned to my farm and terminated the employees seen in the . video.' Herring said that he used approved euthanasia methods he calls 'humane.' He also said workers are instructed to make sure an animal is dead before they leave it. 'It is a part of the business and there are prescribed methods of euthanasia and I follow those to a T,' said Herring.","Tyson food sent out letters on Wednesday to farms requiring that they stop employing 'blunt force euthanasia' as a means of killing piglets .

Millions of diners are too scared to eat oysters and prefer to eat fish fingers, rather than tucking into fish with eyes, a new study has revealed. Although cookery programmes are among the most popular shows on television, it seems that when it comes to adventurous eating it seems many of us have a long way to go. In fact, one in five adults are so put off by fish that they would only eat them if they were coated in breadcrumbs and shaped into 'fingers'. Phobia: Oysters have come top of a list of the nation's 10 most-feared foods, with a third of people refusing to eat them . The survey, carried out by restaurant chain Loch Fyne found that seafood was among the UK's most feared foods, with oysters coming out on top as a third of people refuse to eat them and one in 10 will not eat any fish whatsoever. Fish with eyes came second in the poll and anchovies were fifth, while shellfish and fish on the bone took up places eight and nine. Only offal and meat cooked rare managed to break the underwater monopoly on the top five spots, while blue cheese, liver and gherkins also appeared in the top 10. Childhood favourite: One in five adults are so put off by fish that they will only eat them in the form of fish fingers . Experts say many food phobics are put off by the smell, look and texture of fish and seafood. Food psychologist Dr Christy Fergusson said that many people were averse to eating fish because of a subconscious association with it. 'Perhaps the look of the whole fish with the eyes on the plate freaked them out as a child. Maybe the texture of seafood reminds them of something unpleasant,' she told the Mirror. Dr Fergusson said that some fussy eaters even chose to stay well clear of more popular foods, such as cottage cheese and baked beans - while the survey found that some people could not even bring themselves to eat chocolate or bagels. She added: 'One reason to explain this could be that as a child they experienced some form of stress or anxiety while eating the food or the texture or feel of the food reminded them of something unpleasant.' Turn off: Boasting both eyes and bones, this fish dish would be too scary for many . 1. Oysters - 34.7% . 2. Fish with eyes - 34.5% . 3. Offal - 33% . 4. Meat cooked rare - 29% . 5.

Condemned: This undated file photo shows death row inmate Dennis McGuire, who raped and murdered a pregnant woman in 1989 . An Ohio inmate facing execution next week from an untried method is at substantial risk of a medical phenomenon known as air hunger. This would cause condemned killer David McGuire, 53, to experience terror as he strains to catch his breath, an anesthesiologist testified Friday at a federal court hearing. Because McGuire has several characteristics of sleep apnea, or the struggle to breathe while asleep, the chances are even greater he will be subjected to feelings of suffocation, an expert warned. 'Mr. McGuire is at a substantial risk . of experiencing the terror of air hunger during the first five minutes . of the execution,' Professor David Waisel, of Harvard Medical School, . said. 'Air hunger is a horrible feeling,' Waisel added. 'It's the inability to get your breath.' Professor . Waisel is a witness for defense attorneys trying to stop McGuire's . execution next Thursday. He testified at the beginning of a two-day . hearing on the state's new lethal drug process. Ohio . plans to use intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and . hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death. The . method has been part of Ohio's execution process since 2009, though . never used. It was chosen because of a shortage of other lethal . injection drugs. The state says its own anesthesiology expert is ready to argue that experiments have shown nothing of the sort will happen. Experimental: McGuire is scheduled to be executed next week at this facility but an expert has testified that he may experience terror as he strains to catch his breath due to Ohio's untested execution method . Punishment: The death chamber at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. Ohio plans to use intravenous doses of two drugs, midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, to put McGuire to death . Such dueling arguments have taken place often in federal judge Gregory Frost's courtroom over the years. Frost has heard numerous arguments for and against Ohio's lethal injection process. He has never ruled the drugs themselves unconstitutional, but he has at times harshly criticized the state for conducting haphazard executions by not closely following its own policies. McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for . the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in . western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant. 'McGuire . will experience the agony and terror of air hunger as he struggles to . breathe for five minutes after defendants intravenously inject him with . the execution drugs,' the inmate's attorneys said in a Monday court . filing. Victim: McGuire, 53, was sentenced to die for the 1989 rape and fatal stabbing of Joy Stewart in Preble County in western Ohio. The 22-year-old Stewart was newly married and pregnant . Higher courts have twice rejected claims that the drugs pose a risk of severe pain, the state argued in opposing McGuire's attempt to stop his execution. The state says that because courts have upheld the use of those drugs in the backup method, McGuire can't challenge their use just because they are to be given intravenously. There is no excuse for not raising . this claim years ago, 'much less presenting it for the first time in an . eleventh-hour stay of execution,' lawyers for the Ohio attorney . general's office said in their filing. Late . Wednesday, McGuire's attorneys filed a separate appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court, saying information about his chaotic childhood of abuse . and neglect could have prevented him from being sentenced to death if it . was presented at trial. The . filings argue McGuire was so malnourished as a child that his stomach . was swollen and distended. He also had to frequently steal food for . himself and his younger sister, the appeal said. McGuire . was physically abused by at least four different parental figures and . shows signs of brain damage from head trauma, the attorneys said. The filings say jurors who sentenced McGuire to death never got to hear the full extent of his chaotic childhood because his trial attorneys didn't properly investigate reasons he should be spared. Even without the full picture of McGuire's life, a juror held out for 12 hours before relenting, a sign that a full investigation might have led to a different outcome, the lawyers said. In Ohio, one juror can block a death sentence by voting against it. The state's response to that claim is expected Monday.","Ohio's untried execution could cause killer David McGuire to experience 'air hunger' during planned death next week .

Speakes died at home in Cleveland, Miss., where he had lived the past several years, said Bolivar County Coroner Nate Brown. Brown said Speakes had Alzheimer's disease. 'He died in his sleep and it was a natural death,' Brown said. Spokesman: Larry Speakes served as press secretary for President Ronald Reagan and Assistant Press Secretary for President Gerald Ford . Speakes was buried in North Cleveland Cemetery during a private service Friday morning, a few hours after dying, said Kenny Williams of Cleveland Funeral Home. Speakes became Reagan's acting spokesman after Press Secretary James Brady was wounded during an assassination attempt on Reagan in 1981.In a statement issued from Los Angeles, former first lady Nancy Reagan said that she was 'saddened to learn about Larry, who served Ronnie with great loyalty in one of the toughest jobs in the White House.' 'He stepped up in very difficult circumstances and was an articulate and respected spokesman day in and day out, including some very historically significant moments,' Reagan said. 'It is a source of special sadness to know he suffered from Alzheimer's disease.' Ronald Reagan died in 2004 after a 10-year battle with Alzheimer's disease.

Republican Haley Barbour, who served as Mississippi governor from 2004 to 2012, was political director of the Reagan White House when Speakes worked there. He said Friday that it wasn't unusual to have tension between the political office and the press office, but he and Speakes had a good working relationship. Barbour said that within the Reagan administration, people generally admired Speakes' handling of the press, although Speakes could be abrupt. 'Sometimes, that meant reporters didn't get everything they wanted, and sometimes it meant they didn't get anything,' Barbour said Friday. 'But, Larry knew who he worked for.' Peter Roussel, who worked with Speakes in the Ford and Reagan press offices, said Speakes conducted more than 2,000 press briefings. 'Larry set high performance standards for himself and for those who worked for him,' Roussel said. Dennis Brack, a photographer who has covered the White House for the Black Star photo agency since the 1960s, said Speakes had a good relationship with photographers during the years when Reagan, a former actor, was president. Speakes says the day Brady was shot, he'd asked the press secretary if he would like him to fill in. Brady said no and was shot an hour later . But when photographers took pictures of President Gerald Ford falling down the steps of Air Force One in Austria in 1976, Speakes complained that the press was determined to make the president 'look like a klutz,' said Brack, author of Presidential Picture Stories: Behind the Cameras at the White House, published in December. Weeks after leaving his White House job in 1987, Speakes said during a speech at East Texas State University that he often thought about the day Reagan, Brady and two others were wounded when John Hinckley Jr. opened fire. 'Shortly before the president left that day to go the Hilton Hotel to make a speech, I said to Jim, ""Do you want to go with the president, or would you like me to go?"" And he said, ""I believe I'll go,'"" Speakes said. 'And had it not been in that one split second, I would have been exactly where Jim Brady was at that moment an hour or so later. ... It's not a day goes by that I don't think about that.' After leaving the White House, Speakes worked for Merrill Lynch in New York. Speakes left the Merrill Lynch job after he wrote in his memoir, Speaking Out, that he had fabricated quotes for President Reagan while working for him. Speakes (right) seen here with other presidential press secretaries, suffered from Alzheimer's Disease, just like his boss, President Reagan . He returned to Washington in 1988 and worked in public relations for Northern Telecom and the U. S. Postal Service, retiring in 2008. Speakes grew up in Merigold, Miss., and graduated from the University of Mississippi. He worked for two Mississippi newspapers, the Oxford Eagle and the Bolivar Commercial, before going to Washington in 1968 as press secretary for U.S. Sen. James O. Eastland, D-Miss. In 1974, Speakes worked as press secretary for the special counsel to President Richard Nixon during the Watergate hearings. After Nixon resigned, Speakes became assistant press secretary for President Gerald Ford. Speakes worked as press secretary for Ford's vice presidential running mate, Bob Dole, during the 1976 campaign. After Democrat Jimmy Carter won the election, he moved to the Hill and Knowlton public relations firm in Washington. Speakes worked for Reagan's transition team after Reagan won the 1980 election, then became deputy press secretary under Brady. Speakes is survived by a daughter, Sandy Speakes Huerta of Cleveland, Miss; sons Scott Speakes of Cleveland, Miss., and Jeremy Speakes of Clifton, Va.; six grandchildren and one great-grandchild.","Speakes also served as assistant press secretary to President Gerald Ford .

It may come as little surprise to long-suffering employees but new research has confirmed that your boss is far happier than you. Top managers have a more satisfying family life, enjoy greater financial security and have a higher sense of career fulfilment, according to a comprehensive but predictable study. Earnings may have some bearing on the . job satisfaction; half of all bosses earn more than $75,000 while only a . third of employees take home a similar wage, The Pew . Research Center survey found. Snowed under: Workers said they were far less satisfied with their careers than their bosses. (Stock picture) Four-in-ten top managers say they are very satisfied with . their financial situation, compared to just 28 per cent of workers. Overall . about eight-in-ten bosses (83 per cent) describe themselves as 'very satisfied' with their family situation. In contrast, about seven-in-ten (74 per cent) of . workers are similarly content with their home lives. Tough at the top: Bosses are more satisfied with their family life, current job and their financial situation than their workers, a study found . Bosses . also are more likely to say they have sufficient education and training . to help them succeed (73 per cent vs. 57 per cent) and to believe they are fairly paid . for the work they do (62 per cent vs. 54 per cent). Senior managers are only about half as likely as workers to be looking for another job (12 per cent vs. 23 per cent). The study of 2,002 adults also highlighted that men are far more likely than women to rise to the top. Bad career move: Bosses were less likely to complain that having children harmed their career progression - but top managers were more likely to be men, the study found . Top managers said having . children has not been an obstacle to promotion, with only a third . saying family life harmed their advancement. However, . more than four in five workers lower down the pecking order complained . that raising a family hurt their career progression. The survey found top managers and workers are equally likely to be found in church or attending some other religious service. The survey asked adults if they would like to someday be a boss or top manager. Among all employed adults, about four-in-ten (39 per cent) say they would while a roughly similar share (43 per cent) say they would not. But 16 per cent of workers surveyed say they . already are the boss or a top manager where they work. It is this group . at or near the top of the career ladder that is the primary focus of . this analysis. On average, bosses are about eight years older than workers (47 vs. 39) so as a group they are further along in their careers. Only about one-in-five bosses (20 per cent) and workers (18 per cent) say a big salary is extremely important while somewhat . similar proportions highly value a job that helps society (19 per cent and 23 per cent) and opportunities for advancement (25 per cent and 24 per cent). About . half of top managers (52 per cent) and employees (48 per cent) say it’s easier for a . man than a woman to get a top job in government or business. And exactly . the same proportion say men generally earn more for doing the same work . (54 per cent for both sexes).

Seven-in-ten bosses and a . similar share of workers (75%) say that men and women are paid the same . for doing the same job where they work. Equally large majorities agree . that women and men have the same opportunities to advance. Today’s bosses also are somewhat better educated than other adults.

The war began with a British invasion of Zululand, and ended with almost 8,000 dead, a British victory and Zulu independence. Now, a Zulu shield from the 1879 war is being put up for auction. The rare tribal shield which belonged to a young Zulu warrior is believed to have been used in the infamous battle of Isandlwana, a massacre that claimed the lives of over 1,300 British soldiers. Scroll down for video . The Zulu war shield, or 'isihlangu' for sale: expected to sell for £800 at an auction which is thought to have been used in the battle of Isanlwana . Used . as a weapon and armour in the 19th century the 4ft tall cover was . wielded by a Zulu warrior in the massacre that took place immediately . before the Battle of Rorke's Drift. The . Zulus charged at the British troops holding shields in front of them . and hit their target with it before stabbing them with a long spear. The primitive shield was made out of dried cow skin and the black colour and dark pattern of the leather suggest it was held by a young warrior and not an experienced fighter, who has lighter coloured shields. Collection: Zulu stabbing spears (left) and staffs, collected as part of the set of artefacts up for auction .

A 4ft long spear with a lethal 9 inch blade is also for auction, and is expected to sell for £900.

David Smith, a former Royal Marine Commando from Beckenham, Kent amassed the collection. There . are over 150 items for sale including a wooden club that was used by an . executioner, worth £300, and a necklace made from lion's teeth worth . £2,000. Mr Smith died aged 65 in 2009 and the items are being sold by his partner, Roberta Welham. Ian Knight, a historian for Wallis and Wallis, said: 'In the 19th century every Zulu man had a shield. 'Smaller examples of the shields were kept for personal use whereas the larger ones would have been used in battle. Fight scene: Michael Caine (left) played Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead in the 1964 film, Zulu . Comparison: The film showed how the British soldiers were equipped with guns while the tribesmen only had spears and shields . As the warriors who fought at Isandlwana . on January 22, 1879 were mostly young men, it is highly likely to have . been used there. 'The King placed men in regiments . when they turned 18, similar to doing national service, and he would . give them a herd of cattle with similar colourings and markings.

'I believe that the large, dark, shield in this collection could have been used in the Battle of Isandlwana in 1879 because in that particular war, the warriors were quite young. 'Once the British had conquered the Zulu kingdom six months later it is likely that they gathered up items like these to take back home as a souvenir of the war. 'They normally have a shelf life of around five years but it was probably well looked after and this would explain why it has remained in such good condition. 'One of the spears in the sale was taken from the battlefield after the Ulundi war, we know that because a British troop appears to have carved 'Ulundi' and the year on it. 'Other weapons in the sale are a spear called an Iklwa, because of the noise it apparently made when someone was stabbed with it, and an executioners club. 'It is rare to see a collection of . this size and I haven't seen anything like it come up for sale during my . whole time of collecting Zulu artefacts.' The auction takes place on January 22. The Anglo - Zulu war took place during 1979, starting with an invasion by the British in January and ending with a British victory and Zulu independence five months later . The British invasion of Zululand began on the 11th of January 1879, with the British objective being an eventual federation in Africa. The battle of Isandlwana erupted on the 22nd of January 1879, . 11 days after the British started their invasion. 20,000 Zulu warriors . attacked 1,800 British, colonial and native troops and 400 . civilians. The Zulus, who had more numbers, overwhelmed the British, killing . over 1,300 troops, while around 1,000 Zulu soldiers were killed. The . battle of Rorke's drift started almost immediately after, ending on the 23rd, after 150 . British and colonial troops were set upon, and ended up successfully . defending themselves against an assault by almost 4,000 Zulu warriors. The Battle of Ulundi on the 4th of July 1879 effectively ended the Zulu-Anglo war, with the defeat of the Zulu forces by the British when over 5,200 British and African soldiers razed the capital of Zululand after defeating the main Zulu army. The war ultimately ended with a British victory, and Zulu independence.","Battle of Isandlwana took place in 1879 and killed over 1,000 soldiers .

Karren Brady, 44, pictured in London last night, says going back to work two days after giving birth to her first child is a 'deep regret' Apprentice star Karren Brady says she feels 'a deep regret' for going back to work just two days after she had her first child. The successful businesswoman and mother-of-two made the frank admission about her 'pretty hardcore' decision in a television interview to be broadcast tomorrow. Miss Brady, 44, said she went back to work as managing director of Birmingham Football Club two days after she gave birth to Sophia, now 17, because she 'had a manager to sack'. When asked by Jonathan Ross if her career success had cost her time spent with her children, Miss Brady said: 'Well, I didn't take much maternity leave, which is a deep regret of mine. 'With Sophie, unfortunately I had a manager to sack, so I had to have my baby on the Wednesday and get up and go and do it on the Friday. 'It was pretty hardcore.' She is thought to have been referring to former Birmingham City manager Barry Fry, after she sacked him in 1996. The workaholic, who was handed a CBE for services to entrepreneurship and women in business in this year's New Year honours list, is married to former Birmingham City striker, Canadian Paul Peschisolido. She took over Birmingham City at the age of 23, had her first child, Sophia, in 1996 when she was 27, and then had son, Paolo, in 1998, when she was 29. Miss Brady told the chat show host that modern technology had made life easier for working mothers, enabling them to work wherever they are, rather than having to go into an office. And she joked about being her husband's boss, saying: 'I sold him because I needed the money. 'Most women want to give their husbands away - I managed to get a few quid for mine.' She also spoke about being diagnosed with a brain aneurysm, or bulging blood vessel, at the age of 36, saying: 'I went and had this five-hour operation and spent a couple of days in intensive care and then I was home.' Miss Brady added: 'One of the most important things about being ill is actually getting on with your life after it and closing the door and not reflecting on it. I’ve packed it away and I’ve got on with my life. 'I’ve had the best possible outcome of the operation.  There is life after brain aneurysms, and things go on and, touch wood, I’ve not had a problem with it since.' Successful: Miss Brady, seen here on the Jonathan Ross Show, has always championed women in business . new family: Karren Brady, husband Paul Peschisolido, and their baby daughter, Sophia, in 1996 . Now vice-chairman of West Ham United, . as well as Lord Sugar's right-hand woman in the Apprentice TV show, . Miss Brady, who lives in Knowle, Solihull, is an outspoken champion of . women in business. She once said: 'If you don't have a woman on your board you should write to your shareholders and explain why. 'Tell . us how many women you've interviewed and what skills they've been . lacking, because that will give us some basis to teach the new . generation of women in business.' Last year Miss Brady told a Women in the Workplace summit at Downing Street: 'Childcare is the biggest barrier for women in the workplace because if you don’t have high quality affordable childcare, you are not going to leave your children to go to work. 'Most of us won’t leave our children unless we go into a job that respects us, pays us well and give us the opportunity that we want, and if you put a barrier of quality childcare into that, it becomes even more difficult.' Miss Brady, who previously said the way she handled her maternity leave with Sophia was 'shameful', took longer off after having Paolo. Workaholic: Miss Brady was made managing director of Birmingham City Football Club at the age of 23 . Speaking previously about the battle to combine work and childcare, she said: 'When Paolo was born I took longer off and worked from home when I could. 'I tried bringing both children to the office but that didn't work out. I had to have full-time help in the end.' However her views that women should be able to combine work and family are at odds with those of Lord Sugar, who has questioned women's maternity rights. He said: 'Everything has gone too far.  We have maternity laws where people are entitled to too much.'","Lord Sugar's Apprentice co-star tells of 'deep regret' over maternity leave .

A seven-year-old Burmese refugee who was allegedly raped and fatally beaten by her Utah neighbor suffered an excruciating death, a child abuse expert has testified. Hser Ner Moo was found dead in a pool of her blood at the bottom . of 26-year-old Esar Met's shower in Salt Lake City in March 2008. On Friday, child abuse expert Lori Frasier testified on the fourth day of Met's trial, which has been full of heartbreaking details revealing the alleged torture the little girl suffered . 'This would have been terrible pain for . her,' Frasier testified, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'This kind of injury would have required force.' On trial: Esar Met, a Burmese refugee, listens to proceedings through a translator in court on Thursday as his murder trial continues. He is accused of kidnapping, raping and killing his seven-year-old neighbor . Loss: This photo of Hser Ner Moo, who was raped and beaten, was displayed at Met's murder trial. On Friday, a child abuse expert said that the little girl had likely suffered a painful death at the hands of her killer . Frasier explained that injuries to Hser's genitals were extremely rare and probably caused by forceful penetration. Images of the girl's injuries were shown to the jury. There was no DNA evidence found on the body to suggest a sexual assault took place, but Frasier said that didn't mean one hadn't taken place. 'It may have been a crime of power rather than a crime of sex,' Frasier said. 'There are a number of reasons for DNA not to be present.' Hser also suffered a broken left arm that Frasier said would have caused great pain. But defense attorneys questioned Frasier, pointing out that she specializes in abuse suffered by children who are alive, and is not licensed to perform autopsy exams, the Tribune reported. It came after emotional testimony by Mikal Wersland, a sergeant with the South Salt Lake Police Department who had helped search for the little girl after she vanished on March 31, 2008. Emotional: South Salt Lake Police's Mikal Wersland became emotional as he spoke about the desperate search for Hser in March 2008 and how he and his colleagues feared she would be found dead . Passionate: He described searching all of the houses - and his heartbreak when he heard she had been found . He fought tears in court on Thursday as he recounted how a colleague called him to say they had found the girl's body the day after they began looking for her. 'They told me they found what they believed to be blood evidence in the stairwell of one of the apartments we hadnâ€™t been able to search,' he said, using a tissue to wipe tears. 'I just thought about this poor family and having to - just the thought of having to tell this family what had happened to their little girl.' Hser's heartbroken parents gave their own emotional testimony earlier this week as they sobbed about how much they missed their only daughter. 'She was my one, my only one,' her . father, Cartoon Wah, said through an interpreter on Wednesday, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Crime scene: A photo shown in court reveals blood in the basement bathroom where Hser was found . Gruesome: Another image shows blood against a wall in the bathroom where her body was discovered . Cordoned off: A photo shows the front of Met's apartment in Salt Lake City where Hser was found dead . Scene: Hser and her family lived at this South Salt Lake complex, where she reportedly befriended Met . 'I have lost many things in my life, but this . was the biggest loss of my life... Now I have to carry on living with . this broken heart and support my family.' Before moving to Utah, the family had fled the Burmese jungle for a crowded refugee camp in Thailand, which later burned down. Her father recounted their fears as they waited for news of their missing daughter. 'The night [she disappeared] my . wife was crying,' Wah said. 'It had been too long, so we assumed, we . thought maybe our daughter is already dead.' 'I'll . never forget the look on [the mother's] face,' caseworker Carrie Pender . told the court on Thursday. 'Just the fear in her eyes that she . couldn't find her little girl.' His wife, Pearlly Wah, sobbed as she added: 'This is the biggest loss of my life. If you . gave me the whole world of happiness to exchange for this little girl, I . would say no. Nothing can pay me back because I only had one. Whenever I . see little girls run around, it breaks my heart.' In court: Met faces life in prison if he is found guilty of kidnapping and murdering his young neighbor . Painful memories: Carrie Pender, the family's caseworker, testified on Thursday and recalled the look of pain on Hser's mother's face as the family desperately searched for the missing girl in March 2008 . Hser was killed on March 31, 2008 . after she wandered from her parents' home at the same complex, telling . an aunt she was going to play downstairs. But when she failed to return home, her parents grew anxious when they couldn't find her. The . couple, who only speak their native language of Karen, contacted their . case worker who in turn called police. The little girl's body was found . the following day. Met, a 26-year-old Burmese refugee, was arrested and charged with first-degree felony counts of child kidnapping and aggravated murder. If . convicted, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. Prosecutors . decided not to seek the death penalty due to the extreme language . barriers that have already stalled the case for so long. Devastated: Pearlly Wah weeps as photographs taken at her daughter's crime scene are shown in a preliminary hearing in November 2012. The distraught mother also testified at his trial on Wednesday . Loss: Cartoon Wah, pictured in 2012, said losing his daughter has been the worst experience of his life . Defense lawyers say no one saw Met . take or kill Hser and that DNA found from his jacket and from beneath . her fingernails were from games the two had shared in days before the . murder. Met, who had also been living in a . Burmese refugee camp in Thailand before moving to the U.S., moved to the . apartment about a month before the slaying. He . lived at the house with four roommates, but defense attorneys say they . shunned him because he was a Muslim man of Indian origin. The . roommates were arrested on April 1, 2008 but they were later released. Police said they had not been home at the time of the killing and did . not know her body was in the basement bathroom. Met has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

But they can also be considered downright offensive, especially if the matching costume is 'white trash,' and it's worn to an elementary school Halloween event. A mother-daughter duo in metro Detroit did exactly that - and the reaction from parents and students were probably not what they had in mind. The pair wore their costumes to Huron Park Elementary School's 'Trunk or Treat' Halloween celebration in Roseville on Thursday evening. 'White trash': This 'white trash' Halloween costume has irked some parents at a Michigan elementary school . To become 'white trash,' the pair simply donned plain white trash bags - over black sweatshirts - with the words 'white trash' scrawled on them. Additionally, they painted their faces white with a smeared coat of black paint near their eyes. 'I was a little appalled. To me, how can you dress yourself and your . child in a white trash outfit?' parent Nicole Ekmeian said to MyFoxDetroit.com. The area where the school is located is a suffering economically like much of the rest of the city of Detroit, which recently declared bankruptcy. This has added even more fuel to the outrage of parents at the school, as the offensive slur 'white trash' has often crept its way into the area. Offensive: one parent said she was appalled that the pair would wear such an offensive Halloween costume . 'Roseville is known for ""white trash"" and you just don't do that at a kids function,' says mom Megan Manchenko. 'You can't have weapons; you can't have blood; you can't have gory stuff, but racial slurs? Go right ahead!' One person, however, didn't understand what all the fuss is about. 'I don't get offended easily,' Eric Frasier told the station. 'There's more important things in this world right now - people are out of jobs, people are homeless and not eating. Lighten up.' The school's principal said he confronted the mother about the costume, but noted that it's hard to make parents abide by the same rules as the students. Detroit: One mother said this section of Detroit is often called 'white trash,' making the costume even more offensive . Last week, the University of Colorado at Boulder told students to not wear Halloween costumes that it deemed offensive, or to be a 'crude stereotype.' On the list are cowboys, Indians, anything with a sombrero, anything 'ghetto' and anything 'white trash.' 'Making the choice to dress up as someone from another culture, either with the intention of being humorous or without the intention of being disrespectful, can lead to inaccurate and hurtful portrayals of other people's cultures,' Dean of Students Christina Gonzeles wrote in a letter to students.","Parents 'appalled' that the mother would dress her daughter in such an offensive outfit .

An elk has been found frozen solid after falling through the icy surface of a Norwegian lake. The animal was found frozen in the middle of the water near Bodo in northern Norway with just its antler visible above the ice. It appears the ice cracked beneath it as it was trying to cross and the animal fell in, but was unable to pull itself out and froze to death. Frozen: The animal was found frozen solid in the middle of the water near Bodo in northern Norway with just its antlers and back visible above the ice . Inger Sjøberg, 47, found the animal as she was skating across the lake, reported The Local. 'I was out skating with my boyfriend, and we saw something dark on the ice,' she told the Norway edition of the English language website. 'I thought it was some wood or some grass or something, and when we looked at it, we saw that it was an elk. I have never seen it before, a frozen animal in the ice.' She said she believed the elk must have fallen through earlier in the winter before the ice hardened properly. Although many can swim and bear cold weather better than humans, they can still die of exhaustion if they tread water too long . 'We had to go out a bit from land, so the ice was strong enough when he started to walk, but then further out it was not strong enough. It's part of nature that animals die in this way.' Since her grim, but unusual discovery the body has been become a local attraction and visitors have made the trip to view the frozen carcass. It is not uncommon for animals to fall into icy water, become trapped and die. Although many can swim and bear cold weather better than humans, they can still die of exhaustion if they tread water too long. Last month two horses in Missouri were rescued by firefighters from a frozen lake after they'd fallen through the ice. The dramatic rescue happened in the town of Warrenton - about 40 miles east of St. Louis - when the two horses fell through the ice on a private lake as their owner, Tina Churchill, watched helplessly. Rescuers used chainsaws to cut a path through the ice where the horses could make it out, and after about an hour, they made it to dry land - and a thankful owner.","Found frozen solid in the middle of the water in northern Norway .

"By . Rachel Quigley . UPDATED: . 10:55 EST, 25 August 2011 . Health problems: Steve Jobs, pictured in February 2011, has been battling pancreatic cancer . Steve Jobs has resigned as CEO of Apple Inc in a stunning move that ended his 14-year reign at the technology giant he co-founded in a garage. In a letter to the board of directors, he hinted at his on-going battle with pancreatic cancer as the reason, saying: 'I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer meet . my duties and expectations as Appleâ€™s CEO, I would be the first to let . you know.' He named COO Tim Cook as his successor and said he looks forward to watching the company which he nourished and made into one of the world's most powerful and recognised brands. Jobs will remain in position as board chairman and is simply relinquishing his seat as CEO. Apple shares were suspended from trade before the announcement. They had lost more than six per cent yesterday, and lost a further 2.3 per cent in pre-market trading today. Analysts reminded market investors the news was expected due to Mr Jobs' ill health and it was 'positive' that he would remain as chairman and continue to influence the company. Apple board member Art Levinson, . chairman of Genentech, issued the following statement on behalf of the . Apple board: 'Steve's extraordinary vision and leadership saved Apple . and guided it to its position as the world's most innovative and . valuable technology company. 'Steve . has made countless contributions to Apple's success, and he has . attracted and inspired Apple's immensely creative employees and world . class executive team. 'In his new role as Chairman of the Board, Steve will continue to serve Apple with his unique insights, creativity and inspiration.' The industry icon, who has been on medical leave since January 17, only briefly emerged in March to unveil the iPad 2. He later attended a dinner hosted by President Barack Obama for technology leaders in Silicon Valley. Innovator: Jobs holds the iPad during the launch of Apple's new tablet computing device in San Francisco in January 2010. It instantly became the latest must-have gadget . Guest list: Jobs takes his place as guest of honour beside President Obama. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg is on the President's right. Other guests included Google and Twitter CEOs Eric Schmidt and Dick Costolo . Jobs, who was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2003 and underwent surgery, began to . grow noticeably gaunt in 2009 and pulled out of appearances, . prompting fears that he was seriously ill. But . he denied rumours, releasing a statement saying it was simply a . 'hormone imbalance that was robbing his body of the proteins it needs'. It . was then, on 5 January, 2009, that he promised: 'I will be the first . one to step up and tell our Board of Directors if I can no longer . continue to fulfil my duties as Apple's CEO.' He received a liver transplant that same year. Though his resignation letter was short and to . the point, it was obviously full of emotion as he thanked 'the best . friends he made for life' at the billion dollar company. He . is seen as the heart and soul of Apple, with analysts and investors . repeatedly expressing concern over how the company, based in Cupertino, California, . would handle his departure. BGC Financial . analyst Colin Gillis said today: 'I will say to investors: don't panic and remain calm, it's the right . thing to do. Steve will be chairman and Cook is CEO. Tim Cook already has extensive experience running the company having all but taken over from Jobs while he was on medical leave. He has served as Apple's chief operating officer for seven years. Long . considered a front-runner to replace Jobs, Cook joined Apple in 1998 as . a senior vice president of worldwide operations and was promoted to . chief operating officer in 2004. Before . joining Apple, Cook briefly served as an executive at Compaq and spent . 12 years at IBM, where he ran manufacturing and operations for the . company's PC business. He . is credited with completely restructuring Apple's manufacturing . operations, insisting that Apple shut down its overseas factories and . farm out the work to third-party manufacturers. As a result, the company . reduced inventory and improved margins on its entire product lineup. He . has served as Jobs' right-hand man at shareholder events and has . completely handled earnings calls with analysts for last few years. While . Jobs was on medical leave from January to June 2009, Apple delivered . two back-to-back blow-out quarters, as well as an updated iPhone OS, and . new iPhone 3GS hardware. For . his performance, Apple's board rewarded Cook with a $5million bonus as . well as 75,000 restricted stock units as a thank-you for 'his . outstanding performance'. To the Apple Board of Directors and the Apple Community: . I have always said if there ever came a day when I could no longer . meet my duties and expectations as Appleâ€™s CEO, I would be the first to . let you know. Unfortunately, that day has come. I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board . sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee. As far as my successor goes, I strongly recommend that we execute our succession plan and name Tim Cook as CEO of Apple. I believe Appleâ€™s brightest and most innovative days are ahead of . it. And I look forward to watching and contributing to its success in a . new role. I have made some of the best friends of my life at Apple, and I . thank you all for the many years of being able to work alongside you. Steve . 'But Tim has been de facto chief . executive for some time and the company has been hugely successful. The . vision and the roadmap is intact.' Tim . Cook ran Apple when Jobs went on medical leave and has essentially been . running day-to-day operations since early this year, with the company . racking up record revenue and profit. Mr . Cook was previously responsible for Apple's worldwide sales and . operations, including management of the supply chain, sales activities, . and service and support in all markets and countries, according to ABC. He has been at the company since 1998 . and was recently given a $5million bonus as well as 75,000 restricted . stock units as a thank you for his 'outstanding performance'. Apple officially  became the most . valuable company in America this month and is now worth $338billion, . $1billion more than Exxon Mobil. It was confirmed in February that . Jobs was receiving treatment for cancer after the 56-year-old's gaunt . appearance fuelled rumours that he might resign any day. Pancreatic . cancers are generally some of the most lethal of all tumours, and the . most common type often kills within six months. Jobs . has battled a less common variety that grows far more slowly and . develops in the hormone-secreting section of the pancreas, according to . USA Today. Although diagnosed in 2003, his illness was not disclosed until the following year, after he'd had surgery. The . fiercely private CEO has said relatively little about his health . problems, although he did acknowledge his bout with cancer during a . commencement speech at Stanford University, saying: 'No one wants to . die. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever . escaped it.' Biography: The front cover of Steve Jobs, written by Walter Isaacson, in which he details the Apple boss's battle with cancer. The book will be released in November . In June, Jobs . got a standing ovation at a software developers' conference in San . Francisco to introduce an operating system called Lion and a wireless . service called iCloud. From the conference people tweeted that he looked 'gaunt', 'exasperated' and 'very ill'. He . stayed on stage for only three minutes before handing it over to Phil . Schiller, Apple's senior vice president for worldwide marketing. He demonstrated how photos taken with an iPhone were visible on a user's iPad moments later. The . iPhone 5 is due to hit the shops in September with almost 40 per cent . of Apple customers saying they would buy it even before they had set . eyes on it. As news of Jobs' resignation spread, Twitter and Facebook exploded with tributes to him. Teresa Kopec tweeted: 'Few *things* have given me more sheer pleasure to own than iPods, iPads, & iPhones. I'll miss your brain Steve Jobs.' SusaNorlean wrote: 'Very sad hearing about Steve Jobs. That can't be good news about his health.' Late Will posted: 'Steve Jobs proves all the money in the world means NOTHING if you're not healthy. Take the time to take care of yourself.'

A president of a company that owns a North Carolina motel where three guests were killed by carbon monoxide gas that seeped . into their room is facing felony charges. Damon Mallatere was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday and faces three counts of involuntary manslaughter and assault inflicting seriously bodily injury following the deaths at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone. Mallatere's company owns the motel, which is part of an international franchise, where police say a faulty swimming pool heater allowed . carbon monoxide to seep into the motel room through a corroded pipe. Damon Mallatere was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday and faces three counts of involuntary manslaughter after three people died of carbon monoxide poisoning at a North Carolina hotel he owned . Poisoned by carbon monoxide: Jeffrey Williams, 11, was found dead in room 225 of the Best Western Hotel because of a faulty pool water heater in June . Daryl and Shirley Jenkins from Washington state died on . April 16, but delays in investigating the cause led to 11-year-old . Jeffrey Williams' death in the same room in June. The South Carolina boy's mother Jeannie was seriously injured. Prosecutor . Britt Springer says Mallatere, 50, faces three counts of involuntary . manslaughter and assault inflicting serious bodily injury. Mallatere’s attorney told the Charlotte Observer that he was 'extremely disappointed' that charges have been pressed against him instead of the gas company that converted the heater from propane to natural gas. A message left at a telephone number listed for Mallatere wasn't returned. It was revealed in November that a . medical examiner who failed to inform police that carbon monoxide gas . that killed the elderly couple could strike again had resigned. Dr. Brent Hall, Watauga County Medical Examiner, had a report on his desk . that explained the reasons for the Jenkins' deaths, however their . toxicology reports did not make it to Boone police until after Jeffrey . Williams died two months later in room 225. Toxicology tests have confirmed that the deaths of Daryl Dean Jenkins, 73, and Shirley Mae Jenkins, 72, were both due to carbon monoxide poisoning . 'I don't know why they didn't expedite . them, but the thinking at the time was that it was not carbon monoxide,' said Chief Police Officer Dana Crawford. When Jeffrey and his mother checked into the hotel, they did not know about the previous victims - nor did the police. The state said Medical Examiner Dr. Brent Hall had received the toxicology report the week before Jeffrey Williams died but failed to share those results with Watauga County authorities who could have shut down the motel. Dr Hall suddenly resigned in November but he has not answered questions about when he received the results. Three people died last year from carbon monoxide poisoning after staying in room 225 at the Best Western Plus Blue Ridge Plaza in Boone, North Carolina . 'I can’t speculate as to why we . didn’t get them,' Police Chief Dana Crawford said, according to WSOC. Ms. Crawford said those documents could have saved the boy's life. 'I would like to think we would have . been able to conclude and find the source of that carbon monoxide, and . with that information, been able to rectify that whole situation before . this happened,' Ms Crawford said if her department knew . there was a carbon monoxide death in the room, they would have worked . with fire officials to find the leak. He said it took investigators just hours to trace it back to a pool water heater after Williams’ death.","Hotel owner Damon Mallatere was indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday and faces three counts of involuntary manslaughter .

A woman who threw gallons of boiling water into the air in a bid to make it freeze during the polar vortex instead suffered excruciating burns when the trick backfired. Crystal Wallem, 22, from Brown Deer, Wisconsin, decided to try out the trick after seeing videos showing people throwing hot water into the air before watching it turn to snow clouds above them. So last Monday, she attempted it in sub-zero temperatures and, looking for a more dramatic effect as she tried it for the third time, she took a bucket with several gallons of water outside. Scroll down for video: Warning: Graphic content . Burned: Crystal Wallem, 22, suffered second-degree burns after throwing boiling water during the polar vortex, after she had seen videos of it freezing mid-air. But the wind blew the water over her . 'It was boiling on the stove for awhile,' she told Fox6. 'I actually took the temperature. It was 220 degrees or something.' But when she released the bucket, the wind blew the scalding water across her back. 'It hurt so bad,' she recounted. 'I was probably the worst pain I have ever felt.' Her father, Scott Wallem, rushed with her to the hospital with second-degree burns. Images of her body show blisters and red burns across her entire back. Ouch! Painful: Photographs show the second-degree burns across Crystal's back after the failed trick . Scars: Doctors say she will have to wear bandages for weeks and it will take a year for the scars to heal . As her father said in the waiting room, he was stunned to see broadcasters showing people completing the boiling-water-to-ice trick. 'It's like, people, if you . saw my daughterâ€™s back, you'd stop doing this,' he told Fox6. 'For somebody her age, it's fine to try it but just be careful - but little kids are on social media and little kids are on Facebook. We have to be careful what we put out there.' He added that his daughter was the third person to check into the hospital with burns from trying to carry out the water trick. Doctors told Crystal that she will have to wear bandages across her back for a few more weeks, and the scars could take up to a year to fade. Failed: Crystal shows how she had attempted to throw water in the air to make it freeze on Monday . Mistake: Crystal, who said she had received a lot of criticism since suffering her injuries, said when she had never suffered anything so painful and warned others against trying out the trick . Before the Fox6 report went live, she . joked on her Facebook page: 'Don't give me any c*** or I'll throw a pot . of boiling water on you.' She . later lamented her decision, adding: 'It's amazing how one wrong move . can turn your reputation from smart, talented girl to that stupid, idiot . blonde.' But she added her thanks for people who have wished her well.

Trick: She had been trying to create ice droplets as another person demonstrates in this video still . Boiling water turns into snow because freezing cold air holds less vapor than warmer air. When the hot water is thrown into the cold air, the air gets more water vapor than it can hold, Mark Seeley, a climatologist at the University of Minnesota told LiveScience. The water vapor clings to particles, crystallizing into a snow cloud. Mr Seeley warned not to attempt this unless the temperature had dropped to -30F or below.","Crystal Wallem was attempting to throw boiling water into the freezing air so it would turn into snow clouds, as she had seen in videos online .

When two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line in April, spraying metal shards, nails and ball bearings into a crowd of thousands, the technicians didn't have time to deploy bomb x-ray machines. Putting their own lives at risk, Boston bomb squad sergeant Chris Connolly and his team frantically knifed open a minefield of backpacks by hand in search of more devices to prevent another devastating blast. Frantic: Bomb technicians frantically cut open backpacks and bags searching for bombs to prevent a third blast at the Boston Marathon in April . Brave: Boston Bomb Squad Sergeant Chris Connolly and his team cut open bags and backpacks with a knife in search of bombs . The so-called hand entry - a Hollywood-style search for the red wire - is not standard procedure, according to an exclusive report by WIRED. In an average operation, a team of bomb technicians will spend several hours . disassembling a single device. But after surveying the scene, Connolly quickly realized every bag could be hiding a device and 'blind hand entry' was the only option to save lives. 'If two [bombs], why not three?' Connolly . thought as he tore into the bags with a knife. He avoided zippers, which could be a . trigger, as he cut into the base of the packs. Connolly was about one of about a dozen bomb techs stationed at the finish line before the April 15 Marathon commenced. Earlier that morning, the team had searched the area for bombs - peering inside trash cans, peeking into car and store windows and inspected flower planters. That is standard procedure in the post-9/11 world. The team felt it was ready for any potential bomb threat as about half a million spectators turned out to watch nearly 25,000 athletes run the Marathon. But according to WIRED, the Boston bombings was the 'worst day of their lives' that required an unorthodox response. For technician Mitch McCormick, seeing twisted sheet metal and a battery among the debris after the bombings - so obviously out of place among the discarded shoes and jackets of the runners - was a sign the bomb had been hidden in a backpack. 'Well, now I know what I’m looking for,' he thought. He told himself: 'Mitch, this is American history in the making, and you’re smack-dab in the middle of it. Now don’t f*** this up, ’cause you’d rather be dead than have another one of these go off.' Meanwhile, Connolly was still cutting up bags. 'I’m gonna f****** die,' he thought. 'One of these is gonna be real. But that’s OK. If it goes, it goes. That’s just the way it’s going to be today.' That's when he realized he needed more technicians to clear the bags, and put in a desperate call for back-up.

When Todd Brown arrived on scene, he felt he had stepped into a minefield. Fresh from training with a retired Israeli bomb technician who taught his unit how to assess and cut into suspicious packages found near victims at a still-warm blast scene, Brown knew he had to check the bags. With only a cheap blade in his pocket, he ran up to backpacks in the crowd, placed his body between bags and a victim prone on the ground and cut. About 45 bomb technicians and 40 K-9 handlers had answered Boston police's call for help. Over the next few days, technicians pulled off grueling 16-hour days to keep up with reports of suspicious packages around time. The bomb squad deployed sophisticated equipment, including the Logos XR200, a portable x-ray unit powered by a Dewalt battery from a cordless drill, for the more suspicious looking packages. The week after the marathon, Connolly met with the police commissioner to review the bomb squad’s performance. He was worried they had missed the pressure cookers used by the bombers during that morning’s sweep of Boylston Street where the bombs hit. They hadn’t, but many in the team still felt guilty. 'Bombs went off in our city,' McCormick says. 'We’re the bomb squad. I wish we could have prevented it.'

Jailed: Rizwan Butt, a fraudster who duped a European businesswoman out of more than £650,000, has been jailed today . A former security guard who posed as an investment tycoon to con a German businesswoman out of £625,000 has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. Rizwan Butt, 45, from Manchester, tricked company chief executive Talke Stauss by pretending to be a go-between for a potential $1.5 billion dollar investment into her hedge fund. Mrs Stauss, 46, held a series of business meetings with Butt at top London hotels The Dorchester and The Ritz not realising the bachelor had been living with his mother in a £56,000 inner city terraced house in Longsight, Manchester. During the two-month scam Butt went on 'a charm offensive' with his knowledge of finance, talk of introducing investors from the Middle East and of having a Swiss bank account. After one meeting he drove former semi-professional tennis player Mrs Stauss back to her apartment in a Bentley and later professed his love for her. When he asked for $1milion as a returnable security deposit to clinch the deal, Mrs Stauss and her husband Roman, 44, agreed to transfer the money in sterling to Butt’s bank account without carrying out any checks on his background. But the alarm was raised after Eddie George - a fellow director at ATG Investment Managers Ltd - found out about the deposit and looked into Butt's background. He discovered Butt in fact ran a cleaning company with net assets of just £657. Mrs Stauss realised she had been duped when she returned from a business trip with Butt in Shanghai with a plan to leave her husband - only to be faced by Mr George insisting her lover was a fraud. When Mrs Stauss asked for the money back, Butt - who had flown home early - sent a text message saying: 'Talke my dear. No problem my love. They should have it by five this evening. Take care love. Kisses.' Four weeks later when police caught up with Butt he was at the wheel of a black Audi Q7 carrying a wad of £1,000 in cash. He had recently bought a house for £175,000 and had a black Mercedes parked in the driveway. The Bentley turned out to be rented and before the scam he drove a 2003 Honda Accord. Con: Talke Stauss (left) was duped by the former security guard after the pair met at two top London hotels for business meetings. Butt even told the German executive he had fallen in love with her . Butt, who the sole carer to his 72-year-old mother who is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer, was convicted of two counts of fraud by false representation and one count of money laundering last month. He was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for three-and-a-half years today. Sentencing, Judge Peter Openshaw told him: 'It is obvious that he managed to charm her before he wormed his way into her affections. 'She fell under his spell, she became infatuated with him and in the process she seems to have lost her critical faculties and made no checks. 'She didn’t ask for character or credit references, she said simply she trusted him. In my mind she was naive to the point of being vulnerable as the defendant recognised. 'He took advantage of her, spinning extravagant and absurd lies. It were a complete fiction yet she apparently swallowed it all. Reality: Butt's cleaning business was registered to this address in Longsight, Manchester . 'He has not shown the slightest regret or remorse. It seems to me cunning. He did not squander the proceeds and substantial amount remains in the bank account where it was restrained. 'Today he has produced documents giving consent to pay ATG Investment Managers Ltd £553,167.61. 'This was a brazen fraud committed with considerable scheming. He played the high stake game and the price must be paid.' Before the scam, Butt worked as a security guard, lived with his mother and had bought his new house with a £30,000 deposit he borrowed from two friends. During the trial Butt claimed the $1.5b deal would have gone through but it failed as ATG did not have a relevant trading licence. The jury was told the Mr and Mrs Stauss and Mr George had formed ATG in April 2012 set up an office in Clerkenwell, in London and were aiming to form a hedge fund using their expertise on banking and foreign exchange. They were introduced to Butt though a German friend who met him at a renewable energy fair and believed he was genuine. Butt said he was interested in investing and a meeting was held at the Dorchester Hotel on August 3 2012. Suspicious: When police caught up with Butt, he had bought this £175,000 home in Manchester . At a meeting at the same hotel a week later, Butt introduced Mrs Stauss to a man he said was the 'doctor from Dover' as another potential investor. He then drove Mrs Stauss home in his Bentley before saying he was dropping off his friend at the ferry port. At a third meeting at The Dorchester on August 17, Butt said he wanted to introduce investors from Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia who had $1.5billion to invest in the hedge fund and later at a wedding the Stauss’ were asked to pay a $1m security despot to Butt to 'demonstrate the legitimacy and viability' of ATG. During a subsequent meeting in a Lebanese restaurant in Knightsbridge on September 7 Butt promised to pay back the money immediately once he had shown it to his investors. The money was transferred to the account of Butt’s cleaning company Horizon Solutions UK on September 14. Family: Mrs Stauss' husband Roman - who also agreed to transfer $1million to Butt . Butt then sent Mrs Stauss an email saying: 'Hello Talke. Hope all is well with you. Meeting went really well but unfortunately I’m still here trying to sort other bits out. My investors have transferred 1.5billion into my account. 'They don’t know what security deposit I am taking off you so you need to sort this out quick so I can give them the feedback.' She replied: 'Hi Riz that sounds all good and great. Been with HSBC and they guarantee the money to be in the account by 5pm today. For your security I attach the proof of transfer with this email.' Later the pair flew to Shanghai to investigate potential investments but Butt returned to the UK early claiming his mother was ill. It emerged Butt had withdrawn £130,000 from the account just seven days after the money went in.

An Auburn fan almost won more than $50,000 for placing a bet on Monday's BCS National Title game before the teams playing in it were even decided. Mark Skiba bet on December 1 $100 that Auburn would win the BCS Title Game at . 500/1 odds - the payout would have been $50,100 if the Tigers had won. But his chances were dashed after Florida State University scored the go-ahead touchdown to put FSU up 34-31 with only 13 seconds remaining. Mr . Skiba graduated from Auburn in 1998, and had previously won a bet on . them winning the national title in 2010, according to Fox Sports. He placed the bet on tonight's game on Dec 1, before it was even known if Auburn would be in the national title game. The Auburn alum did not win the $50,100, but he did collect $2,000 earlier in the game - so it wasn't a total loss. 'I caught FSU at Even money early in the game for $2K,' he wrote on Twitter. 'So that should make some of you feel better.' Jameis Winston, Florida State's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback had other ideas though. He threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Kelvin . Benjamin with 13 seconds left and No. 1 Florida State beat No. 2 Auburn 34-31 . to win the last BCS National Championship game on Monday night. The winning toss capped a tumultuous 12 months that saw him face rape allegations, . win the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player and go undefeated to win the college . football championship.

Mr Winston struggled much of the night but was near perfect . when the Seminoles (14-0) needed it most, going 6 for 7 for 77 yards on the . game-winning 80-yard drive. A pass interference penalty on Auburn's Chris Davis . gave Florida State a first-and-goal at the 2 and on the next play Winston hit . his big receiver for the touchdown. 'I said this from Day 1 in spring ball. These kids are . special,' coach Jimbo Fisher said. 'This group never faltered. They . wanted to be elite. They wanted to go to the top and there's so much character . in this group.'

It was after that third quarter that a picture of a betting slip began circulating around Twitter. All-America kicker Roberto Aguayo's second field goal of the . night accounted for the only third-quarter points for either team as both . defenses took charge after a frenetic first half. The powerful Seminoles trailed by 18 points in the second . quarter and 21-10 at halftime, but picked up momentum in the third quarter with . solid defensive play and improvements by Winston, who was fighting a case of . big-game jitters.

Mr Winston also led a 66-yard . scoring drive late in the first half and consistently moved Florida State in . the third quarter â€” but with only three points to show for it. After trailing for the first time in any game since Sept. 28, Florida State needed a big finish to become the first team to rally from a . halftime deficit to win the BCS title game. The end of the season brings a host of questions for the embattled, and battle-tested, FSU quarterback. Will he stay in college or declare himself eligible for the NFL Draft? He is not assured of being a number one pick when going up against Alabama's QB AJ McCarron or Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel - should he also declare. The perfect setting: The BCS National Championship was played at the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, California . Will the rape allegations from last year hurt his draft stock? That cloud may never lift from Mr Winston's head, and time will only tell how NFL teams feel about his character when making draft picks when Mr Winston does decide to go pro. Will he also pursue a baseball career? The Texas Rangers have been adamant about signing the two sport collegiate star and developing him in the mold of famous two sport stars Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders. The challenge to Mr Winston being a two sport star is that neither Mr Jackson nor Mr Sanders was a quarterback, as the Dallas Morning News noted. But Mr Winston seems undeterred. 'I want to be better than Bo Jackson,' Mr Winston told reporters in New York before receiving the Heisman last month, according to the paper. 'Of course, I want to keep doing both. Thatâ€™s my dream.' His stock may never be higher, but that doesn't mean he's ready to bolt FSU's Tallahassee campus just yet. One thing is certain, he can't defend his BCS title because college football is moving to a playoff system next season.","Florida State beat Auburn 34-31 to win the last-ever BCS National Championship game .

New Jersey Republican Governor Chris Christie broke his day-long silence Wednesday afternoon to say that a petty plan to exact revenge against a Democratic mayor by bottling up traffic in his town was carried out 'without my knowledge.' Christie put out a strongly-worded statement aimed at distancing himself from the growing scandal that threatens to engulf him and put the brakes on his presidential ambitions. 'What I've seen today for the first time is unacceptable,' Christie said. 'I am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not only was I misled by a member of my staff, but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned conduct was made without my knowledge.' Shocking emails released hours earlier revealed Christie's aides punished a Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for refusing to endorse their boss by snarling commuter traffic entering his town's on-ramp to New York City's busy George Washington Bridge. 'One thing is clear: this type of . behavior is unacceptable,' he said, 'and I will not tolerate it because . the people of New Jersey deserve better. This behavior is not . representative of me or my Administration in any way, and people will be . held responsible for their actions.' Scroll down for video . Trouble in Trenton: The traffic chaos in which Mrs Genova died was caused by Gov. Christie's aides as an act of political revenge . Bottleneck: The ambulance took nine minutes to reach Mrs Genova as traffic backed up to cross the double-deck George Washington Bridge which spans the Hudson river between New York City and Fort Lee, New Jersey . Axed: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie walks with his Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Anne Kelly (right) who he fired for lying to him about authorizing the lane closures . Payback: Kelly (left) lied to her boss and said she had not caused the closures, according to Christie . But Christie had downplayed the episode to the Newark Star-Ledger in December, it emerged today. 'I . don’t ever remember even meeting the mayor of Fort Lee and I certainly . don’t remember getting any briefings at any time from campaign staff . that this was someone who was on our radar screen as a potential . endorser,' Christie said at the time. 'That’s . why none of this makes any sense to me and I think in the end what it . will be shown to be is rank speculation from folks who want to play . political games.' The . governor's office's involvement in the petty exercise of political . power during a tense re-election campaign has been big news in the . Garden State since before Christie won a second term as governor. But a raft of electronic messages . subpoenaed from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey by the . New Jersey Assembly's Transportation Committee revealed explosive details of the . plot today. Emails and instant messages between . Christie deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly and two appointees at . the Port Authority revealed a calculated effort to retaliate against . Sokolich by closing off lanes leading to the bridge. 'Time . for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' Kelly wrote weeks before the . event, suggesting the development of a long-term plan for vindictive . political payback. 'Got it,' responded David Wildstein, a Christie ally who served as a Port Authority official until his resignation – unrelated to the bridge mini-scandal, the Christie administration has insisted – in early December. The Christie administration would later claim that forcing three lanes of the bridge into a single toll booth was the result of a mismanaged traffic study supervised by Wildstein. Kelly kicked off the traffic shenanigans with a gleeful email to a Port Authority official on August 13, subpoenaed documents show . Texts between two Christie aides depict a callous attitude toward the traffic chaos they caused, including a swipe at children of voters who supported Christie's gubernatorial candidate, Barbara Buono . Bridget Anne Kelly (L), sent the email that triggered a controversial closing of the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee . But the trove of emails and other . messages, obtained by several news outlets on Wednesday, show that the . governor's appointees reveled in their accomplishment and later . expressed shock when Port Authority officials in New York restored the . Fort Lee traffic. 'The New York side gave Fort Lee back all three lanes this morning. We are appropriately going nuts', Wildstein wrote to Kelly. Mark Sokolich, mayor of Fort Lee, N.J., found his town's traffic backed up because he refused to endorse Christ Christie's re-election bid last year . 'What??' she responded in an email. 'Yes, unreal. Fixed now,' Wildstein responded. After . Mayor Sokolich complained to the Port Authority that the traffic jam . was keeping children from reaching schools on their bus routes, . Wildstein asked in an instant message, 'Is it wrong that I am smiling,' 'No,' came the reply from the recipient. 'I feel badly about the kids ... I guess,' wrote Wildstein. 'They are children of Buono voters,' his unidentified texting partner answered. Barbara Buono was the Democrats' failed gubernatorial candidate who garnered Sokolich's endorsement. She told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that the flap represented 'a clear abuse of power. This is what is being inflicted on the people of New Jersey.' Christie . won the support of several prominent Democratic politicians in his . state, in an effort to demonstrate his ability to build bipartisan . support and reach across the political aisle. That quality, a Republican strategist told MailOnline on Wednesday, 'will be critical if Christie has any chance at winning the presidency as a Republican in 2016.' Not-so-EZ-Pass: When three toll lanes originating in Fort Lee were suddenly forced to merge into one in September, traffic snarled for a week until authorities in New York City reversed the New Jersey officials' order . 'He's already lost the party's right . wing,' the long-time operative said. 'So he needs moderates, and maybe . to create a new kind of Reagan Democrat, if he's going to have any . chance of beating Hillary Clinton.' He . cited Christie's public embrace of President Barack Obama following . Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and his signature this week on legislation . extending DREAM Act-like benefits to some illegal immigrants, among . problems that conservatives will raise. In a sign of an administration suddenly thrown into confusion by the simmering scandal, Christie abruptly canceled his only scheduled public appearance on Wednesday. He was to make a Hurricane Sandy 'housing recovery milestone announcement.'","The September petty payback came after the mayor of Fort Lee, NJ refused to endorse Christie's re-election bid .

Damon Janes, 16, a running back for the Westfield-Brocton . Wolverines, died only days after an illegal helmet-to-helmet tackle . during the team's second game of the season. His father Dean, a 45-year-old logger, knows that nothing is ever going to bring him back but he is determined to make sure no other parent has to go through what he is going through and get to the bottom of how and why his son died. 'Any minute I still expect him to walk through that door over there,' he said. 'Damon was a great kid, and he was going to be an awesome man. That’s what makes this so hard.'

Damon Janes, running back for Brocton-Westfield, died in Women & Children’s Hospital of Buffalo, three days after suffering an apparent brain seizure and losing consciousness in the third quarter of a game at Portville HS. The teen's tragic death on September 13, has thrown football and the dangers surrounding it back into the spotlight. Just yesterday, NFL legend Brett Favre revealed he has forgotten memories of his daughter growing up because of the damage caused to his brain by big hits while playing football. He said he fears he has been damaged . by his time in the game and that for the first time in his life it ‘put a . little fear in me'. ‘I think after 20 years [in the NFL], God only knows the toll’, he said. Dean Janes, a self-confessed . hillbilly, has found himself as an advocate for football safety and . anything that might lessen the horrific fallout of traumatic brain . injury. 'I don’t want anybody to ever go . through what I went through in Portville,' he told the New York Daily . News. 'That was the worst nightmare of my life. 'It doesn’t get worse . than that. Literally, I am holding my own son’s head, praying that . somebody will come and help. 'Nobody should have to go through that. I want to make changes to what is going on out there. I want to look at everything. 'I’m not playing at the local level. We want to go big with this. We’re talking about the safety of our . children, and we are not going stop.' A town shaken: Signs for Damon Janes hang in the window of Studio 64 in Brocton, N.Y. Earlier this month, he was in the office of State Senator Catharine Young sharing thoughts and ideas about ways to . reduce the risk of serious head injury. Young, a member of the Senate . Health Committee, promised to explore research and initiatives in place . in other states that might provide more protection. 'It’s wonderful that (Mr Janes) is so . caring and wants to make a difference,' she said. 'We’re at the . beginning of the process, but I want to do everything I can to help.' But Mr Janes has not been met without opposition. Gary Swetland, the Portville coach, said he does not think Damon died from the helmet-to-helmet tackle. 'It’s . a terrible thing when something this tragic transpires, (but) I keep . hearing about late hits and spears and helmet-to-helmet collision and it . just wasn’t the case. 'I’ve reviewed that film many times, . and it was an ordinary play. Nobody did anything wrong. Nobody did . anything with malicious intent. 'Nobody did anything that was any different from what happened on football fields across America that night.' Just a young boy: Mr Janes was only 16 when his life was cut tragically short . Doing what he loved: Mr Janes (far left) died after a vicious helmet-to-helmet tackle during a game . The coach says he 'absolutely' believes that there must’ve been a pre-existing condition, maybe even a . prior head trauma, that triggered Damon's loss of consciousness and . ultimately his death. Speaking about the coach's comments, Mr Janes said: 'I can’t say anything to the guy. That’s just ignorance. Out of respect to me and his mother, shut your mouth. 'How can you say anything? We have . nothing to prove here. We already know. He has to lay down with this . every night. I don’t. He does. 'I go through everything every day. Is it the ref’s fault for not protecting the kid? Is it the school’s fault? Is it my fault? I push that kid to no end. Is it my fault for pushing him to do what he did?' Damon took what hospital officials would . later describe as a 'helmet-to-helmet' hit during the third quarter of . Westfield-Brocton's Sept. 13 game against Portville, a 32-6 loss. He was . able to get on his feet but lost consciousness on the sidelines. He died three days later at Women & Children's Hospital in Buffalo. In . his obituary, his family wrote that Damon liked fishing, hunting and . just about every kind of sport — soccer, basketball, ice skating, . motocross and snowboarding. 'He put 110 percent into everything he did,' it said. 'His motto was, 'Giving up is simply not an option.' For . some parents, the dangers were obvious even before Damon's death. As . their sadness began to mix with anger, they complained that poor . officiating, with no penalty calls on late hits, made it only a matter . of time before ball carriers like Damon got hurt. The grief surrounding Damon's death . has spread through the close-knit villages of Brocton and Westfield, . tucked amid grape farms about an hour's drive south of Buffalo, where . the once-rival high schools were forced to combine their teams three . seasons ago because of budget cuts. Townspeople . held vigils, lit candles and released balloons. They stayed up nights . making ribbons and cookies as fundraisers for the Janes family. Only 16-years-old: Mr janes had  barely earned his driver's license when he died . Concern about increasingly hard hits . among the 1 million boys who play high school football has brought . renewed attention to concussion management and a national initiative to . teach the 'Heads Up' tackling technique. An . average of 12 high school and college players die annually, according . to a recent study in the American Journal of Sports Medicine. Damon's was at least the fifth high school football death this season, but his was the only team to cancel the season because of it. As iridescent ribbons sparkle from light poles in Brocton, the players say they are moving on without football after making a decision that's drawn both support and criticism — from those who believe Damon would have wanted the season to go on. 'Honestly, none of us can really say what Damon would have wanted,' Villafrank said. 'The only person who could have said that was Damon. And unfortunately, he's not here anymore.'","Damon Janes, 16, died after a helmet-to-helmet hit .

A navy support ship helped seize marijuana worth around £1 million from a boat in the Caribbean in the latest drugs bust involving British personnel. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) naval support ship Wave Knight chased the suspect vessel - the Miss Kameney - on Boxing Day, allowing US Coast Guard law enforcement officers to board it and find quarter of a tonne of marijuana hidden in sacks. Five crew members from the boat were detained and delivered to US authorities in the Dominican Republic while a joint crew of US Coast Guard and RFA personnel took control of the Miss Kameney to transport her illegal cargo to shore. Contraband: Officers went on board the suspect vessel and found nearly a quarter of a tonne of cannabis . Follow: A raft from the RFA Wave Knight, bottom, circled the suspect boat and guided it to US authorities . The seizure was the second large-scale drugs bust for RFA Wave Knight during her year deployed in the region, where she has been working alongside Royal Navy frigate HMS Lancaster and international authorities to disrupt illegal activities in the Caribbean. Praising the crew, defence secretary Philip Hammond said: 'The operation, successfully conducted when most of us were enjoying a Christmas break, is testament to the hard work of our service personnel and the demanding tasks we ask them to carry out. 'I am proud of the work of RFA Wave Knight and the role her crew has played in stopping these drugs reaching the streets.' The Royal Navy's Fleet Commander, Vice Admiral Phil Jones, added: 'This operation is another remarkable success for the ship's company. Bust: The crew of five from the boat were detained on RFA Wave Knight and delivered to US authorities in the Dominican Republic . 'The skill and dedication shown by RFA Wave Knight and HMS Lancaster over the last year has hit the mark and demonstrates the Royal Navy's commitment to the international effort to combat the illicit sea trade in drugs which ultimately affects us all.' Efforts to disrupt illegal activities in the Caribbean are part of the UK's commitment to the region in support of the overseas territories, disaster relief and counter-narcotics operations. RFA Wave Knight was involved in several drug bust operations during 2013, with three tonnes of drug disruptions previously attributed to her name, while HMS Lancaster, which has since returned to Portsmouth, seized more than 1.2 tonnes of marijuana and 400 kilograms of cocaine. Captain Duncan Lamb, commanding officer of RFA Wave Knight, said: 'The entire ship's company - Royal Fleet Auxiliary, Royal Navy and US Law Enforcement Team - as well as HQ and prosecuting staff ashore in mainland USA are delighted with this result. Vessel: The RFA Wave Knight, where the raft was launched from in the Caribbean . 'It has been a truly international team effort and I acknowledge the fact that a number of shore personnel have been recalled off leave to provide the necessary support. This operation is a notable disruption to the regional drug trade.' This latest success was in support of Operation Martillo - a 15-nation joint effort focusing on putting a stop to the illegal movement of drugs from South America into the Caribbean and onwards to the UK. The Royal Fleet Auxiliary is a civilian-manned fleet, owned by the MOD, which supports Royal Navy ships around the world, supplying warships with fuel, ammunition and supplies. A fast fleet tanker, RFA Wave Knight has 77 RFA personnel and two Royal Navy sailors on board, as well as an 11-strong US Law Enforcement Team engaged in counter-narcotics work in the Caribbean.","Naval support ship Wave Knight chased the suspect vessel .

A science teacher who took a pupil to concerts and had sex with her on the way home has been jailed for three-and-a-half years. Married father-of-one Paul Burford, 38, parked up in lay-bys and service areas after driving the 15-year-old to gigs including White Snake and Thin Lizzie guitarist Gary Moore. Over two years, he had sex with her on the street in her uniform, gave her sex toys, and bought them matching rings. Burford was a science teacher at Darlington Branksome School when he kissed first his 14-year-old student in 2010. The liaison continued for two years until the girl went to the police . The science teacher even continued the liaison for a year after being interrogated by Child Protection officers - who desisted when he claimed to be teaching the girl guitar. The girl was 14 when Burford, then a science teacher at Branksome School in Darlington, kissed her in a classroom when they were alone, Teesside Crown Court heard. From 2010, they had sex at his homes in Darlington and Sadberge, both in County Durham, while his wife was with her parents in Carlisle, said prosecutor David Lamb. Once they had sex in the street in West Auckland Road, Darlington, when she was in her school uniform. The girl finally went to police in May 2012 and they arrested Burford who was then assistant head at a school in Devon. He is now separated from his wife and eight-year-old daughter. Teesside Crown Court heard he had sex with the girl on the street in her uniform and gave her sex toys . He confessed the affair to his father on his deathbed, said Amrit Jandoo, defending.

Shocked: Florence Coke, 59, owner of Mama Flo’s in Gorton, Greater Manchester, told how she 'nearly fell over' after opening the £979,092,858 bill from HM Revenue and Customs . Ms Coke, who lives above the café, said it ‘frightened the hell out of me’ when the bill arrived. She added: This is my first time in business and I am naive, I didn’t know where to turn. It really shook me up. This is a little café and takeaway in Gorton - not a Gordon Ramsay restaurant.’ Ms Coke opened Mama Flo’s three years ago after working on the perfume counter at Selfridges and as a newspaper street vendor. She received the astonishing bill from HMRC in March. The letter, signed by an HMRC debt collector, said: ‘If you do not pay or contact us, we can visit your premises in order to arrange for your assets to be sold by public auction.’ Ms Coke immediately called HMRC - who said they would investigate the matter.

Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston won the Heisman Trophy Saturday only nine days after being cleared in a sex assault case. He earned college football's most prestigious individual award despite being left completely off a substantial number of ballots - likely in response to the allegations that were made against him by a female Florida State University student. The charges were dropped December 5, only a handful of days before votes for the Heisman ballot were due. Moving on: Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston hoists the Heisman Trophy after being named college football's best player . 'I cannot explain the feeling that I have inside right now,' Mr Winston said. 'I'm so overwhelmed. It's awesome.' When his name was announced, he popped from his seat and quickly made his way to his mom and dad for hugs and kisses. He smiled and laughed through most of his acceptance speech, but got a little choked up when he talked about his parents. 'So many people instilled in me, trust the process â€“ from there, know the truth,' said Mr Winston. 'When you see your mom and your dad and they've been struggling through this whole process it was nice to see a smile on their faces,' he added. Mr Winston received 668 first-place votes and 2,205 points. He finished 1,501 points ahead of Alabama quarterback AJ McCarron for the seventh-largest margin of victory in Heisman history, despite being left off 115 of the 900 ballots that were returned. Northern Illinois quarterback Jordan Lynch was third, followed by Boston College's Andre Williams, Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel and Auburn's Tre Mason. Mr Manziel - who won the honor last year - was the first freshman to win the Heisman, and was trying to join Ohio State's Archie Griffin as a two-time winner. Instead, Mr Winston made it two freshman winners in the 79-year history of the Heisman. He also became the youngest winner at 23 days short of 20. The 19-year-old also was investigated last month for a year-old sexual assault complaint, but no charges were filed and the case was closed four days before Heisman votes were due. 'People trusted me and saw us play,' Winston said. Mr Winston is the nation's top-rated passer and has led the top-ranked Seminoles to a spot in the BCS championship game against No. 2 Auburn on Jan. 6, his birthday. Famous Jameis: Mr Winston won the award despite being left off 115 ballots . He made college football look easy from his very first game. On Labor Day night, on national television, Winston completed 25 of 27 passes for 356 yards and four touchdowns in a victory at Pittsburgh. It was a brilliant debut that lived up to the offseason hype, when Mr Winston wowed Florida State fans in the Seminoles' spring football game and on the baseball diamond as a hard-throwing reliever and clutch-hitting outfielder. He had already earned the nickname Famous Jameis before he ever played a college football game. He quickly became one of the most beloved Seminoles since Charlie Ward, the 1993 Heisman winner. Mr Winston is the third Seminoles quarterback to win the award, along with Chris Weinke in 2000. He and Florida State were cruising toward an undefeated season when news broke of an unresolved sexual assault complaint against him made to the Tallahassee Police Department last December. The dormant case was handed over to the state attorney's office for a full investigation. A female student at Florida State accused Winston of rape. Mr Winston's attorney said the sex was consensual. Controversial winner: Mr Winston kisses the Heisman Trophy while posing for photographers after the award ceremony . During three weeks of uncertainty, the footballer continued to play sensationally, especially in Florida State's big games against Clemson and Miami, while other contenders stumbled or failed to distinguish themselves. If voters were looking to Mr Manziel or Mr McCarron or Mr Lynch or Mr Williams or even Marcus Mariota of Oregon to give them a good alternative, it didn't happen. Mr Mason made a late surge and ended up in New York because of the lack of serious challengers to Mr Winston. The Heisman Trust mission statement says: 'The Heisman Memorial Trophy annually recognizes the outstanding college football player whose performance best exhibits the pursuit of excellence with integrity.' It's a statement that has put the Heisman in awkward situations before. In 2010, Cam Newton played the season under the cloud of an NCAA investigation. He had also had legal troubles while in college. But like Mr Winston, there was no doubt he was the best player and he won the award. Before last season, Mr Manziel was arrested after being involved in a fight and providing police fake ID. It didn't stop Johnny Football from winning the Heisman. Johnny Rodgers, the 1972 winner from Nebraska, pleaded guilty to a felony after helping to hold up a gas station as a freshman in 1970. He was pardoned earlier this year. Reggie Bush had his 2005 Heisman stripped after the NCAA determined he had violated its rules during that season. But the Heisman trust did not ask Billy Cannon and O.J. Simpson to return their Heismans after serving jail time. No contest: Despite his off-field  issues, Mr Winston was a cut above the rest of the Heisman candidates . The accusations against Mr Winston were serious and documents released by the police with the accuser's allegations were not flattering to him. It probably explains why so many voters left him out of their top three. Last year Mr Manziel appeared on 92 percent of the ballots. Mr Winston appeared on 87 percent this year. There was no doubting his on-the-field credentials. Winston is on pace (190.1) to break Russell Wilson's record for best passer efficiency rating in a season and set FBS freshman records for yards passing (3,820) and touchdown passes (38). Florida State's average margin of victory is 42 points, and the star quarterback has spent most of the Seminoles' fourth quarters resting. The investigation has taken some of the shine off Mr Winston's Heisman coronation, at least for some. But if the question is simply who was college football's best player in 2013, Famous Jameis was the clear answer.","The star player won the award as college football's best player during the 2013 season .

Lauren Astley didn't tell any of her friends she was going to see her ex-boyfriend on the night he brutally murdered her. The 18-year-old went to Nathanial Fujita's home at the request of his mother, her friends believe, because she was worried about her son's behavior since the breakup and had not been able to get through to him. 'Well, he had gone from a kid who . was always on the move, always working out ... to a kid who was . basically at home, lying on the couch, looking miserable,' said . Nathaniel's uncle, George Mattingly. Nathaniel had stopped hanging out with friends. He was drinking a lot and smoking pot daily. After taking him to see a . psychiatrist, his mom thought maybe Lauren could talk some sense into . him. And the teen obliged because she, too, had been worried about him. Malcolm Astley, left, said: 'I know Nate's parents are in the deepest of pain. I talked with his mother. And we just shared our pain together and cried together' Still painful: Lauren Astley's father Malcolm breaks down as he talks about his daughter's tragic and brutal death . Mary Dunne wants her daughter's story to serve as a wakeup call to other teens in violent relationships: 'She walked right in to this. After you have broken up with somebody, you don't go and see that person alone ever!' Shock: Friends of Lauren and Nathanial spoke to 48 Hours about their volatile relationship but how they never thought Fujita would be capable of murder . Her friend Genevieve told CBS 48 Hours: 'She would say like, ""Do you think I should do something? Do you think I should talk to him? Maybe I should try and help him?""' Another friend added: 'Nate's mom came and visited Lauren at . work ... and asked if it would be a good idea if she reached out to him . and talked to him and kind of saw what was going on.' On . July 3, 2011, Lauren did just that and was seen leaving her job at the . mall at 6.45pm while she was on the phone to Fujita. She was never seen . again. Genevieve said: 'We had had plans to hang out all the big group of us that night. No one knew that she was going [to see him].' The 18-year-old's body was found the next day. She had been strangled with a bungee chord and her throat had been slashed. 'She went over to see that he was doing OK. And he killed her. For going over to see if he was OK,' Genevieve said. When . police searched Fujita's home they found bloody clothing, bungee chords . with blood on them and a blood stain that matched Lauren's on the . garage floor. The . then-19-year-old was arrested and charged with murder and, after a . three-week trial earlier this year, he was found guilty and sentenced to . life in prison without parole - something his uncle believes was too . harsh. 'Nathaniel does not deserve to be thrown away. Before his depression he was a young man . with limitless possibilities ... now he is a warehoused person with . a number,' Mattingly said. 'Mental illness is real and nobody asks for . it.' Murder trial: Nathanial Fujita and his ex girlfriend Lauren Astley both went to the same high school . Loved to death: CBS' 48 Hours aired a special on Friday centering around Lauren Astley's murder at the hands of her ex boyfriend Nathanial who could not handle their breakup . Evidence: A pair of bloody sneakers were found in Nathanial Fujita's attic space the day after Lauren's body was found . But Lauren's mother Mary Dunne said: 'Lauren does not have the privilege of re-entering the world, it seems fair that Nathanial should not either.' Speaking to 48 Hours, she said that looking back, there were signs. 'The signs, although I think they were there, were very, very soft. And I construed them as teenage, you know, behavior,' she said. 'But there was more to it than that ... and certainly there are things in retrospect that I would pay attention to, like the amount of time not at my house. 'The amount of time he had her at his house. The fact that Lauren's friends didn't like him at all and the numbers of times she tried to break up with him, that he wouldn't allow it, I think is another red flag.' She wants her daughter's story to serve as a wakeup call to other teens in violent relationships. 'She walked right in to this,' Mary Dunne said. 'After you have broken up with somebody, you don't go and see that person alone ever!' 'Nathanial was calculated and planful and organized and purposeful - . that's what the evidence told me. And I thought, if you are that, then you . must pay. If she doesn't get out, you don't get out.' Victim: Lauren Astley, pictured, was strangled to death and then had her throat slit by her exboyfriend . Shackled: Nathanial Fujita was sentenced to life without parole in a maximum security prison .

Victor Spirescu, 30, was treated to Costa Coffee by the Labour MP when he landed in England on New Year's Day after labour market restrictions were relaxed. He insisted he was here to work and not 'rob your country' when he arrived and is now washing cars outside Aldi in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire.

It was claimed today that he was found guilty of violence in June 2011 and fined for attacking his girlfriend in Bucharest, The Sun reported. The woman - identified as 26-year-old Ana - said that he punched her to the floor in a park and then hit her repeatedly when she was on the ground. She also claimed he threatened to drown her in a lake. She told James Beal and Chris Pollard at The Sun that she split up with Spirescu because he had failed to get a job. Speaking about the attack, she told the newspaper: 'He had never been violent to me before - but in the last couple of months he did not understand that he needed to do something with his life.' The pair began dating in 2009 but she split up with him seven months later.

She eventually agreed to meet up with him again in a park in January 2010 after he had tried to contact her up to 40 times. When they met up, she said he launched his attack. It was reported that Spirescu was fined Â£600 and ordered to pay his ex-girlfriend Â£400 compensation in June 2011 by Bucharest's 3rd District Court following the incident. In addition, he was given a 35 day suspended jail sentence. Ana claims that she has not received a penny of the payout that the court said she should receive. Spirescu's mother told The Sun that he was not a violent person.

'Ambassadors': Sir John Major said One Direction and Susan Boyle are ambassadors for Britain . Boy band One Direction and Britain’s Got Talent singer Susan Boyle now rival the Queen as key brand ambassadors for Britain, Sir John Major said last night. The former Prime Minister said that Harry Styles and his fellow bandmates, along with singer Adele, Premier League football and shows such as Downton Abbey have increased ‘trust’ in the UK around the world. Sir John told a House of Lords committee investigating ‘soft power’ diplomacy that hard power, like the Armed Forces, is now more difficult to use. He argued that Britain needs to cash in on advantages like the English language, the BBC World Service and the Monarchy to make friends around the world. Sir John said the Queen and some pop music figures are ‘subliminal’ reasons why foreigners like Britain. ‘When people refer to the Queen they almost always mean our Queen,’ he said. ‘Wherever you go Bond will be known and so, these days, will be Downton Abbey. ‘All of these reflect a rather favourable impression on Britain. We’ve had over 20 British albums top the charts in countries around the world. It’s not just the established stars like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. ‘You have Adele, One Direction, Susan Boyle. Wherever you go, they’re household names and they have an implication for perception and thus soft power. That is a background that few countries can match in terms of profile and that is important for our diplomacy. Because of these elements of soft power, and because of our history, there is...a greater tendency to trust the British in diplomacy.’ Earlier this month, One Direction’s third album, Midnight Memories, entered the US Billboard 200 at number one making them the only group to have their first three albums top the chart in their opening week. Trust: Former PM said arry Styles and his fellow bandmates, along with singer Adele, Susan Boyle, Premier League football and shows like Downton Abbey have increased 'trust' in the UK around the world . Sir John also warned that Britain will be ‘diminished’ in the eyes of the world if the UK leaves the European Union or Scotland votes for independence. The former Tory Prime Minister said the UK Independence Party and Conservative ‘europhobes’ are damaging Britain abroad. ‘I have not a shred of doubt that we are better off in than out. To lose our biggest market would be folly on a grand scale. Household name: Scottish singer Susan Boyle was also held up as an example of a British ambassador . ‘There are people who trade under the banner of Euroscepticism but they want us out. Whether they’re in Ukip or any other party, that is damaging.’ Sir John, who began the discussions with the IRA that led to the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, warned that leaving the EU would mean border controls between Northern and Southern Ireland that would ‘unsettle’ the local population and unpick the stability of the peace process. ‘Ireland would have really legitimate cause to worry.’ Sir John said that when he travels the world the prospect of Scotland quitting the UK and the UK leaving the EU were raised with him frequently. ‘If Scotland were to vote for independence I think it would be bad for Scotland. It certainly would be bad for the United Kingdom.’ He said foreign leaders are ‘baffled’ about why Scotland would leave. ‘They would perceive a country that was damaged and diminished if a chunk of it voluntarily chose to leave the United Kingdom.’ Sir John also warned that Alex Salmond is wrong to say Scotland could continue as a member of the EU. The belief that because they are in the European Union as part of the United Kingdom, they would automatically be when they left is fallacy. They would not. ‘They would have to apply to rejoin at a time when the European Union is in no hurry about new members. I’m sure they would get in but it would take them 10 years and who knows what conditions of entry they would get.’","Also included Adele, Premier League football and TV show Downton Abbey .

Top New York divorce lawyer Norman Sheresky took revenge on his former legal partners by having a video played at his funeral where they praised him for his experience, skill and mentorship. The New York Post reports Sheresky, who died from pneumonia on October 19 at 85 years old, had said his dying wish was to ban David Aronson and Allan Mayefsky from his funeral in New York. Top New York City divorce attorney Norman Sheresky, who died on October 19 aged 85, was at war with his former legal partners. A video was played at his funeral from his 80th birthday party where his 'enemies' praised him . The law partners split acrimoniously in 2010 when Sheresky quit the firm aged 82 believing his partners backed out on a deal to look after him financially in retirement. Aronson and Mayesfsky claimed Sheresky had agreed to a buy-out plan three years earlier. Between them, the trio's high-profile divorce clients have included Christine Brinkley and Peter Cook, Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise, and the former wives of actors James Gandolfini, Dustin Hoffmann, and Robert Duvall. Sheresky's final act was to ask his wife to play a video presentation called 'Norman’s Reflections on his 80th Birthday' that was recorded with Aronson and Mayefsky before their own professional union dramatically fell apart. Sheresky, Aronson, and Mayefsky represented architect Peter Cook (left) after former model Christine Brinkley (right) filed for divorce in 2008 after 10 years of marriage. Cook was revealed to have had  an affair with his 18-year-old assistant . Sheresky was prominent in New York divorce law and played a major part in establishing the concept of equitable distribution of assets between divorcing couples. The messy fall out between Sheresky, Aronson, and Mayefsky became its own headline act in New York's legal world. In 2010, Sheresky filed a $26 million lawsuit in the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, alleging breach of contract and fraud. Attorney David Aronson, pictured left, and partner Allan Mayefsky, right, were once considered part of a 'family' with former partner Norman Sheresky. A dramatic 2010 split between the powerful divorce lawyers rocked the New York City legal world in a bitter dispute from which Sheresky never recovered . 'I see now that for Norman it was about money, and I find that to be unfortunate,' Mayefsky told the New York Times at the time of the suit. In 1972, Sheresky co-authored a book called 'Uncoupling: The Art of Coming Apart' and told the Times he 'treated these people like they were my sons, and they turned on me.' 'It’s like a lot of relationships,' he added. 'We were in love, and somehow they decided they’re not in love anymore.' Aronson and Mayefsky went on to represent actress Katie Holmes in her divorce from Hollywood heavyweight Tom Cruise. Aronson Mayefsky & Sloan, LLP, is now considered one of the best law firms specializing in divorce in New York City . In the birthday video played at his funeral, Sheresky's wife asks Aronson: 'What do you think the secret is of you three staying together all these years?' 'We love each other,' Aronson replied. 'It goes beyond our professional relationship - the way relatives would love each other.' Sheresky's law suit against Aronson and Mayefsky hit the rocks in September, 2011, when a Manhattan judge threw out four of five of his claims. The judge allowed one claim for breach of fiduciary duty for not paying Sheresky a bonus in 2009.

Since undergoing lap-band surgery in February, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has been 'losing weight steadily.' The plain-speaking governor, who's known for his generous physique, has been given the all-clear by his doctor, who said in medical report that Christie is 'fit to serve.' Christie, 51, has apparently adopted a more healthy lifestyle since the surgery and continues to lose weight, according to his doctor. Shrinking: Governor Chris Christie in May (left) and looking more slender earlier this month (right) The two-page report from Christie's cardiologist, Dr Rachana Kulkarni, notes that the governor has been 'very compliant' with follow-up treatments and has been eating healthily and exercising four times a week. While the report failed to mention Christie's starting weight and current weight, the Republican has appeared noticably slimmer in recent days. He told CBS Sunday Morning that he is more than halfway to his goal weight. Christie's Democrat opponent Barbara Buono challenged him to release his medical records in a debate three weeks ago. Fit to run: In a debate three weeks ago, Christie refused to rule out a presidential run in 2016 . 'Governor Christie has normal blood work, normal cardiovascular test results, and good functional capacity,' the report stated. 'He has no medical limitations and is fit to serve as the Governor of the state of New Jersey.'

A new weight loss invention will let dieters eat anything they want - by sucking food and drink straight out of their stomachs. The rather gruesome-sounding system stops the body from digesting a third of each meal by pumping it out of the stomach via a tube inserted in the abdomen. So far it has been trialled on 24 obese patients and now the company Aspire Bariatrics has applied for a patent on the unusual device in partnership with inventor Dean Kamen. Mr Kamen is best known for inventing the Segway, the two-wheeled self-balancing personal transport. However, critics have been horrified by the system, which they say doesn't tackle the causes of obesity. Scroll down for video . Brighter tomorrow: The new invention will suck food straight out of the user's belly before the body can fully digest it . Not for every meal: One user complained the pump had issues 'clogging' with some foods . This graphic shows how the AspireAssist reduced excess weight in clinical trial patients over a year . The latest product is being touted as an . alternative to other procedures such as gastric bypass surgery, which discourages people from overeating by . dividing the stomach into two pouches. A tube, called the A-Tube, is placed . in the stomach. The thin silicone rubber tube then connects the inside . of the stomach to a poker-chip-sized Skin-Port outside the abdomen. The . port has a valve the user can open and close to control the flow of the . stomach's contents. The patient then empties a portion of . their stomach contents about 20 minutes after each main meal through this tube by connecting a . small, handheld device to the port. The emptying process itself is called aspiration and takes five to 10minutes to complete. The device would be used in combination with counseling and group support meetings to encourage healthier food choices. Patients aspire after every main meal and then use it less often as they learn to eat more healthily. If problems are encountered the tube can be removed in a 15minute outpatient procedure. According to a statement from the . company: 'The AspireAssist Aspiration Therapy System works by reducing . the calories absorbed by the body. After eating, food travels to the . stomach immediately, where it is temporarily stored and the digestion . process begins. 'Over the first hour after a meal, the . stomach begins breaking down the food, and then passes the food on to . the intestines, where calories are absorbed. 'The AspireAssist allows patients to . remove about 30 per cent of the food from the stomach before the . calories are absorbed into the body, causing weight loss.' However expert Tam Fry, a trustee of the National Obesity Forum, said he was dismayed by the new system. 'I haven't seen anything as horrific as this before,' he said. 'You are supposed to eat and then digest, not pump your food out. 'It seems they are trying to come up with a quick-fix for lazy people. It is far better to eat properly and in the correct amounts. 'I understand that those who are obese need help, but we should be focusing on counseling and especially education. 'The key is to teach children early about nutrition and a healthy diet.' The company claimed that patients lost an average of 49 per cent of their excess weight, equivalent to 45lbs, during the first year of using the system in a U.S clinical trial. However, the pump reportedly struggles when attempting to break up large foods. One patient even reported 'clogging' and had to avoid cauliflower, broccoli, Chinese food, stir fry, snow . peas, pretzels, chips and steak. There have also been concerns that the system has a number of similarities to bulimia, where people make themselves sick after eating. However, the company said AspireAssist does not cause eating disorders and there is little overlap between people with obesity and the psychological disorder. It added patients would be screened for the condition before being approved. According to the patent, the process of removing ingested food could potentially be improved by alternating . the infusion of liquid into the stomach with the removal of material . from the stomach. The company is also considering capturing stomach acid and returning it to the stomach to help break down food further, as well as adding nutritional supplements or medicines to the infused liquid.

JK Rowling has revealed the heartbreaking moment she almost snatched a baby from her cot in a ‘cold and frightening’ state-run so-called orphanage in Eastern Europe. The Harry Potter author says her maternal instincts drove her to consider the unthinkable during a visit to the institution, which she claimed was more like a prison than a home. She says: ‘I’m an emotional person. I struggle with that a lot in this kind of situation. There was one little baby, a girl, and I was standing at this cot and I just thought, “I will take her”. Emotional: JK Rowling makes heart-rending confession in rare interview about her children's charity Lumos . ‘It was irrational but that’s your human response. There was no earthly way I could take this baby home but that is your most powerful reaction. You think as a mother, “I will save this baby, this one baby”.’ Rowling recalls the encounter in an emotional interview with Geordie Greig, Editor of The Mail on Sunday, in which she also discusses the work of  her children’s charity Lumos, named after a spell in the Harry Potter novels. The mother of three also reveals that, despite being worth £560 million, she still worries about money - the  legacy of once being a single mother living on benefits. Rowling’s charity has rescued thousands of children from filthy and inadequate care homes in some of Europe’s poorest countries. They include orphans as well as those whose parents are no longer able to feed them properly. Action: Rowling has set up a children’s charity, Lumos, to help orphans in Europe . The writer, who is planning to expand the work of the charity to Britain, has donated millions of pounds of her own money and made a series of ‘secret’ visits both to the orphanage she is trying to close and the replacement homes she has helped to build. In the interview, published in today’s Event magazine, she also discusses the emotional toil her encounters have had on her and how she hopes to help a million children in Moldova, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Romania. She says: ‘The one incident that absolutely killed me was a little girl with physical disabilities who had been put into the institution and used to ask for her mother. The nurse would go outside and ring the girl and pretend to be her mother. Utterly heartbreaking.’ And Rowling reveals how  she came up with the charity’s unusual name – the wand-lighting charm in Harry Potter. She says: ‘Harry had been left in a very hostile environment, so there are clear parallels. He is a boy removed from his family by bereavement.’ The author speaks candidly about how her ‘emotional  anxiety’ about money is deeply rooted in her past. ‘I still worry about money. Funnily enough it bears no relation to what is in your bank account, it is purely emotional,’ she says. ‘I was as poor as it’s possible to be in this country. ‘I was a single parent. The key phrase is “in this country” because we have a welfare state. I remember not eating so my daughter would eat... nights when there was literally no money, when I had one Rich Tea biscuit and that was dinner.’ She adds: ‘I was terrified of  pressing the wrong button and losing everything, and having to look my daughter in the face and say, “We had a house and now through a stupid error...” I don’t know what I thought I was going to do but my terror was making a ridiculous mistake and it all disappearing.’ Rowling - whose seven Harry Potter books have sold more than 450 million copies between them - is now enjoying success with her two adult fiction novels, The Casual Vacancy and The Cuckoo’s Calling. She was accused of being ‘anti-middle-class’ after her first novel looked at tensions between a sink council estate and the local town. But she explains: ‘I’m not anti-middle-class in the slightest. Look at me! I am very pro people putting time and money and effort into trying to improve the world. ‘And the middle classes do that very, very well. I would be the last person to deny that, being middle-class myself.’ The Harry Potter author has welcomed the ‘huge’ improvement in the press’s behaviour. JK Rowling, who told the Leveson Inquiry in 2011 that her family’s privacy had been invaded on dozens of occasions, said she no longer felt that she was being ‘watched or followed’. And she claimed it was unlikely that anyone today would be exposed to the ‘tsunami’ of media attention she endured at the height of her Harry Potter fame. ‘In 1997 it was like the Wild West,’ she says in the interview with today’s Event magazine. ‘If Harry Potter happened now, I’d have a different experience. I have felt a change and it’s been really welcome. ‘It has largely disappeared, those mysterious phone calls trying to get information out of you. It went on routinely and has fallen away, and thank God for that.’ She adds: ‘Certain things aren’t up for grabs.’","She reveals how she nearly snatched a baby from her cot at an orphanage .

A 12-year-old Canadian boy has pleaded guilty to three charges of hacking government websites under the affiliation of 'hacktavist' initiative Anonymous. A court heard on Thursday how the fifth grader - from the Montreal suburb of Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce - wreaked computer havoc during the Quebec student uprising in 2012, with some sites out of service for two days. He has pleaded guilty to three charges related to hacking websites that included those of Montreal police, the Quebec Institute of Public Health, the Chilean government and some non-public sites. The attacks took some of the sites offline for up to two days, at what police estimated as a cost of $60,000 in damages. Guilty: A 12-year-old boy has admitted to three serious charges of government hacking as part of the 'hacktavist' group Anonymous, who would disguise themselves in public using masks the same as this one . A more detailed report will be handed over next month when the boy is sentenced, according to the Toronto Sun. Even though most of the attacks took place during the Quebec student protests in 2012 - sparked by an outrage at proposed tuition hikes that eventually escalated into a riot - the boyâ€™s lawyers maintained he was not politically motivated. Instead they said he traded information obtained from website databases for video games. 'He saw it as a challenge, he was only 12 years old,' said the young hackerâ€™s lawyer. 'There was no political purpose.' According to Montreal police, the boy also taught others how to hack. While others have been arrested for the attacks, it was the boy who 'opened the door to enable them', the court was told. Court documents said she showed a keen interest with computers from the age of 9. The Quebec student uprising in 2012 lasted months and was sparked by a planned rise in tuition fees. They saw the rise of hacker group Anonymous. The online attacks of a 12-year-old boy in court this year happened at the time of the protests last year . Major march: Thousands of demonstrators hit the streets of Montreal in 2012 in a rally marking 100 days of student protests . He appeared in youth court on Thursday dressed in his school uniform and accompanied by his father. The court was told that the targeted sites suffered three types of attack, including a Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack, where aggressors bombard a target with requests designed to consume so much of its resources that it becomes unusable. The Toronto Sun says that the court heard testimony from somebody who said the boy hard warned others about the dangers of hacking. 'It's easy to hack but do not go there too much, they will track you down,' the testimony said. The Quebec student uprisings last until fall 2012. Old school: Michael Calce, known by his screen name as Mafia Boy, remains one of the biggest cases in computer hacking. He was caught in 2000 and went on to plead guilty to 56 charges, causing an estimated $1.7 million in damages. He was 15 at the time but is pictured here during a recent interview with Carson Daly . One occasion was compared with Occupy Wall Street, with Molotov cocktails being thrown and police using rubber bullets and tear gas. There were serious injuries recorded for both police and protestors. In 2000, a 15-year-old boy also from Montreal - known by his screen name 'Mafiaboy' but real name Michael Calce - pleaded guilty to 56 counts of hacking and attacking sites, causing an estimated $1.7 million damage. He was sentenced to eight months in 'open custody' at a rehabilitation home for youths and went on to write a book and field many offers for jobs in cyber security.","The boy, from Montreal, Canada, gained access to multiple sites, including that of the Chilean government, and 'bombarded them with requests to consume so much of its resources that they become unusable', court was told .

Dennis Rodman led an auditorium of North Koreans in singing 'Happy Birthday' to their leader on Wednesday, a day after the former U.S. basketball star sparked controversy by appearing to suggest a Korean-American was to blame for his captivity in North Korea. Rodman, 52, brought a team of fellow former National Basketball Association stars to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to mark the birthday of leader Kim Jong Un with an exhibition game. The birthday is believed to have been on Wednesday though that has not been confirmed. Bizarre: Dennis Rodman sings Happy Birthday to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, seated above in the stands, before an exhibition basketball game in Pyongyang . Joy: North Koreans cheer at the start of an exhibition basketball game with U.S. and North Korean players . 'It started out as surreal, then people . joined in and it sort of faded a bit, but it seemed pretty heartfelt . from Rodman's side,' said Simon Cockerell, a tour guide who watched the . game in Pyongyang, said of Rodman's birthday singing. 'It was unexpected, and probably unplanned,' he said. 'Kim Jong Un appeared to smile, but he didn't appear to expect it.' It was a scene bizarrely reminiscent of when film star Marilyn Monroe sang 'Happy Birthday Mr President' to President John F Kennedy on his 45th birthday at Madison Square Garden in New York in 1962. Cockerell, whose company Koryo Tours took a group of tourists to the game, said the audience had stood and cheered Kim for up to six minutes when he appeared with his wife. 'Dennis Rodman gave a charmingly shambolic speech where he thanked Kim Jong Un and his wife for showing up, along with the other players for being brave enough to come with him and join in his ""engagement effort"".' This was Rodman's fourth trip to Pyongyang. On previous visits, he spent time dining as a guest of Kim, with whom he says he has a genuine friendship, though he did not meet Kim on his third trip. Play ball: Dennis Rodman, centre, pauses with the ball during the basketball game . The U.S. and North Korean teams  raise their hands to the crowd after the game . The visit come weeks after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who until then was one of the most powerful figures in the regime. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has described events in North Korea as a 'reign of terror'. Rodman has said he would not interfere in North Korea's politics but he raised an outcry at home when, in a television interview on Tuesday, he appeared to suggest that Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae was to blame for his captivity. During an expletive-ridden interview with CNN about his trip, Rodman seemed to say Bae, held in North Korea since November 2012 and convicted in May on charges of crimes against the state, was responsible for his situation. In a TV interview Rodman appeared to suggest that Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae was to blame for his captivity . 'If you understand what Kenneth Bae did... Do you understand what he did in this country? Why is he held captive in this country?' Rodman said, declining to respond to questions to clarify what he meant. Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said her family was 'outraged' by his comments and he could 'do a lot of good' by using his access to the North Korea leader to advocate on Bae's behalf, rather than 'hurl outrageous accusations' at her brother. 'He is playing games with my brother's life,' Chung said in a statement. 'There is no diplomacy, only games, and at my brother's expense.'

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and former NBA star Dennis Rodman in February 2013 . 'He is clearly uninformed about Kenneth's case, and he is certainly not in any position to pass judgment,' Chung said, adding that Bae never had hostile intentions against the state. Asked about Rodman's comments, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters, 'I'm not going to dignify that outburst with a response', emphasizing that the trip was private travel that was not endorsed by the U.S. government. 'I'm simply going to say that we remain gravely concerned about Kenneth Bae's health, and continue to urge DPRK authorities to grant his amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds,' Carney said. Parallel: Actress Marilyn Monrow sings 'Happy Birthday, Mr President' to JFK in 1962 . Bae, 45, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour for state subversion in North Korea. He was detained in 2012 as he led a tour group through the northern region of the country. The country's Supreme Court said he used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government. Following a visit to her son in October, Bae's mother, Myunghee Bae, said her son was 'alone and ailing'. A devout Christian, Bae has acknowledged he conducted religious services in North Korea, which has long been hostile to Westerners advocating religious causes. U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, the leading Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized Rodman and the other Americans for what he called an 'ill-advised' trip. 'As North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un continues to starve and oppress his citizens, it is unthinkable that a few fading celebrities would use such an opportunity to reward his brutal regime,' he said. Rodman has faced both ridicule and harsh criticism for his trips to North Korea, which some U.S. politicians and activists view as serving only as fodder for North Korean propaganda. But he defended his visit, saying it would help 'open the door' and was a 'great idea for the world'. 'It's amazing how we thrive on negativity. Does anyone know this guy's only 31 years old?' he said of Kim, whom he calls his friend. 'Dennis, he could be 31, he could be 51,' said CNN interviewer Chris Cuomo. 'He's just killed his uncle.

An Oklahoma woman says she's a firm believer in God after meeting him during the nine minutes she died in 2009. Crystal McVea is a 36-year-old married school teacher and mother of four who didn't quite believe in God for most of her life. At the age of three, McVea started to be sexually abused by her drug and alcohol-addicted step father and that abuse continued by him and others until the age of 12. Believer: After accidentally overdosing on drugs in a hospital while being treated for pancreatitis, Crystal McVea says she woke up in heaven where she met God . Those experiences made her second guess from a young age whether or not God existed, and if he did, whether he loved her. 'I saw a lot of things that children shouldn't see,' she told WFAA. 'I always believed that God had abandoned me, that he didn't save me, that he didn't love me and I questioned if he was real.' Then, when she was a teenager, she had an abortion. A choice she believed cemented her position as a sinner. 'After that abortion I thought, ""I've done it now - if he was real, he could never love me now,""' she told The Blaze. Skeptic: McVea says abuse when she was a child led her to doubt God's existence, but that changed the moment she died . In December 2009, McVea was taken to the hospital to be treated for pancreatitis when she was accidentally overdosed on pain medication. The last thing McVea remembers is being given the drugs and falling asleep. For the next nine minutes, doctors struggled to revive her as her heart stopped beating. McVea says she was in a more peaceful place. After closing her eyes in the hospital, the next thing she remembers is waking up in heaven. 'I was standing in the most gorgeous light and instantly I recognized where I was. I knew who I was, I knew where I was...' she recalls. In heaven, time seemed to stand still. She recalls being in the presence of two angels - though they didn't look like anyone she had ever met on earth. At the pearly gates: McVea says at one point during her period in Heaven, God presented himself to her but not in his human form. She says they communicated non-verbally . At one point, God presented himself to her, but not in human form. Still she knew who he was and says that she could feel his presence with much more than the five senses she had on earth. They didn't even need to communicate with words. One of the things she remembers most about the experience was God conjuring up the image of a young girl, laughing and playing. Looking back on the experience, she believes that girl was a version of herself before the sexual abuse made her lose faith. Being in the presence of God and seeing that innocent version of herself, the weight was lifted from her dark past. 'I just remember I felt free from all the lies I had lived and the untruth that God didn't love me,' she told the New York Daily News. Spreading the word: A few years after her near-death experience, McVea has published a book about her encounter with God in the afterlife . She felt so overcome with happiness that when he asked her if she wanted to go back to her husband and four children, she opted to stay in heaven. She says God assured her that they would be fine without her. It was only when she heard her mother calling out from her hospital bedside that she changed her mind. 'I just felt such pity (for my mom) and I turned around to find her voice - and (God) said, ""Tell them what you can remember""' she recalled. And just like that, she was back in her hospital room - miraculously alive again. McVea isn't the first to claim she communicated with God in the afterlife. Neuroscientist Dean Mobb explained in Scientific American that these experiences have a biological answer in the side effects of medicinal and recreational drugs. In McVea's case, those would be the drugs she accidentally overdosed on while being treated for pancreatitus. But for McVea, the experience was real and she hasn't let the non-believers keep her from sharing her story. A few years ago she realized that it was her duty to share her story with the world, and so authored a book about her 9 minutes in heaven titled 'Waking up in Heaven' which was published this past June. She hopes the book will help others realize that 'no matter how broken and beaten' they are, that 'there is nothing that you can do in your life that will ever separate his love from you'.","Crystal McVea, 36, died for nine minutes after doctors overdosed her on pain medication in the hospital .

A well-intentioned honest mistake could cost Major Jason Brezler his position as a Marine reservist. Maj Brezler found himself in hot water last summer when he responded to an email from  troops in Helmand Province, Afghanistan who were inquiring about a local police chief named Sarwar Jan. Jan was being given access to the base in Delhi as part of the U.S. military's exit strategy from the country. Maj Jason Brezler, pictured in the middle on the right, will face a Marine hearing as early as next month for accidentally emailing classified information via his personal email account . Maj Brezler had prior knowledge of Jan, and immediately replied to warn his fellow marines about the dangerous police chief with ties to the Taliban. He also reported that Jan was a noted child abuser and there were allegations he sexually abused minors on U.S. bases in the past. Immediately after sending the email, Maj Brezler realized he had made a mistake and shouldn't have sent the message from his personal Yahoo email account. He reported himself to the Marines and is now facing judgement. He could face a Board of Inquiry hearing as early as next month where he will need to argue his case for remaining a Marine. But punishment for the email is causing an uproar among politicians and high-ranking military leaders since his email was a harbinger for a deadly attack carried out at the forward operating base in Delhi by one of Jan's boy assistants. The assistant, who is believed to be one of Jan's sexual-abuse victims, opened fire in a base gym on August 10, 2012 and killed three American soldiers: Staff Sergeant Scott Dickinson, Corporal Richard Rivera and Lance Corporal George Buckley, Jr. Warning: Shortly after sending a warning email to soldiers in Helmand Province about Sarwar Jar, one of Sanwar Jar's assistants shot and killed three soldiers on the base. Above, the body of victim Staff Sgt Scott Dickinson is brought back to the U.S. Maj Brezler lives in New York and in addition to being a Marine reservist, is a New York City fireman. Kevin Carroll, Maj Brezler's lawyer who is working pro bono, said it was 'inconceivable that a combat Marine and New York City fireman, such as Jason Brezler, would have lied or stayed silent when marines in Afghanistan sought his advice on an emergency force protection issue.' New York Senator Kristen Gillibrand and Representative Peter King have both written letters backing their fellow New Yorker. Rep King called it 'unfair' that Maj Brezler would be punished for his 'good-faith effort to warn his fellow Marines. 'The Marines and the (New York City) Fire Department need more good men such as Maj Brezler, not less,' Rep King wrote. Other military leaders have come to Maj Brezler's defense, describing him as a model Marine. Bing West, a former assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs and who has written several non-fiction books about the military, said Major Brezler 'has brass balls. We'd like to believe that's the definition of a marine, but I've seen Brezler in action'. He also described the time he saw Brezler 'brace a punk police chief and drag away from a young teen who was being used as a sex slave'. U.S. military in the area were able to convince the provincial governor to depose that police chief. Doing the right thing: Several politicians and high-ranking military officials have written to defend Maj Brezler's actions. Above, another picture of the casks of the three Marine victims from the shooting at FOB Delhi being brought back to the U.S. Maj Gen Larry Nicholson, the commanding general of the 1st Marine Division and Brig Gen Richard Simcock have also spoke up for Maj Brezler. 'Jason is a selfless, fearless and dedicated Marine officer. He accomplished much, for so many, with little regard for himself. I urge board members to take into consideration these aspects of his character and prior service in deliberations,' Maj Gen Nicholson wrote. Brig Gen Simcock called Maj Brezler a 'principled man of integrity who is not swayed by peer pressure or personal gain'. The Marine Corps Times also published an editorial in favor of leniency for Maj Brezler. 'Brezler's treatment sends the message that in the Marine Corps there's no room for honest mistakes. That's a dangerous precedent to set in any line of work, but most assuredly in the military where even four-star generals will acknowledged that an understanding commander showed them some leniency along the way.' A spokesman for the Marine Corps Forces Reserve declined to comment on Maj Brezler's impending hearing.","Major Jason Brezler faces a disciplinary hearing as early as next month for sending an email from his personal account containing classified information .

'It may help your body to detox and cleanse, along with boosting the metabolism.'

'Green . tea may increase metabolism, while ginger is warming and stimulates . circulation. Psyllium husks are a source of soluble dietary fibre, and . both aloe vera and fennel are soothing and calming to the digestive . tract. 'Fenugreek may . help to maintain healthy blood sugar levels.

'If you're taking any medications or other . supplements, make sure to take them at least an hour away from this, as . psyllium husks may slow the absorption of these.' Madeleine . Shaw, a nutritionist who works with the likes of Millie Mackintosh, . added: 'I haven't tried it so I am not sure if it works, however I don't . think any pill can perform miracles if you are still eating rubbish . alongside.

Laura Williams from www.naturesremedies.uk.com said: 'There are some effective ingredients in this but I’m not sure they will do what they say on the tin. Green tea will help support the immune system because it’s high in antioxidants – you need about 3-5 cups per day to reap the benefits. 'The B vitamins can be useful for supporting the nervous system, while cayenne pepper has been shown to create a small hike in metabolic rate – but no more than you’d get from lifting a few weights. 'Psyllium husks are simply a source of soluble dietary fibre that help to prevent constipation. 'Do the ingredients match the claims? It’s a long shot. We already have perfectly good detoxification organs (liver, kidneys etc) while I’m really not sure how a supplement is going to tone you. 'Will this give you the same results as a sound diet and regular exercise regime? If only.'","MeckTone is a 3-in-1 detoxifier, cleanser and metabolism booster .

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Rachel Quigley . PUBLISHED: . 22:48 EST, 26 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 22:48 EST, 26 October 2013 . The adoptive father of an Ethiopian teen has blamed his wife for the girl's hypothermia and starvation death in order to get a lighter sentence, it emerged today. Larry Williams and his wife Carri were found guilty of manslaughter last month after their adopted daughter Hana was found frozen and starved to death outside their Washington home in May 2011 when the temperature was just 40F. The couple will be sentenced next week for her death and the abuse of their son Immanuel, who was also adopted from Ethiopia. On Friday Larry Williams said through his attorney that his wife should spend decades in jail because 'she was the primary actor' in all of the treatment of Hana and Immanuel. Waiting sentencing: On Friday, Larry Williams said through his lawyer that his wife was the 'primary actor' in the abuse of their adopted children . Outside court: Williams is asking for a five-year sentence after being convicted of the manslaughter of his adopted daughter - which means he could be out in three years . Hana Williams was found frozen and starved to death in the yard of her adoptive parents' Washington home in 2011. They were given maximum sentences today for causing her death . The lawyer filed a motion in court to get him out of jail quickly. He faces 14 to 19 years in prison for his part in the gruesome death of Hana, who died in the backyard of the . couple's home, where she was forced to stay as part of a strict system . of child-rearing outlined in a Christian parenting book. An autopsy showed that Hana died of hypothermia that was aggravated by chronic gastritis and malnutrition. Her bone-thin body was covered in . bruises, including a lump on her shaved head, and red bloody markings on her . hips, elbows and face. Williams' attorney is asking a judge for a short five-year sentence, KIROTV reports, arguing that he was away working at Boeing while Carri, a stay-at-home mom, beat the adopted pair and fed them frozen food. Carri Williams said her husband was aware of everything that went on in the home. She faces up to 37 years in prison. During their trial, both Immanuel and one of the Williams' biological children testified against the couple. Manslaughter: Larry (left) and Carri Williams react in a Washington cour as a jury read their guilty verdict. The couple were guilty of manslaughter in the death of their 13-year-old Ethiopian adopted daughter . Dragged away: Carri Williams is taken into custody last month after a jury deemed her guilty of the 2011 death of her daughter. She was also found guilty of homicide by abuse . The jury was unable to decide if Larry Williams was guilty of homicide by abuse. In the end, only Carri Williams was convicted on that charge. Both Larry and Carri were also convicted of first degree assault on Hana's adopted brother Immanuel. Tests on Hana's teeth and bones gave varying . estimates and experts were unable to agree on her age. Her age was significant because the homicide by abuse charge applies only if the victim was younger than 16, though experts were unable to say for sure if she was or was not. She was adopted in 2008. Guilty: Larry Williams listens in Skagit County court days before a jury found him and wife Carri guilty of neglecting and ultimately killing their adopted Ethiopian daughter Hana . Wicked: Carri Williams cries during her trial. She was convicted of homicide by abuse in addition to manslaughter . Remorseful? Williams is pictured here testifying for his defense in August. The Washington man and his wife were both found guilty of first degree manslaughter and both face a possible life sentence . A foster mother testified during the trial that the couple's other adopted son Immanuel . was rail-thin and covered in scratches when she took him in. The . testimony from Sheila Jackson came on day 18 of the Williams murder trial. The . couple left their 13-year-old Hana, to . starve and die in the cold after brutally punishing her and . her step-brother, Immanuel. Jackson, . who is deaf, told the jury in a Mount Vernon courtroom that when the . Williamses’ son Immanuel, who was also adopted from Ethiopia, came to . live with her, she could barely keep up with his demands for food. 'He ate fast. He ate a lot. He ate more than I expected,' she told on the stand, the station KIRO-TV reported . Following the couple's arrest, Child Protective Services removed Immanuel and seven other children from their home. Sheila Jackson said the boy was terrified to talk about his adoptive parents. Wasting away: Hana, pictured left sometime after her arrival in the U.S., lost nearly 30lbs between 2009 and 2011, and had her head shaven when she was found dead in the backyard . Angelic: Hana, pictured second left, seen as a young girl with her family back in Ethiopia . According to the foster mother, the child was so emaciated that his ribs were showing through his skin covered in markings from past beatings. Immanuel, now 12 years old, testified during the trial that the Williamses beat him and Hana with belts and switches. Lingering fear: Foster mother Sheila Jackson, who took in Immanuel after the Williamses' arrest, said the boy was very thin, always hungry and  terrified to talk about his adoptive parents . The parents kept the family isolated from non-relatives, home-schooled the children and followed strict religious principles described in the Christian parenting book titled ‘To Train Up a Child,’ investigators said. As punishment for bad behavior, the teen told the court that he and his step-sister were fed frozen meals, hosed down and forced to sleep in closets, where they would listen to recordings of the Bible on tape and Christian music. The defense has attempted to paint Immanuel as a disobedient boy with an attitude problem. The lawyers for the couple said Immanuel hit and bit Jackson’s daughter so badly that her teacher ended up calling CPS after the child came to school with bruises. Sheila Jackson said that Immanuel has been getting counseling and his behavior has been improving. In 2008, Immanuel was seven-years-old when the American couple, both devout Christians, adopted him and Hana from Ethiopia. Larry worked at Boeing while his wife was a stay-at-home mom home-schooling the two adopted kids and their seven biological children. In his testimony, the 12-year-old told the court that his adopted parents would beat him with a stick until blood was running down his face. Other disciplinary measures included having Immanuel hosed down in the yard for bed-wetting and keeping him and Hana outside in the cold. Tough disciplinarians: Hana and her adoptive brother were allegedly spanked, hit with sticks, hosed down and forced to eat frozen food . Cruel death: Hana's emaciated body covered in bruises was found face down in the mud in the backyard of the family's home in Sedro-Woolley, Washington . Cause of death: An autopsy showed that the 13-year-old died from hypothermia exacerbated by malnutrition and gastritis . 'I would suffer with the pain until it eventually went away,' he said in sign language July 29. Larry’s attorney, Rachel Forde, characterized the Ethiopian boy as a troublemaker who lied to his adoptive parents and refused to do lessons assigned by his mother. While the couple's biological children, five of whom had testified during the trial, were generally treated better, the strict rules in the Williams household applied to them as well. According to Joseph Williams, however, he and his siblings were given the authority to punish and even spank their adopted brother and sister, KIRO-TV reported. Joseph was called to the stand to describe the night of May 12, 2011, when his 13-year-old adopted sister died. Joseph Williams told the court that after Hana died while sitting in the yard in 40-degree weather, his mother instructed him to bring the girl's body inside, where she performed CPR and called 911. The mother of nine said on the call that her daughter Hana 'has killed herself.' Blaming the victim: On a 911 call after Hana's death, Carri Williams (left) told the dispatcher that her 'rebellious' adopted daughter had killed herself by throwing herself down to the ground and refusing to come indoors . When asked by the 911 dispatcher why she believed her daughter had taken her own life, Williams said that the girl was not breathing and lying face down in the mud after refusing to come indoors, according to the Seattle Times. Calling Hana 'rebellious,' the mother said that she had seen the 13-year-old throwing herself to the ground and staggering about the yard after taking her clothes off. A local weather station reported that the temperature that night was 42 degrees. First responders arrived just after midnight and rushed Hana to Skagit Valley Hospital, where she was pronounced dead an hour later. An autopsy report concluded that the girl died from hypothermia, with malnutrition and chronic gastritis as contributing factors. According to the girl’s medical records, between 2009 and 2011, she had lost nearly 30lbs and was short for her age. Larry and Carri Williams were arrested September 29, 2011, on charges of homicide by abuse in connection with their daughter's death, and first-degree assault of a child stemming from mistreatment of Immanuel. If convicted, each faces a prison term of between 20 and 29 years, according to state sentencing guidelines.","Larry and Carri Williams of Sedro-Woolley, Washington were found guilty of neglecting, abusing, and ultimately killing 13-year-old Hana Williams .

An early morning hike turned into a rescue mission for an Arizona mother after she stumbled across a dog that had been shot and abandoned on a mountain. Andi Davis had walked about half a mile up a Phoenix trail on Friday last week when she found a black and white dog close to death. Although she was nervous of him at first, Mrs Davis lifted the 47lb pit bull into her arms and carried him to safety - and a new, secure life with her family. Scroll down for video . Rescue: Andi Davis and her family have adopted the pit bull she saved from death on a Phoenix mountain . Although she is fit, it took nearly an hour for Mrs Davis to reach her car with the wounded dog, who she constantly reassured as she made the descent. 'I looked down and there's this dog laying there he's not moving,' Mrs Davis, who had been scared of pit bulls, told Fox 10. 'I realized I have two choices. I can try to help this animal or run down the mountain to try to get help.' After gingerly approaching the dog, she offered him a drink from her water bottle and then carefully carried the injured animal to the road, where she was met by her husband and daughter. 'When my mom found our new dog on the mountain, my heart broke at the first sight of him,' Mrs Davis' daughter, Jessi, said. 'He was torn up. Everywhere,' the 10-year-old, who has named the dog Elijah, told WKTR. It is not known how long the two-year-old dog had been left on the mountain, but when he was examined by vets at the Arizona Humane Society, Elijah had an open abdominal wound, bullet fragments near his spinal cord and bullet in his neck. Near death: When Andi found the dog he was collapsed and barely able to move . Injuries: One of the bullet wounds, above, that were found on Elijah who had been left to die on a mountain . Humane Society spokesman Bretta Nelson said it was unlikely that the person responsible for harming Elijah will be found, and said as of yet no witnesses have come forward. Despite his ordeal, Elijah is settling into his new life with the Davis family and their other dogs. He has developed a special bond with Jessi, and Ms Nelson said he responded to the young girl as if 'they had been best friends their whole lives'. Mrs Davis added that when her daughter first met the dog, after he had been carried off the mountain: 'Her heart melted and he looked up and gave her a kiss.' Jessi told AZ Central: 'Mom had him in her arms, and then he looked at me, and I was like, ""Is this dog going to bite?"" And I looked in his eyes - I could tell, I could just tell that he was a nice dog.' Best friends: Jessi says the first time she saw Elijah she knew he was a good dog . The mother is now to be recognized for her rescue efforts with a Compassionate Action Award from animal rights group Peta. 'Thanks to Andi Davis' heroic actions, Elijah hasn't just survived being cruelly shot and left to die - he is now thriving in his loving new home,' Peta's executive vice-president Tracy Reiman said. The group is also offering a reward of $2,500 for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the person responsible for harming the dog.","Andi Davis and her family adopted injured dog she found on morning hike .

Diego Simeone’s Atletico side have been the surprise package of the 2013-14 campaign in Spain. They are locked on 49 points with Barca, with only the defending champions’ superior goal difference keeping them top of the league, while rivals Real Madrid are five points adrift. Here, Pete Jenson previews the big match... VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Lionel Messi star in Barcelona keepy up challenge . Will he, won't he? Messi (centre) is not guaranteed to start when Barcelona meet second placed Atletico . Still got it! Messi made a goal scoring return as a substitute against Getafe in the Copa del Rey . In the dugout: Barcelona head coach Martino is in his first season at the Nou Camp while Diego Simeone (right) has been this season's surprise package with Atletico Madrid . Barcelona coach Tata Martino is contemplating leaving Leo Messi on the bench for Saturday night’s potential title decider against Atletico Madrid. Messi came on as a substitute in midweek and scored twice in 25 minutes against Getafe in the Spanish Cup but 50 days without a game prior to his return has left the Argentine manager pondering his final decision. Martino said: 'Messi likes to finish games so sometimes the best way to make sure he does not over do it is to have him come off the bench. We are always thinking about the last game, but we have to remember he was out for almost two months before that. 'He looked good on Wednesday but we will decide on Saturday whether or not he starts.' If any team in the world can afford not to rush Messi back then it’s Barcelona who have averaged a goal every four games without him. For the first time in their history at this stage of the sesaon Barcelona have five players on more than 10 goals. Pedro, Alexis and Cesc Fabregas have joined Messi and Neymar in double figures and leaving the four-times Ballon d’Or winner on the bench would still leave Barcelona with a front three to frighten any defence. Boy from Brazil: Neymar (centre) has been in fine form since his big money summer move from Santos . Joy of Cesc: Fabregas . Goal getter: Pedro . Hot stuff: Chilean Alexis Sanchez . Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone said he doubted Martino would leave out Messi despite the form of his other strikers. He said: ‘It is possible because Barça has a wonderful squad and thanks to Martino they now have a lot of different and very dangerous options. They have survived without Messi. The other day Pedro scored a hat-trick, then Alexis scored a hat-trick. But I can’t really imagine Messi not playing in this game.’ Martino’s final doubts may turn not just on Messi’s impressive return in midweek but also on his incredible record against Atletico Madrid. Atletico are his favourite victim. He has scored 20 career goals against them – 17 coming in 14 league matches. In what is the most eagerly anticipated game anywhere in Europe this weekend those sensational Barcelona striking options will be pitted against the meanest defence in La Liga. Chelsea’s on loan keeper Thibaut Courtois will once again be behind Juanfran, Miranda, Diego Godin and Felipe Luis. 'We need to defend well and hurt them on the counter attack' said the Brazilian left-back who believes Atletico forward Diego Costa could be just as decisive as any of Barcelona’s attackers. Playing for keeps: Chelsea's on loan keeper Thibaut Courtois is hoping to keep Barcelona's attack at bay . Hitman: Atletico's Diego Costa (left) is La Liga's second highest scorer with 19 goals . Attacking intent: Atletico Madrid's Koke, believed to be a Manchester United target, will be another one to watch . Costa whose 19 goals have him just behind Cristiano Ronaldo as La Liga’s second highest scorer, will partner former Barcelona favourite David Villa for a game between two sides separated only by goal difference in the table. Simeone admitted: ‘Individually they are better than us but we have a very strong group. We feel strong and very competitive.’ Both teams have just one defeat and one draw and Atletico have won every home game played this season. What they have failed to do over the last three years is beat Barça in any of the six league games played between the two sides. It is the biggest test of their title credentials but it will also test Barcelona who for all the glorious options going forward still creak at the back especially when defending set-plays. Martino’s team have conceded five times already in the league from corners and corner-kicks will be cheered like goals by the expected 54,000 sell-out crowd. Bogey man: Messi (right) has scored 17 goals in 14 league games against Atletico Madrid . Bench mark: Spanish football is waiting to see if Messi (centre) plays in Barca's biggest game of the season . It has been ten years since neither Real Madrid nor Barcelona won the league. Valencia’s win under Rafa Benitez owed more to persistence and patience than sparkling football. Atletico Madrid’s adventure has so far been a lot more exhilarating with a Europa League and last season’s Copa del Rey win over Real Madrid picked up along the way. Coach Diego Simeone is facing a former player in one-time River Plate striker Alexis Sanchez as well as fellow countryman Martino in the opposing dug-out. The Argentine keeping both awake on Friday night, however, will be Messi – Martino wondering whether or not to pick him; and Simone wondering how to stop him.","Barcelona and Atletico Madrid are level on 49 points at the top of La Liga .

"By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 23:32 EST, 9 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 02:53 EST, 10 January 2014 . An X-ray telescope has captured the 'Hand of God' in space. NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, or NuStar, captured the new image of a dead star nicknamed the 'Hand of God' since it looks like an open hand. NuStar has been circling earth since June 2012, on a mission to gather more information about black holes in our universe. High five: One of NuStar's latest pictures is of the 'Hand of God' which is the remnants of a dead star about 17,000 light-years away . 'NuStar's unique viewpoint, in seeing the highest-energy X-rays, is showing us well-studied objects and regions in a whole new light,' Fiona Harrison, the mission's principal investigator at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California said on the university's website. This latest image is helping astronomers learn more about pulsars, which are the remnants of dead stars. The 'Hand of God' is a pulsar 17,000 light-years away. It's only about 12 miles in diameter but spins around about seven times in a second throwing around particles from the dead star. Mission: NuStar has been orbiting earth for the past year and a half on a mission to capture better images of black holes . Previous images captured of the pulsar made it look like an outstretched hand (shown in red and blue in the picture), but this new image makes it look more like a fist (shown in blue). 'We don't know if the hand shape is an optical illusion,' said Hongjun An of McGill University. 'With NuStar, the hand looks more like a fist which is giving us some clues.' This new picture leads astronomers to believe that the fingers captured in the original picture are physically different areas from the fist. Astronomers also released another of NuStar's latest images, showing black holes throughout space. Each dot shown in the picture is a different black hole in the surrounding galaxies, with the colors representing different types of X-ray light. Holes in the sky: Another recently released NuStar image show black holes in neighboring galaxies. The dots in blue are the new black holes NuStar has been able to pick up on . The red and green dots are what the Chandra X-ray Observatory captured before and the blue dots are the black holes captured by NuStar. The black holes that shine blue are more actively feeding off surrounding clouds of dust and gas. NuStar is the first telescope to capture black holes at such a far distance. The point of finding these black holes is to learn more about the evolution of black holes and the galaxies they belong to. 'This is a hot topic in astronomy,' said Francesca Civano of Yale University. 'We want to understand how black holes grew in the past and the degree to which they are obscured.'","Researchers released the latest images captured by the NuStar X-ray telescope .

Also: West Ham are braced for another blow, with Fulham set to make a £7.5million approach for Ravel Morrison and fellow midfielder Mohamed Diame. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE . David Moyes has appeared to question whether Manchester United's best is still good enough as the club bid to avoid a fourth successive defeat for the first time in 53 years. Also: Everyone has a story about Emmanuel Adebayor. They are not uniformly positive. So here comes one of the most beguiling and entirely unpredictable stories of a Premier League season which is not exactly short of them. We are about to discover whether Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, the epitome of equanimity and an uncombative nature, can form a successful partnership with Vincent Tan, the serial interferer from Malaysia who regularly telephoned the new Cardiff City manager's predecessor with requests that his players score more goals from distance and make better use of throw-ins. Also: Sam Allardyce believes Andy Carroll need only take a seat on the bench to provide his West Ham United team-mates and the club's supporters with a significant and timely fillip as they end a tumultuous week by resuming their struggle to stay in the Premier League with a key fixture at Cardiff City. David Moyes has said he will not alter his course at Manchester United by defiantly vowing to keep faith with the methods that have left the club facing four consecutive defeats for the first time in more than 50 years. Also: Sam Allardyce insists he was right to blow his West Ham budget on Andy Carroll and would sign the striker with an injury again. David Moyes' traumatic week continued when the Manchester United manager was charged by the Football Association for misconduct yesterday, having been forced to deny his new-look coaching staff are the prime reason for the champions' dismal run of form. Also: Jose Mourinho says he has helped Eden Hazard improve so much it is now inconceivable that Chelsea could sell the Belgian - even for 'crazy' money. David Moyes fears that his players may not be good enough to halt Manchester United's slide. Also: Manuel Pellegrini took a thinly disguised dig at Roberto Mancini by claiming he has liberated Manchester City's stars. Peter Schmeichel has accused Manchester United players of ducking their responsibilities. Also: Sam Allardyce has waited all season for bearded saviour Andy Carroll to resurrect West Ham's season. Andy Carroll will be catapulted back into West Ham's squad today. Also: Manchester United hope there is a Pharoah chance a trip to Egypt will solve Wayne Rooney's injury woe. Wayne Rooney has been sent on a sunshine break to boost his fitness in the hope he can save Manchester United's season.

A new study released Thursday revealed that nearly 70 percent of American adults experience eye strain caused by computers, tablets and smartphones. The vision council reported their findings, which also found that half of adults don't know they can reduce the discomfort, at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Sufferers can start to experience the nagging back pain, blurred vision and headaches just two hours into using a device and research has begun to suggest that exposure to some types of digital screen light may lead to cataracts and macular degeneration. Up close and personal: A study released Thursday reveled that 70 percent of Americans suffer from digital eye strain caused by looking at electronic device screens for two or more hours. The study was presented by the Vision Council at the Consumer Electronics Show 2014 Ipictured) in Las Vegas . 'The eye is not equipped to look at digital screens for extended periods of time,' said Justin Bazan, OD, optometrist and medical adviser to The Vision Council. 'These experiences might be common, but they are not normal.' But common they are. The Vision Council found that many Americans average 6 to 9 hours per day in front of digital devices. They also discovered that the percentage of adults spending 10 or more hours per day staring at devices rose 4 percent from last year. 'Focusing on objects at an . intermediate distance â€“ like a computer or smartphone â€“ ultimately . fatigues the eyes' focusing system and causes strain,' Bazan said. That fatigue means digital eye strain. According . to the Vision Council, 'eye care providers are noting a steady rise in . the number of patients with screen-related eye strain.' While . aches and pains and possibility of more serious issues seem like a good . reason to pick up a paperback instead of an e-reader, there are ways to . cut down the effects of digital strain. Eye yai yai: The study found that adult Americans spend a great deal of their day in front of digital devices. Four percent more respondees said they spent 10+ hours in front of screens than did thje year before . The Vision Council breaks down the the percentage of their respondees who used various digital devices daily . Ways to reduce strain include: positioning screens at arm's length, holding handheld devices below eye-level to elminate glare, and taking short breaks from looking at screens as often as possible. There are also optics-based solutions in development that could ease the problem. 'Digital eye strain has become a large concern for the vision community,' said Ed Greene, CEO of The Vision Council. 'Fortunately, the optical industry has made great strides in the past year to develop lens technologies that can best address the causes of digital eye strain. 'Like other glasses we rely on to read and see clearly, computer glasses are transforming the way we look at computer and hand-held device screens.'","A study released Thursday at the Consumer Electronics show in Las Vegas in revealed just how common digital eye strain really is .

Richard Durkin, 44, who has been engaged in a 16-year legal battle with PC World and HFC Bank after he tried to return a laptop the day after he bought it, will have his case decided by the Supreme Court on 28 January . A father-of-two whose attempt to buy a laptop from PC World sparked a 16-year legal battle costing £250,000 in legal fees is taking his case to the Supreme Court. Richard Durkin, 44, says if the court, which only hears cases 'of the greatest public or constitutional importance', decides against him, he will go bankrupt. But the offshore construction surveyor from Aberdeen, who says his credit rating was ruined after he disputed paying for a computer he didn't want, is determined to fight the corporate giants. 'It's too late for me to throw in the towel now, and besides, I'm a very determined chap' Mr Durkin said. 'I've spent so much on lawyers I'm bankrupt already - I might as well go bankrupt for doing the right thing.' His David and Goliath-style fight began in 1998 when he visited PC World in Aberdeen and asked for a laptop with a built-in modem. He says the sales assistant showed him a model which was in a sealed box and suggested he buy it, saying that if there was a problem he could bring it back and get his money back. Mr Durkin bought the computer, putting down a £50 deposit and signing a credit agreement with HFC Bank, a sub-division of HSBC which provided PC World's in-store finance, for £1,449 to cover the rest. But he found when he got home that the computer did not have a built-in modem, and so took it back to the store the next morning, where the duty manager refused to take the computer back, refund his £50 or cancel the credit agreement. It began a fight that would stretch over the next decade and a half. Mr Durkin, who lives in Aberdeen with his wife and two sons, aged six and three, left the computer at the shop and went to work offshore for a fortnight, returning home to discover the computer waiting for him.  He took it back to the shop and sued PC World for his deposit. The company returned his £50 but did not admit liability, and HFC Bank said he still had to make his credit payments. Mr Durkin said he told the bank what had happened with PC World but was told that if he did not pay, he would be putting his future credit rating at risk. Mr Durkin's problems began when he visited a PC World store in Aberdeen in 1998 to buy a laptop (file image) The epic legal battle will be finally decided by five judges of the Supreme Court, pictured, on 28 January . Subsequently the bank put black marks on his credit files with Experian and Equifax, which, over the next few years, Mr Durkin struggled - and failed - to have removed.  He said when he tried to buy a home in Spain in 2003, these default notices meant he was unable to do so. 'Until you get a credit blacklisting you have no idea how much damage it can do - it has wrecked my life,' he told MailOnline.  'At first I thought I would just take it like a man, but a bad credit rating affects everything.  I can't do anything.' Mr Durkin bought a small council house in Aberdeen in 1996 when he was in his twenties, with a view to buying a larger house once he married and had children.  But he is still there because he cannot get a mortgage for a bigger one. 'People don't realise how much damage a default on your credit record does until they actually have one.' he said.  'I earn quite good money and have done for years, but I am stuck in my house and in so much debt because of the lawyers.' 'It's too late to throw in the towel, and besides, I'm a very determined chap.' - Richard Durkin . In March 2008, a decade after he bought the laptop, Mr Durkin was awarded £116,000 damages by Aberdeen Sheriff Court, which ruled that he was entitled to return the computer and cancel the credit agreement. But two years later, the court of session in Edinburgh overturned the decision, saying that Mr Durkin was not entitled to cancel his credit agreement. The judges also argued that the Spanish property deal fell through because of high spending on Mr Durkin's credit card. With the help of a legal charity, Mr Durkin now has the support of a top lawyer, Andrew Smith QC, and is taking his fight to the Supreme Court on 28 January, where five judges will make a final decision over whether he was the victim of an injustice. Mr Durkin said: 'What makes me sick is that they've had millions of opportunities to do the right thing, and every time they have refused. 'It's no longer about the money for me; it's the principle.  Why should these companies and banks be allowed to get away with treating consumers like this? 'It sickens me. I  just can't let them win.' Neither PC World's parent firm, Dixons Retail, nor HFC parent company, HSBC, would comment on the case today.","Richard Durkin, 44, bought a computer in Aberdeen's PC World in 1998 .

"By . Rosie Taylor . PUBLISHED: . 07:30 EST, 27 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:40 EST, 27 May 2013 . A small Germany town that was once a pilgrimage site for Neo-Nazis has been forced to recruit jobless workers from Spain to fill a labour shortage caused by its shrinking population. Wunsiedel, on German-Czech border, was best known as the burial place of Adolf Hitler's deputy Rudolf Hess. His grave attracted Neo-Nazis who carried out annual marches in the town, which regularly conflicted with opposing anti-Nazi marches. Pilgrimage: The grave of Rudolph Hess was a focal point for Neo-Nazis until marches were banned and his body exhumed and cremated . Although authorities banned the annual pilgrimage in 2005, the town's population has been diminishing, in part because of a slow birth rate. Now companies have started recruiting from countries in southern Europe which have been hit hard by the economic crisis. Already 12 Spanish workers have been relocated after business owners from the town visited Galicia in Spain, where unemployment is around 25 per cent. In contrast, fewer than 6 per cent of Wunsiedel's 9,500 inhabitants are unemployed. Bernd Birke, the owner of an electrical . firm in Wunsiedel, went on the trip in March 2012 to find workers willing to relocate to . Germany. Hitler's deputy: Rudolf Hess was buried in Wunsiedel after he died in a Berlin prison in 1987 where he had served a life sentence for war crimes . He needed more trained electricians than he could find . at home but he did not expect the overwhelming response he got from the . unemployed in the Spanish town of Padron. 'We went to Spain with a queasy feeling,' said . Mr Birke. 'Nobody had any kind of experiences with such a project, whether . it could be successful or not.' But more than 200 people desperate to . find work gathered in Padron's town hall and each vacancy received . several applications. The plan to recruit workers in crisis-hit . Spain was hatched by Bernd Schoeffel, Wunsiedel's deputy mayor after he remembered an incident about 30 years ago when 'guest workers' from Galicia filled a labour shortage in the local ceramic industry. He said the recent scheme had gone well and that 10 of the 12 Spaniards were still in the town. 'The road was not straight, but our experiment is . successful,' he said. Local authorities bought and renovated a house for the Spanish workers to live in, and even put their names on the doors to 'make them feel welcome'. Spanish worker Angel Morales had spent months looking for work in his home country before he took up the offer to move to Wunsiedel. He said: 'This project was introduced to me, and it . seemed interesting because it is a way of learning another language, . another culture and another way of working. 'And now I'm here. I am very happy, and happy to get to know . other people, another way of working, and at the moment I like it.' Back home in Spain, his mother Mercedes said: 'A few years ago nobody imagined this . could happen because the country was alright, there was work for . everybody. Struggle: In crisis-hit Galicia the unemployment rate is around 25 per cent . 'Ours is a beautiful . country, a cheerful country, where everybody would love to have a job to . earn a living. But if that's not what happens, then we have to go and . look wherever jobs are, that's normal.' Some townspeople have objected to foreign workers being brought in when there are still some unemployed Germans in the area, but company bosses insist they cannot find skilled workers locally. Nazi Hess died in a Berlin prison in 1987 after served a life sentence for war crimes handed down at the Nuremberg tribunal. He was buried in the town where his family had been on regular holidays at his own request. Marches and demonstrations around the anniversary of his death on August 17 were a regular occurrence in the town until a crackdown by authorities in 2005. Finally, in 2011, Hess's remains were exhumed, cremated and scattered at sea.","Wunsiedel attracted hoards of Neo-Nazis visiting grave of Hitler's deputy .

A conwoman who posed as a 'simple and sincere' potential bride in order to trick men out of money on an Asian marriage website has escaped jail. Sidra Fatima, 33, carried on her cruel charade for nearly two years, and in that time managed to pull the wool over the eyes of seven men, getting them to part with over £35,000. But the mother-of-two from Dewsbury in West Yorkshire today avoided jail, being given a 12-month suspended sentence despite the judge saying her suitors 'had to put up with humiliation, debt and misery'. Fatima said she was divorced and looking for a husband 'who knows the meaning of love' on dating website Shaadi.com. But she was already married, setting up the scam with her husband Raja Haider Ali, 45. Once they found a victim Fatima would arrange to meet him and occasionally meet their families. Ali would often chaperone Fatima while pretending to be her cousin or brother . John Harrison, prosecuting, today told Bradford Crown Court that Fatima even had two profiles on the website to enable the defendants to catch more hopeful men in their trap'. At the top of one of her pages Fatima described herself as 'simple and sincere'. Mr Harrison said: 'The various suitors were not told that Fatima and Ali were married. Following the initial meeting, Fatima would agree to marriage. 'She would then insist that the complainant hand over money to pay for the wedding and also to purchase items to for the wedding to give to her in the form of a dowry. 'After purchases had been made and money handed over, Fatima would terminate the relationship, either by telling the complainant that she no longer wished to pursue the relationship of by simply not returning his phone calls. 'The defendants made significant sums from this fraudulent activity.' Misery: Potential suitors were left humiliated and deeply in debt by Sidra Fatima (left). Her husband Raja Haider Ali (right) threatened men who ask for their money back, telling them he had murdered 20 people in Pakistan . On one occasion, when a suitor asked for his money back, Ali threatened him, telling him he had murdered 20 people in Pakistan and showing him a picture of an AK-47 machine gun on his phone. Some of the young men they targeted were left 'burdened by debt' as a result of the scam. Reading from one victim impact statement Mr Harrison said: '[The victim] is still traumatised and embarrassed and has lost the faith and confidence in himself.' Reading from another, he said: 'She [Fatima] convinced him that she was a good person. He was convinced she was telling the truth and spent all his savings on her.' Sidra Fatima said she was looking for a husband 'who knows the meaning of love' on a dating website . One victim said in his statement: 'She is good at using emotional blackmail so I spent more on her than I wanted to.' Unemployed Fatima and her taxi driver husband pleaded guilty in the middle of their trial last year. The court heard the marriage scam was part of a variety of fraud offences committed by Fatima and Ali. Sentencing Fatima to a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two-years and Ali to two-and-a-half years in jail, Judge Colin Burn said: 'You both benefited from these frauds and it is clear you lived a very comfortable lifestyle.' 'You cheated suitors who had to put up with humiliation, debt and misery.' The court heard when arrested a Jaguar car was in Fatima’s drive and a Volvo was in Ali’s garage. Fatima had previously admitted providing false details about her employment and income in relation to a £171,000 mortgage fraud involving a former home. The pair had also admitted charges involving insurance claims for three 'staged burglaries' at the same property. Ali, who also goes under three other different names, had admitted six of the marriage deceptions committed between May 2009 and January 2011. He also admitted fraud charges in relation to money he obtained from a man who he thought would buy their house.","Sidra Fatima, 33, ran cruel scam for nearly two years, conning seven men .

Regulating the bedroom: Ultra-conservative Republican Senator Thomas Garrett of Virginia is currently proposing a bill that would outlaw oral sex between teens . A new bill being considered by Virginia State legislature would make oral sex between teenagers illegal. The bill is being proposed by ultra-conservative Republican Senator Thomas Garrett, in an attempt to get a previously proposed 'crimes against nature' law passed. This law, which made it a felony to carnally know 'any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth' was shut down by the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit because it violates the 14th Amendment, which guarantees the rights of due process and equal protection. Senator Garrett hoped to get around the 14th Amendment this second time around by restricting the law to just minors. In the new bill summary, Senator Garrett clarifies that these 'crimes against nature' are not illegal if commited between adults, are not in a public place and don't involve prostitution. The phrasing of the new bill suggests that oral sex with and between minors would be a felony. In an email to the Huffington Post, Senator Garrett defended his bill by saying its aim was not to prohibit oral sex between teens, but to protect them from child predators. He said he was concerned that predators convitcted of 'crimes against nature' with children or teens 'may pursue appeal and quite possibly be released.' If that's the case, legal experts say Senator Garrett should have drafted a law against predators instead of against certain sexual acts. 'If he wants to prosecute people who abuse children, why not write a law that would ban abuse of children,' UCLS law professor Eugene Volokh told HuffPo. Working on it: Senator Garrett says this isn't the final version of the bill that he will propose to the legislature. Above, the Virginia State Capitol . The proposed bill is also causing controversy in the LGBT community by people who say it's discriminatory towards people who have non-genital sex. Claire Guthrie GastaÃ±aga, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia told Think Progress that her group would oppose the bill because 'it leaves in place discriminatory treatment and doesn't address the underlying problem that LGBT people are treated differently than folks that have other kinds of sex.' But Senator Garrett promises that this isn't the final version of Senate Bill 14. 'Our office has been inundated with extremely unsavory telephone calls and emails,' Senator Garrett said in the email. 'For the record, I have heard the concerns and have started to draft an amendment to my bill that will deal with the unintended consequences of a bill that is nothing but well-intentioned.'","Senate Bill 14 defines 'crimes against nature' as knowing 'any male or female person by the anus or by or with the mouth'
Consenting adults who perform these sex acts in private and aren't practicing prostitution are excepted from the felony .
The wording therefore makes it illegal for two consenting teens to have oral sex .

Former neighbours of a father of 22, this week spared jail for drug dealing, have spoken of his lavish lifestyle, impressive cars and raucous late-night parties in a caravan. Raymond Hull, 58, who has children by 11 women despite only having been married once, appears to have enjoyed the trappings of wealth - BMWs, foreign holidays, and presents for his numerous girlfriends - despite having been out of work for a decade. Hull, who already had 31 convictions and has been jailed four times, was had his prison sentence suspended this week after asking a judge to let him go so that he could care for his newest child - seven-month-old Barry. 'I just love kids': Raymond Hull, who was spared jail for dealing drugs, with his 22nd and youngest child Barry . 'Great dad': Hull has defended his record as a father, saying he loves his kids - some of whom he cannot name . Residents of Wigton, Cumbria, where Hull used to live with ex-girlfriend Vanessa Wright, 32, told the Daily Mirror how he had BMWs and even a speedboat in his driveway, and would post photographs of himself enjoying fry-ups while holidaying abroad. They also attacked him for holding wild parties in a caravan - described as 'pure madness' - almost forcing his neighbours to move away. One said: 'It was just awful. There was a caravan, a speedboat and a double decker bus parked in the drive or in the street. 'The place was like ­Piccadilly Circus. We were on the verge of moving out as we couldn’t take any more. It’s nice and quiet here now.' Boast: Rianna, 23, one of Hull's daughters, boasted of her idle life on Facebook . Estimates for the total cost of Hull's lifestyle - totalling up his unemployment payouts, housing benefits as well as handouts to support his children - suggest that he could have cost the taxpayer more than £1million. Meanwhile, it emerged that one of his daughters, 23-year-old Rianna, posted a jeering message online where, in poor English, she thanked taxpayers for supporting her life of idleness. She wrote: 'Jst gta announce that i love every working person in cumbria cz fanx to uze i get to sit on my jeer all day nd help use spend yr wagez ! Yaz no hw t spend it wisely ya jenerous f***z xxxxx.' But despite his record - and the fact that he seems unable to name all his children - Hull last night insisted that he is 'a great dad'. Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'People might have a pop at me but I love my kids. I can't help it if I'm so fertile and it's not my fault I can't work. 'I keep in touch with as many of my kids as I can and they come round for dinner every week - I'm a great dad — all my kids will tell you that.' When asked by reporters to list all of his children, Hull could only manage 15 - and says that the remaining seven do not know he is their father. 'Thanks': Miss Hull's message to taxpayers on the social networking site . After his court hearing this week, Hull, who has been married only once insisted ‘I just love kids’, but admitted he was in contact with only ‘about 12’ of them. Despite police finding a stash of cannabis and text messages from customers, a judge accepted he was helping to raise child number 22 while his partner returned to work. With ‘considerable hesitation’ the judge went on to impose a suspended sentence. Afterwards . Hull – who has a series of convictions dating back four decades – . defended his unconventional lifestyle, saying he had ‘never been short . of offers’. ‘I just love kids,’ he said. ‘I don’t regret anything, . even though I don’t speak to them all. Some of them don’t even know I’m . their dad.’ And he bragged: ‘I don’t know what it is about me, but I’m . never short of offers. Raymond Hull narrowly missed time behind bars when his 18-month jail sentence was suspended to allow him to care for his youngest son Barry . ‘It’s just my luck that every time I have a one-night stand, the girl ends up getting pregnant. 'I've never had to chase after women. I'm easy going, they are always chasing me.'If it's tidy, you don't knock it back, do you?' ‘I only know one or . two of their birthdays, but they don’t mind. One of the girls got a . sister for her birthday one year,’ he recalled yesterday. The couple . split up and Hull is listed as the father of three children – Leon, now . 23, Rianna, 22, and Kane, 20 – by his next partner. Two years ago he . set up home in the Cumbrian village of Aspatria with a bakery worker . less than half his age, 26-year-old Emma McNeil, and last year she gave . birth to a baby boy, Barry. However, when he appeared in court this week . he claimed to have fathered a total of 22 children. Explaining how . he fathered so many children by so many women, he said yesterday: ‘I’ve . only been married once. I’ve got five kids with one woman; three with . another; three with another; and three with another. I’ve got two kids . with one woman and little Barry with Emma. When asked by The Sun to name all of his children, Hull made it up to 15 before stopping. He added that the remaining seven do not know he is their father. They are: . Naomi, 39, Michael, 39, Raymond, 38, Joseph, 36, AdrIan, 34, Rebecca MarIe, 29, Leon, 23, Rianna, 22, Kane, 20, Callum, 10, CaItlyn, 9, Connor, 16, Reece, 16, Abbie, 14, and Barry, seven months. Seven more were not named. ‘The others were just one each with different women. 'Some of the girls were happy to give the . relationship a go, others did not want anything to do with me after . they got pregnant. I still keep in touch with all the women now though. I . get on better with them now we've split. 'I . agreed with some of my exes now that if they get married to someone . else, and another man raises the kid, it is not my kid anymore. I see 14 . of my kids who know I am their dad all the time'. Hull hasn’t worked for ten years because of a bad back and says 'it must be from running round after all these kids all these years'. A picture of Hull was once placed on Facebook of him clutching a condom and smiling, and his son Raymond Jr posted: 'You wanna learn how to use them.'

He . claimed to be in debt – but his baby son was playing with an iPad when a . reporter visited this week. Hull, who also claims to have 19 . grandchildren, was arrested after police raided his terraced home last . May and discovered cannabis worth £350. Examination of his mobile . phone revealed a text message telling a customer there would be a delay . in supplying drugs due to Barry’s impending birth. Hull admitted . using cannabis to help with his own medical problems at Carlisle Crown . Court, but claimed he only sold to friends to cover costs. However, . Judge Paul Batty QC dismissed Hull’s claims as a ‘cock and bull story’. Hull then abandoned his story, choosing not to give evidence in support . of it. In mitigation, Anthony Wilson said Hull had ‘a number of . medicinal conditions’ including breathing problems, back pains and . frequent chest infections which would make any time in prison difficult. He suggested that a suspended sentence could be imposed so that Hull . could stay at home and look after the baby while his partner went back . to work. Judge Batty imposed an 18-month sentence, suspended for two . years. He also put Hull under a night-time curfew for the next six . months and ordered him pay £200 which will be taken out of his benefits.

I think it will be on a lot of people's minds whether they want to stay here now.' Police said the dog, which allegedly bit Barry several times, had been removed from the property following the attack and had since been destroyed. Officers initially treated the death as suspicious but, following questioning at Southend Police Station, the woman was later released. A police spokesman said: 'The death of a man found at a flat in Westcliff, on Tuesday, January 7, is not being treated as suspicious. 'Prior to his death the 46-year-old man from Westcliff received injuries to his lower body consistent with dog bites. A Staffordshire bull terrier was removed from the address and has since been put down. 'A post-mortem examination found the initial cause of death to be internal bleeding following a laceration to the spleen. 'Police will now prepare a file for the coroner. 'There appears to have been an incident whereby then man was bitten by the dog. It is likely that during this incident the man sustained an injury to his back and this then caused damage to his spleen. It is not possible to say how that back injury was caused. The injuries to the spleen were not due to the bites by the dog.'","Unnamed man suffered bit injuries to lower body in Essex flat .

Sentenced: Henry Hoare, 18, (right) with stockbroker father Tim Hoare, 63, has been banned from driving after picking up a group of girls double the legal drinking limit . A descendant of the C Hoare & Co banking family was caught drink-driving when he used his new BMW to pick up four girls while at nearly twice the legal limit. Henry Hoare, 18, whose family live in the Grade-II listed Hollycombe House in Liphook, Hampshire, was staying at their multi-million-pound London property in Belgravia when he was called by his female friends asking for a lift in the early hours. He had drunk four pints of beer and as he drove home he was stopped by the police for speeding. He slipped when he was asked to get out of the car and was unsteady on his feet. The finance student at Bristol University pleaded guilty at Hammersmith Magistrates’ Court to driving the black Series 1 vehicle, with excess alcohol in his breath, in  Eaton Square on December 15 last year. He was supported in court by his stockbroker father, Tim Hoare, 63, who founded the hugely successful T Hoare & Co in 1993. The court heard how Hoare was well over the drink-drive limit when he was stopped at 2.20am, around the corner from his London home and 500 yards from C Hoare & Co’s Knightsbridge branch. After failing a road-side breath test Hoare was arrested and later blew an alcohol reading of 68 microgrammes – the legal limit is 35. Lineage: The Bristol University student, seen outside Hammersmith Magistrate's Court, is the descendent of the UK's oldest bank C Hoare & Co. He was staying at his family's Belgravia home when he took the BMW out . Caught: Police officers ordered him to pull over at 2.20am on December 15 when he sped through traffic lights on December 15 on Eaton Square - just 500 yards away from the family bank's headquarters . On Thursday he was fined £400, with £80 costs, ordered to pay a £40 victim surcharge and disqualified from driving for a year. Robin . Falvey, defending, told the court: ‘He receives an allowance and it . would be  disingenuous for me to say  his family will not pay his . financial penalty. ‘I . have spoken to his father, who sits at the back of  the court, and he . says that since obtaining his licence  his son has been very responsible . in relation to driving  and drink-driving.’ He added: ‘He never intended to drive … [when] some female friends asked for a lift. ‘At that time of night  he should have told them to get a taxi.’ Henry told the court he had drunk five pints. The court heard his family, which resides in Grade II-listed Hollycombe House in Hampshire, will foot the £520 bill . But . district judge Davinder Lachhar disagreed, saying: ‘He intended to . drive and he did drive. These terms are used too liberally.’ She told Hoare: ‘Your female friends should have gone home on their own volition.’ The . family’s wealth stems from C Hoare & Co, Britain’s oldest bank, . which was founded in 1672 by Sir Richard Hoare and continues to be run . by the eleventh generation of his direct descendants.

Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna called for curbs on jobless migrants . Jobless migrants could be barred from moving to Britain if they do not have the offer of work under controversial plans being drawn up by Labour. Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna insisted the founding principle of the European Union was 'free movement of workers not free movement of jobseekers'. It comes after a top Brussels official accused politicians in the UK of fuelling myths about an 'invasion' of immigrants, claiming David Cameron's tough rhetoric risks ‘destroying the future’ of the British people. Mr Cameron has made clear that tackling . immigration from Europe would be a key demand of his plan to renegotiate . Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. The Prime Minister has suggested curbs on people from poor parts of Europe moving to Britain for work while also banning migrants claiming child benefit to send to families back home. Ahead of work restrictions on Romanians and Bulgarians being lifted on 1 January, the government rushed through laws to stop new arrivals claiming benefits for three months. However Labour suggested it could go further and prevent anyone moving to the UK if they do not have a firm offer of work. Mr Umunna said: 'The founders of the European Union had in mind free movement of workers, not free movement of jobseekers. And undoubtedly we do have to work with our European partners to deal with that. 'What people intended when they built the EU in the first instance was that people who either had a job or had the skills to get a job would move around the European Union,' he told BBC1's Question Time. Labour's Chuka Umunna . 'The problem that we've had at the moment is that we've had, during our time in office - and this is where we did make a mistake - you had high skilled people coming from other countries to do low skilled jobs here. 'All people want is a system that is properly controlled and managed, and more work needs to be done on that.' The remarks are the strongest signal yet of a major new immigration policy from Labour, and comes after leader Ed Miliband vowed to close a loophole which allows migrants to paid less by agencies. But a Conservative spokesman said: 'Labour had 13 years to change the EU's rules and fix the immigration system, but they failed to do so. 'They even decided to opt out of transitional controls on the right of people coming from new member states to work here. 'That's why David Cameron's long-term plan is to seek a new settlement for Britain in Europe, including putting in place new arrangements that will slow full access to each other's labour markets until we can be sure it will not cause vast migrations. We would then put this new settlement to the British people through an in-out referendum. 'But Ed Miliband opposes our long-term plan to fix our relationship with Europe and to let Britain decide. Nothing would change under Labour.' Scroll down for video .

European Commission, that Mr Cameron is fuelling fears of an . 'invasion'. She insisted Britons claim ‘much more’ in benefits than EU . migrants and accused Mr Cameron of using 'populist' rhetoric to pddle 'myths. Taking part in an online web chat, Miss Reding said: The free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections,’ she said. ‘I’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders [in Britain]. What is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes? You are destroying the future of your people, actually. Pressure: The Prime Minister has vowed to use his planned renegotiation of Britain's EU membership to tackle immigration . ‘What the people who come to work bring to the taxation and social security is much more than they take out. “And those who take out of social security are much more the [UK] nationals than the European Union citizens, who take advantage of the free movement of people. ‘It’s just a myth to speak about an invasion, this invasion is just not taking place.’ But a government spokesman hit back: 'Hardworking people expect and deserve a benefits system that is fair to British citizens and migrants who come here to work but is robust and tough on those who abuse the system and flout the law.' At the weekend Mr Cameron said: ‘My job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’ The Prime Minister insisted it was wrong that the British taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the European Union. He added: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.’ But the remarks triggered an angry response from Poland's foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski accused Mr Cameron of ‘stigmatising’ Poles by singling out the nation’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform EU welfare rules. Mr Sikorski said: ‘If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn’t it also pay their benefits?

Charlotte Mei Ling Lee, 31, lost control on a mountain trail in Canada. Miss Lee, a magistrates’ court assistant from Portishead, Bristol, suffered severe head injuries and died in hospital five days later. Tragedy: Tributes have been pouring in for Charlotte Mei Ling Lee (left), pictured with her boyfriend Domynique Tamaire, who survived the accident in Quebec . Her boyfriend Domynique Tamaire, a . passenger on the rented snowmobile, was seriously hurt in the crash at . Ferme-Neuve, 100 miles north of Montreal, last Saturday. Miss . Lee’s family flew to her bedside where on Thursday they decided to . switch off her ventilator and donate her organs for transplant. Messages of support to Mr Tamaire have been flooding in on Facebook. One from Bon Rayment read: ‘I don't know what to say to you Dom as no words will make this tragedy any better but I wanted you to know that we are thinking of you and send you lots of love. ‘I hope you make a speedy recovery from injuries. Thank you for making Charlotte so happy since she met you.’ Another, from Annabel Stewart, said: ‘I'm so sorry she is gone as you made each other so happy. We are all thinking of you and sending you love.’ Messages of support to Mr Tamaire over the death of his girlfriend (centre) have been left on Facebook . Ms Lee was negotiating a mountain trail when she suffered catastrophic head injuries during a festive holiday with Mr Tamaire. He was a passenger on the vehicle and was also seriously hurt in the smash in picturesque Ferme-Neuve, Quebec. The pair were rushed to hospital where they were later joined by Charlotte's distraught family, who flew to her bedside from their home in Bristol. But five days after the crash they made the agonising decision switch off her ventilator and donate her organs. In a statement, mum Elaine, dad Frank and sisters Helen and Jenny said: ‘We are all absolutely devastated by the loss of our beautiful, tender-hearted Charlotte. ‘Although our hearts are broken we are taking great comfort from the overwhelming amount of love, support, kind message and generosity of the many people that have been in touch. ‘Charlotte was loved by so many people and will forever be in our hearts.’ The accident happened at a popular spot for trekking and outdoor activities on Saturday. Tragedy: Ms Lee was treated at Montreal hospital, but her life support was turned off after five days . Local police say Ms Lee - known as Lottie to pals - had little experience driving the rented snowmobile and might have lost control while doing a ‘bad manoeuvre’. The magistrates court assistant was transferred 100 miles to Montreal Hospital after the incident. A spokesman for the Quebec Provincial Police said: ‘A young woman from the UK was involved in a snowmobile accident which was driven into a tree. ‘It appears she was driving along a trail and lost control of the machine, maybe she did a bad manoeuvre. ‘The snowmobile had been rented and there is some evidence that she did not have a lot of experience when it came to driving the machine. Ms Lee was negotiating a mountain trail near Ferme-Neuve when she suffered catastrophic head injuries . ‘She suffered major head injuries and the man who was with her also suffered serious but not life-threatening injuries. ‘Both of the victims were transported to hospital but the woman died later at the hospital.’ It is understood her family are still in Canada arranging repatriation. An online appeal to help her family from Portishead, Bristol, foot the medical bills has already raised more than £12,000. On Thursday a family friend said they had now discovered Ms Lee had insurance which will cover the bills and potentially the full cost of repatriation. But donations have continued to pour in, and website creator Janie Digby said the money will now probably be put towards her funeral, the family's travelling costs or donated to a charity in Ms Lee's name. In an online message she said: ‘Your messages of support and enormously generous donations have really touched us and we don't think that we will ever be able to fully express our gratitude. ‘It's been a truly terrible week, but knowing that so many people care, send their support and want to help has been a huge comfort to Jenny and Elaine.’ When Ms Lee was declared dead by the Montreal Coroner on Thursday, she posted: ‘Her body remains on a ventilator as her parents have made the very generous and brave decision to donate her organs for life saving purposes. ‘The recipients of the donated organs will be prepared and the family anticipate that this and the turning off of the ventilator will take place this evening Canadian time. ‘Charlotte's sisters Helen and Jenny are so touched by how many of you have been wishing Charlotte and the family well and we are all completely blown away by the generosity of people donating to Charlotte's fund.’","Charlotte Mei Ling Lee from Bristol suffered fatal head injuries in the crash .

This is the makeshift den under a railway bridge where a rapist hid from police while on the run. Peter Lee Watton, 37, dragged a 44-year-old woman into woodland as she jogged with her dog in broad daylight just 48 hours after he was released early from prison. Clutching a knife, the convicted kidnapper told her he had been watching her for weeks, before assaulting her for nine hours. Hideout: Peter Lee Watton fashioned a camp out of a sleeping bag and camp fire in Wrexham, north Wales . After a nationwide manhunt, officers detected his fire and arrested him for kidnapping and raping a woman for nine hours in Handbridge, Chester, in broad daylight . But eventually, she managed to break free and seek refuge in a nearby cottage in Handbridge, Chester. Watton fled as police launched a nationwide manhunt. Six days later, he was found and arrested metres away from this camp under a railway bridge in North Wales. Today he was was found guilty of 12 offences including false imprisonment, eight counts of rape, two counts of assault by penetration, and possession of a bladed article. He remains in custody awaiting sentence. Convicted: Watton, 37, has been found guilty of 12 offences including eight counts of rape, two counts of penetration and possession of a bladed article . Detective Inspector Simon Lonsdale said: 'The bravery of the victim is extraordinary. I am humbled by her courage and determination which has enabled us to return a very dangerous man back to prison for a long time. 'Watton put the victim through a terrifying ordeal lasting several hours and had the audacity to claim the contact was consensual. 'Consequently the victim had to attend court and give evidence at the trial. Thankfully the jury saw through his lies and deceit and he will stay behind bars where he belongs. 'This case will obviously be very concerning to people, particularly in the Chester area, but I just want to stress that horrendous as it is, thankfully incidents like this are extremely rare for Cheshire as a whole' The victim and her pet dog set off for their habitual afternoon jog along the tarmac path through the woods at about 3pm on Friday June 14, police said. Watton was walking in the opposite direction and pushing a bicycle. He spoke to the victim telling her to enjoy her run. Moments later she was grabbed from behind and carried into the wooded area. Watton initially had his face covered and threatened to harm the victim if she called out, telling her he had a knife and had been watching her for weeks. He held the victim captive for several hours moving to different areas within the woods and subjecting her to repeated sexual assaults. The victim knew that Watton was armed with a knife and was convinced that she would be killed. He appeared to be moving her closer to the River Dee and she feared she would be thrown in, police said. This is the road where the woman had been running at around 3pm on June 14 when Watton grabbed her . Eventually, at midnight, she saw lights and as Watton was distracted she ran to nearby houses. She knocked on the door of a house and told the couple she had been attacked and raped. They allowed her into their home where she called the police and told them the man had 'Pete' tattooed to his knuckles. An immediate and intensive manhunt was launched.

Tragedy: Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham died when his ejector seat unexpectedly fired as he and colleagues prepared their jets to fly . An RAF engineer who witnessed his pilot friend die after his ejector seat unexpectedly fired gave an emotional description of the tragedy to an inquest today. Corporal David Morris watched as Flight Lieutenant Sean Cunningham of the Red Arrows was propelled into the air from his parked Hawk T1 aircraft at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire. The highly-regarded and experienced pilot with the aerial display team, who was also an Iraq war veteran, was fatally injured when he hit the ground. The parachute on the ejector seat did not deploy and the 35-year-old South African-born airman died in hospital after suffering multiple injuries. Corporal Morris, a Survival Equipment Fitter with the RAF, told the inquest that on November 8, 2011, he was not far from Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s jet as the team prepared to fly to RAF Valley in Wales. Ground crew had been carrying out pre-flight checks, as had the pilots in their cockpits, when he became aware that something had gone wrong for Flight Lieutenant Cunningham. 'The canopy filled with smoke and Flight Lieutenant Cunningham went from his seat through the canopy,' he said. Shaken by the memory of the tragedy, Corporal Morris was forced to pause to compose himself before he continued recalling the events of the day. He said he was standing with a colleague when the canopy blew, scattering pieces of perspex across the ground which they had to duck to avoid, and it took a few seconds to realise what had happened. He told the inquest he had to watch the trajectory of the ejection seat through the air because he was aware it should separate from the ejected pilot and it was unclear where they would land. However, the inquest heard that the seat did not come away from Flight Lieutenant Cunningham who remained attached to the seat until he hit the ground. Corporal Morris said: 'I watched it from start to finish and when I saw the drogue deploy the seat stabilised but from where I was standing it looked like Flight Lieutenant Cunningham was trying to stabilise himself. 'I could see his limbs moving and then the seat seemed to come to some sort of position where it was falling properly and that’s when I thought it would separate from Flight Lieutenant Cunningham. 'He came down almost in slow motion, but obviously fairly quickly, and hit the floor. I could hear and feel the thud beneath our feet.' Colleagues rushed to Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s side but Corporal Morris said it was obvious he was terribly injured. 'I knew it was bad,' he told the inquest. Asked by Richard Seabrook, counsel to the inquest, if he saw any signs of life, Corporal Morris paused to take a deep breath before answering: 'No.' He told the inquest he had been quite close to the pilot and the morning of the incident had shared some banter, in which Flight Lieutenant Cunningham had put his arm around him. 'I watched it from start to finish': The Red Arrows Hawk T1 jet from which Flight Lieutenant Cunningham was unexpectedly ejected sits with a damaged canopy on the Tarmac at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire . Corporal Morris's account came on the day that the inquest in Lincoln heard from the Red Arrows' squadron leader, who admitted he had been left shocked at the team's lack of resources on returning from time away. Squadron Leader Martin Higgins said in a pre-written statement to the hearing: 'The big change I have seen, having left the team for four years, is that resources is now a big issue, and the ability to do the task. 'It’s a big ask on the boys downstairs.' Giving evidence to the inquest, Squadron Leader Higgins said he was talking about the engineers, who understood and wanted to do their job but needed some extra help to do so. 'They need some reassurance that help is on the way.' Admitting that his unit's jets 'were not getting any younger' Squadron Leader Higgins also lamented that there was little opportunity for the engineers to get their hands on the planes. Senior Aircraftman Joseph Tiley, an aircraft maintenance mechanic for Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team (RAFAT), told the inquest that on the morning of November 8 he carried out checks on Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s aircraft before signing it over to the pilot for flight. He said part of his inspection was to examine the cockpit to make sure there were no problems. This included a visual check for safety pins in the seat, which pilots must pull out as they prepare for take-off to allow a seat firing handle to activate in case of emergency. Yesterday the inquest heard that, to trigger the seat, pilots must then pull the handle, which is located on the seat between their legs, upwards. Evidence given to the hearing said there had been occasions when air crew were unaware that the safety pin had been mistakenly inserted incorrectly and the firing mechanism became live. The inquest also heard that the safety handle could be locked in a certain position where a downward pressure would cause the ejection seat to launch. SAC Tiley said he would always check safety pins in the seat. This was usually done visually, both to ensure his own safety while carrying out cockpit inspections and that of the pilot he was handing over to. The Red Arrows performing last June at the British Grand Prix: The Red Arrows' squadron leader admitted he had been left shocked at the aerial display team's lack of resources on returning from with different units . On the morning of the day of Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s death, he carried out these checks as usual, he told the inquest. He was with the pilot when he strapped into the cockpit and did not notice anything untoward, with the only slightly unusual thing being a 'slight delay' in the canopy closing. SAC Tiley went on with his normal checks as the jets prepared to fly, and told the inquest: 'As I passed the nose and took a quick glance to my left, I did notice that his pins were not in stowage at that point, but I focused on doing my look-round checks on the aircraft.' He said that by the time he had finished his checks, a colleague was close to Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s plane and he thought had reminded him about the pins, which the inquest has heard it was not uncommon for pilots to occasionally forget about. SAC Tiley did not see the ejection. 'I was about to take a step back to do the air brake when I saw a flash of black smoke and at that point I tucked myself into a ball, put my hands over my head, and closed my eyes,' he said. SAC Tiley told the inquest he had not been aware that if a safety pin was in the seat it could be unsafe. He said: 'At the time, if the pin was in, in my opinion, that should have meant it was through the housing and it should not have been possible for the other positions. 'To me, an ejector seat should have two settings - safe or in use. It should not have these dead spots.' The inquest, which is expected to last up to three weeks and is attended by members of Flight Lieutenant Cunningham’s family, continues.","Cpl David Morris watched Flt Lt Sean Cunningham ejected from his aircraft .

A baby boy who weighed less than a bag of sugar after being born three months prematurely has survived, and his incredible journey to good health has been documented by his doting father. These photographs show Saxon on the day he entered the world at just 26 weeks, weighing just 1lb 12oz, and today, as a strapping eight-month-old boy with his siblings. Parents Heidi and Edmund Shum, from Llanelli, west Wales, feared their son might not survive, but believe his story will be an inspiration to others. Fight for life: Saxon on the day he was born on April 27 last year. He was three months early and weighed just 1lb 12oz but happily is now a strapping eight-month-old boy . Path to health: Saxon sleeping soundly, after being born at 26 weeks, (right) a jubilant mother Heidi during a key procedure in the early stages of Saxon's life . Brothers: Saxon (middle) with his older brothers Elliot, 11 (right) and Dexter, 4 (left), eight months after his incredibly premature birth . When Heidi Shum, 40, unexpectedly went into labour before her due date she feared the worst. She said: 'We weren’t really trying for a baby when I fell pregnant. I was approaching 40 so I thought perhaps my age would act against me. But we were thrilled when it happened. 'It was a very emotional journey - when Saxon was born he could fit into the palm of my hand, he was about the size of a slice of bread. 'He was in hospital for five months, and while there were low points as well as happy days, Ed captured them all.' Mr Shum said he thought it was important to document his son’s journey to make the most of the couple’s first days with their son, and to show Saxon when he gets older. 'I wanted to capture his life as a baby, as babies don’t stay babies for long,' he said. Early days: Saxon spent most of his early life fighting for survival in hospital, with close attention by hospital staff . A tender moment as mother and Son hold hands: Saxon was in hospital for five months, with his parents by his side every day . 'I naturally take photos to tell a story. To this day, when I tell people how small Saxon was when he was born, I find it hard to believe, and I find myself cross-referencing with my photos. 'The only people allowed to see Saxon were my wife and I, so taking photos meant we could update everyone with Saxon’s progress while using those photos to preserve memories. 'Memories fade away, and little details get lost, but photographs will last forever and help you live the moment again. In our case, it reminds us every single day how lucky we were that Saxon fought his way out of hospital and safely home.' The touching moment the family were together for the first time - when Saxon met his brothers in hospital. Pictured, Elliot, 11, Dexter, 4, Heidi, Edmund and Saxon. Heidi Shum, 40, and Edmund Shum, 34 . In the collection there are pictures of Saxon which capture his fight for life, featuring photos of the family, as well as high resolution close-ups. The series of photographs, which begin with a picture taken on Saxon’s birthday on April 27th 2013, show Saxon growing and putting on weight as he gets stronger. In one of the photographs, Edmund captures the moment Saxon appears to be waving at his older brothers Elliot 11, and Dexter 4, as they stare at him through the window in the hospital. Mrs Shum said: 'It wasn’t easy - there were many complications along the way, everything which could go wrong seemed to happen. Saxon suffered two bleeds on the brain, a lung infection, bowel disease and a blood infection, among other things. 'The nurses at Singleton Hospital in Swansea were absolutely amazing and really taught me the importance of expressing milk to help Saxon grow and get stronger. 'They were like angels, and Ed’s pictures of Saxon have now been put up in the hospital to show the importance of breastfeeding. 'It was a very frightening time, but all the way through Saxon’s fight we took photographs and emailed them to a special account to show him when he’s older. 'I look at them now and they bring me to tears. I never lost hope that my little boy was going to survive. Saxon was born unexpectedly and prematurely in a hospital in Wales and spent a lot of his early life fighting for survival among health problems, but soon grew to a healthy eight-month-old .

'Before he was born, I didn’t know anything about premature babies. My son Dexter was born one month premature but it was nothing compared to what happened with Saxon. 'Hopefully expectant mothers, and mothers going through a similar dark time, will be able to see these pictures and know there is hope.' The couple suffered one more set-back in July. Just as they were ready to take Saxon home, he developed a hernia of the groin and had to undergo an operation. He eventually left hospital in September. Mrs Shum said: 'We had his stuff all packed and we were just about to put him into the car seat when the doctor realised he had the hernia.

'At the time we were down 2-1, then I scored the equaliser and my dad was really proud - you could see he was. 'But then I heard someone say ""Liam, your dad’s ill"", and I saw him on the floor.  At first I thought he must be being sick or something. 'But then I saw his best mate was trying to do CPR on him and I knew it was serious.' Mrs Wildsmith, 45, said: 'When he went down, everything froze - time just stood still. 'It felt like hours waiting for the paramedics to arrive, but I was told afterwards that the ambulance arrived within four minutes.' Mrs Wildsmith said she was glad that she and Liam were with her husband, holding his hands, 'until the end' She added: 'The only silver lining was that all his family were at the game, a lot of his friends were there, his son was there - whom he was so proud of for scoring, he always was - and we all held his hands and stayed with him until the end.' Liam said: 'I’ll miss my dad. He was such a great motivator on the football field. He wasn’t one of those parents you hear about going mad on the football field. 'He also taught me to love a good pork pie.' He added: 'My family all tell me that I’m exactly like my dad was.

Mr Wildsmith arrived late when his wife was in labour with Liam as he'd been watching a football match . Mrs Wildsmith said her husband, who co-founded the Hoyland Reds’ Barnsley FC supporters’ club, had two loves: family and football. She added: 'He was a life-long Barnsley supporter - I remember being in labour and having to wait until he got back from a Barnsley match.' Mr Wildsmith's mother, Sue, said: 'He had so many friends in the area - our living room looks like a florist with all the flowers and cards we’ve been sent.

Tragic: Joshua Stadius-Horn died after accidentally hanging himself while playing in his bedroom with his three younger brothers, an inquest heard . A nine-year-old boy has died after accidentally hanging himself while playing in his bedroom with his three younger brothers. Joshua Stadius-Horn had been spending time with his siblings at home in Watton, Norfolk, when he became tangled in the cord of his dressing gown. He was found by his mother Helen and airlifted to hospital, but sadly died a few hours later. The accident happened at about 8am on New Year's Day after the boys had been sent upstairs to tidy their bedroom,  an inquest in Norfolk heard yesterday. Mrs Stadius-Horn realised that Joshua was in trouble when one of his younger brothers ran into her bedroom - complaining that the schoolboy 'wasn't helping' to tidy up and was 'pretending to be dead'. She then discovered her unconscious son, before calling 999 and starting to perform CPR. Paramedics and police arrived at the house, and Joshua was flown by air ambulance helicopter to Addenbrookeâ€™s . Hospital in Cambridge. However, he died later that night, with his mother and father Steve, at his bedside after his life support machine was turned off. Yesterday, police officer Donna Flanaghan told the inquest that social services had had no concerns about the schoolboy. And recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Jacqueline Lake agreed there had been no suspicious circumstances. She added Joshua had died from a 'catastrophic' brain injury. Response: The schoolboy was found by his mother Helen and airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured) in Cambridge, but sadly died a few hours later . 'It was a tragic accident in which Joshua was not aware and died not knowing the outcome of his actions,' she said. Speaking after the inquest, Mrs Stadius-Horn paid tribute to her 'amazing' son. 'Josh was an amazing son and brother and we are all devastated by such a tragic accident,' she said. 'We love him so much and he will be very much missed.'","Joshua Stadius-Horn had been playing with siblings, an inquest heard .

David Cameron accused the BBC of misleading  listeners ‘day after day’ on the scale of budget cuts. The Prime Minister said on a radio show yesterday that he wanted people to be given accurate figures on the austerity measures. Mr Cameron was admonished on BBC Radio Merseyside for ‘unfairly’ hitting Liverpool with bigger cuts than his Oxfordshire constituency, Witney. Rant: David Cameron appearing on Absolute Radio in Central London. He made the comments during an appearance on BBC Radio Merseyside . In a feisty exchange, host Roger Phillips said Mr Cameron was ‘so out of touch, it’s untrue’. But Mr Cameron said local politicians had actually built up their reserves. He said: ‘One of the reasons people feel treated unfairly is because they hear on programmes like yours, day after day, week after week, sets of figures that aren’t accurate. ‘That’s why I’ve spent so much time, on your programme, giving you the accurate figures. ‘You’ve got me on this programme, you’ve asked me about these figures, you are saying Liverpool is unfairly funded and I want to give you the statistics so you can see that’s  absolutely not the case.’ He added: ‘Liverpool is adding to its reserves while making these  complaints, rather than drawing on its reserves, and there’s still  £6million of uncollected council tax.’ The Labour Mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, had accused Mr Cameron of cutting the budget of one of the country’s most deprived cities. In an article for the Liverpool Echo, Mr Anderson wrote: ‘When Cameron comes to praise Liverpool, he also plans on stabbing us in the back. Liverpool City Council is facing £156million of government cuts in the next few years. That’s on top of £176million in funding and 1,600 jobs the council has already lost.’ Unfair: He was admonished for imposing bigger cuts on Liverpool in comparison to his Oxfordshire constituency, Witney . The city faces cuts of 5.5 per cent, or £30million, by 2015, while West Oxfordshire, which covers Mr Cameron’s prosperous constituency, will see its budget trimmed by a more modest 2 per cent. However, spending per household in Liverpool is more than ten times higher, some £2,636 compared to £205. Mr Cameron admitted his constituents received less because they were richer but said Liverpool had a  ‘generous’ settlement. Last week the BBC faced claims of bias over items on BBC Radio Four’s Today programme that criticised the Prime Minister and the Queen. Left-wing journalist John Pilger attacked Mr Cameron for mourning the death of Nelson Mandela despite visiting South Africa during the apartheid era. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has clashed with the BBC over its coverage of welfare reform. He accused the broadcaster of ‘adopting the language of the Labour Party’ by branding cuts to housing benefit a ‘bedroom tax’. In March, he said the term was ‘innately political’ and ‘factually wrong’. In 2012, he accused then economics editor Stephanie Flanders of ‘pouring cold water’ on good news. BBC political editor Nick Robinson said this week it had made a ‘terrible mistake’ in failing to properly reflect public concern over immigration.","Prime Minister made the comments on BBC Radio Merseyside .

I was stunned,’ said Ms Kondvar. 'We were devastated because we thought it was going to be mom and then it wasn't,' sister Joanne Chaney told WLEX. She went to the funeral director’s office hoping for . answers, but was directed to the funeral home in St. Maarten.

A Tory councillor who won £100,000 on a lottery scratchcard has been jailed after then plundering a widow's life savings of more than £154,000 pounds which he gambled away on slot machines. Shamed John Morgan was starting a five-year sentence after a judge described him as 'arrogant, self-deluding and shambolic'. The 75-year-old Conservative had an addiction for slot machines and squandered away the savings of Beryl Gittens, who suffered from Alzheimer's, meaning that when she died aged 92, she had to be given a pauper's funeral. Jailed: John Morgan, who stole more than £154,000 from widow Beryl Gittens' bank account after she had given him power of attorney . Morgan ruthlessly raided the bank account of Mrs Gittens, a friend of 30 years, after he was given legal control over her affairs when her memory began to fail. He had won £100,000 pounds on a lottery scratchcard he bought at a newsagent's shop in Swindon in November 2009. He was convicted after a six-day trial of the theft of £154,000 pounds, which he made in thousands of bank transfers and cash withdrawals as Mrs Gittens sat in care homes. He even bought himself trips to Las Vegas casinos with her money. When Mrs Gittens died in 2012, she was given a pauper's funeral funded by the local council, because Morgan had even drained her accounts of any money to pay for her burial. Speaking at Oxford Crown Court, Judge Mary-Jane Mowat labelled Morgan's actions 'shambolic and devious'. Vulnerable: Mrs Gittens had been diagnosed with dementia and had to be given a pauper's funeral . 'In my opinion there is no degree of trust higher than conveyed by an enduring power of attorney for someone with lesser mental capacity,' she said. 'There is no greater breach of trust than the abuse of that power to the benefit of the holder.' The court heard how OAP Morgan had . begun siphoning off Mrs Gittens' money in 2005. He had been given power . of attorney the previous year and registered it after medical advice on . her condition in March 2005. Judge Mowat said figures showed that in 2007 alone he took £11,000 pounds in cash and £26,000 pounds in bank transfers. This . money was going, unbelievably unless you heard the evidence, into . gambling machines,' she said, adding that his job as a car parts . salesman meant he often stopped and used slot machines at motorway . service stations. 'You even went gaming in Las Vegas, on two occasions, using Beryl Gittens' money,' said the judge. She . slammed his excuses that he was draining her funds at her own expressed . wish to deprive her in-laws, the Pagett family, of money if her son and . primary heir Roger Gittens died, as 'frankly absurd'. Roger Gittens, . who lives in Australia and gave evidence at the trial via a videolink, . lost out on more than £70,000 in inheritance, with West Berkshire . District Council paying a similar sum in care costs after Beryl's assets . fell below the threshold for assistance. Mrs Gittens was visited regularly by Morgan in the two Newbury care homes she lived at in her latter years. Judge Mowat said she took into account Morgan's 26 years of public service on councils including the Vale of White Horse District Council and Wantage Town Council, as well as charity work for Mencap. 'All this is in strange and stark contrast to the devious and shambolic way you handled Beryl Gittens' affairs and the way you attempted to pull rank at West Berkshire District Council in interview when your actions were discovered,' she said, adding that his justifications were 'arrogant and self-deluding.' She praised the efforts of investigation officer Detective Sergeant Rachel Jackson in uncovering the theft. Trial: Judge Mowat said Morgan's 'arrogant and self-deluding' actions didn't match the charity work he had undertaken. He was jailed yesterday at Oxford Crown Court . Morgan, of Wantage, Oxfordshire, shook his head as he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment, half of which is to be served in custody. He waved to his daughter, who was in court as he was led away. Following . the sentence, Audrey Pagett, Mrs Gittens' sister-in-law, said: 'He got . what he deserved. This draws a line under it. I am pleased for my . husband and sister-in-law [Beryl Gittens]. Mrs . Pagett, from Marshfield, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, was praised during . the trial, in which she gave evidence, after she alerted authorities to . the theft after Mrs Gittens' funeral and thorough examination of her . bank records. 'I just never trusted him, right from the beginning. It was just a gut feeling,' she said. The . court had earlier heard from Michael Roques, prosecuting, who said: . 'This was a long course of offending that continued even after the major . capital assets had been depleted and continued taking her pension, . resulting in cheques to the local authority bouncing right up until . Beryl died in January 2012.' He said Morgan, who wore a green . fleece, red jumper and black trousers in court, had received £120,000 . pounds from the sale of his half of the house he shared with his wife, . from whom he is recently separated. A hearing under the Proceeds of Crime Act will be held on 3 April to determine compensation and costs payments. Morgan . had maintained his denial of any wrongdoing throughout the trial and . even in interviews with probation officers prior to sentence. Lauren Soertsz, mitigating, said Morgan was 'a man of exemplary good character' prior to the theft. 'He secured for Mencap a building to use and has, in a real and proper sense, done good works for the community,' she said. 'He was a good friend to Beryl Gittens and I submit that his conduct does not detract from that.' She . claimed his actions were that of a gambling addict, which Judge Mowat . agreed with, and said: 'The whole episode is one that is causing . everyone in his family extreme stress.' Despite . this, Judge Mowat ordered Morgan, who resigned from the Conservative . party following his conviction in November, to just one year less than . the maximum sentence of six years.","John Morgan blew more than £154,000 on slot machines and trips to Vegas .

A Beatles fan travelled across the country for eight years taking photographs of all 131 Abbey Road street signs in England. From rural lanes to inner-city estates and motorway sidings, Bryan Eccleshall, 48, crossed the length and breadth of the country to document each location where the famous street name could be found. The centrepiece of his collection is a picture from Abbey Road in St John’s Wood, London, made famous by the 1969 Beatles album of the same name. With over 130 signs across England bearing the Abbey Road name, the photographer Bryan Eccleshall had his work cut out for him in his successful attempt to capture every single one. Pictured is the most famous one in St John's Wood, London, taken September 2003 . The iconic album cover for the Beatles album Abbey Road, taken outside the studio in which the album was recorded in St John's Wood, London. The album cover is said to contain cryptic messages about the band, with rumors including a long-standing conspiracy theory that Paul McCartney has been dead since 1966 . Mr Eccleshall said inspiration for the project did not come from the iconic album cover, which features the Fab Four using the famous zebra crossing, but rather the Abbey Wood area near his home in south-east London. He said: 'I was living near an Abbey Road. I’ve been a fan of the Beatles since my late teens and to be living near to an Abbey Road - not the one made famous by the album, but a different one - tickled me. 'I began to wonder how many there were in England, and thinking about how the Abbey Road made famous by the Beatles is a ""first among equals"". 'The thought inspired me to bring them together in a collection. I wondered if I could photograph them all.'

Mr Eccleshall from Worksop in Nottinghamshire started his project with the iconic Westminster Abbey Road sign in St John's Wood . Mr Eccleshall, a former publisher who is currently completing a PhD in Fine Art, set about visiting each Abbey Road in turn. Visiting . around 16 locations a year, he would often make detours during . cross-country journeys to provide opportunities to add to his . collection. He said: 'My partner was supportive . and patient. All the trips were done without a sat-nav system so . occasionally she would be the navigator. She didn’t mind adding time on . to a journey so I could visit another Abbey Road. 'Towards the end of the project we had a holiday where we took a tent and did 11 sites on the South East coast in one week. 'Many of the Abbey Roads had features . in common. The rural sites sometimes had ruins nearby - the original . abbey from which the road took its name. 'Others were found on council . estates, where the name was just a name and had no relation to the . surrounding area. One Abbey Road actually turned out to be a motorway . on-ramp. 'It started out as mundane as . trainspotting. But as the project grew, I noticed how the backgrounds . became the focus of interest - the gardens, the roadsides, the broken . walls.

The consignment has just arrived at the only British importer, but already most of them have been snapped up by enthusiasts more than happy to pay the £35,000 starting price. They are the last brand new campers in all of Europe. End of an era: The last new consignment ever of VW campervans arrives at Southampton docks .

They don't look much now, with empty . interiors and factory white paint job, but Danbury Motorcaravans will . transform them into luxury versions of the old classic. The . Bristol-based company has been turning the VW vans, officially known as . the Type 2 Kombi, into beloved campers since the model was first . launched in 1950. They have . already sold all but 20 of the very last batch and say it will be a sad . day when the last VW Type 2 leaves the factory. The end of production, due to new health and safety laws in Brazil, is now pushing the price of second hand VW campers up. 'These . are the only new vans in the whole of Europe - it really is an end of . an era,' said Jason Jones, director of Danbury Motorcaravans. 'The VW campervan is so iconic and so loved that it has barely changed shape in 60 years.

'We will be sad to see them all go but the smiles on the faces of the customers who pick them up makes up for it. 'It's impossible to collect one of these vans without grinning from ear to ear.

'Of course there are other makes of camper van but none will ever compare to the classic VW. 'We've even seen the second hand market rise because of demand.

VW campervans became an instant hit with travellers worldwide on their launch by the German car company in 1950. The original vans were called Type 2, following on from Volkswagen's first offering the Type 1, better known as the Beetle. The Type 2 came to life when workers at the German company's plant built a van around the chassis of a Beetle to carry parts around the factory. A customer visiting the site spotted the strange-looking van and placed an order for one there and then - and the rest is history. Production in the UK stopped in the UK in 1967 but continued in South America. From 1994 onwards Brazil was the only country in the world still manufacturing Type 2 campervans but production ceased in December on health and safety grounds. New Brazilian laws introduced this year state all cars must have an airbag and anti-lock breaks which are impossible to fit on a VW Type 2.

Boris Johnson is being lined up to return to a safe Commons seat in 2015 and mount an immediate leadership challenge if David Cameron fails to secure an overall majority. Allies of the London Mayor, whose popularity has been boosted by the success of the Olympics and Paralympics, played down the prospect of him making a Westminster comeback before that. Their comments came despite swirling rumours of plots against the Prime Minister and to install Mr Johnson. One Conservative MP, Colonel Bob Stewart, said two colleagues approached him before the summer break to consider a ‘stalking horse’ challenge for the party leadership that might open the door for Mr Johnson to take over. But Colonel Stewart told them to ‘get lost’. The Mayor infuriated Number Ten by going to war with Mr Cameron last week, criticising what he called a ‘fudgearama’ over increasing airport capacity. But a spokesman for Mr Johnson dismissed as ‘fanciful’ a claim that multi- millionaire Tory rebel Zac Goldsmith, who has threatened to quit Parliament if the Government goes ahead with a third runway at Heathrow, offered his south-west London seat to the Mayor. However, despite the denials from City Hall, the rumours about Mr Johnson's return to Westminster do not seem to be going away. Scroll down for video . Boost: The Mayor of London, pictured handing over the Paralympic Flag at the closing ceremony yesterday, has enjoyed a boom in popularity because of London 2012 . Running scared? The Prime Minister arrived back at No10 this morning after a jog, after news that Mr Johnson may be poised to challenge him . The two men were said to have discussed . the prospect of a by-election in Mr Goldsmith’s Richmond constituency . following last week’s Cabinet reshuffle, in which Mr Cameron sidelined . ministers who are opposed to Heathrow expansion. Mr Johnson did meet Mr Goldsmith and the . by-election scheme is thought to have been ‘jokingly’ mentioned, but the . Mayor is said to have dismissed it out of hand. Mr Goldsmith wrote yesterday on . Twitter: ‘I have never offered to resign! But I did promise before the . election that I would, if the Government U-turns on Heathrow.’ But MPs who want to see Mr Johnson in . Downing Street confirmed privately that advanced discussions had taken . place on finding him a seat for the 2015 election. Mr Goldsmith’s seat is not considered . safe enough because it is a marginal. Two that have been discussed by Mr . Johnson’s supporters are Mole Valley, where veteran MP Sir Paul . Beresford might be persuaded to step down, and Henley, the Mayor’s old . Commons seat. Mr Johnson has always insisted he has . no intention of trying to oust Mr Cameron and has pledged to see out his . second term as Mayor. But while he would be heavily . criticised if he tried to combine the role of mayor and MP for an . extended period, he is due to leave office in London in 2016. That would mean the two jobs would . only overlap for a year if he made a comeback at the next general . election. One rebel MP said: ‘The aim is that Boris is in place at the . next election. If Cameron loses the election badly, he’ll resign and . Boris will stand, but if he misses a majority again and tries to stitch . up another coalition with the Lib Dems then there will be blood on the . walls. We won’t let him do it again.’ Another rebel Tory, Nadine Dorries, said: ‘We need to get Boris in and Cameron out to survive 2015.’ But Mr Johnson said he was ‘absolutely . not’ planning a return to the Commons. ‘As I said in the election about . a billion times, being Mayor is the best job in British politics and . it’s what I want to do,’ he said.

The couple, co-workers at a Dubai McDonald's, were seen in an intimate situation in the lifeguard tower on Jumeirah Open Beach on December 17, The National reported. Despite admitting to police upon their arrest that they were a couple, the man and woman pleaded not guilty to kissing in public. ‘That was absolutely untrue. We did not kiss. My colleague suffered an asthma while we were seated there and I performed CPR on her,’ argued the man. The couple confessed to drinking alcohol without a licence and said they went to the beach at around 9.30pm after they had drinks at a hotel in Deira. They were seen by a woman who had been alerted by her child who said a man and a woman were ‘wrestling’ in the wooden lifeguard tower on the beach.

The son of disgraced former television chef Paula Deen has spoken out about the racism scandal that caused the Southern matriarch's empire to spiral out of control last year. 'It was a tough summer, but it’s made us stronger as a family ... We are good members of the community and our attitude is to learn from our mistakes and go forward,' Jamie Deen told Closer magazine. Deen, 66, had her show cancelled and many of her paid endorsement deals dropped last year as it was revealed that she used racial slurs in discussing black employees. Standing by their mom: Jamie Deen (seen left with his mom Paula and brother Bobby in 2012) has spoken out about the effect that the racism scandal had on their close-knit family . She retreated from public life for months and spent time with her family, including sons Jamie and Bobby who are also chefs and have been closely involved in her ventures. Breakdown: Deen, 66, gave a tear-filled apology on The Today Show and largely retreated from public life following the scandal . 'She’s always been true to herself and she can really brighten up someone’s week just by spending time with them,' Jamie said. 'She’s authentic. 'We look forward to getting back to work and persevering...We are going to have a big year in 2014!' Her official website suggests that the comeback is going to start very soon, as she is scheduled as headlining her own cruise trip starting on the 18th and heading to San Juan, St Thomas and St Maarten. She will then be returning to the U.S. a week later and has her next publicly advertised event in February as she will be signing cookbooks in Buffalo, New York on February 8. The former Food Network star has made only a handful of appearances since she broke down in tears on The Today Show while giving a public apology for the racism scandal. In September, she signed copies of her cookbook at her Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons. 'Yes I'm back,' she told a local television station at the time. 'Well actually, I never went anywhere. I just took a little breather.' Showing her face: Deen made her first public appearance following the scandal at the Metropolitan Cooking & Entertaining Show in Houston, Texas in September but there are many more events planned this year .

'I’ve been on the road for so long. So it has been wonderful to reconnect with my team and everything that is going on with my business,' she said. Her first official appearance came the weekend before that, where she couldn't help but cry on stage at a cooking show in Houston, but she said that they were happy tears. 'These are tears of joy, y'all,' 66-year-old Deen told the audience of 1,500 supporters at the Reliant Center. 'I've said all along that the one place I'd want to make my first step back out is Texas. Y'all's hearts are as big as your state.'

'Turfed out': Teresa Miller at her new home after being accused of anti-social behaviour for complaining about Susan Boyle's singing . Many people would pay good money for a private audience with a worldwide superstar. For Susan Boyle’s next-door neighbours, however, hearing her sing every day became a nightmare – leading to almighty rows and police calls. Teresa Miller, 40, claims Miss Boyle would play her own singles and perform karaoke at the top of her voice. Her favourites were said to include Wild Horses, I Dreamed A Dream and Donny Osmond’s This Is The Moment. Miss Miller said she complained, but in return Miss Boyle and other neighbours accused her of anti-social behaviour – and Miss Miller and her disabled ten-year-old daughter Daniella were told to leave their rented house by their landlord in October. The singer then rented the property and plans to buy it so she can convert the two semis, both former council houses, into a detached six-bedroom home. Miss Miller said the saga had left her in debt and depressed. ‘I’ve been through hell,’ she said. ‘Susan is a good singer but once she had a song out on CD she would listen to it over and over and start singing to it on a microphone. It would go on most days, one time until after 10pm. ‘Now I’ve been turfed out. I just don’t know why anyone would want to build a six-bedroom house in the middle of a council estate. Why take a house that a family could be in?’ Representatives of Miss Boyle, 52, deny that her singing has caused problems and said Miss Miller’s claims had been dismissed by other neighbours. The entertainer, who lives with her cat in a former council house in Blackburn, West Lothian, has amassed an estimated £22million after selling more than 20million copies of her five studio albums. Next door: The stars home and the one Miss Miller rented. One night it went on until 10pm, she claims . Miss Miller, a single mother whose daughter has muscle problems, said she used to get on well with her neighbour and voted for her on Britain’s Got Talent in 2009. But while Miss Boyle would sing occasionally, her performances became ‘unbearable’ after finding fame. ‘She used to sing Wild Horses over and over again. It sounded like she was doing a karaoke,’ Miss Miller said. ‘Something played the backing music and she would do the singing. She always used a microphone. Superstar: Ms Boyle now has five albums. Her favourite singles to sing, apparently, include Wild Horses . 'You could hear it all over the house. There was a Donny Osmond one that she sang for a few weeks. It would go . on, then off for a couple of hours, then back on. Everybody likes a bit . of music but there is a limit.’ Miss Miller complained to the council about two years ago. In turn, Miss Boyle called police to report her neighbour for anti-social behaviour. Last August Miss Miller was served two months’ notice to move out by her landlords Romano and Claudia Pacitti. The only rental in the area she could find at short notice needed furnishing and, in total, she claims to have had to lay out £2,000 on the move, much of which she had to borrow from family. Miss Miller said: ‘I was devastated. We haven’t spoken to Susan since. She’s got the full building to herself now so she can blare it out all she wants.’ As well as denying that Miss Boyle’s singing had caused problems, her agent said she did not force her neighbours from their house and had started renting the property only after they had already been asked to leave. A spokesman added: ‘Susan’s love of her home town has been well documented in the past. She continues to enjoy living there and enjoys good relationships with her neighbours.’ Miss Miller’s landlord Mrs Pacitti said: ‘We served Teresa with a notice to quit because there were three serious issues with that tenancy. It was a business decision and has absolutely nothing to do with Susan Boyle. ‘We had complaints of anti-social behaviour, not just from Susan, from other neighbours as well. Susan did not ask me to remove Teresa. I approached Susan. There was nothing underhand.’","Teresa Miller, 40, claims Ms Boyle played her own singles and karaoke .

Only 36 per cent believe Christie’s claim that he was unaware that a top aide orchestrated the politically motivated closing of George Washington Bridge access lanes, the survey showed. The voters’ opinions were particularly divided into their political affiliation. Only 34 per cent of Republicans and 46 per cent of unaffiliated voters believed Christie was lying — while 75 per cent of Democrats were convinced he wasn’t telling the truth.

'I was not a typical battered wife and he had never been abusive to me before. So it was more than shocking when it happened.' It was when the couple moved from Los Angeles to Tarleton's native Vermont that the problems started. 'He [Rodgers] did start to unravel the year we moved back,' she said. 'I knew he was struggling but I didn't know what to do or how to help him.' The couple, who had two daughters, separated but remained good friends. However a few days after an argument about the sale of their house, Tarleton woke up at 2.30am to find someone in her house. Before: Tarleton, pictured, suffered burns over 80 per cent of her body in the horrific act of domestic abuse . She thought it was a burglar, but soon realised it was Rodgers. He pushed her down on the bed and started beating her with a baseball bat so viciously that she could hear her bones being broken. Before blacking out, she called out to her daughters, then aged 12 and 14, to lock themselves in the bathroom and phone the police. Carmen Tarleton was left disfigured after the horrific attack but has now had a face transplant . It was then that Rodgers produced a bottle of industrial-strength cleaning fluid which he had brought with him, and sprayed her face and body. He then waited for the police to arrive and was arrested at the scene. Tarleton was in a coma for three months and lost the sight in both eyes, although the sight in one has now returned. In February 2009 Rodgers was sentenced to a maximum of 70 years in prison, 30 of them without parole. Tarleton's appearance was so shocking that news reports about her were given a 'graphic images' warning and she said that she found the way people were disturbed by her appearance upsetting. However last year more than two dozen doctors at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital worked for 15 hours to give the disfigured Vermont woman new facial skin, including neck, nose, lips, facial muscles arteries and nerves. Talking of her decision to forgive her ex-husband, Carmen told This Morning: 'Forgiveness is not about them at all, it's not about condoning what they did, it's about you, about your self-esteem and confidence. I have forgiven him and it's left me room to grow.' Since the attack, Tarleton has become an inspirational public speaker as well as writing a book, Burned, Blinded and Blessed, about her experiences. She also signed up for piano lessons, which is where she met her partner, Sheldon Stein. Carmen Tarleton suffered 80 per cent burns and the sight in one eye in the attack . Face transplant: Tarleton, pictured at high school in 1986, was only the fifth person to undergo a face transplant at the Boston hospital . Before: Carmen Tarleton, pictured, was a happy, healthy mother of two before the attack . Herb Rodgers was jailed in 2009 for 30 years without parole for the vicious attack on his wife . She described meeting the daughter of the donor Cheryl Righter, who died in February last year aged 56 from a massive stroke, as 'a blessing, a great experience, it's been great for both of us.' Cheryl's daughter Marinda Righter said that after meeting Tarleton for the first time, she felt a profound joy, as she literally was able to see her motherâ€™s features return to life. 'I get to feel my motherâ€™s skin again, I get to see my motherâ€™s freckles, and through you, I get to see my mother live on,' Marinda Righter said. 'This is truly a blessing.' Tarleton's life-changing face transplant was the fifth the Boston hospital has performed and the doctors said that Carmen can expect to regain almost full functionality in her face. In her book Carmen says that she wouldn't . take back what happened to her, insisting she is 'more blessed' now than . she was before Rodgers broke into her home and unleashed his anger. 'When life gives you a big negative . situation like I'd been through, if you can get through that, you can . really find all of the blessings and all of the positive things that can . come out of that,' she said. 'And I found so much that I would not go back. I'm so much more blessed than I was then.' While . she lay in a hospital bed after surviving what doctors called 'the most . horrific injury a human being could suffer,' Tarleton decided it did . not have to ruin the rest of her life. She had vivid dreams, including one where dozens of doors stretched around her and a voice said 'Life is a choice,' before the words appeared one at a time in white across a dark movie screen: LIFE IS A CHOICE.

Controversy: The drug has recently been legalised in parts of the U.S. Mental illnesses are triggered six years earlier in patients who have smoked high-strength cannabis every day, a study has claimed. Mental health patients who smoked skunk daily - which has a high amount of the drug's active ingredient, THC - had their first psychotic episode at an average age of 25, compared to 31 for non-users. Yet the damage was not limited to heavy smokers or those using powerful cannabis, according to the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London. Mental health patients with a general history of using cannabis still had their first psychotic episodes at 28 - three years earlier than those who never tried the drug. And those who smoked the drug before they were 15 put themselves more at risk, with their first symptoms at the age of 27 instead of 29. Dr Marti Di Forti, who led the study, wrote: 'Daily use, especially of high-potency cannabis, drives the earlier onset of psychosis in cannabis users.' The study was of 410 people aged 16 to 65 who were admitted to south London hospitals with their first psychotic episode. Scientists asked the patients about their history of using tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and other illicit drugs. Those who smoked skunk cannabis - four times more powerful than hash, according to seizures by police in south east London cited in the study - were at the greatest risk, they said. Psychosis means a loss . of reality and is associated with several psychiatric diseases, . including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Risk: Mental health patients who smoked skunk cannabis daily developed symptoms six years earlier . Dr Di Forti said: 'This is not a study about the . association between cannabis and psychosis, but about the association . between specific patterns of cannabis use... and an earlier onset of . psychotic disorders.' The report said age was critical because the teenage years and early twenties were when people developed professionally and educationally. Potent: A bag of prepared skunk. Skunk is a generic word for more powerful strains of cannabis . The study also found men were more likely to use cannabis than women, and also had psychotic episodes earlier - though both genders were at risk from smoking the drug. It focused only on people who already had mental illnesses. It did not try to establish whether cannabis causes psychosis on its own. Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse, said that was still a key question to answer. 'The thorny question is whether they . might otherwise have developed the disease or would have not had mental . illness,' he said. 'It's a distinction we haven't figured out yet.' Skunk is a word used to describe about 100 strains of cannabis which have higher levels of tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient, than other varieties. It was originally created by cross-breeding plants. The study was revealed in the latest issue of Schizophrenia Bulletin and follows the legalising of the drug in some parts of the U.S. Colorado has suffered a shortage of the drug just a week after it was legalised. The political battleground is still dogged by conflicting evidence. One study from the Netherlands found that people prone to mental illness may smoke cannabis to 'self-medicate', which could be why scientists keep finding a link. Politics: Labour changed cannabis from Class B to the less serious Class C, then back to Class B again, amid concerns including widely varying levels of the active ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)","Mental health patients who smoked heavily had first symptoms aged 25 .

A Florida teenager has died after smoking a synthetic drug known as Spice - and now his family are fighting to raise awareness of the dangerous concoction and have authorities acknowledge it caused his and many other deaths. Kurtis Hildreth, 18, moved to Wasilla, Alaska to live with his aunt, Kerri Stevens, and work at her family's commercial glass shop after graduating high school. But what was supposed to be a promising new start ended abruptly, when Stevens found him dead inside his room with a pipe filled with Spice and a lighter on the floor by his side. However, the state medical examiner and Alaska State troopers won't acknowledge Spice caused the November 16 death of the otherwise healthy teen and have ruled it a mystery. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Kurtis Hildreth, pictured died after smoking a synthetic drug known as Spice . New start: Kurtis Hildreth, 18, moved to Wasilla, Alaska to live with his aunt, Kerri Stevens, and work at her family's commercial glass shop after graduating high school. But the fresh start turned to tragedy . 'Whatever hit him, (it) hit him hard and hit him fast,' Stevens told Alaska Dispatch. 'The pipe was right there by his feet. He was a healthy kid. The lighter was right there. The pipe was right there. He never had any kind of heart problems or seizures.' Some of the partially burned 'Spice' was still in the pipe, but its chemical composition wasn't tested, the family say. Spice, gaining popularity as a legal alternative to marijuana, is actually a mystery cocktail of chemicals made in China and shipped to the U.S. where it is sprayed on plant material and packaged as incense or potpourri. It generally comes with a warning, 'not for human consumption,' however it is clearly positioned as a tool for getting high. Stevens and the teen's mother, Kelli Farquer, are certain Spice killed Hildreth, a happy-go-lucky teen. But the Alaska Medical Examiner's Office has listed his death as 'undetermined,' as in many other suspected cases, because an autopsy of Hildreth's body did not turn up any medical conditions. Dangerous: Some of the partially burned 'Spice,' pictured, was still in the pipe, but its chemical composition wasn't tested, the family say (file photo) Popular: Spice, pictured, is gaining popularity as a legal alternative to marijuana, is actually a mystery cocktail of chemicals made in China and shipped to the U.S. where it is sprayed on plant material and packaged as incense or potpourri . A toxicity screening of his blood, bile and other body fluids did not show any signs of illegal drugs or alcohol, despite some 300 drugs being tested for, including outlawed combinations of Spice. But Karen Dobner, founder of To the Maximus, a nonprofit anti-synthetic drug foundation, said the chemists change their formulas often, trying to dodge laws aimed at their product. In Alaska, packages of synthetic drugs have not tested positive for banned substances in months. 'It's not a marijuana alternative, and these newer chemicals have never been seen on earth before -- the kids are the lab rats,' Dobner said. But Hildreth's family are determined that his death will not go unsolved, medically. They've teamed up with Dobner, whose own son Max was killed in June 2011 after he smoked synthetic marijuana then ran his car into a house. Synthetic drugs are still largely mysterious. The number of people killed by the cocktails each year is relatively unknown because most Spice-related deaths are listed as undetermined or as a result of something else. Horror: His aunt, Kerri Stevens, pictured, found him dead inside his room with a pipe filled with Spice and a lighter on the floor by his side . Determined: Hildreth's family are determined that his death will not go unsolved, medically . In September, Colorado officials began investigating three possible Spice-related deaths. But there are hundreds of stories of both suspected and officially designated Spice-related deaths online. 'Currently only 22 of several hundred synthetic cannabinoids can be identified in blood fluids. They are actually looking for metabolites in blood, and it is a difficult and slow process to identify these chemicals,' Dobner told Alaska Dispatch. In Hildreth's case, the drugs themselves were not tested to determine their composition. Testing for the exact chemical composition in synthetic drugs can be tricky but it's not impossible. While synthetic drugs are metabolized by the body, they can be identified in the drug itself, which is the test Dobner and Hildreth's family want carried out. Farquer said the troopers told her they could not submit the drugs to the lab because there appeared to be no criminal intent in Hildreth's death. The mother is hiring a private attorney to get the drugs to the lab for testing. 'I know Spice killed my son,' Farquer told the news website. Meanwhile, the Municipality of Anchorage wants to get the drugs off the shelves, and is considering a new law that will outlaw possession and sale of Spice, not because of the chemical makeup but because of deceptive marketing. The drugs are sold in Alaska at local smoke and head shops, usually packaged with a cartoonish character and a name such as 'Dead Man' and 'Mr. Nice Guy.' 'They market this crap to 12-year-olds. It has Scooby-Doo on the front of it, smiley faces, SpongeBob -- I mean, that's who its being marketed to. It's horrible,' Stevens said.","Kurtis Hildreth, 18, was found dead in the bedroom of his aunt's Wasilla, Alaska home .

Neiman Marcus customers look to be the latest victims of hackers targeting credit card information from big retail chains. The Dallas-based retailer confirmed on Friday it had a cyber security breach in mid-December and an undisclosed number of customers' cards were compromised. It is not yet known how many people have been affected, according to ABC Local. The company says it is taking the necessary steps to notify customers with cards that have definitely been used frequently. Compromised: Upmarket department store Neiman Marcus has been forced to admit they have had a credit card data breach after the story was unearthed on Friday . Much like Target, who have confirmed some 70 million customers of their customers were affected by a hacking scandal in December, Neimen Marcus say it is only in-store shoppers, not online shoppers, that have been vulnerable to the data breach . Neiman Marcus issued the following statement over the issue. 'We informed federal law enforcement agencies and are working actively with the U.S. Secret Service, the payment brands, our credit card processor, a leading investigations, intelligence and risk management firm, and a leading forensics firm to investigate the situation,' the statement said. The hack was unearthed by independent security researcher Brian Krebs reported on Friday. The news comes on the same day that Target announced its December security breach may have affected as many as 70 million customers - not the 40 million it initially had estimated. Interestingly, the Neiman Marcus data breach happened at the same time as the Target scandal - mid-December. Upscale retailer Neiman Marcus isn't yet saying how many customers might be at risk, but it is confirming that a breach of credit card data took place. Also like Target, online shoppers don't seem to be affected, just in-store customers. Neiman Marcus says it's started to contain the intrusion and is taking 'significant' steps to enhance its information security. 'The security of our customers' information is always a priority and we sincerely regret any inconvenience,' the statement said. 'We are taking steps, where possible, to notify customers whose cards we know were used fraudulently after making a purchase at our store.' 'Earlier this week, I began hearing from sources in the financial industry about an increasing number of fraudulent credit and debit card charges that were being traced to cards that had been very recently used at brick-and-mortar stores run by the Dallas, Texas based high-end retail chain,' Krebs wrote.","Reports surfaced on Friday about an increasing number of fraudulent credit and debit charge costs coming out of Neiman Marcus .

Further, 'Pirate Zero' asked that authorities bring him a woman. Yarrr! Samuel Kenneth McDonough faces more than two years in prison for stealing a commercial ferry near Seattle . 'Pirate Zero' was later identified as Samuel Kenneth McDonough, whom, by all accounts, is in no way, shape or form a pirate. The incident happened on December 1 - McDonough's 32nd birthday - when he boarded the cruise ferry on the Seattle waterfront and set sail into the bay. Shortly after hijacking the boat, authorities found him adrift in the bay. 'When contacted by police SWAT-team officers while adrift in Elliott Bay, . Mr. McDonough proclaimed himself a pirate, and said he intended to flee . the country to Victoria, B.C.,' according to court records obtained by Q13FOX.com. Ahoy: The boat McDonough stole (pictured) is 480-ton catamaran worth about $8 million . 'The subject identified himself as ''Zero'' and requested safe passage . somewhere where he would not get in trouble for stealing the boat. Throughout the conversation, ""Zero"" made several rambling statements . regarding maritime law, piracy and international waters. ""Zero"" at one . time requested a woman be brought to his location because he was . lonely,' the court records show. Upon his arrest, police found a bottle of wine lying on the floor of the main cabin and bottle of liquor on a seat. McDonouch later told police that his plan was to ditch the boat in West Seattle or the Duwamish River.

Police told a press conference today that investigators found gunpowder . residue on a white, batting-style glove that Huerta was wearing and none . on the arresting officer's hand. Authorities say the officer checked the car at the start of his shift and found no weapon. However Huerta's family says the findings have raised more questions than answers, repeating their call for a federal investigation. 'Is this the type of police culture we want? The culture starts at the top, at the chief,' family attorney Alex Charns said, according to WNCN.com. 'Why was the family left in the parking lot without answers? Most of what they had to say today, they knew that morning.' On November 19, Huerta's sister called 911 to report him missing.

Cops said on the way to the police station, Huerta shot himself. An initial police report said the cruiser's internal video was not turned on at the time. The camera was started at 6.05pm when Duncan initially logged on to the system but he did not turn the camera back on after picking up Huerta. Officers said Huerta shot himself with a .45 caliber semiautomatic handgun but did not say how the teenager got the gun. The controversial case has sparked at least two demonstrations against police regarding the department's handling of the Huerta case. In one protest, officers used tear gas to disperse crowds that had gathered in downtown Durham. Police said some in the crowd threw rocks and bottles at officers. Grief and anger: Protesters held the vigil for teen Jesus Huerta who died in November while in police custody . Police line: Officers in riot gear shadowed the protesters as they moved from Durham's downtown to the police department and back again . Meanwhile late last month, a peaceful vigil for Huerta ended in violence. The supporters began at Durham City Hall and marched towards Durham Police Department, shadowed by police.

The crowd continued into the parking lot, some carrying signs that read: 'murdered by police'. Police, . some dressed in riot gear, used tear gas and batons to disperse the . crowd of about 150 friends, family and supporters as they marched. A coordinator of the vigil, Rafael Estrada Maya called for quiet and restraint. 'We are praying! Respect prayer! Respect the dead,' he pleaded over a loudspeaker. The crowd departed the parking lot and began to move back towards Durham's downtown area where younger members of the crowd chanted and threw firecrackers at the ranks of armed riot police.

Fewer than 10 days into his term as New York City mayor and Bill de Blasio is already defending himself after his first scandal: being caught eating his pizza with a knife and fork. A photograph of de Blasio using utensils spread across Twitter and prompted mock outrage among New Yorkers on blogs and news sites. Responding to the pizza palaver, de Blasio defended the approach, saying that his Italian ancestry is behind his decidedly un-New York pizza-eating style. Put a fork in him: de Blasio earned the disapproval of New Yorkers when he ate a slice with a knife and fork at Goodfellas, Staten Island . 'In my ancestral homeland it is more typical to eat with a fork and knife. And I have been in Italy a lot and I’ve picked up the habit for certain types of pizza,' he said. It's a method New Yorkers have variously described as 'blasphemous,' a 'cardinal sin,' and 'unacceptable' on Twitter. As any New Yorker knows, the preferred method for eating a slice of pizza is to fold it in half and eat it with your hands. The incident, already dubbed 'Forkgate,' happened at Staten Island pizza joint Goodfellas Friday, where de Blasio stopped in for lunch with local business owners. The owner of Goodfellas, which was a favorite spot of former mayor Rudy Giuliani, wasn't sold on the mayor's method either. 'I think he’s just trying to be polite,' Scot Costentino said. 'We’ll talk to him on the side about that,' he added. Hand it to him: de Blasio did eventually pick up his slice . Proving he is not a complete heathen, though, de Blasio explained that he likes to use his hands too. His method is a combination of the Italian and New York styles, he said, describing it as 'very complicated.' 'I often start with a knife and fork. But then I cross over to the American approach and  pick it up when I go farther into the pizza,' he told a reporter who questioned his methods, adding that the inquiry was a 'very important question.' Charles Greinsky witnessed the incident and is not letting his longstanding friendship with the mayor get in the way of what's right. One of us: Conservative pals Donald Trump and Sarah Palin made news in 2011 when they stepped out of Trump's presumably gold-plated apartment in Trump tower for a slice of pizza and proceeded to use a knife and fork . The American way: Both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama would win approval from New Yorkers with their pizza approach . He told The New York Times he loved having de Blasio in his home borough but could not approve of his genteel pizza-eating. 'No,' he told The New York Times. 'No. It's blasphemy.' Relenting a little, he added, 'He's from Boston. He doesn't know any better.' For the record, de Blasio ate three slices of smoked mozzarella and sausage pie.","Mayor Bill de Blasio had lunch at Goodfellas Pizza in Staten Island on Friday afternoon .

Fatal crash: Dale Smith, 51, and four relatives died after their small plane experienced engine problems . When Dellon Smith spotted the wreckage of his older brother's airplane on the side of a central Idaho mountain, he started running. 'It's hard to sprint in snowshoes, but we did,' Smith said Saturday, a day after finding the snow-covered aircraft on a steep slope at about 7,500 feet, bringing an end to a six-week search. 'I just wanted to run as fast as I could, and I knew it was a very sacred place to me.' After covering the 200 feet to the aircraft, he asked the rest of the 12-member search team to give him a few minutes alone at the site where a light snow was falling. 'You're just overwhelmed,' he said. 'You're just so happy to have found it, yet you're so sad because you found it. I just enjoyed the peace of being there, and finally getting answers for our whole family.' Bad weather Saturday morning turned back a recovery team attempting to reach the wreckage of the small aircraft that went down in early December, killing 51-year-old pilot Dale Smith, a Silicon Valley executive, and four of his family members. There were no plans to make another attempt Sunday, but a meeting will be held Monday to consider options for reaching the remote crash site and removing the five bodies, Valley County Sheriff Patti Bolen said. She said snowmobiles will be needed to reach the area, and various routes in the rugged terrain are being considered. She didn't rule out the use of a helicopter. The aircraft had been carrying Dale Smith, a software executive from San Jose, Calif.; his son, Daniel Smith and his wife, Sheree Smith; and daughter Amber Smith with her fiance, Jonathan Norton, officials said. The plane was flying from eastern Oregon, where the family had been spending the Thanksgiving holiday, to Montana, where Daniel and Sheree Smith live, when it disappeared Dec. 1 in the mountains 150 miles northeast of Boise. Dellon Smith, 38, a cargo pilot based in Anchorage, Alaska, and one of three brothers, found the crash site at about 2 p.m. Friday. Scroll down for video . Family lost: Members of the Smith family (left to right) Michael Christensen, wife Crystal Christensen (nee Smith), Nathan Smith, Janis Smith, Dale Smith, Craig Smith, Amber Smith, Daniel Smith and wife Sheree Smith are in mourning for Dale, Amber, Daniel, Sheree and Jonathan Norton (not pictured) Young couple: Amber Smith and her fiance Jonathan Norton were due to wed in January . A large, tracked vehicle carried the search team into the backcountry, where they spread out. He said he tried to take in the scene to determine how the crash might have happened, adding it appeared to have been a violent impact. 'It was very sudden,' he said. 'Since they were in the clouds, they probably didn't know what hit them. Probably a couple seconds and it was over. There was no pain and suffering for our family members, and for that we're very grateful.' Officials suspended the official search for the aircraft in mid-December, but an intensive hunt by family, friends and a large online community scouring satellite and other photos helped locate the badly damaged aircraft Friday. At one point, hundreds of online volunteers were pitching in. 'Every single one of them made a difference,' Dellon Smith said. On Friday, he spoke with Dale Smith's wife, Janis, and told her he found the wreckage. 'It's a real sense of closure to know exactly what happened and to know that they didn't suffer at all,' she told The Associated Press late Friday. Family man: The Smith family (clockwise from top) Nathan Smith, Craig Smith, Amber Smith, Crystal Christensen (nee Smith), Dale Smith, Daniel Smith and Janis Smith . Fears: Mr Smith, pictured, was flying over Idaho when he reported an engine failure on Sunday . afternoon . Dellon Smith said the search team dug away some of the snow to make sure it was his brother's aircraft, and he recognized the color from having flown in it. He said the team looked for bodies but determined that a professional crew would need to clear the snow to find them. The team focused on the site after a pilot thought he spotted reflecting metal and the online searchers began studying landscape photos of that area, Janis Smith said. Closure: Janis Smith is finally able to mourn for her husband Dale Smith and her children and their partners . Light aircraft: Smith was flying with his family in this Beech Bonanza, a six-seat single engine plane . Dale Smith had reported engine trouble and radioed for coordinates to possible landing sites, including a grass-covered backcountry landing strip. Shortly after, controllers lost radio and radar contact. Janis Smith said it appeared the plane crashed moments after the last communication. She said the plane had caught fire. Dellon Smith said he thinks his brother was trying to make it to an airport in McCall.

Arlene Saiz, 30, of Albuqurque, says she brought the dog to a . veterinarian Tuesday after it began acting strangely and was told it tested . positive for cocaine and marijuana – she insists she has no idea where the drugs . came from. The single mother claims the vet and police then coerced her . into signing a document that forfeited her rights to Maddie because she asked to . be billed for the visit. Taken away: 11-month-old puppy Maddie has been placed in the care of the city . Ms Saiz told MailOnline that she and her 11-year-old . daughter became concerned when Maddie become unsteady on her feet during a . walk. They took the dog home and it soon started twitching, shaking and having trouble holding up . its own head, said Ms Saiz, that’s when she rushed Maddie to the vet. ‘I thought something maybe bit her, I didn’t know what was . wrong with her.’ Veterinarians quickly told her otherwise. ‘She has marijuana in her system,’ Ms Saiz recalled being . told. The veterinarian went into the back and again came out. ‘Your dog has cocaine in her system,’ the veterinarian said. 'I don't take drugs': Arlene Saiz, the dog's former owner, claims she doesn't take drugs and didn't give them to the dog . The city won't give Maddie back: City officials refuse to return Maddie, saying Ms Saiz signed away her rights to the puppy . Soon police arrived and teamed up with doctors to force her . to sign a document saying she couldn’t pay for the visit and release the dog . into the custody of the city, she said. It was the only way to keep the dog alive, she says she was . told. The dog is being taken care of by the city, according to . KOAT. It has since suffered from multiple seizures and an infection. Mr Saiz says she asked to be billed for the visit. ‘I can pay for the dog,’ she said, adding that she wasn’t . provided that option. A toxicology report obtained by the Albuquerque Journal concluded the dog may have eaten cocaine-laced marijuana. The call center employee claims she has never done drugs and . will gladly take a drug test to prove it wasn’t her that gave the dog the . illicit substances. ‘I have an 11-year-old daughter, I’m a single mother, I . don’t take drugs,’ she said, adding that child welfare officials checked in on . her daughter, and even interviewed her without permission. Friendly: Maddie is very friendly and often played with Ms Saiz's daughter - the woman claims the dog tried to play with neighbor children as well, which may have led to a conflict . Her daytime digs: Maddie often spent her days in the backyard while Ms Saiz worked, the single mother believes someone spiked her dog's food . She has since tried to get the dog back, but the city isn’t . budging. A spokesperson told KOAT the dog wasn’t spayed or licensed – she . cannot have Maddie back. Police have declined to press charges, citing a lack of evidence tying her to the dog's drugging. When asked where the dog could possibly have found cocaine . and marijuana, Ms Saiz said Maddie is normally kept outside while she is at work, someone . may have spiked the poor pooch’s food. ‘I know one of my neighbors doesn’t like my dog,’ she said, . explaining Maddie tried to play with the neighbor’s children a few times. She also blamed a 'poop-like' substance the dog ate near an outdoor trash can, explaining Maddie started acting funny after eating it. Maddie will either be handed to a rescue agency or put into . an adoption program once healthy, a city official told KOAT. Ms Saiz is unable . to adopt any pets for one full year because she signed the waiver. Ms Saiz has hired a lawyer and is pursuing legal action to . be reunited with the dog.

When police tracked him down and breathalysed him, he was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 1.64 per millilitre, eight times over the legal Swedish limit of 0.2 millilitre. Breathalysed: An Asian driver was found to be eight times over the limit but was acquitted, with the court stating that how alcohol is processed is determined by ethnicity . He was charged despite the man’s friends telling police that he’d had 18 centilitres of whiskey since arriving home. The accused denied the charges from the beginning. When the judge acquitted him, he noted that it could not be proven that he’d driven his car while under the influence.

He was on his way to the bathroom when officers confronted him about the theft and after brief hesitation, he admitted to his crime. Ammerman confessed to stealing 'a large amount' of hand sanitizer containers each worth $6.65. The hospital is seeking about $80 in restitution. UMPC Altoona said that employees had to replace four to six containers daily in November and December. Ammerman doesn't have a listed phone or an attorney named in court records. The Mail Online contacted the hospital to determine whether Ammerman was ever a patient at the hospital or just a sticky-fingered visitor. As it turns out, Ammerman only visits the hospital for its unique beverages such as hand-sanitizer. A spokesperson joked and said Ammerman was just there for 'the good stuff.' He also said that the hand-sanitizer was 'non-toxic.'

Michele Bachmann has released a family portrait styled like the poster for Downton Abbey. The former Republican presidential candidate posted the picture of her family on her Twitter account but gave no explanation for why they were dressed in black tie attire or when the photo was taken. And considering the acclaimed series' fourth season premiered last Sunday, the reference is either five days too late for the first episode or two days too early for the second. Best guess: Congresswoman Michele Bachmann posted this family portrait on Thursday . The Bachmann's imitation of the Crawley family looks like a fair interpretation but two key components are missing: any staff and a grand manor house in the background. Instead of taking their unusual portrait in front of their Minnesota home, the politician's family apparently decided that the January temperatures were not befitting the bare arms that the ladies had as a result of their sleeveless gowns. Mrs Bachmann stands next to her husband Marcus and is flanked by their five children- Lucas, Harrison, Elisa, Caroline, and Sophia. The eighth person in the photo is Christine Griffin, who is dating Lucas. Inspiration: A large staff and massive estate were two of the missing parts in the Bachmann's version . Though Mrs Bachmann shared the photo on Twitter yesterday, it was actually her daughter Sophia who posted it originally to her Facebook profile with the caption 'Bachmann Abbey'. Many commentators praised Sophia's posting, saying that it was 'fantastic' and hilarious, while the comments were much more harsh on Mrs Bachmann's Twitter post. Some likened it to the promo photos for Keeping Up With The Kardashians, RuPaul's Drag Race, My Strange Addiction, Will & Grace, and American Horror Story.","Congresswoman Michele Bachmann shared this family portrait on Thursday .

Criminals might have to think again about attempting a getaway after police revealed their newest and fastest police car - a 207mph McLaren worth £240,000. The specially adapted two-seater supercar - which can hit 60mph in three seconds - will be unveiled at a car show in Birmingham this weekend. Although it is not practical as an everyday patrol vehicle, officers from the Central Motorway Group in the Midlands hope it will help to break down barriers between police and motorists. Watch out criminals: Britain's fastest police vehicle, a 200mph plus McLaren super car, is being unveiled at the Birmingham motor show this weekend . Speedy PC: Angus Nairn - star of 'Motorway Cops' - says the vehicle will teach people about the danger of excess speed . PC Angus Nairn - currently starring in the 'Motorway Cops' real-life TV shows - said: 'Everyone who see the McLaren wants to come and talk about it - it is an excellent way to get people to have a conversation with the police - and not end up with a fixed penalty ticket. Production: 2011 . Engine: McLaren M838T twin-turbo 3.8 L V8 - 616 horsepower . Transmission: 7-speed dual-clutch . Top speed: 207mph . Structure:  carbon fibre composite chassis . Max torque: 443 lb per ft of torque . Price: £240,000 . 'The car breaks the ice and gives us the opportunity to get across the safety message - especially about the dangers of excess speed. 'The McLaren is a very powerful car with a top speed of more than 200 miles an hour but it wouldn't be very practical as an every day police vehicle - there's not a great deal of luggage space and it has gull-wing doors that opens outwards and upwards so you have to leave plenty of space when you park.' The police-liveried car will be at the Autosports Show at the NEC in Birmingham this weekend before it goes back in the showroom. The car was supplied by local McLaren dealers and sales director David Tibbett said: 'We are delighted to help the police and their work. 'The police-liveried McLaren has some extras on and would cost around £240,000. 'We have sold more than 100 Mclaren cars since 2011 and buyers have ranged from company bosses to footballers.' The car - a Spider 12C model - is powered by a 3.8 litre twin turbo engine which develops almost 600 bhp - six times the power of a standard Fiord Fiesta. Luxury: The 207mph supercar is popular with celebrities, including David Beckham, and costs around £240,000 . But the makers claim it still returns 25 miles to the gallon - providing it's not driven flat out at its top speed of 207mph.

There are over four million passenger journeys on our London Underground services each day, with just 9.6 crimes for every million journeys. 'Pickpocketing is the most common type of crime experienced on the transport system and is tackled proactively by our partners at British Transport Police through Operation Magnum. As part of this operation, plain-clothes pickpocket squad officers, highly trained in identifying pickpocket behaviour, are out on the Tube network every day spotting offenders, arresting them and bringing them before the courts. 'We also have a network wide marketing campaign that is specifically aimed at advising passengers on how best to protect themselves from thieves. We are confident this continued partnership approach will have a long term impact and further reduce this type of crime.' The Home Office told the newspaper: 'Anyone coming to the UK must abide by our laws. EU citizens who commit crimes or abuse these rights are liable to be removed.' 'The most common crime': Britons were also guilty of stealing from fellow tube passengers . In October, MailOnline revealed that some Romanian gangs were using cheap flights to come to Britain to commit crimes. Up to 240 crime networks have been identified in the country by Europol, the European criminal intelligence agency. Its director Rob Wainwright said crooks are using low-cost airlines to target cities for one-day sprees. Thieves, credit card fraudsters and pickpockets buy cheap tickets to fly in and out in just a few hours. As a result police are almost powerless to identify those responsible. An estimated 68,000 Romanians live in Britain, but there have been 28,000 arrests of Romanian people for serious offences in the past five years. Mr Wainwright said his agency was facing ‘petty criminals operating across multiple jurisdictions’. He added Romanian and Bulgarian offenders are responsible for 90 per cent of all card-skimming in Europe. Government figures suggest the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK has gone up by a third in the past year. The number working in the UK rose from 91,000 in April to June 2012 to 127,000 during the same period this year. Both countries joined the EU in 2007, and from January 1 their citizens will have full rights to live and work here. France’s foreign minister has called for Romanians and  Bulgarians to be stopped from travelling freely. Laurent Fabius said there were security fears over crooks using the two impoverished countries as a way into the rest of the EU.","Of the 170 convictions between 2012 and 2013 52 per cent were Romanian .

James Middleton's cake and bread company Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £21,148 for the 12 months to March 2013, the latest accounts filed this week have shown . The brother of the Duchess of Cambridge has failed to make a profit with his food business for a second year. James Middleton's cake and bread company Nice Group London Limited made a total loss of £21,148 for the 12 months to March 2013, the latest accounts filed this week have shown. It means the company, which was set up in April 2011, is yet to post a profit, having lost £19,928 in it's first year of trading. The company also owes creditors £35,951. Mr Middleton meanwhile has had to ask his family for financial help for the business, according to the accounts. Under a section titled 'Creditors. Amounts falling due within one year', it reads: 'The bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director's family'. Mr Middleton, 26, a former public school boy, dropped out of the University of Edinburgh in 2006 after a year of studying to go into business. But he has so far failed to recreate the success of his parents, Carol and Michael, who made millions with their own Party Pieces venture. Mr Middleton last year told MailOnline: 'Nice Group is a start-up company and as you can imagine there are overheads needed to start a company. 'I made the decision to finance the business myself along with a loan rather than go to investors. 'This has its pros and cons, it does mean things don’t move as quickly as I would like but it does mean I keep complete ownership and control over my company. 'Further down the line I may look to open the doors for investors but I will see how things go. Mr Middleton, pictured with his sister Pippa, has had to ask his family for financial help for his business, according to the accounts . 'It is not uncommon for start-up companies to make a loss in the early stages of development and it is not something I am concerned about right now. 'On the contrary I am very excited as after running a pilot over 2012, Nice Cakes will be officially launching later this year with a brand new website and range of products which I am very excited about.' Mr Middleton has also spoken about Cake Kit, which he said had been nominated for four business awards. He has also described working 14 hour days and how he loved 'being my own boss'. Mr Middleton's parents, Carol and Michael, have made millions with their own Party Pieces venture . Nice Group London is registered to the family's trading headquarters close to their Berkshire home. It filed the accounts signed by Mr Middleton - the sole director and shareholder - with Companies House. The paperwork covers the company's second full year of trading. Mr Middleton is also a director at Nice Cakes, Nice Wine and The Cake Kit Company, all of which filed dormant accounts in September last year. He embarrassed the Royals in 2011 with a range of 'rude' products, including a 'stud muffin' cake featuring a picture of a man and the caption: 'A willy that wriggles and gives me the giggles'.","Nice Group London Limited made total loss of £21,148 in its second year .

Chloe Waddell, 16, endured 5am training starts four days a week as well as evening sessions in the hope of representing Team GB at Rio in 2016. But Miss Waddell, from Timperley, Cheshire, who had already represented her country in the sport, had a heart almost twice the normal size for a girl her age, the inquest at Manchester Coroner’s Court heard. Teenage Olympic swimming hopeful Chloe Waddell died after suffering from an undiagnosed serious heart defect . Miss Waddell endured 5am training starts four days a week as well as evening sessions in the hope of representing Team GB at Rio in 2016 . Just hours before her death on . February 3 this year, her mother Fiona told the hearing she had sent her . daughter a text congratulating her on winning a clutch of awards at her . local swimming club’s presentation night. She . was found unresponsive in her bed the next morning by her father David . after attending a party with other youngsters at a friend’s house. Miss Waddell had become unwell at the party after downing vodka shots and cider and . the alcohol may have interfered with her natural heart rhythm, although . she could have died at any time from the condition, the inquest heard. She had a heart almost twice the normal size for a girl her age, an inquest heard . Coroner Nigel Meadows, giving a . narrative verdict, said: 'There’s a combination of natural disease and . the unnatural effects of alcohol. 'Chloe . suffered from undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is a . serious heart condition which can lead to unexpected and sudden death. 'A combination of her natural disease . process and alcohol consumption resulted in her having cardiac . arrhythmia or cardiac arrest, from which she could not be resuscitated. 'Chloe had no idea she had this heart condition, you would not know and no-one was to know. 'It’s very likely, in my judgment, at some point Chloe was going to have a serious problem.' The teenager had competed in Olympic trials against Rebecca Adlington and had swum at the National and British Championships in the 200m, 400m, 800m freestyle and open water events. She had also been selected to attend British Swimming talent camps including an open water development camp last year after winning a bronze medal in the 800m freestyle at the UK School Games. Miss Waddell, a member of both Swim Trafford and Altrincham Swimming Club, had been at an awards ceremony the evening before, where she was presented with an outstanding achievement award. Her mother said her daughter did four 5am swimming sessions along with four evening sessions each week. After her parents accompanied her to the swimming club awards, Miss Waddell went on to the party at a friend’s house. Miss Waddell was found unresponsive in her bed by her father David after attending a party the night before. The inquest heard that alcohol may have interfered with her natural heart rhythm, although she could have died at any time from the condition . Mrs Waddell told the inquest: 'I sent her a text partway through the evening, she should be very proud of herself for the awards she got.' Around 11.30pm her parents went to fetch Chloe home from the party as she was feeling unwell.Mrs Waddell said her daughter was 'very apologetic' and, although she had been drinking, did not appear very drunk and was still walking and talking and awake. During the night Miss Waddell got up several times and had been sick in a bucket at the side of her bed.At around 8am her father went in to check on her. Mr Waddell noticed her lips were discoloured and she was cool to the touch. An ambulance was called while her mother attempted CPR and she was rushed to Wythenshawe Hospital but doctors were unable to save her. Karan Mahadad, a friend of Miss Waddell who . held the party, said around 15 youngsters attended and he thought the teenager had drunk a can of Strongbow cider and 'five or six' shots of vodka and . had later been sick. The coroner said that Miss Waddell  suffered from undiagnosed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a serious heart condition which can lead to unexpected and sudden death . She was taken to a bedroom to lie down and given water before her parents arrived to collect her. Dr Michael Scott, who carried out the post-mortem examination, said tests showed the alcohol in Chloe’s system was around twice the drink-drive limit when she left the party. He also said the teenager’s heart was much bigger and heavier than normal and almost twice the size it should be in girls her age. Dr Scott said her condition, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, only affects one in every 500 people and is caused by a mutation in genes. It is nothing to do with straining the heart through physical exercise due to her swimming. He said the condition can have no symptoms and it particularly affects young people because the heart grows quickly during adolescence. He added: 'I think she could have died at any time in the future.'

The widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev appeared in court Thursday to deal with motor vehicle charges filed following a traffic stop four months after the deadly attack. Katherine Russell, 24, has never spoken publicly about the April 15 bombings, which authorities say was carried out by her husband and brother-in-law. She has not been charged, although a grand jury looking into the bombings has called her family members to testify as recently as last month. Russell appeared in Wrentham District Court wearing a hijab, proving that she is still living a strict Muslim life after rumors that her family was pushing her to embrace Christianity again. She was facing charges of driving with a suspended license, speeding and driving an unregistered motor vehicle. She was stopped by police in Franklin in August. Scroll down for video . Facing the law: Katherine Tsarnaeva, widow of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, appeared in Wrentham, Massachusetts court Thursday to face traffic charges . Life before: Before marrying Tamerlan Tsarnaev, Katherine Russeel wore Westernized clothing and ate at fast food chains but followed her husband as he became more orthodox . The charges of driving with a suspended license and driving an unregistered motor vehicle were dismissed. Russell was found responsible for speeding, which will remain on her driving record. She paid $150 in court costs. Her lawyer, John St. Cyr, said Russell was stopped at a ""traumatic time"" in her life and may not have realized her license had been suspended. At the time, she was moving around a lot and couldn't get back to her home in Cambridge to get her mail, St. Cyr said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died following a shootout with police four days after the twin bombings near the marathon finish line, which killed three people and injured more than 260. When he met future-wife Katherine, she was still wearing Westernized clothing. But when they married she started adhering to his strict Muslim lifestyle, and even gave up fast food like Chipotle. Since his death, Tsarnaeva has been living with her parents in Rhode Island, and they have reportedly been trying to convince her to stop being so strict. Suspects: Tsarnaeva is the widow of Tamleran Tsarnaev (left) who died in a car chase four days after the Boston Marathon bombings. His brother Dzhokhar (right) will stand trial in the next year . His brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, has pleaded not guilty in the bombing and is awaiting trial. Russell was stopped by Franklin police on Aug. 21 after an officer saw a 1999 Honda Accord with Rhode Island license plates traveling at a high rate of speed. Radar confirmed that the car was going 46 mph in a 30 mph zone, according to a police report. Russell handed the officer her Massachusetts driver's license but was unable to produce the car's registration. She said the car belonged to her father, Warren Russell, and that she had been living with her parents in North Kingstown, R.I. Their plan: Police believe the Tsarnaev brothers triggered explosives at the finish line of the Boston Marathon last April, which killed five and injured hundreds . Records at the time showed the car was unregistered, but a spokeswoman for the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles on Thursday blamed that on a data entry error. A computer check during the stop also showed that Russell's driver's license, which was under the name Katherine Tsarnaeva, had been suspended for three ""surchargable events."" According to Registry of Motor Vehicle records, her license was suspended indefinitely, effective July 17, because she had had three accidents within a 2-year period.","Katherine Russell Tsarnaeva's husband died four days after the attack in a car chase .

The parents of a Virginia teenager shot by a neighbor when he accidentally broke into his home while drunk, have questioned whether he was killed in self-defense. Caleb Gordley, 16, was shot in the back by Donald West Wilder, who lives two doors away from the teenager's family in Sterling. Caleb's parents, Jennea and Shawn initially said they forgave Mr Wilder, but the release of a police report months after their son was shot has forced them to change their minds. Fatal error: Caleb was trying to sneak back into his home after drinking with friends when he entered the wrong property . 'At no point, from the . homeowner's ... testimony, the account of the events, did he ever describe . Caleb in any way being aggressive,' Mr Gordley told ABC 20/20. The autopsy report also showed that Caleb had been shot in the back, his parents said. Star: Caleb Gordley was a popular student and excellent athlete . 'If you're really in fear of danger of . your life and your family's life, why would you allow a person ... that . appeared to be dazed to you, walk right past you and then you shoot him . in the back?' Mrs Gordley said. The basketball star had crawled in a back window in the early hours. He didn't realize the house he had entered . was not his own, but one two doors away from where . he lived. After ending up in his neighbor's home, a drunk Caleb had tried to walk upstairs to where he thought his bedroom was. When Mr Wilder heard his alarm go off, . and saw a tall figure he didn't recognize, he grabbed his pistol and . confronted what he thought was a burglar. He . yelled out at the teenager but Caleb continued to walk through the . house and up the stairs, where Mr Wilder's girlfriend was sleeping. 'The homeowner said he made eye . contact with Caleb, and there was a dazed look on his face, so he knew . he was on drugs, alcohol, whatever the case may be,' Mr Gordley said. 'As he came up the steps, he said he saw no weapon, nothing like that.' According . to police reports seen by ABC, when Mr Wilder fired warning shots at . Caleb, the teenager turned to him and said: 'You just shot me.' Mr Wilder then fired up to three more shots, including one that hit Caleb in the back. Sheriff . Michael Chapman said that the incident needed to be seen in the context . of an unknown and dazed-looking intruder breaking into someone's home . at 2.30am. But the teenager's parents say their neighbor could have shot at his leg instead of aiming at his chest and head. 'He lined himself up at the perfect angle to . shoot a hollow point bullet through my son's lung and explode his chest . and then a fourth shot at his head for good measure,' Mr Gordley said. Loss: Shawn and Jennea Gordley have questioned their neighbor's actions in shooting their 16-year-old son . Close: The teenager lived in a house that looked almost identical to his neighbor's . No charges have been filed against Mr Wilder, who declined to be interviewed on 20/20. Virginia law permits homeowners to use deadly force if they feel threatened inside their own homes. 'Do I hate him? No. Do I want him put away? No, I don't think that's going to solve anything,' Mrs  Gordley said. The teenager's parents say they are still waiting for their neighbor to make an apology in person.","Donald Wilder killed Caleb Gordley, 16, after mistaking him for an intruder .

A Virginia court has ruled that the identities of seven anonymous reviewers who criticized a local carpet cleaning business must be revealed. In a decision that will strike fear in the hearts of all anonymous online trolls, an Alexandria judge ruled on Tuesday that Yelp must comply with the demand of Joe Hadeed's attorneys and hand over the names of the reviewers. Alexandria-based Hadeed Carpet Cleaning was the subject of several negative reviews on the site by anonymous authors - who Hadeed claims were not real customers of his business. Bad reviews: Business owner Joe Hadeed (left, with Virginia governor McDonnell) wants to sue anonymous reviewers of his carpet cleaning business for defamation . If he is correct and the customers are not genuine, Yelp's Terms of Service will have been violated, and the comments will not be protected under the First Amendment. The case began in 2012 when several negative reviews were left on Hadeed Carpet's Yelp page, some claiming the company swindled customers, overcharging hundreds of dollars above the quoted price, while others said their carpets ended up looking worse than before they were cleaned. Joe Hadeed could find no record that the reviewers were actual customers and sued the authors of seven negative reviews and subpoenaed Yelp for their identities. According to the Courthouse News Service, Yelp refused several times and was help in contempt of court. On Tuesday, the Virginia Court of Appeals agreed two to one, that Yelp must identify the anonymous reviewers. Yelp's Terms of Service requires that reviewers must have been a customer of a business to leave a review. Bad opinion: The company's Yelp page has seven negative anonymous reviews from 2012 which Hadeed says cannot be matched to any customer . The company does not require users to register with their full name, but does record the IP address of each review posted. 'The Virginia statute makes the judge a gatekeeper to decide whether or not thereâ€™s a common sense reason for someone in our position to get this information,' Raighne Delaney, a lawyer at the Arlington firm Bean, Kinney & Korman who represent Hadeed, told the Washington Times. 'In order for someone like Joe Hadeed to find out who these people are, he has to explain his case, and if he can convince the judge that there might be a real lawsuit against this person, the judge can then say, ""Yes, you can get this information,""' said Delaney. If the negative reviews were written by people who were never customers of Hadeed, he will sue for defamation. Small business: The company cleans and repairs carpets and rugs . The non-profit advocacy group Public Citizen that represents Yelp says reviewers should not have to reveal their identities when expressing opinions protected by the First Amendment and that Hadeed should have to at least prove that the reviews were false before the identities are handed over. Yelp's lawyers say Hadeed did not meet nationwide standards necessary to uncover the anonymous users, but the court disagreed. 'Yelp said that all the posts had different IP addresses, but how many IP addresses does one person have between all their devices?' said Hadeedâ€™s attorney, Raighne Delaney, to the Washington Times. 'It would be easy to create a number of different fake accounts.' In a 25-page majority opinion, Judge William G. Petty said, 'Generally, a Yelp review is entitled to First Amendment protection because it is a personâ€™s opinion about a business that they patronized. 'The anonymous speaker has the right to express himself on the Internet without the fear that his veil of anonymity will be pierced for no other reason than because another person disagrees with him,' Judge Petty wrote. However, the court said that First Amendment rights do not cover deliberately false statements and agreed that Hadeed provided sufficient reason to believe the users may not have been customers of Hadeed Carpet Cleaning.","A Virginia court has ordered Yelp to reveal the identities of the anonymous authors of seven negative reviews .
The reviews were left for local business Hadeed's Carpet Cleaning .

Lovers of honey miso salmon, it proposes, might like to inhale some sour og in between mouthfuls.Katsu curry, meanwhile, goes with blue dream.

Colorado and Washington are the first two states with legalized recreational marijuana, and Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada and Oregon will allow medical cannabis shops to open in 2014. Washington's recreational weed will go on sale later this year. Marijuana and cannabis-infused products are displayed for sale at a marijuana dispensary in Denver, Colorado . Pot promises to be such big business that advocates are planning voter initiatives for legalizing recreational use in several other states by 2016. As Colorado comes close to the end of its first week of legally selling recreational marijuana stores under revolutionary new state laws, official sales figures and profit margins have started rolling in. 'Adult use' pot is projected to be a $208 million industry in Colorado this year - on top of the $250 million projected to be spent on medical marijuana, Betty Aldworth, deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CNN.

An Oregon woman was sentenced Friday to serve 3 to 15 years in prison for dumping the body of her elderly mother outside a Michigan thrift store. ‘I understand I need to be punished for my poor decisions that were not sensible or logical at all,’ Kelly Rhodes said before her sentencing in St. Clair County Circuit Court. The 49-year-old from Salem pleaded guilty in November to manslaughter, fourth-degree vulnerable adult abuse and removing a body without permission of a medical examiner. Callous crime: Kelly Rhodes (left), 49, was sentenced to 3 to 15 years in prison for dumping the body of her mother, 89-year-old Mary Grania (right) outside a Michigan thrift store last March . Discarded: The corpse of Mary Grenia was found wrapped in blankets behind this Goodwill store in Port Huron about 10 days after she died . The corpse of Rhodes' mother, Mary Grenia, 89, was found wrapped in blankets behind a Goodwill store near Port Huron in March. ‘I love her and miss her more than I ever could imagine,’ Rhodes said about her mother, who died a few days after she and Rhodes were turned away while trying to enter Ontario, Canada, with a truck full of possessions. Rhodes planned to move in with a boyfriend in Canada, the Port Huron Times Herald reported. Grenia’s remains were discovered March 13, 2013 under a snow bank near a Dumpster behind a Goodwill Industries thrift store in Port Huron. Detectives were able to determine that the body had been there since at least March 3, but had been concealed by snow and blankets. An autopsy showed no signs of trauma, but medical examiner Daniel Spitz said Grenia's poor health could have been worsened by neglect. She died in the truck. Rhodes could have called her brother or put her mother in a home if she was unable to care for her, Judge Cynthia Lane said. Remorse: Rhodes, pictured in court during her sentencing Friday, has acknowledged her poor decision-making and said she needed to be punished . Instead, the judge said, ‘She didn't make the right choices.’ Defense lawyer Sharon Parrish said Rhodes took her mother out of a nursing home three years ago at her request. Rhodes was stressed out from caring for her and was looking for support from a former boyfriend after her husband died, Parrish said. Senior assistant prosecutor Mona Armstrong said Rhodes made choices that were shocking and cold. ‘The bottom line is: [Grenia] was not provided that simple dignity she was entitled to at her age and after raising this particular defendant,’ Armstrong said.","Kelly Rhodes, 49, was sentenced to 3 to 15 years after pleading guilty to manslaughter, vulnerable adult abuse and removing body .

Edward Snowden could put U.S. lives at risk in Afghanistan, say Congressmen who claim most of his stolen documents related to ongoing military operations . Two congressmen say a classified Pentagon report on former National Security Agency systems analyst Edward Snowden asserts that most of the documents he took concerned current military operations. ‘The vast majority of the material was related to the Defense Department, and our military services,’ not NSA operations, House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers said in an interview Thursday. Revelation: Two congressmen say a classified Pentagon report on Snowden asserts that most of the documents he took concerned current military operations . ‘Clearly, given the scope and the types of information, I have concerns about operations that would be ongoing in Afghanistan,’ Rogers said, as well other ongoing military operations. The ranking committee member C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger said Snowden tipped off U.S. enemies to spying methods used to defend the country, and potentially jeopardized U.S. troops overseas. They said the classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency found that Snowden stole approximately 1.7 million intelligence files that ‘concern vital operations of the U.S. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force.’ A lawyer representing Snowden said the U.S. government is exaggerating the potential harm of Snowden's actions. ‘There is not a shred of evidence that any adversary has seen any documents other than those that have been published by journalists who had access to this material,’ said Ben Wizner, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union. The classified report by the Defense Intelligence Agency found that former NSA analyst Snowden stole approximately 1.7 million intelligence files . House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers has attacked Snowden over his disclosures . Glenn Greenwald, a journalist who received documents from Snowden and reported about them last year for the Guardian, said in a statement that ‘the overwhelming majority’ of documents he had received dealt with NSA surveillance on the communications and online activities of American citizens and others around the world. ‘As every journalist who has worked with Snowden has said, he was adamant that we very carefully review the materials he gave us and only publish what is in the public interest, while withholding anything that would endanger the lives of innocent people or invade people's privacy,’ Greenwald said. ‘We have fully honored our agreement with him when publishing and intend to continue doing so.’ Quoting the classified Pentagon report, Mr Rogers and Mr Ruppersberger said the disclosures have already tipped off U.S. adversaries to U.S. defense methods, and hurt U.S. allies helping with counterterrorism, cybercrime, trafficking, and stopping weapons of mass destruction. They offered no specifics and none of the documents that have been published so far through Snowden associate Glenn Greenwald appeared to have dealt with current military operations. Director of National Intelligence spokesman Michael Birmingham said intelligence officials are continuing to assess damage from the material Snowden took when he left the country in June 2013. ‘We've been clear that these leaks have been unnecessarily and extremely damaging,’ he said in a statement Thursday. ‘As a result of these disclosures, terrorists and their support networks, now have a better understanding of our collection methods and, make no mistake about it, they are taking countermeasures,’ he said.","Former NSA analyst Snowden stole 1.7m files, two Congressmen said .

Forensic specialists have begun piecing together the remains of hundreds of victims from Argentina's Dirty War. For nearly 30 years, the group of scientists from the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team have been examining skeletons from all over the world including Che Guevara's who was executed in Bolivia more than 40 years ago. But now they have begun identifying the bones belonging to victims who died during the Argentine military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983 which became known as the Dirty War. Forensics have begun the painstaking task of identifying the remains which they have found in a grave . Around 30,000 Argentinians 'disappeared' during the period and were presumed murdered by the regime. The bones have been found in a mass grave at a secret detention centre known as Arsenal Miguel de Azcuenaga, in the northern province of Tucuman, Argentina. Luis Fondebrider, an anthropologist from the University of Buenos Aires, said one identification can take years. The bones are being kept in boxes which have the letters 'NN' which stands for No Name. Each piece of bone has been numbered and labelled in red ink.

'Then there is the second blow, when the scientist confirm the identity of a deceased loved one.' More than 400 members of the regime have been convicted for their part in the regime. Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team members working in a common grave found at the cemetery of Avellaneda in 1988 . The Dirty War was a campaign waged by Argentina's military rulers against left-wing opponents. It began when a military junta led by General Jorge Videla seized power on 24 March 1976, in response to a period of political instability and growing violence after the death of President Juan Peron. The military's aim was to wipe out left-wing terrorism but the terror carried out by the state exceeded anything previously seen in Argentina. Former Argentine dictator Jorge Rafael Videla died in May this year . Around 30,000 people disappeared before Argentina returned to civilian rule with the election of President Raul Alfonsin in October 1983. This month marks 30 years since the end of the dictatorship. Former Argentine military leader Jorge Rafael Videla died aged 87 in May while serving a life sentence for crimes against humanity. The general was jailed in 2010 for the deaths of 31 dissidents during the 1976-83 military dictatorship. General Videla had been sentenced to life in prison for torture, murder and other crimes in 1985, but was pardoned in 1990 under an amnesty given by the president at the time, Carlos Menem. In April 2010, the Supreme Court upheld a 2007 federal court move to overturn his pardon. Most of the left-wing activists were taken from their cells in the central city of Cordoba and shot dead shortly after the military took power. Gen Videla was one of 30 members of the security forces charged with the murders. Last year, he was also convicted of overseeing the theft of babies from political prisoners. At least 400 babies are thought to have been taken from their parents while they were held in detention centres. More than 100 children given for adoption to military or police couples have since been reunited with their biological families.","Bones belong to victims of the military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983 .

Charges dropped: Sexual assault charges against Midshipman Eric Graham of Eight Mile, Alabama have been dismissed at the  recommendation of prosecutors . A U.S. Naval Academy midshipman accused in a sexual assault case will not face charges, leaving just one of three original defendants in the case remaining. A Naval Academy spokesman said charges against Midshipman Eric Graham of Eight Mile, Alabama, were dismissed following a recommendation from prosecutors. Prosecutors initially accused three men of sexually assaulting a woman, also a midshipman, in 2012 at an off-campus house in Annapolis, Maryland. The woman said she didn't remember being sexually assaulted after a night of heavy drinking but heard from others she had had sex with multiple partners at a party. The men were all football players at the academy at the time of the alleged assault. The decision to drop charges against Graham was made by U.S. Naval Academy superintendent Vice Adm. Michael Miller. At an earlier stage of the case Miller also decided not to pursue charges against Tra'ves Bush of Johnston, South Carolina. Cmdr. John Schofield, spokesman for the Naval Academy, said prosecutors recommended Miller drop the charges against Graham 'citing no reasonable grounds to believe a crime of sexual assault was committed by Midshipman Graham due to the absence of evidence'. A major factor in the recommendation was a recent ruling by a military judge that statements Graham made during an investigation would not be admissible during a military trial scheduled for later this month. Scene: The sexual assault allegedly occurred at a campus off the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland . Graham had faced charges of abusive sexual contact and making a false statement during the investigation of the case. 'From the start, we have always been confident that the truth was on our side,' said Chip Herrington, Graham's lawyer, after learning charges would be dropped. 'We are extremely pleased that Vice Adm. Miller has finally accepted the recommendation of dismissal, based on the absence of any evidence that a crime was committed.' Ryan Guilds, a lawyer for the woman who is at the center of the case, said today that his client is 'deeply disappointed' Graham will not be prosecuted and that he is 'troubled' Graham is 'getting off scot-free.' The Associated Press generally doesn't name alleged victims of sexual assault. The third midshipman involved in the case, Joshua Tate of Nashville, Tennessee, still faces charges. Tate's court-martial, the military's equivalent of a trial, is scheduled to begin February 10.","Three U.S. Naval Army officers were accused of sexually assaulting drunk female midshipman in 2012 .

"By . Alex Greig . PUBLISHED: . 19:36 EST, 11 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:36 EST, 11 January 2014 . Young veterans are committing suicide at almost three times the rate of active-duty troops, according to data released by the Department of Veteran Affairs. The number of men under the age of 30 committing suicide after leaving the military jumped by 44 per cent between 2009 and 2011. The report found that the rate of suicide among female veteran had also increased, while the overall rate of suicide among all veterans was unchanged. High suicide rate: The rate of suicide among young men who have left the military is alarmingly high . Two young vets commit suicide every day, and overall 22 former servicemen and women every day. 'Their rates are astronomically high and climbing,' Jan Kemp, VAâ€™s National Mental Health Director for Suicide Prevention and author of the report, told military publication Stars and Stripes. 'Thatâ€™s concerning to us.' The Department can't pinpoint a reason for the increase, but Kemp said the pressures of leaving military careers, adjusting to civilian life, living with injuries sustained in combat and mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder all play a part. Suicide rates among vets enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Health (VHA) system who seek help are much more positive. There has been a decrease in rates among vets seeking care in the health system, and only five of the 22 daily suicides are in the system. Unknown soldiers: Veterans commit suicide at a rate of 22 people every single day . According to the report, the suicide rate among VHA male users decreased by 30 per cent, while rates increase 60 per cent among males not enrolled. 'Treatment does work,' said Kemp. The difficulty lies in getting young veterans to seek care for mental health problems, which are highly stigmatized. According to the data, the rates of female suicide reflect wider trends in suicide rates in women in the United States. In the U.S., the female suicide rate increased 31.5 per cent - the same rate of increase among female VHA users. Causes unknown: Officials say pre-existing problems, trauma suffered during combat, injuries, post-traumatic stress syndrome and readjusting to civilian live are all possible causes of the increase in suicide rates among young men . In 2011, veterans aged 18-24 committed suicide at a rate of 80 per 100,000. In the civilian population, the rate was about 20 per 100,000. For active duty personnel, the suicide rate was about 22 per 100,000 during the 2009 to 2011 period. At a conference on Monday, Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki said his agency needs to do a better job understanding what led to each suicide. He said that of the 30,000 suicides each year in America, about 20 per cent are committed by veterans, who make up about 10 per cent of the population.","The Department of Veterans Affairs has released data from between 2009 and 2011 .

An American football fan is suing the NFL over claims that tickets for the Super Bowl in New Jersey next month are too expensive. Lawyer Josh Finkelman bought two tickets for $2,000 each for the event on February 2, a price he alleges violates New Jersey's consumer fraud law. The 28-year-old has argued that the state prohibits companies issuing tickets to withhold more than 5 per cent of available seating to the public. Rule book: An American Football fan is suing the NFL over claims that not enough tickets have been released at face value for the New Jersey final . Mr Finkelman has claimed that only 1 per cent, or 775 of the 77,500 tickets, have been made available at face value to the public, according to ABC News. This means that fans are forced to turn to the secondary market to try to obtain tickets for the biggest event in American Football. The price of tickets is already out of reach to most fans, with the average cost is $3,432.90 according to TiqIQ. But according to Mr Finkelman's lawsuit, the price he paid was 'far in excess of the face value of the tickets'. The Houston Texas fan claimed he was redirected to a secondary sales site when he visited the NFL website to buy his tickets. 'I believe they need to release the seats at face value. Weâ€™re the ones who support the team, who buy the jerseys. We should be able to go at a fair price,' he told the Daily News. Diane Sammons, an attorney for Mr Finkelman, said she hoped the lawsuit would force the NFL to comply with New Jersey law, but said it was unlikely that a court will hear the case before the Super Bowl is held. Huge event: New Jersey's MetLife stadium will play host to the Super Bowl on February 2 . The NFL told ESPN it was reviewing the lawsuit, but pointed out that 75 per cent of the tickets were given to teams, which sell them at face value to fans. A statement from the NFL added that it 'would like for as many fans as possible to attend ... [but] we . can never fulfill all the requests for tickets'. The spokeswoman added: 'The NFL's Super Bowl . ticket distribution process has been in existence for years and is well . documented. We are confident it is in compliance with all applicable . laws.' According to the NFL every ticket distributed by the league is sold at face value. The NFL gives 75 per cent of tickets to the league's 30 teams, with 35 per cent going to the two teams that make it to the final. Teams hold lotteries among their fans to distribute their tickets, but Ms Sammons claimed they often offer them in expensive packages, adding: 'The Super Bowl has become an event . for the very wealthy.' Frozen out: Lawyer Josh Finkelman claims fans are being priced out of the massive NFL event . 'The New Jersey statute was . intended to stop that and to prevent all the profits to go to the . secondary market, which is what is happening,' she said. But TiqIQ's Chris Matcovich believes about 10 per cent of tickets will be sold at face value, and not 1 per cent like the lawsuit claims. 'The NFL isn't holding tickets back for the benefit of themselves, but for the teams and their fans,' he said.","Josh Finkelman has filed a lawsuit claiming NFL broke state law .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:32 EST, 27 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:56 EST, 27 October 2013 . California Gov. Jerry Brown has decided to allow freedom to a woman who received a life sentence when she was a teenager for killing her former pimp. Brown decided late Friday not to take action on a state parole board's decision to grant parole to Sara Kruzan, thereby allowing the decision to go into effect, his spokesman Evan Westrup said Saturday. Kruzan was 17 when she was sentenced to die in prison for the 1994 shooting death of George Gilbert Howard in a Riverside motel room. She contended that he sexually abused her and had groomed her since she was 11 to work for him as a child prostitute. Sara Kruzan: Riverside County prosecutors say they've agreed to reduce the 1995 conviction and sentence of Kruzan, who killed her former pimp when she was 16. Kruzan, now 35, has served 19 years in prison and is now eligible for parole . Looking back: At the age of 13, Sara began to be commercially sexually exploited, in 1994 at age 16 after George Gilbert Howard attempted to rape her yet again, Sara shot and killed him. She was sentenced to life without parole . Her case became a high-profile example used by state Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, who sought to soften harsh life sentences for juveniles. 'It is justice long overdue,' Yee told the Los Angeles Times. He called Kruzan's case the 'perfect example of adults who failed her, of society failing her. You had a predator who stalked her, raped her, forced her into prostitution, and there was no one around.' Kruzan's case garnered widespread publicity in 2010 after Human Rights Watch posted a six-minute interview with her on YouTube. The year culminated with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger commuting her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the possibility of parole on his last full day in office. Schwarzenegger said he still considered . her guilty of first-degree murder, but he sympathized with her defense . that the man she killed had sexually abused her and served as her pimp . for years. Clemency: Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger commuted her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the possibility of parole on his last full day in office . 'Given Ms. Kruzan's age at the time of the murder, and considering the significant abuse she suffered at his hands, I believe Ms. Kruzan's sentence is excessive,' the governor wrote in his commutation message, 'it is apparent that Ms. Kruzan suffered significant abuse starting at a vulnerable age.' This January, a Riverside judge further reduced her first-degree murder conviction to second degree, making her immediately eligible for release. Approved: Governor Jerry Brown has decided to allow freedom to a woman who received a life sentence when she was a teen for killing her former pimp . Yee's legislation to allow new sentencing hearings for juveniles sent to prison for life without parole became law in January. In September, Brown signed a second bill requiring parole boards to give special consideration to juveniles tried as adults who have served at least 15 years of lengthy sentences. Advocates estimate there are more than 1,000 prisoners already eligible for parole hearings under that new law. Brown's decision on Kruzan's case came nearly two weeks before the deadline for his action, Westrup said. The parole board was expected to act on the decision on Monday. Kruzan is housed at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla. Her aunt told the Associated Press she wasn't surprised by the governor's action. 'I just wondered why it took so long,' Ann Rogen of Riverside said.","Sara Kruzan was forced into prostitution at the age of 13 .

Uncertain future: Although Maria's birth mother Sasha Ruseva, 35, insists that she wants her daughter back she more likely to be placed with a foster family . The mother of ‘blonde angel’ Maria – the little girl who sparked an international investigation after she was found living with a Roma gipsy couple in Greece – stands little chance of ever being reunited with her daughter. Instead, the youngster’s future will almost certainly be with a foster family in either Greece or Bulgaria. The child has been at the centre of a global interpol investigation since she was found during a police raid on the Tabakou gipsy settlement near Farsala, central Greece, earlier this month. Officers became suspicious because she bore no resemblance to the woman falsely claiming to be her mother – Hristos Salis, 39 – or her partner, Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40. The pair have now been charged with child abduction. Meanwhile, Maria’s birth mother, Sasha Ruseva, 35, remains in Bulgaria, where police are investigating claims that she sold her daughter. ‘Given the circumstances of the two . women, it is extremely unlikely either will see Maria in the foreseeable . future, if at all,’ said a source. The Athens charity Smile of the Child has been appointed as Maria’s temporary guardian. A spokesman for the organisation, Panagiogis Bardalis, said Maria, thought to be aged about four, was coping well. ‘She seems a normal, happy child,’ he said. ‘She is playing, she is doing well under the circumstances.’ Prosecutors . claim Salis has registered ten children in Greece since 1993, sometimes . using a fake identity. Salis insists that she did not buy Maria . although police suspect she paid  about £850. Her large family allowed her and Dimopoulou to claim £2,370 in child benefit each month. Meanwhile, Ruseva is waiting to hear whether she too will face charges. Waiting: Sasha Ruseva with one of her ten children, who she claims is albino, she and her husband live with their sizeable family in a Roma camp near Stara Zagora in Bulgaria . She claims she handed over her daughter while working as a farm labourer near Farsala in 2009 but denies receiving any payment. Ruseva and her husband live with their nine other children in a hut in the Nikolaevo Roma camp, near Stara Zagora,  Bulgaria. She has insisted she wants Maria back. But Diana Kaneva, head of social services in Stara Zagora, appeared to rule out any reunion. ‘At a later stage we will take measures to protect the child and perhaps she will be placed in a foster family,’ she said.","Sources say it is unlikely that either Hirstos Salis, who was caring for Maria or her birth mother Sasha Rusevawill be able to see her soon, if at all .

"By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 18:58 EST, 9 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 09:38 EST, 10 January 2014 . A father dashed back into his burning home to save two of his five children. Three other children, including a seven-month-old baby, were killed during the blaze in Hammond, Indiana after the fire was started by a space heater. The children's 27-year-old father Andre Young is in critical condition after heading back into the inferno to save two of his other sons, aged two and six. The mother was not home at the time and the two surviving children are said to be in good condition. The fire broke out around 10:20 pm on Wednesday night. Family tragedy: Children's toys and clothes lay on the stairwell of a house in Hammond, Indiana where three children died in a blaze . Trying to keep warm: Fire department officials believe space heaters were to blame for a fire that killed three children Wednesday night in Hammond, Indiana . Firefighters found the body of 7-month-old Jayden five feet from the front door. Nearby lay the bodies of his sister, Alexia, 3, and brother, Dasani, 4, holding onto each other. 'That broke my heart,' said Hammond Chief Fire Inspector Michael Opink told the Chicago Sun-Times. Upstairs neighbor Jasmine rice said that she saw Mr Young running out of the house with flames coming from his back. He fell to the ground immediately and began rolling around in the snow to douse the flames. 'I heard him yelling, ‘Everybody get out! Get out! My babies! My babies,’' Rice said Thursday outside the charred two-flat rental house. She told the paper that after smelling smoke, she initially thought it was from something she left on. Then she heard someone scream 'Fire!' leading her boyfriend to grab their kids and escape the burning building. Possible causes: The Hammond Fire Department are investigating a house fire where three children died . Once outside, Rice saw her neighbor Young on fire and her boyfriend attempted to go into the family's bottom apartment to see if anyone needed help. At that point though, flames were already shooting out dangerously and he couldn't get in. 'The smoke, the flames, everything happened so fast,' Ms Rice said. Firefighters found at least three space heaters inside the house, including a portable propane-powered model. Investigators say they found a bed, rocker and piles of clothes - items that could easily catch fire if someone knocked the heater over. 'There was so much fuel for the fire to do what it did,' Opinker said. '\these kids had no chance.' Rice and her boyfriend lived in the unit upstairs and had let the Youngs run an extension cord from their apartment to provide electricity. 'I remember once they had had a propane tank, and it had, like, an open flame,' Rice said. 'I just thought, they've got all these little kids running around and that could get knocked over so easily.' Survivors: Three of the Young family children perished in the blaze but 27-year-old father Andre Young was able to save two of his sons . Breaking in: When firefighters arrived on the scene, they found the father lying on the ground badly burned. They had a hard time getting into the house since two doors seemed to be blocked with furniture . Tragic loss: The mother was not home at the time, and was informed at the hospital that three of her children died in the blaze . When firefighters arrived on the scene, they found Mr Young lying on the ground badly burnt. He managed to get two of his children out of the house, but the rest were still trapped inside. The fire may have been caused by a space heater connected to a propane tank . Firefighters had trouble getting into the burning building because two of the doors were blocked by what appeared to be furniture. By the time they finally busted in, it was too late. Seven-month-old Jayden Young, 3-year-old Alexia Young and 4-year-old Dasani Young were all pronounced dead shortly after midnight and found within six feet of the front door. Healing: As of Thursday morning, father Andre Young was still in critical condition but his two surviving sons were in good condition . The father and his two surviving children were rushed to Stroger Hospital in Chicago which has a burn unit. As of Thursday morning, the father was still in critical condition but his two sons were in good condition and even talking to each other. The mother was not home at the time, but showed up at one point while her house was burning down and was informed at the hospital that three of her children had died in the blaze. Chief fire inspector Michael Opinker said he believes space heaters played a role in starting the blaze, in an interview with Nwitimes.com. According to neighbor Nicki Flick, 70, the Young family had been living in the lower half of the house since last Spring, and since at least last summer had been living without electricity. Ms Flick says she heard a strange sound coming form the house one day and went over to find the mother who said it was a generator. 'She said,""Well, it's better than not having any lights""' Ms Flick recalls. She said she would often watch from her window as the children played with toy trains and trucks — always with at least one of their parents — outside their home. Sometimes an older son would push a younger sibling in a stroller. Other times the father would teach his kids to somersault. 'He was just very friendly, very boisterous with his kids … they would just hang off of him,' Flick said. 'They didn’t have any water in the house, but I never saw the kids grubby.' Living conditions in the rental property had been dire for months, however. Hammond city records show the electricity was shut off in March, and gas service a month later. Water service was stopped in October . Records indicate the building owners, Real Estate Equity Solutions of Indiana, LLC had not allowed in inspectors and ignored citations and penalties — including a $2,600 fine in August. 'We were a week away from getting an order from the court so we could go in,' City Attorney Kristina Kantar said. 'Obviously, if our inspectors found people living there without water or power or heat, we would not let them stay there.' Christian Bartholomew, attorney for Real Estate Equity Solutions, told the Chicago Tribune that he did not know whether utility services were connected at the house. City records show the property had changed owners in 2012. 'My client was attempting to coordinate an inspection with the city. I know there had been difficulty contacting the tenant living there,' Bartholomew said. “We are still looking at the situation, and we are taking it very seriously . Ms Flick remembers the Young kids playing outside, always accompanied by a parent, and how they would run to meet their dad when he returned home at the end of the day. 'He loved all those kids,' she said. According to fire officials, the family had been using propane to heat the home in the middle of winter. 'Unfortunately I see too many of these,' Hammond Deputy Fire Chief Kevin Margat said.","A fire broke out around 10:20pm Wednesday night in Hammond, Indiana .

Holly Thorogood's was unaware her boyfriend Martin was a sex offender - and she only found out when she googled him . When Holly Thorogood met 'charming, funny' Martin Haze in the bar of her parents' hotel in Torquay, she thought she'd found the love of her life . 'He was loving, caring - you couldn't fault him in any way,' Holly said on This Morning today. 'My friends loved him to bits.' But, as Holly was to find out, her devoted boyfriend was hiding a dark secret. Martin was in fact a convicted sex offender, who had been sentenced to six years in jail in 2006 for trespass with the intent to rape a pensioner at her home. And Hoyle – his real name – had been . jailed three times for using false names and failing to comply with the . sex offenders register after his release. His . true identity only came to light in March, a year into their . relationship, when his sister added Holly as a friend on Facebook. Her . surname, Hoyle, was different to Martin’s. When Holly mentioned it, her boyfriend said he and his sister had different fathers - something he hadn't mentioned in the year they'd been together. 'He wouldn't look at me when I asked him about it. He was being a . bit dodgy', Holly explained. Her suspicions aroused, Holly tapped 'Martin Hoyle' into Google. Martin Hoyle, pictured left, with girlfriend Holly, right, was placed on the sex offenders register for an attack on a pensioner . Nothing could have prepared her for what she stumbled upon. When she typed his name into the search engine, the first thing she saw was a warning, stating that the man she adored was wanted by the police. Holly found out that the man she'd hoped to start a family with was in fact a dangerous sex offender. Martin Hoyle was jailed for six years after he ambushed a 74-year-old woman in the shower, forcing her to flee naked. He also had a previous conviction for raping a 73-year-old, which was quashed on appeal . 'I didn't want to believe it at first,' Holly told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford today. In an earlier interview in The Sunday Mirror, . Holly said: 'The man I loved was a monster. As I stared at the police . mugshot of him in the reports, the true scale of what he had done and . was capable of hit me. 'It makes me feel sick to my stomach to think I was intimate with him. 'This wasn’t some fling, this was someone I was planning on spending the rest of my life with.' Holly immediately called the hotline number she found on the internet. In May, Hoyle was jailed for a fourth time for six months for failing to comply with the register and using a false identity. Looking back, Holly says she missed several signs that all was not right: 'Martin claimed to be a qualified labourer yet he could never find work. We never went abroad as he didn’t have a passport.' Today, she says she feels let down by the authorities. She said: 'His probation officers failed me. I don’t . understand how they didn’t know he was in a new relationship when he was . practically living with me. 'I could have gone on for years never knowing the truth.' 'Something need to be done, to protect people like me,' said Holly on This Morning.

Hip hop manager James Rosemond, who was suspected of hiring a robber to shoot rapper Tupac outside a New York recording studio in 1994, was jailed for life on Friday on drug dealing charges. Rosemond, known also as Jimmy the Henchman, was found guilty of using his record label as a front for an $11 million a year cocaine trafficking ring in the U.S. The 48-year-old, who has worked with stars including Jay-Z and Sean Combs, will now face charges in a separate trial that alleges he ordered a murder as payback for an assault on his son. Convicted: James Rosemond, pictured in his 2011 arrest in New York, has been sentenced to life in prison for drug trafficking . Rosemond was found guilty by a Brooklyn court last year of using his record label as a front for the coastal cocaine ring, the New York Post reported. 'This was astonishing in its breadth and duration and intensity. You chose that life and this is the punishment you get,' Judge John Gleeson said. The prosecution also condemned Rosemond, who owns Czar Entertainment, for funding his lavish lifestyle by supplying drugs to his community in Queens and Brooklyn. The record label manager, who managed some of the biggest names in rap, trafficked millions of dollars worth of cocaine, hidden in music equipment, from California to New York. His music business and drug dealing paid for a luxury lifestyle, with penthouses in Brooklyn and Los Angeles that he had to forfeit after his arrest. Link: Rosemond allegedly confessed to being involved in the 1994 New York shooting of Tupac that left the rapper seriously injured . Attorney Loretta Lynch called him a 'thug in a suit,' according to the New York Daily News, telling the court: 'Today's life sentence is a fitting end to the ""Henchman's two-faced machinations"".' Despite . his celebrity links, only a few people wrote letters of support for . Rosemond before his sentencing. None of them were his former rap star . friends. As well as the drug-running sentence, Rosemond must also stand trial over 'murder-for-hire charges that allege he ordered a 'kill' on an associate of 50 Cent who was said to have slapped the record label manager's son. Rosemond had also long been a suspect in the 1994 shooting of Tupac, who was robbed and shot five times outside a Manhattan recording studio. Celebrity status: Sean P Diddy Combs and Jimmy the Henchman in 2006 . Luxury life: Rosemond with Jim Jones at a party in New York in 2006 . The attack sparked a feud between rival gangs that resulted in the 1996 murder of Tupac in Las Vegas and 1997 killing of Notorious B.I.G in Los Angeles in 1997. Convicted killer Dexter Isaac later alleged that Rosemond had paid him $2,500 in cash and jewellery to rob Tupac outside the Quad Studio. Rosemond has denied any involvement in the attack, which his lawyer described as a 'flat out lie' to the Daily News. No one will stand trial over the 1994 robbery because its New York's statute of limitations has expired.","'Jimmy the Henchman' used record label as front for drug running .

Police were told a suspected illegal immigrant who was caught shoplifting could not be detained on immigration offences as the Home Office was already aware he was in the country. The 19-year-old Moroccan admitted he was homeless and living in the UK illegally when he was stopped by police after stealing two bottles of coke from Sainsbury's in Ipswich. According to police, the man admitted the theft but was not charged.

Ipswich Tory MP Ben Gummer has now vowed to investigate the incident. Mr Gummer said: 'I shall endeavour to rapidly find out the detail of this. 'If this is true it shows how much work we have still got to do in fixing our immigration system. 'We have never said it would be working in a few months, but immigration is down significantly.' He added: 'There is still a huge amount to do and this case shows how our UK border force is not measuring up yet to what it should be.' The 19-year-old was spotted taking two bottles of coke from a Sainsbury's in Ipswich (pictured) The teenager, who is believed to be called Imad Touri, was stopped at 12.30pm on Sunday. Police said a store security officer spotted him taking the soft drinks and hiding them under his clothing before fleeing. Touri admitted the theft to police and apologised. Suffolk Police have said they had spoken to immigration officials about Touri. Ipswich Tory MP Ben Gummer has now vowed to investigate the incident . Police spokesman Richard Jones said: 'On Sunday, September 8, police officers were called to reports of a shoplifter at a store in Upper Brook Street where a man had tried to conceal two bottles of drink under his clothing and leave without making an attempt to pay. 'The man was spoken to by officers and admitted the theft. Following enquiries by officers the Home Office was contacted who stated they were aware of the man and were currently making a decision on his stay in the country. The officer was advised the man need not be detained. 'As a result the matter was dealt with via community resolution with the man being banned from the store.'

Westminster's spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, highlighted security flaws at the country's ports and airports. In a report, the organisation found the database used to stop terrorists, dangerous criminals and illegal immigrants getting into Britain – the Warnings Index system – was deeply ‘unstable’. The report said border security was being undermined by staff shortages, while personal details on one third of the 106million people entering Britain every year are not handed over in advance, meaning nearly 40million do not undergo background checks before they land. The audit’s results came as MPs warned border checks in Britain were so lax that the country was at the mercy of ‘easyJet criminals’ who fly in and out on the same day without detection.","Police stopped 19-year-old Moroccan after he was spotted shoplifting .

Former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson has given his side of the story about his tumultuous relationship with former wife actress Robin Givens. In a new, no-holds-barred memoir, 'Undisputed Truth', Tyson writes that Givens and her mother had been 'on the prowl for a big black celebrity for Robin,' and Tyson, at the height of his fame in 1987, fit the bill. Despite having already dated some of the world's most beautiful women including Naomi Campbell, Tyson had chronically low self-esteem. Newlyweds: Tyson and Givens together in June 1988, just months after they were married . Fighting back: Tyson came from poverty to prominence as the world's top boxer in the 1980s, earning millions of dollars . Motley crew: Tyson kisses wife Robin Givens while Donald Trump and the woman Tyson called 'Ruthless', Givens' mother Ruth Roper, talk to the media following a press conference that Tyson called . 'My social skills consisted of putting a guy in a coma,' he writes. 'So maybe Robin was just what the doctor ordered.' Givens, a Sarah Lawrence graduate who was starring on the ABC sitcom 'Head of the Class', was well-spoken, educated and beautiful. Just 11 months after their first date, to which Givens arrived with her mother and publicist, the pair were married. He was 22 years old. According to Tyson, their wedding was hastily arranged because Givens, then 24, had announced that she was pregnant. Tyson writes that Givens' mother Ruth, who he referred to as 'Ruthless,' immediately set about finding the pair a suitable mansion to settle into, at Tyson's expense. During a close friend's funeral, Tyson received a phone call from his accountant, who told him Givens and her mother were in his office, demanding that he release $5 million so that they could purchase a New Jersey estate. Against his accountant's advice, he gave the money, and another $10 million soon after, which he placed into a separate account for Givens and her mother. Short-lived: Givens and Tyson, two days after their wedding, give a satellite interview from New York to Japan . New home: Tyson and Givens embrace in June 1988 in front of the New Jersey estate Givens and her mother purchased with $5 million of Tyson's funds . It was at about this time, writes Tyson, that Givens, whose slender frame hadn't grown in the months since she'd become pregnant, told Tyson that she had miscarried their baby. 'She was supposedly three months pregnant when we got married,' he writes. The pair married on February 7, 1988. 'Now it was June and she hadnâ€™t gained a pound, so the next thing I knew she was in bed and claimed she had miscarried our baby.' That same year, Tyson and Givens gave an interview to Barbara Walters. Tyson says the interview was originally meant to be a profile on him, but Givens had pulled Walters aside and told her 'that she still didn't have the truth.' Unplanned: Tyson looks on as Givens describes their hellish relationship to Barbara Walters . Walters, whose journalistic interest must have been piqued, asked Givens to join her husband for the interview. It would go down in history as one of the most uncomfortable celebrity interviews of all time. Givens began by listing Tyson's qualities, but quickly moved on to his deficits. He had an 'extremely volatile temper,' Givens told Walters as Tyson looks down, somewhere beyond the camera, his eyes wide with disbelief. 'He's got a side to him that's scary,' she went on. 'Michael is intimidating, to say the least. I think there's a time when he cannot control his temper. And that's frightening to me. To my mother. To anyone around.' Moving on: Brad Pitt narrowly avoided a confrontation with Mike Tyson when he began dating Robin Givens before the pair's divorce . Turning a new page: Tyson's new memoir gives an inside look at the many highs and lows of his life and career . 'Does he hit you?' Walters asked, neither woman looking at nor speaking to Tyson who continued to stare at the floor. 'He shakes, he pushes, he swings,' responded Givens. 'Just recently I have become afraid. I mean very, very much afraid.' Givens filed for divorce soon after the interview, but Tyson says they continued to see each other. Tyson describes how one day he encountered a pre-fame Brad Pitt at Givens' house. 'Dude, don't strike me,' said Pitt, 'don't strike me.' 'You had to see the look on his face,' Tyson writes. 'He looked like he was ready to receive his last rites. He also looked stoned out of his gourd.' Tyson and Givens' divorce was finalized on Valentine's Day 1989. They had never signed a prenuptial agreement and she received a reported settlement of more than $10 million. Following the divorce, Givens received bad press and one article described her as the 'most hated woman in America.' The pair have maintained a war of words through the media ever since.","Mike Tyson and Robin Givens married just 11 months after meeting .

A suburban Los Angeles town is outraged after learning a serial rapist is moving in - and they aren't going down without a fight. Christopher Hubbart, 62, dubbed the ‘Pillowcase Rapist’ after being linked to dozens of sexual assaults on women during the 1970s and 80s, has been cleared to move to a Lake Los Angeles home close to a park, multiple schools and a bus stop. The depraved man has admitted to 41 rapes, but said there were about 70 unreported, according CBS Los Angeles. He is being released into the area because he previously resided in Los Angeles, officials said. A very sick man: Christopher Hubbart admitted to raping 38 women, but said about 70 other rapes went unreported . Announced earlier this week during a hearing in San Jose, the conditions of Mr Hubbart’s release are sealed – people living on the street he is targeted to live on by the end of this year are not happy. ‘I have a daughter, so this isn't going to work for me,’ Bart Stone told NBC Bay Area. Also seen in a CBS Los Angeles report, Mr Stone stood in front of the house and pointed about 100 feet down the street to a school bus stop. ‘That’s where children get off,’ he angrily shouted. The home is within a few miles of two schools and only 2,200 feet from a nearby park – just outside the limits of Jessica’s Law, which prohibits predators from living closer than 2,000 feet to any park or school. Home sweet home: This is the Lake Los Angeles home officials have decided will house the serial rapist . ‘The bus stop is right in front of my house, with all the kids,’ Steve Villavicincio told CBS Los Angeles, ‘I don’t know what the heck’s going on with that.’ Markeisha Brooks, 19, pointed to three houses where children live, telling CBS Los Angeles that ‘a lot of children live around here… he’s a rapist and he can do it again.’ Mr Hubbart was put on parole multiple times, and kept raping women in both the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas, terrorizing the state with his deviancy. Furious: Bart Stone says he has no choice but to move if the rapist relocates to the neighborhood . Just a door down from a bus stop: 'You see that right there, past the PT Cruiser, that's where the drop the kids off' Mr Stone points to and explains . Officials are also united in their displeasure to dump the rapist in the community. The pervert’s most recent sojourn back into custody came because he couldn’t control his violent urges, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich told KNX. ‘He belongs in a mental institution, a state hospital’ Mr Antonovich said during a recent press conference, ‘he does not belong in a community with children where he will once again commit these crimes.’ ‘His past behavior is not a one-time occurrence where he made a mistake. We’re talking over and over again,’ Mr Antonovich added. So many arrests: Mr Hubbart was released into parole multiple times, and he assaulted women every single time - forcing officials to arrest and reincarcerate him . ‘They're taking someone who is not from here — who has a horrific criminal record — and they're dumping him in the [area],’ a Palmdale city spokesperson told the Los Angeles Times. ‘We don't think that's right,’ the spokesperson added. Palmdale is only a handful of miles from the home slated to house Mr Hubbart. California authorities are giving the public until Nov 29 to voice their concerns. A website has been set up for locals to submit comments. The modest ranch home was recently listed for rent on Craigslist. The ad asked $850 for the three bedroom, two bath house - it is no longer on the site. 'That's crazy': Steve Villavicincio lives next door, the bus stop is in front of his home, he cannot believe officials think the home is suitable for a rapist . Not in our neighborhood!: Residents are furious the predator is set to live only feet from a school bus stop and within a few miles of multiple schools . Mr Stone called the home’s owner during a local media report, furiously asking if he knew who the rapist was and asking why he’d rent to him. Other locations are also being considered, an official told the Times, but it will be in Los Angeles County. Mr Hubbart was first arrested in 1972 for multiple rapes in southern California, he soon admitted raping 20 women, records cited by the Times show. Only seven years later, he was released from a mental health institution after doctors deemed him a changed man. He was snagged again in 1982 for raping more women. Based on his own estimates, Mr Hubbart raped well over 100 women. ‘It really angers me,’ another local resident told the Times. ‘My wife and I are getting to the point where we're anxious to leave California anyway. That might get us to... move quicker.’ Mr Hubbart will be required to wear a GPS monitor at all times, an official told the Times. The monitor will be able to alert authorities if he violates the terms of his release by beng to close to a school or park, or even if he violates curfew. Still, that’s not enough to satisfy people living in the proposed area. ‘This is like a bad dream right now because I'm going to have to move out of this neighborhood,’ Mr Stone told NBC Bay Area . He doesn’t appear to be alone.","Christopher Hubbart admitted to 41 rape, he told authorities another 70 went unreported .

"By . Emma Parker Bowles . PUBLISHED: . 16:04 EST, 26 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:38 EST, 27 October 2013 . I am creeping through the streets of Compton, one of the most dangerous neighbourhoods in Los Angeles, like a night stalker. Wearing military fatigues and a bullet-proof vest, and brandishing my weapon, I dash behind a tree. There is a helicopter circling overhead, its beam illuminating the neighbourhood. Suddenly, I spot my target darting behind a huge metal industrial rubbish bin. I approach slowly and as I shine my torch down the narrow gap, I realise I have him cornered. I can see the whites of his eyes, glowing like orbs in the darkness, as he cowers and trembles in the corner. My target is a brown terrier mongrel. Now I have to catch him and just hope that he doesn’t bite. Best freinds: Emma Parker Bowles walks with two of her canine companions . So I start yawning and licking my lips as I get closer. I went on an  animal behaviour course and this  is apparently one way to relax a  dog. But as I do it, I feel like a  total maniac. As I crawl on my hands and knees through smelly litter with a cheeseburger in my mouth, this isn’t what I imagined I would be doing when I moved to Los Angeles four years ago. I am an animal rescuer. Like a demented Snow White, I will take in any creature great or small that is in  distress or homeless. I  will rehabilitate the creature and then find it a  new home. From featherless chickens from a butcher to a box of kittens, my home is a revolving door. (Matilda, Gertrude and Fergus the chickens are all living happily on a ranch and their feathers have grown back, I am happy to report). But rescuing dogs is my greatest passion. At the moment there are four of my own dogs, three foster dogs – a mum and her puppies – plus a mini boa constrictor (found in an air-conditioning vent) co-habiting in my house. I have a big garden, so don’t think I am a hoarder. I volunteer with a charity called Dogs Without Borders and we save animals from ‘death row’ in the Los Angeles dog pounds, and strays off the street. They are placed in loving foster homes until we find them a perfect ‘forever home’. Our pack leader is my friend Galit, who started Dogs Without Borders after Hurricane Katrina to help some of the abandoned dogs in New  Orleans. We also rescue dogs from  as far away as Taiwan. However, most of  are from the Los Angeles area. About 200 perfectly healthy dogs are euthanised in Los Angeles County every week. And, across the United States, millions are put down each year. About 50 per cent of all  the ‘owner surrenders’ or strays  are pedigrees. The most common reasons given for dogs being dumped is moving to a house that doesn’t allow pets or, after buying a cute puppy, ‘it got bigger than we thought it would’. If a stray dog comes in, by law it has to be held for 72 hours to give the owners a chance to be reunited. About 200 perfectly healthy dogs are euthanised in Los Angeles County every week . However, there is a 90 per cent chance that these dogs will be put to sleep. When the pound does a cull because of overcrowding, the strays are the first to be killed. The dog pounds, which we visit about three times a week to rescue dogs from death row, are the saddest places I have ever been to. After four years, I still cry when I’m there. The staff do their best but they are overwhelmed. The dogs are confined to small kennels/runs with about 25 other barking or crying animals, and they have to relieve themselves where they eat and sleep. They are depressed and sad, and cry constantly for the family that abandoned them. They don’t get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under their kennel door and their waste sprayed out with a high-powered hose. If the dog is big, black or any of the ‘bully’ breeds (pitbull, rottweiler, mastiff etc), it is pretty much dead when it walks through the door. The most heartbreaking part is when they are taken to be put down. The dogs get excited when they see the leash, thinking they are going for a walk, and trot off happily, wagging their tails. Until, that is, they get to The Room. One shelter manager says: ‘Every one of them freaks out and puts on the brakes when we get to the door. ‘It must smell like death or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there. It’s strange, but it happens with every one of them.’ The dog is then restrained and held down by one or two veterinary technicians depending on their size and how freaked out they are. A euthanasia technician or a vet starts the process. They find a vein in a front leg and inject a lethal dose of the ‘pink stuff’. If the dog panics from being restrained and jerks, the needle can tear out of a leg. ‘I’ve seen needles comes out and I’ve been covered with the resulting blood, and been deafened by the yelps and screams,’ says the manager. ‘They all don’t just go to sleep. Sometimes they spasm for a while, gasp for air and defecate.’ I know this is heartbreaking to any dog lover and I am sorry for being graphic. But on a happier note, there are about 100 animal rescue groups in the Los Angeles area that go into these shelters, take as many animals as possible and then find them loving homes. We are very strict about who can adopt – there’s a process everyone must go through to make sure we match the right dog with the right person. And we always do a ‘home check’ to make sure that it is a suitable environment. Adopters have to sign a contract, which includes the guarantee that if they ever give up the dog, they return it to us and not to the pound. For me, there is no better feeling than saving a dog from the pound, rehabilitating it and then watching it go to its forever home. The dog pounds, which we visit about three times a week to rescue dogs from death row, are the saddest places I have ever been to . My most recent case was an  emaciated Old English Bulldog, who had given birth to three litters before being dumped on the street by her owners. She ended up at a shelter and when I took her she had only three hours left to live. She had calluses from lying on a cement floor and had chewed the end of her tail off from the stress. I called her Rosebud because with a lot of love (and food) she blossomed like a rose in the sun. She now lives with a couple who adore her, and they send me photographs of Rosebud, who goes fishing and camping, and lies in the sun snoring. I have added to my own pack a deaf and blind-in-one-eye dog called Little Moon, who came from a situation that even made the headlines back in the UK – 137 dogs were seized from an animal hoarder. It is not just America that has a stray dog problem. About 9,000  strays were ‘put to sleep’ in the UK last year, according to the Dogs Trust. The charity found that 111,986 stray and abandoned dogs were picked up by local authority teams  across the UK in the last year – that’s more than 300 every day. Happily, microchips have saved the lives of more than 8,000 dogs in the past year by reuniting them with their owners. If your dog isn’t microchipped, I would strongly recommend it. If your dog isn't microchipped, I would strongly recommend it . The device is only the size of a grain of rice and is implanted under the skin. My dogs even have a  GPS tracking device attached to their collars and if any of them escaped or were stolen I could track them with an app on my phone.  Neurotic? Maybe, but it’s better to be safe than sorry. The best thing you could do, of course, is to rescue a dog rather than buy one. Anyone who has a rescue dog knows they are the best type. They always know you have saved them, and they will love you with every fibre of their being. My first dog was Wally, a lurcher I got from Battersea Dogs Home (which never kills dogs). He was my heart and when he died I thought it was the end of the world. I miss him every day. If I hadn’t rescued Wally, I would never have ended up in dog rescue. So every one I save partly owes their lives to the love of mine. As the Buddhist saying goes: ‘Hearts are meant to be broken. That is how they open.’ Since Wally, I have fallen in love a hundred more times – and I’ve had my heart broken a thousand more. I have cried into the fur of a lifeless body and witnessed the result of horrific cruelty. But the happiness by far outweighs the sadness. I am not some sanctimonious do-gooder who has no life outside of dog rescue. I don’t think there is a special place for me in heaven because of what I do. I just feel blessed that I have found my little niche in life. It compels me and defines me, and makes me happy. Some people think my  passion for animals is sad and I  must be crazy to love my dogs like people love their children. But just because I didn’t give birth to them, doesn’t mean I should love them less. I don’t really give a fig what those people think. People who love dogs are my kind of people. We are from the same tribe. If you don’t like dogs, then the chances are that I won’t like you. I definitely wouldn’t date you. It’s a deal-breaker. But then you wouldn’t want to date me either – and would be horrified with sharing the bed with three dogs.","Emma Parker Bowles describes herself as a 'demented Snow White'

A Silicon Valley software executive and five of his family members have been found dead more than a month after his plane vanished in the Idaho wilderness. Dale Smith vanished after reporting engine problems as he flew himself, his son and daughter-in-law, his daughter and her fiance from Oregon to Montana after Thanksgiving on December 1. The wreckage of the plane was found on Friday with no survivors. Rescuers said all five victims perished in the crash and were not stranded in the wilderness. The single-engine plane was piloted by 51-year-old Dale Smith, a software executive from San Jose, California. Also on board were Smith's son, Daniel Smith and his wife, Sheree Smith, daughter Amber Smith and her fiance, Jonathon Norton. The plane was flying from eastern Oregon to Montana on December 1 when it disappeared in mountains 150 miles northeast of Boise. Authorities had suspended the search for the plane in mid-December but groups of volunteers continued to search for the family members. Dale Smith's brother Dellon Smith, also a pilot, was the one to find the plane. In a Facebook post, Dale Smith's wife Janis told friends that the plane had been found and thanked all the volunteers who searched. 'Less than two hours before they needed to wrap up the search for the foreseeable future, Dellon and Arthur found the plane,' she wrote. Scroll down for video .

'I am so grateful that Dellon was the one who found his brother. The plane is in pieces and buried in snow. They have not yet found all the parts. However, we do know my family members on the plane died quickly and painlessly. They did not suffer.' The recovery effort may be delayed due to a severe storm coming in, according to the sheriff's office. The official search for the plane was called off on December 12 due to increasingly hostile weather conditions, but volunteers kept looking. Dellon Smith and others set out on a . four-day search Wednesday, a last-ditch effort to find the plane before . winter set in and the search had to be abandoned until spring. Rand Kriech, who co-founded company SerialTek with Smith in 2007, said he got a call Friday evening, telling him the wreckage had been found. The private search involved hundreds of online volunteers analyzing satellite images of the terrain, looking for clues like damaged trees that might indicate a crash site, and posting that information back to a search website, Kriech said in a telephone interview. Search teams then checked promising sites. 'They were just getting ready to close up today, checking one last site - and sure enough,' Kriech said. 'It's simply amazing that so many people were volunteering so much of their time to bring the family peace,' he said. 'It's just really hard to get closure if you don't have any information.'

Friends and family said the Mormon engineer, who lived with his large family in San Jose, California, was an experienced and safe pilot. The family had spent Thanksgiving together in Oregon just before the accident. Closure: Janis Smith is finally able to mourn for her husband Dale Smith and her children and their partners . Light aircraft: Smith was flying with his family in this Beech Bonanza, a six-seat single engine plane . Fellow pilots told KTVU at the time that they were hopeful the plane had landed safely and was simply out of reach of cell phone coverage. 'We have no idea what the status of things is right now,' Valley County Shieriff's Lt. Dan Smith said. 'They could have landed safely somewhere and just can't communicate.' Smith was taking his adult son to Montana following the Thanksgiving weekend. Rand Kriech, who co-founded a hardware and software company, SerialTek, with Smith, said his friend was an excellent pilot. 'He's one of the safest pilots I know. A very cautious pilot,' Kriech told NBC. 'Have no fear of flying with him at all. I'm a pilot myself and I really appreciate somebody that takes as much care as Dale.'

Detective searching for Mason Cox and David Wood, both 20, are baffled by their disappearance more than a week ago. They were last seen on Thursday January 2 before they headed to Lake Lanier in Dawsonville, Georgia, about 60 miles north of Atlanta. Mystery: David Wood, left, and Mason Cox, right, vanished on a late-night fishing trip . But their fishing equipment had been left behind and they both left personal belongings at Mr Cox's family home. Police have no evidence of foul play but have been using cadaver dogs, specially trained to follow the scent of bodies, to scour the area where they were last seen. Dawson County's Sheriff's Major Tony Wooten told DawsonNews.com: 'At this point, we don't suspect foul play.

City Mayor Michael Bloomberg after his wife found a container in their . refrigerator filled with what appeared to be ricin. According to the New York Post, Richardson was released on Friday after authorities didn't have enough evidence to hold him but a source said that he is 'still a suspect.' Guess is a civilian employee of the Department of Defense who works at the Red River Army Depot. His . wife told officers that as well as the . container in the fridge, she also found internet searches related to . ricin production, Obama and Bloomberg on their computer. The husband is now saying that he was set up by the woman and he claimed that the plot was her idea during questioning. The Post reports that both will take polygraph tests.

Model and actress: However Nathaniel Richardson did blame his wife Shannon Guess for the alleged plot against Mayor Bloomberg during his questioning by the FBI . Couple: His wife also allegedly found searches for Obama, Bloomberg and ricin production on their computer . The . development comes two days after it emerged that Bloomberg and his . anti-gun group were sent two ricin-laced letters. On Thursday, it was . revealed that another, identical letter was sent to Obama. Neighbors said Richardson worked at the Red River Army Depot, which was once used as an ammunition storage facility, and which now repairs Humvees and other military vehicles. It comes after one of the ricin-tainted letters intended for Bloomberg was pictured for the first time. The envelope shows the letter, posted . on May 20, was postmarked at Shreveport, Louisiana, where other letters . intended for Mayor Bloomberg and President Obama were also handled. Sources said that Richardson has connections to Shreveport. The city's postal center handles mail from Louisiana, Texas and Arkansas, KSLA reported. Plot: Members of an FBI hazardous materials team prepare to enter a house in New Boston, Texas, Friday May 31st in connection with the ricin investigation .

'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you.' The letter sent to President Obama contained the same chilling text, sources said on Thursday. The letter to the president was received at a mail screening facility and did not reach the White House, law enforcement sources told NBC4. One of the letters sent to Bloomberg was retrieved at the City Hall, and the second arrived at the headquarters of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg . operates and personally finances. They contained threats warning him to . stay away from the gun laws debate, authorities said. NYPD officials said . the threatening letters were opened on Friday in New York at the . city's mail facility and on Sunday in Washington at the headquarters of . the nonprofit. Three . members of the NYPD fell ill after being exposed to the letters, which . contained a 'pink, orange oily substance', authorities said. Their . symptoms have since subsided.

Bloomberg, speaking Friday on his weekly WOR Radio show, shrugged off any specter of danger. 'There's always threats, . unfortunately. That comes with the job,' he said. 'I trust the police . department and I feel perfectly safe. I've got more danger from . lightning than from anything else and I'll go about my business.'

'This is a scourge on the country that we just have to . make sure that we get under control and eliminate.' Targeted: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured at the Real Estate Board of New York on May 30th, was sent two letters laced with the poison ricin. The attack left three members of the NYPD ill . Under threat? A threatening letter sent to President Barack Obama is being tested for ricin after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was sent two similar letters laced with the poison . Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. The beans can be safely made in to castor oil, but ricin is a part of the waste 'mash' from the oil production. It can be made into a powder, a mist or a pellet and is poisonous if inhaled, injected, or ingested. Chewing the beans can also release the harmful substance. For ricin to poison people, it would have to be a deliberate act, according to the CDC. The only accidental injuries could come through ingesting castor beans. Ricin gets inside the cells of a personâ€™s body and prevents the cells from making proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die. It can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and circulatory symptoms and can lead to death 36 to 72 hours after exposure. In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella which had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin. It is not yet known why it took the FBI and the NYPD five days to announce the discovery. The matter is being investigated by . the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force which said that the letter sent to . Manhattan for billionaire Bloomberg arrived at 100 Gold Street - the . home of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Both . the New York and Washington D.C. notes were addressed to Bloomberg and . contained threats referencing the debate on gun laws. The second letter to the mayor was . opened by Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, who has . not been reported to have fallen ill. The NYPD confirmed preliminary testing indicated the presence of ricin. 'The FBI has an investigation ongoing and so things like the exact . wording and the postmarks, etc. weâ€™re not going to disclose,' NYPD . deputy commissioner Paul Browne told WCBS 880. 'It was a pink-orange . oily substance that subsequently, in the preliminary tests, indicate the . presence of ricin.' Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. It's not clear if the letters were related to other threatening, ricin-laced letters sent to other lawmakers recently. Authorities are now 'in the process of searching to determine if there may be additional letters,' according to the statement. Destination: The letter containing ricin addressed to New York City Mayor Bloomberg arrived here at 100 Gold Street - it was also where three members of the NYPD were exposed to the poison . Mayor . Bloomberg is an outspoken critic of current gun laws and has campaigned . nationally and on Capitol Hill for stricter gun legislation - using his . own considerable wealth to fund commercials. The . confirmation of ricin present in both letters came through on Wednesday . from the National Bioforensic Analysis Center in Maryland.

Chung Kim, 76, was convicted for murder on Thursday after he killed his upstairs neighbors over a dog feces dispute . A 76-year-old Dallas, Texas man was convicted of capital murder on Thursday in the shooting deaths of his neighbors last year because of a months-long feud about their dog's feces on his porch. A jury found that Chung Kim fatally shot his neighbor Michelle Jackson, 31, on February 4, as she stood on her balcony above his apartment. Kim then went upstairs to her residence and shot and killed her boyfriend, Jamie Stafford, 31. The couple's dog would relieve itself on their balcony, causing the urine and feces to drip down Kim's balcony each time they washed it, according to court records. Kim claimed the couple had 'intentionally thrown dog feces' on his porch. 'That’s all come down from my patio, from up patio. But now, three months later so stink,' he told CBS from jail. He also said that the shooting of Stafford was in self-defense but that he could not remember shooting Jackson because he suffered a blackout. Kim faces an automatic life sentence in prison without parole. Just months before their death, Jackson and Stafford had their first child together. Jackson also had four children aged 7 to 11 from a previous partner. The baby now lives with Jackson's parents and the four children live with their father in Garland, Texas. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Chung Kim says he shot Stafford out of self-defense and doesn't remember shooting Jackson . Life wasted: Jamie Stafford and partner Michelle Jackson were killed because their neighbor claims they threw dog feces on his porch . The couple lived above Kim and feces would supposedly drop onto his porch . The Dallas News reports that Kim, with the help of an interpreter, begged district Judge Balido for a new trial and entirely new lawyers. Judge Balido told Kim that she would appoint Kim a court-appointed attorney for appeals if convicted. He said he wanted to share his side of the story and claims that he was terrorized by his neighbors. Kim's defense attorney spoke on his behalf. 'They specifically came down and dumped it on his shoes and on the door,' defense attorney Kobby Warren said. CBS interviewed Kim who shared his account of the event. He says it was his neighbor who pulled a gun on him and that he shot in self-defense. He claims he used martial arts to wrestle the gun out of Stafford's hands. 'Before he pull trigger, I got him!' Kim told CBS from his jail cell. 'I hit him in his gun. And pushed his arm. And, I take his gun. And with my elbow knock him down,' he continued. He says the woman was not killed out of self-defense and claims he doesn't remember shooting her. 'I saw him. I don’t remember. At this time, My brain is gone. After this, I don’t know,' he said. 'I call, ""Hey stop. Stop. And he go up. He say wait."" And, he come back. Threw gun onto my head,' Kim said. The police affidavit describes a different account of the event. It says, around 8 o’clock Monday morning, Chung Kim shot Michelle Jackson while she was standing on her balcony. Defense attorney Koby Warren asked the jury to consider a lesser murder charge. The prosecution argued that revenge is not an acceptable impetus for murder. 'This isn’t an eviction proceeding. If that was the case, the defense would win,' prosecutor Herschel Woods said. 'There could have been time for cool reflection.' 'Because you were angry doesn’t mean you can exact a terrible punishment on someone,' he concluded. Jackson's mother, Yvonne Hypolite, read a statement after the judge read the verdict. 'The smallest baby will never know her mother,' Hypolite said. 'I don’t understand, Kim, why you killed my daughter.' 'I’m really glad he got sentenced, but it still can’t bring my daughter back,' said Hypolite.

A 13-year-old Texas girl has died of influenza, taking this season's swine flu death toll to 17 in Dallas County alone. Lydia Christine Kizziar of Carrollton was just a seventh grader when she passed away Saturday and her little sister is in the hospital fighting off the very same illness. Lydia's circumstance is increasingly common. Texas has been hard-hit this year as swine flu, or H1N1, pummels the Southern U.S. and threatens Americans nationwide. Tragic: 13-year-old Lydia Kizziar died Saturday, becoming the 17th confirmed person to die during this rampant flu season . Looking for help: A memorial fund has been set up for Lydia (right) to help her unemployed parents pay for the Texas girl's funeral . Even as reports of infection and death tolls hit a steep rise, experts warn that the season is still on an upslope. 'It's too early to tell how severe it's going to be but we're still on the up slope of the flu season, so what we can expect is more flu, more intense disease and more deaths over the next few weeks,' Dr. Joe Bresee of the Center for Disease Control's influenze division said Sunday. Flu season last each year from October to April and can peak in January or February. Lydia Kizziar's tragic death came as her home state of Texas saw an uptick in flu cases. Rampant: The Southern United States are among the hardest hit this year by influenza. The color brown indicates widespread flu activity. In Dallas County alone, 17 flu deaths have been reported since September . Swine flu: The 2013-2014 flu vaccine accounts for various strains of the virus, including H1N1, or the swine flu . According to NBCDFW.com, health officials in Dallas and Denton counties had by Tuesday confirmed 19 deaths. While the very old and very young are usually the hardest hit by the flu, on Monday the Garland, Texas health department revealed that the two most recent mortalities were seen in patients under 50 with no other health conditions. Elsewhere in Texas, 13 had been reported dead from the Houston area by last week. The southern state of North carolina had also reported 13 deaths by last week. In South Carolina, nine have died since September. While the south appears to be suffering the most, everyone needs to remain mindful of the threat. Eye-opening: CDC data suggests the H1N1 strain, which became so virulent in the 2009-2010 season, is the predominant flu virus being spread this year . 'The virus is all around the United States right now.,' said Bresee. 'There is still a lot of season to come. If folks haven't been vaccinated, we recommend they do it now.' This season's virus has killed six children in the United States, according to CDC data. A memorial fund has been set up for Lydia Kizziar in order to help her family financially through this painful time. 'The Kizziar family is in need of financial blessings to help with the cost of care and funeral expenses for the passing of their sweet, young daughter, Lydia,' the page on youcaring.com reads.

A former aide to David Blunkett strangled his ex-girlfriend in a jealous rage then killed himself on a railway line, an inquest heard yesterday. Debt ridden Martin Collett, 35, discovered Angela Hoyt had found love with another man after hacking into her email account. But after the Red Cross official asked him to leave the home they shared,  he attacked her while she was running  a bath. Killer: Martin Collett killed Angela Hoyt in the bathroom and then wrote . a suicide note in which he said there 'wasn't a chance in hell' he . would let her leave him . Holding her head under the running water, he strangled her before leaving her lifeless body slumped in the tub. He carried on living in the house for . 48 hours while Miss Hoyt lay dead upstairs, before stepping out in front . of a 100mph train. Days earlier, Miss Hoyt, 34, had . warned police that her ‘obsessive’ ex-boyfriend was ‘trying to ruin her . life’ but insisted to officers that she was able to sort things out . ‘amicably’. Collett had already hacked into her . Facebook and email accounts and used them to send offensive messages to . colleagues, family and friends. When Miss Hoyt confronted him about . the hacking, he laughed and warned her: ‘I am not some walkover. You are . going to pay for this.’ Investigation: Angela Hoyt, who was found dead by police officers at her house in Glebeland in Hatfield, Hertfordshire . Victim: Angela Hoyt (left) with her twin sister Ami Watanabe . Miss Hoyt met Collett while they were . both working at the Home Office. Collett had been a briefing manager for . Labour home secretaries David Blunkett and Charles Clarke while she . worked in the media team. The two had an ‘on-off’ relationship . and had broken up once before. Shortly before her death, Miss Hoyt had . returned from working in Pakistan with the Red Cross, where she had met a . new partner. She had told Collett the relationship was over for good . and had asked him to leave – but he had refused. Miss Hoyt had then been . shocked to discover her ex had been hacking into her email. Her twin sister Ami said Collett had . been obsessed with Miss Hoyt and had ‘gone to great lengths to terrorise . her’ through his cyber-stalking. Miss Hoyt went to Hatfield Police Station in Hertfordshire on May 20 last year to complain that he was harassing her. Scene: The property in Hatfield, Herts, where Angela Hoyt was found dead .

He was once the toast of high society and no champagne-fuelled party was complete without him. Edward Davenport was a fixture in the gossip columns, had homes in London and Monaco, and boasted that he could date any woman in the world. But today the disgraced tycoon, dubbed ‘Fast Eddie’ by friends, cuts a pitiful figure – handcuffed to a prison guard in hospital after undergoing a second kidney transplant. The self-styled ‘Lord’ – jailed for his role in a multi-million pound fraud – is trying to stay positive despite his condition but admits: ‘I know I’m fighting a death sentence.’ Handcuffed: Edward Davenport is chained up in his treatment room at St George's Hospital, South London . In an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday from his bed at St George’s Hospital in South London, Davenport, 47, says: ‘I was diagnosed with a defective kidney when I was about 15 and had my first transplant about 15 years ago. ‘I never told anyone about it as it didn’t really fit in with my image. But over the past few years it became apparent that that kidney was not working any more. I was in prison and feeling ill. ‘I’d been on the NHS donor list for another transplant for ages and then my name up just before Christmas – I think somebody had a tragic accident and lost their life. Before that  I was travelling to St George’s, chained up with three prison officers, three times a week for dialysis. It was an ordeal for them and me.’ Thin and grey-faced, Davenport has been shaken by his stint in hospital. He also needed a vital second operation after his transplant, to treat an aneurysm – a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall. ‘My life hung in the balance. It was touch-and-go,’ Davenport admits. Certainly his situation today is a far cry from the image he cultivated when he burst on to the London party scene in the 1980s. His black-tie Gatecrasher Balls, aimed at wealthy public school teenagers, quickly became synonymous with drunkenness and debauchery. Socialising: 'Fast Eddie' with socialite Tamara Beckwith at a party in 1994 . Life of luxury: The fraudster owned many properties in London and lived  in the L'Hermitage hotel in Monte Carlo . The business made him a fortune but it crashed when he was convicted of tax fraud and sentenced to nine months in jail. Despite the setback, Davenport never lost his love of taking risks – even though it repeatedly landed him in trouble. In 1998, he and two other men were charged with running up an £18,000 bill at the luxury Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland during a five-day New Year party while posing as aristocrats. They denied the claims and charges were later dropped. A year later, he bought the lease of the Sierra Leone High Commission building in Central London for just £50,000 while the country was embroiled in civil war. The property – now his home – is said to be worth £30 million and was used to film scenes for the Oscar-winning movie The King’s Speech. In May 2011, Davenport was given eight years for his part in a £4 million fraud.  The judge described him as the ‘ringmaster’ who was careful not to leave ‘footprints in the snow.’ After his health deteriorated, Davenport’s lawyer Karen Todner lodged an application to have him released on the grounds of ill-health. She hopes to secure a hearing as early as next month. Police escort: He was travelling with prison guards to St George;s Hospital in Tooting, South London, three times a week for dialysis . ‘I feel like an old man shuffling around, chained to a prison officer even when I want to go to the bathroom,’ says Davenport. ‘After the operation I was given a cocktail of drugs which gave me hallucinations.’ Ironically, he says, he got a better night’s sleep while held in Wandsworth prison. ‘I was in a cell on my own there and got a decent night’s rest. In this renal unit there is a lot going on day and night. It never stops.’ The only ‘highlight’ of his hospital stay has been the fact that his elderly mother Jean was allowed to visit on Christmas Day – something that would not have happened had he been in jail. Davenport concedes he sometimes finds it difficult to accept how much his life has changed: ‘I can’t even wear my own silk pyjamas – I have to wear the hospital ones. The truth is I feel shaky. I know I’m at death’s door.’","Disgraced tycoon Edward Davenport, 47, was a fixture of gossip columns .

When the bill came, the cash-strapped suspected drug dealers offered a gift card they had to settle their tab. Lacking any actual money to leave as a tip, the couple improvised.

David Cameron has come under pressure after Tory MPs wrote to him saying parliament should have the authority to veto EU legislation . David Cameron has come under further pressure over Europe after 95 Conservative MPs wrote to him saying parliament should have the authority to veto laws from Brussels. The group of backbenchers wrote to the Prime Minister saying the Commons should be able to block EU legislation and repeal measures that threaten the UK's 'national interest'. Parliament currently has no automatic . veto over EU laws, and the Prime Minister can only use the UK's veto to . head off new rules in the most sensitive issues - such as defence and . the budget. According to The Sunday Telegraph, signatories of the missive, which was drafted by senior MP Bernard Jenkin, include James Clappison, Conor Burns, John Baron, Anne Main and former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth. A committee of MPs which scrutinises EU laws last month recommended that a national veto be introduced. And the MPs' letter, sent to the Prime Minister this weekend, called on Mr Cameron to adopt the policy. ‘Each time you have stood up for British interests in Brussels, you have achieved a great deal,’ it said. ‘Building on your achievements, we would urge you to back the European Scrutiny Committee proposal and make the idea of a national veto over current and future EU laws a reality.’ The letter stated that a new national veto over EU laws would ‘enable Parliament to disapply EU legislation, where it is in our vital national interests to do so’. It added: ‘This would transform the UK's negotiating position in the EU.’ The letter said the veto - which would require a new Act of Parliament - could be used to deliver key reforms to Britain's relations with Europe. That could include gaining control over immigration from within the EU. The MPs' letter, sent to the Prime Minister this weekend, was drafted by senior MP Bernard Jenkin . Parliament currently has no automatic veto over EU laws, and the Prime Minister can only use the UK's veto to head off new rules in the most sensitive issues - such as defence and the budget . In their letter, the MPs praised Mr Cameron for his insistence that national parliaments, not bureaucrats in Brussels, are ‘the true source’ of democratic legitimacy in the EU. ‘However, clarity about how we will achieve these objectives is vital for our credibility,’ the letter says. Mr Jenkin, chairman of the Commons public administration committee, said the identities of all 95 formal signatories are included in the letter but most of the names are not intended to be made public. In an article for the Sunday Telegraph, he wrote: ‘The privately declared supporters of this letter represent more than half the back benches. ‘We speak for the mainstream of the modern Conservative Party in Parliament and in our constituencies, and for the voting public, both in the UK and throughout Europe.’ A Number 10 spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister set out his approach in his Bloomberg speech. ‘He has already won his battle over European bank bailouts, cut the EU budget for the first time and launched a landmark debate on the future of freedom of movement. ‘The Prime Minister is also the only one of the three main party leaders committed to giving the British people an in-out referendum on membership of a reformed EU.' The missive is signed by 95 Tory MPs, including former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth (pictured) They added: ‘We will of course study this idea closely. But we need to look at what it would mean in practice. ‘We've always been clear that Parliament is sovereign and more power for national parliaments must be a key part of a new settlement, including a 'red card' power so groups of national parliaments can block unwanted EU interference. ‘But if individual national parliaments regularly and unilaterally overturned EU laws the Single Market wouldn't work, and even a Swiss-style free trade deal with the EU wouldn't be possible. ‘It is important to negotiate a new deal for Britain in the EU and then put the choice to the British people: stay in the EU on new terms or leave altogether.’","Backbenchers wrote to the PM saying parliament should be able to block EU legislation and repeal measures that threaten 'national interest'

Seedy: The Rev Flowers poses in a photograph he posted on his Facebook page . Disgraced former Co-op Bank boss Rev Paul Flowers has resumed his depraved lifestyle of drugs and rent boys, despite facing fresh scrutiny by police and City regulators. Although he promised to seek help, the Methodist minister is still using the horse tranquilliser drug ketamine and booking male prostitutes. The new revelations come two months after The Mail on Sunday first exposed the former Co-op Bank chairman apparently buying cocaine and crystal meth. He was filmed counting out banknotes, allegedly to buy the drugs. Yet as he faces new probes into his . behaviour, little has changed in the sex- and drug-fuelled world of the . 63-year-old Methodist minister. Flowers . is due to be reinterviewed by detectives this week, as two City . regulators plan separate investigations into his professional conduct at . the time the Co-op Bank was brought to its knees. Yet . despite the renewed scrutiny. Only last Wednesday he asked a rent boy . to visit and promised in a taped telephone call: ‘I will have K . [ketamine] but that’s all. You get what you want.’ Rev Flowers had told friends that he spent four weeks in rehab before returning to his home on Christmas Eve. But . it wasn’t long before he was back to his old ways. On New Year’s Day, . he emailed an escort with the words: ‘Hi – happy new year!! You ok? Meet . sometime? Paul xxx’ The escort was a £400-a-night rent boy 40 years his junior who Flowers had met only once before, during an all-night drug-fuelled orgy at his Church-owned house in Bradford last October. When the younger man jokingly called him ‘Gramps’, Flowers replied: ‘Gramps!!! I’ll f*** you so hard for that!!!!!’. And as they try to arrange a time and place to meet, the former bank boss’s holiday diary proved packed: ‘Today [Thursday January 2] I am seeing Hairy Chris. Tomorrow I have to meet a friend at 11pm who’s coming back from London – to bring him over here for a couple of days.’ The ‘friend’ who Flowers took back to his house last weekend is a known ketamine user and the same man with whom he spoke of spending ‘12 hours in a ket hole’ in a text message on November 13. Back to his old tricks: Flowers at the drug user's house . Slinking off: The Methodist minister drives off after visiting his 'friend' in Manchester late on January 3 . The Mail on Sunday watched as the shamed minister arrived at the man’s house in the run-down Ancoats area of Manchester just before 11pm on Friday January 3 and drove him back to his Bradford home. The following Monday, he headed to Manchester again, this time to go house-hunting. And on Tuesday, he aborted a plan to see the escort he had been emailing but rang him in the early hours of Wednesday to make new arrangements. ‘Maybe you could come over tomorrow night later in the evening,’ he asked. At one point in the conversation, Flowers shows a distinct lack of concern when he hears the 23-year-old had overdosed on date-rape drug GHB [‘G’]. The rent-boy tells him ‘ I had a bit to much G last night. [A friend] had to ring an ambulance. Getting that blood gas thing is the worst ever.’ Flowers asks: ‘How long were you in?’ and after being told about five and a half hours, shows no surprise or alarm and goes on to discuss how he got some ‘good press’ that day over a Commons Select Committee hearing. When the escort told him he wanted to bring a friend along, Flowers grumpily replied: ‘How much have I got to pay for that, for God’s sake?’ Told it would be the ‘same as last time’, Flowers’ admitted he couldn’t remember what he paid before. He then attempted to negotiate down from £800, muttering: ‘That’s a lot of money’ before being told: ‘If that price is too high, we’ll sort something out.’ Later Flowers emailed over his concern that he didn’t want the other escort to be ‘off his trolley like last time’. Flowers was told: ‘Yeah, that’s fine, he won’t have ket,’ but three hours later, as they made their final preparations for the night, Flowers said: ‘I will have K but that’s all. You get what you want.’ On Tuesday, Flowers is due to answer police bail in Leeds over alleged conspiracy to supply class A drugs. Then he may discover whether he will face criminal charges. And last week the financial industry’s two main watchdogs announced they would be holding their own inquiries into goings on at the bank. The Prudential Regulatory Authority, . an arm of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority will . both hold investigations into whether there was any failure or . wrongdoing at Co-op Bank. A . City source said it was ‘unthinkable’ that Flowers would not be called . to testify, although neither regulator would comment on their inquiries. In . November, Chancellor George Osborne announced a broad independent . inquiry into the whole Co-op Bank affair. But that investigation will . now have to wait until the two City watchdogs have completed their own . probes, which are set to take several months. Labour . leader Ed Miliband was drawn into the affair as he had held a private . meeting with Flowers in March 2013, a month before his bank lent Labour . £1.2 million. Flowers and Miliband had two other informal dinners and . three other meetings. Shadow . Chancellor Ed Balls’ office was also given a £50,000 donation from the . Co-op Group, but Mr Balls insisted he had never had any direct contact . with Flowers. Last week, the . Treasury Select Committee heard about the events leading up to the . Co-op Banks’s collapse. At that session, Clive Adamson, the man who . appointed Flowers as chairman in 2010, stood by his decision in the face . of outrage and incredulity from MPs. Mr Adamsons’s intransigence before the MPs delighted Flowers. ‘I’m . fine,’ he said in a phone call to the escort the next day, which the . MoS has heard. ‘Coping all right at the moment. I actually had some good . press today so it was all right for a change. Some people were saying . nice things about me in newspapers and on the BBC.’ However, . committee chairman Andrew Tyrie branded Flowers a ‘financial . illiterate’ following his embarrassing appearance before them last . October when he put the Co-op’s assets at £3 billion when the correct . answer was £47 billion. Crystal meth shame: How the Mail On Sunday broke the original story in November . The news of Flowers’ on-going depravity is sure to disappoint those who have tried to help him conquer his apparent addiction to hard drugs. When our story broke last November he issued a contrite apology admitting: ‘I did things that were stupid and wrong. I am sorry for this and I am seeking professional help.’ The following week, as his Methodist Church employers offered their support while also suspending him from his parish duties, he was caught telling a drug dealer to, ‘bring the boy Charlie’ as he arranged a rendezvous. A spokeswoman for the Church said she had no knowledge of the Church paying for Rev. Flowers to go into drugs rehab. She added: ‘He is still an office holder in the church and we will investigate thoroughly once any criminal processes have finished.’ The Co-op Bank almost collapsed last year due to a £1.5 billion shortfall in its capital reserves. Flowers’ solicitor Andy Hollas did not respond to The Mail on Sunday’s request for comments on the new developments last night.","Exposed by MoS for using drugs and blamed for near collapse of Co-op .

A spat has erupted between two top hairstylists over who switched the Prime Minister’s parting to the left. Stylist-to-the stars Lino Carbosiero – awarded an MBE in the New Year’s Honours list for services to hairdressing – has been widely credited  for giving David Cameron’s locks the distinctive new look. But the PM’s previous barber, Tony Tahir, says the suggestion is rubbish and that it was he who gave the PM his look back in 2007. Mr Tahir – who charged the Tory leader £10 per trim, as opposed to the £90 Mr Cameron currently pays – said: ‘It’s annoying to say the least. I’m sure Mr Carbosiero deserves his MBE  but the publicity he’s had from that side parting over the years must have helped. 'He may not have made the claim himself but he’s never denied it. Yet it is completely wrong. My daughter is furious and I’m getting calls from friends saying, ""Tony, you’ve been stitched up.""’ Mr Tahir, 63, who is now retired but ran his West London salon with wife Sandra, 66, said he remembered the day he gave the PM parting advice. ‘I’ve always had a wonderful eye for the way people have their hair,’ he said. ‘That particular day I said, “Mr Cameron, you’re wearing your hair on the wrong side. It’s making your face look very, very long.” ‘His hair grows from left to right so  if you comb it to go the opposite way, as he did, it sticks up. So I changed it and told him to look in the mirror and say which he liked best. ‘He agreed with me so I swept it from left to right, which flattened the top and pushed it down quite nicely. ‘I was glad he took my advice and I’m pleased it still suits him. But I feel a  bit like a film double. I did the work and some star gets the credit.’ Honoured: Although he never claimed so himself, David Cameron's current stylist Lino Carbosiero (left) has been widely credit with creating the Prime Minister's signature parting. He has been honoured with an MBE . Mr Tahir, who arrived in Britain from . Cyprus in 1958, says he had many celebrity clients because his Hair and . Tanning Rooms salon had a discreet entrance. He and his wife have now . retired  to Cornwall. Mrs Tahir said: ‘It is important to put the record straight. Tony did the parting. In fact we cut all the Cameron family’s hair.’ Mr Carbosiero, whose client list includes Adele and Madonna, is a consultant at upmarket Central London salon Daniel Galvin. He has styled Mr Cameron’s hair for the past five years but it is understood he was not nominated for his award by the PM. Mr Carbosiero - whose 30-year career has been hailed as ‘an inspiration to the industry’ by colleagues - believes he was honoured for his campaign to get hairdressing recognised as a profession. Asked about his approach to the PM’s hairstyle he said: ‘I just did what felt natural.’ However, Mr Tahir remains unconvinced. ‘I see Mr Cameron on TV and I’m not sure about  his hair,’ he said. ‘I don’t think he’s looking after it as well as he could.'","Tony Tahir said his £10 cuts were the ones that gave Cameron his new look .

The new London Gateway port welcomed the largest ever ship to enter the Thames this week, after a huge container vessel was diverted by bad weather. Driven from its original destination of Felixstowe by high winds and rains, the Gudrun Maersk was towed into port laden with goods from the Far East. The port, in Thurrock, Essex, opened in November after a huge dredging operation made the river Thames deep enough to accommodate the very larger cargo ships which are becoming standard in the shipping industry. Docking: The huge Gudrun Maersk container ship makes its way into the London Gateway . Cranes: Equipment at the London Gateway, which only opened in November, can operate in high wind speeds . The ship, which can carry as much as . 8,500 lorries, and weighs 115,000 tonnes when fully loaded, docked in . the new port on Wednesday. When it was constructed in 2005 it was the largest container ship in the world, but has since been eclipsed a new model which can carry more than twice as much cargo. Ships as large as the Gudrun Maersk have been able to venture into the Thames thanks to long-running efforts to remove some 27million tonnes of silt from the river bed. The change, which affects some 100km of waterway, now means that even the world's largest container ship can comfortably dock just miles from London. According to the port's operators, the move will help keep the UK competitive, as without the increased capacity the giant goods ships would have started stopping off in mainland Europe instead. After its time in port, the ship contained to Le Havre in France, and is currently making its way towards Tangiers in Morocco. Close to land: The huge ship - which weighs 115,000 tonnes when fully loaded - is towed into port . Laden: The ship can hold as much cargo as 8,500 lorries . Route: The ship was bound to Felixstowe, but headed to the new London Gateway port instead . A spokesman for the London Gateway said: 'The ship wouldn't have been able to come in before we dredged the Thames. 'You need deep water to get the ships in, so we have conducted over 100km of dredging, about 27million cubic metres has been dredged from the Thames, all the way up to the estuary and the channel. 'And we have built London Gateway, which only opened on 7 November, for the large ships. This is the future of shipping – so to keep the UK competitive that’s what we’ve done. Cranes: Equipment at the London Gateway, which only opened in November, can operate in high wind speeds . 'We’re hoping to get a much larger ship actually – the largest in the world. It’s an 18,000-container Maersk EEE.' 'The way the ships run is they stop at maybe 8 ports then start the loop again. The vessel wasn’t actually due to come here, but because of the bad weather over the Christmas period we had a number of ships come that would have gone to Felixstowe, due to high winds.' This was a Far East service, so would have carried electronics, textiles and things like that. It would have mostly been importing as there is not a great deal of exporting in the UK. 'The whole reason London Gateway was built was to allow these ships to come in – if we hadn’t built this they would have just gone to Europe instead.'","The 8,500-container Gudrun Maersk arrived last week at the London Gateway port, which opened in November .

A group of Israeli settler children have been pictured apparently being cornered and beaten by Palestinians after witnesses said they had attacked farmers near a West Bank village. The settlers  - aged in their teens and 20s  - were held for about two hours at a house under construction before being handed over to the Israeli military. During the standoff, the settlers huddled near a wall of the house, several bleeding from the head, and one was lying on the ground.

The Israeli military said it had received word of a stone-throwing clash between settlers and Palestinian farmers and that it later evacuated 11 settlers with light and moderate injuries from the building. The incident began at about 10.30 am near the West Bank village of Qusra, southeast of the city of Nablus, said Ziad Odeh, the Muslim prayer leader in Qusra and a member of the village council. He said about 25 to 30 settlers, many of them masked, attacked Qusra farmers in an olive grove with sticks and stones, injuring a Palestinian boy in the head. A clash ensued, farmers called for reinforcements and about 100 youths arrived from the village, Odeh said.

Some of the settlers were tied up, and most had signs of beating injuries, according to an photographer at the scene. Odeh said the beatings stopped after the settlers were seized. 'When they were caught, they were beaten, but after we brought them to the building, we did not let anyone beat them,' said Odeh, adding that the captives were given water and bandages for their wounds. Odeh said the settlers involved in the attack on the Qusra farmers were in their late teens and 20s. The military said the chain of events apparently began after Israeli authorities removed an illegally built structure in Esh Kodesh, a rogue settlement in the area. In recent years, militant settlers have often responded to any attempts by the Israeli military to remove parts of dozens of rogue settlements, or outposts, by attacking Palestinians and their property. The tactic, begun in 2008, is known as 'price tag.' Villages in the area have repeatedly come under attack by militant settlers, said Odeh, adding that assailants also set fire to four area mosques in the last three years. A U.N. monitor says that from 2006 to August 2013, there were 630 settler-related attacks on Palestinians and 1,344 attacks on their property, with the pace of incidents rising since 2008. In all, 10 Palestinians were killed and 1,040 injured in such attacks, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). During the same period, 29 Israeli civilians were killed and 368 injured by Palestinians in the West Bank, OCHA said. Injured Israeli settlers appeal to Palestinians while they are detained. The incident began at about 10.30 am near the West Bank village of Qusra, southeast of the city of Nablus, said Ziad Odeh, the Muslim prayer leader in Qusra and a member of the village council . After a short period of time the IDF arrived and removed the detained settlers. Villages in the area have repeatedly come under attack by militant settlers, said Odeh, adding that assailants also set fire to four area mosques in the last three years . In other developments Tuesday, a key political ally warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would quit the coalition government if Israel recognizes its pre-1967 war frontier as a starting point for border talks with the Palestinians. Such recognition is expected to be part of a proposed framework for a peace deal to be presented by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in coming weeks. Kerry returned to Washington on Monday after a mediating mission that included meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The Palestinians want a state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in 1967, but are ready to accept some modifications that would enable Israel to keep some of its settlements. Netanyahu has so far refused to accept the 1967 frontier as a baseline for negotiations or consider a partition of Jerusalem - at least in public. Naftali Bennett, head of the pro-settler Jewish Home party, a key coalition member, warned Netanyahu against softening his position. 'The lines of '67 mean a partition of Jerusalem,' Bennett said in comments carried on Israel TV's Channel Two. 'We will that sit in a government that because of international pressure endangers the future of our children and divides our capital.' Earlier, the U.S. ambassador to Israel said Kerry's framework proposal will be presented to both sides in a few weeks. Dan Shapiro told Israel Radio that the proposal will include security arrangements, borders, Jerusalem and all the other 'core issues.'","Settlers were held for about two hours at a house under construction before being handed over to the Israeli military .

'If a student performs very strongly in most criteria, but their work contains grammatical errors, a first should be awarded,' UEA's Dr Adam Longcroft . A top university has been accused of leaning on academics to give students more top degrees - boosting its ranking in league tables against competitors. An internal document from the University of East Anglia - which charges fees of Â£9,000 a year - states: 'To put it bluntly, too few students are being awarded 2:1s and firsts.' Dr Adam Longcroft, academic director of taught programmes, adds the university's 'Good Honours statistics fall behind those of its close competitors' partly because the 'marking culture' was characterised by 'conservatism' and 'timidity'. He argues that basic grammatical errors should not kill off a chance  of a top grade. The report - the basis for new marking guidance introduced last summer - was obtained by The Mail on Sunday under the Freedom of Information Act. In the 2012 document, Dr Longcroft said some academics had an 'odd' view of a first and seemed to think that students should be 'verging on genius' to be awarded one. He went on to criticise the approach of academics 'who argued that small grammatical errors should preclude the award of a first class mark' and said that this would particularly disadvantage international students with weak English. 'If a student performs very strongly in most of the criteria, but their work contains grammatical errors, a first mark can and should be awarded,' he instructed. He added: 'This isn't about 'dumbing down' - far from it. Rather, it is about rewarding excellent work with high marks - and giving credit where credit is due.' The document will fuel criticism that universities are undermining the credibility of degrees so they can push themselves up the results league tables - a key tool to market themselves to students. The revelation comes after the number of firsts and 2:1s gained by UK students has hit record levels, with universities saying the trend reflects better teaching and the higher A-level grades of entrants. University students on campus at the University of East Anglia (UEA), in Norwich . The proportion of firsts awarded by UEA in 2011/12 was 16 per cent, up from 11 per cent in 2006/7. In other evidence universities are putting pressure on staff, Surrey University discussed whether to assess academics on the marks they awarded to students. A memo said: 'The intention of this target is not to inflate grades unjustifiably but to ensure that levels of good degrees sit comfortably within subject benchmarks and against comparator institutions.' The plan was eventually dropped, however, after critics argued that it would compromise the academics' ability to make objective assessments of students work. And at Nottingham University, documents seen by this newspaper show a working group said there was 'a perceived reluctance' in some departments 'to use the full range  of marks and this may have had a knock-on impact on degree classification in particular in relation  to firsts...' The group added that departments whose results fell below those at comparable universities were 'asked to consider this'. The new disclosures come as official figures to be published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency this week are expected to show another rise in the proportion of graduates awarded top degrees. The proportion of firsts awarded by UEA in 2011/12 was 16 per cent, up from 11 per cent in 2006/7 . Prof Alan Smithers, of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said: 'The documents from UEA show evidence of deliberate dumbing down. It shows the university  is giving out better degrees than students deserve. 'Universities seem to be in a race to give out as many good degrees as they can and are putting their academic staff under pressure to mark more leniently. They are in competition for students and their income depends on who they attract. Many are doing this tacitly, but UEA has set it down in black and white.' But the pro-vice chancellor of UEA, Professor Neil Ward, said Prof Smithers's claims were 'unfounded', adding the new marking system was too new to have had any impact on results. He said: 'We totally refute the accusation of deliberate dumbing down. The claim that students are being awarded degrees they don't deserve is utterly incorrect. The documents are part of regular good practice reviews.' Nottingham University said: 'We strongly refute the suggestion that academic degree grades have been artificially inflated in recent years.'","Internal document from UEA states: 'Too few are being awarded firsts'

A boy who spent more than half his young life has died after a battle with the same rare brain cancer which killed his cousin. Zac Knighton-Smith, nine, passed away on New Year's Day from an agressive neuroblastoma. He had been diagnosed with the condition in February 2009, aged four. And just six months after the diagnosis his cousin, Chelsea Knighton, died from the condition aged three. When he first fell ill aged four, two doctors missed the symptoms of his cancer. It took six months to diagnose him as suffering from a form of the disease called neuroblastoma, which affects the developing nerve cells of children. After chemotherapy at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2009, the NHS paid for Zac to go to Germany for a first time to have antibody therapy. While there, doctors removed a tumour near his heart which, incredibly, his family had not even been told about. Zac was given the all-clear, but a follow-up scan revealed three cancerous lymph nodes in his abdomen. The NHS originally refused to fund potential lifesaving surgery at a German hospital for Zac, from Rushden, Northamptonshire, which led his family to start a desperate fundraising campaign. They found the Â£8,000 needed for the operation, and were delighted to be told in March 2011 that Zac was in remission. The family were also reimbursed the cost of the treatment by the NHS after Conservative MP Peter Bone intervened on their behalf. Packed up: Zac, pictured in 2012 with his parents Bob Smith and Sam Knighton before his trip to Germany . Following intervention from their local Tory MP Peter Bone the NHS did a U-turn and reimbursed the family for the costly treatment. But the cancer later spread to Zac's liver and he passed away at his home on 1 January alongside his parents, Bob Smith, 44, and Sam Knighton, 45. Diagnoses: Zac, right, with his cousin Chelsea, after both had been diagnosed with neuorblastomata . His mother yesterday said he wasn't in any pain but confirmed his health had been ailing because the disease had spread to his liver. Ms Knighton said: 'We took him to America as our last-ditch attempt in November to a specialist oncologist, who was also a scientist. We found out then it had spread to his bone marrow. 'We knew then that we had one hell of a fight. But at that point it wasn't in his liver. But that's the nature of the disease, it can happen that quickly. 'All over Christmas he deteriorated. We knew he didn't have long, he was poorly. Christmas will never be the same again.' Speaking in the House of Commons on Wednesday, Mr Bone said Zac will be 'greatly missed'. Addressing Commons Leader Andrew Lansley in the chamber, he said: This lovely, full-of-life, happy little boy passed away. He will be sadly and greatly missed. 'However, without politicians of different parties working together he would not have had the last five years.' Any funds raised by Zac's Fight Appeal, which has been raising money for his treatment, will now be used to help other children and their families fighting the disease. Ms Knighton added: 'This country offers nothing for relapse neuroblastoma. If you take accidents out of the equation, this disease is the single biggest killer of children. 'How many more children have to die before something is done about it? This can't be allowed to happen.'","Zac Knight-Smith, nine, passed away on New Year's Eve, his parents said .

When a newly single man decided he wanted to find a new love, he decided to try his chances by venturing onto Mumsnet in search of a potential date. Within minutes of posting a romantic request on the popular parenting website, the 35-year-old was deluged with more than 400 replies from women on the site. But sadly for the man, who advertised himself as being 6ft, athletic and well-endowed, the responses were from members of the website who were less than impressed. The mystery man using the pseudonym ‘sheffieldguy’ had boasted on the site that he was ‘a very attentive and confident lover’. But it was his insistence that he was ‘not looking for a relationship, just some NSA (no strings attached) fun’, that seemed to rile the women. He quickly became the subject of ridicule on the website, as well as on Twitter where hundreds of women took the opportunity to mock his plea. In his post on Mumsnet on Tuesday afternoon, the man wrote: ‘I wonder if this gets tried a lot? Or am I the first guy to think of this angle? This will probably get deleted in minutes, but hey, I’ve got a day off with not much else to do. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, as they say. ‘So, I’m 35, 6ft, athletic, well-endowed and recently single. I’m not looking for a relationship, just some NSA (no strings attached) fun. Not into one-night stand. I’d rather click with someone a bit and have repeated fun whenever convenient for both of us. ‘ .

I’m happy to travel up to an hour or so from Sheffield.’ Women on the site quickly started posting sarcastic replies, including: ‘I bet your inbox is ON FIRE’. Lynn Schreiber, a site user, posted on Twitter: ‘Bless his cotton socks. Don’t we all know a guy like that? Thinks he’s God’s gift to women.’ She added: ‘And here’s me on my own for a few days while DH (dear husband) away on business.’ Another added: ‘Have to admire that level optimism!!’ While one wrote: ‘What an old romantic!’ Officials at Mumsnet appeared not to approve of the man’s bid for love and deleted his post, replacing it with a limerick instead. Backlash: 'Sheffieldguy' was hit with more than 400 replies within minutes, attacking him for his request . It read: ‘There once came from Sheffield this guy, who gave the Mumsnetters the eye. They weren’t all that keen, ‘cos he wasn’t Sean Bean, and the size of his knob was a lie.’ In a tweet they added: ‘Here’s what happens when you look for NSA fun on Mumsnet.’ In October last year, a post on the website went viral after a woman asked fellow mothers if their partners ‘dunked’ their penis into a beaker of water left by the bedside table after having sex. ‘We have a dedicated post-sex cleanup area on the bedside table,’ she wrote. ‘A box of tissues, a small bin, and a beaker of clean water for temporary cleaning/dunking while the bathroom is occupied by me. ‘Apparently our penis beaker is strange and not the done thing.” Another mum quickly replied: ‘No. We have a normal bedside table.

A mother was rushed to hospital with stomach ache - and just two hours later gave birth to a baby boy she had no idea she was expecting. Teresa Howard, 43, insisted last night as she held her third son, Ethan: 'I couldn't believe it!' The drama unfolded after she begged her partner, Glen Toher, 42, to take her to hospital after she was struck down by what she thought was stomach cramps last Saturday afternoon. Surprise: Ethan Toher at home in Norwich with his mother Teresa and his father Glen. Ms Howard had no idea she was pregnant and thought she was ill because of an acute wheat intolerance . Ms Howard, of Mile Cross, Norwich, thought she was ill because she suspected she had an acute wheat tolerance. 'Teresa phoned me on Saturday because her stomach had swelled up,' said Mr Toher, a Parcelforce employee. 'She said she was so doubled over in pain she needed to get checked out for this wheat intolerance that her sister has.' Unexpected: Ethan's mother said she never believed women who said they hadn't known they were pregnant - but she has changed her view now . The receptionist at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital's A&E department immediately asked Teresa if she was pregnant. 'We both said 'no',' said Mr Toher. 'But then the doctor came and said Teresa was pregnant, congratulated us and said her contractions were five minutes apart. 'Not only had we just been told that Teresa was pregnant but that she was in labour too.' The baby's heart rate then dramatically started to drop. So Ms Howard was rushed for an emergency Caesarean section, but doctors then had to change their plans because she had started to give birth naturally. After entering A&E at about 1.25pm, the couple welcomed their third son, Ethan, into the world at 3.25pm. He weighed 7lb. 'At first I was frightened about not bonding with the baby because I hadn't had the pregnancy to prepare,' admitted Ms Howard. 'But as soon as they put the baby into your arms, you bond immediately. 'I just wanted him to be okay. 'I just kept thinking, ""How did he survive in there for all that time without me knowing?""' The couple broke the news to family and friends and said it has taken a few days for Ethan's shock arrival to sink in. Ms Howard said she was even doing 100 abdominal crunches a night before Christmas in a bid to get rid of the 'muffin top' she said she had developed in the summer. 'I thought the weight was due to me not eating properly, pigging out and not exercising - but I was still doing my size 12 trousers up,' said the mother-of-three. 'I was running on our treadmill until we moved house at the end of September to try and get rid of the weight I had put on during the summer.' Ms Howard was rushed to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital's A&E department where she gave birth . The couple have been delighted with the reaction of their two other sons - Kyle, six, and Connor, four - who could not have been happier to have a new little baby brother. 'They were really excited and have been very protective of him ever since he came home,' said Ms Howard. She said she thought there would be people who do not believe her story because she was always cynical about similar tales herself. 'I am the first person who sees these stories in the papers and on the television and says, ""Of course you know when you are pregnant,""' she said. 'I have had two boys - I felt rough almost all the way through pregnancy with both of them. 'I had heartburn, sickness, couldn't eat properly and I was huge. 'But now I am sat here eating humble pie because it has happened to me.'","Teresa Howard, 43, thought she was suffering from a wheat intolerance .

One of Britain’s best-loved animal charities is today accused of putting profits before pet welfare after making swingeing cuts to services despite receiving a record income. Cats Protection receives £62 million a year in donations from caring animal lovers and investment profits – yet a Mail on Sunday investigation has revealed that it has slashed spending on frontline services by more than £3 million. The cuts include closing seven centres because they were helping ‘too many’ cats, and reining back on its crucial neutering programme, resulting in 17,000 fewer stray and rescued animals being helped. Vulnerable: Cats Protection has made cutbacks on vital services including vaccines yet pays its chief executive more than £100,000 a year, according to an investigation by the Mail on Sunday (file photo) Despite the cuts, Cats Protection increased its spending on staff to more than £12 million a year – including more than £100,000 on wages for its chief executive – even though it is run largely by an army of 8,500 unpaid volunteers. Now some of those volunteers have come forward to accuse bosses of ‘betraying’ the millions of people who make donations. Major: Cats Protection is one of Britain's largest animal charities, receiving £62 million a year . The whistleblowers, who have now left the charity, also revealed how: . ‘It is no longer about rescuing as many cats as possible, it has become about cutting as many costs as possible,’ said former volunteer Bernice Moorhouse. Cats Protection, which has more than 250 branches, says its ‘vision is a world where every cat is treated with kindness and an understanding of its needs’, with neutering and rehoming its two main objectives. But former volunteers have been left dismayed by cuts. One . of the areas to be hardest hit  is the neutering of cats – even though . the charity itself has warned that the UK is being overrun by an . unprecedented number of strays, as owners can’t afford to neuter their . animals or care for their litters. Whistleblowers said cats were put down instead of having vets' bills paid - a claim the charity denied (file photo) 'Appalling': Mary Millar said her branch in Inverclyde, Scotland, had been chipped away at until it closed completely in October as managers cut back on vaccines. She now runs a cat charity from her home . A female cat can produce 18 kittens in a year and can end up with 20,000 descendants in just five years. However, the number of cats neutered by the charity fell by 20,000 in 2012. Mary Millar told how administrators chipped away at funding for her branch in Inverclyde, until they closed it for good in October. She said her branch had requested £9,000 for neutering in 2013, based on the number of cats brought in  the previous year, but had been given only £1,600. Cute: This cat was one of several helped by Mary Millar, who has blown the whistle on Cats Protection . She said: ‘It’s appalling the way they treat the volunteers by cutting back, irrespective of the effects on the animals.’ She also revealed the cuts to the vaccination programme, saying: ‘In February 2013, they recommended we use cheaper vaccines and give the cats an injection which didn’t cover them against all the diseases, such as respiratory infection. I couldn’t believe they would be willing to put the cats’ health at risk for a small saving.’ But a spokesman from Cats Protection was adamant that ‘all cats in our care must receive a minimum veterinary standard of care, with most receiving more’. Mrs Millar also spoke out against the decision to cut back visits before rehoming strays. ‘It’s disgraceful’, she said. ‘How can you tell over the phone if people are lying or not, or whether they are suitable owners?’ Fellow former volunteer Mrs Moorhouse was left ‘devastated’ when her Cardiff branch was axed in November 2012 after 23 years. ‘It felt like a kick in the teeth,’ she said. ‘It felt like Cats Protection were prioritising cost over the care of the cats.’ She also accused the charity of targeting their branch for closure because they had requested £12,000 to pay for neutering that year. ‘They said we shouldn’t have been neutering so many cats and that we were helping too many people, which was now unaffordable. So they were closing us down. How can they justify paying themselves such high salaries while shutting the centres where the real work is carried out? It was just easier for them to shut us down than fight to keep us open. We helped thousands of stray cats every year – where will they go now?’ Needy: One animal which was put up for rehoming by Cats Protection. The charity's income is £62m a year . Other branches that have been shut in the . past two years include Slough, Maidenhead and Windsor, Inverness, North . Shropshire, Callington in Cornwall and Leeds. While Cats Protection – formerly known as the Cats Protection League claim the cuts are not ‘adversely affecting our care of cats’, figures show that the charity helped 17,000 fewer cats in 2012 than in 2011. Controversy: Another one of the thousands of pets rehomed through Cats Protection . Another volunteer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, accused ‘heartless’ Cats Protection of putting down cats unnecessarily. ‘When I was working for them I was fostering a lot of cats and they said they would take a couple off my hands and rehome them. ‘I stupidly believed them. One of them was a six-month old kitten and they ended up putting her down. They said she was too frightened on her own in the pen. But they didn’t make any efforts to help her. In my opinion it was just easier and cheaper for them to get rid of her. ‘They also wanted us to put down any cats that were over ten years old,’ added the former volunteer. ‘And if blood tests revealed the cats had any diseases, regardless of age, we had to put them down too, rather than pay a vet to cure them.’ However, Cats Protection deny the claim and say they ‘never put a healthy cat to sleep’ and put down sick cats only on vets’ advice. The charity admitted they had cut back their neutering budget following ‘overspends’ in previous years, but said the budget rose again last year. It also admitted no longer carrying out home visits for every rehoming, but pointed out: ‘Since we’ve reduced the number of home visits the number of cats returned to us has not increased.’ Cats Protection chief executive Peter Hepburn added: ‘In an organisation as large as ours, there are bound to be one or two who are unhappy with things.’","Cats Protection whistleblower: Volunteers laid off and seven centres shut .

He said Mr Knock was a 'gentle giant' and because of the drink he was in no fit state to defend himself from the 'murderous onslaught' he met that night. Christopher Morgan, prosecuting, said Mr Knock had been visited by his two daughters on August 31 and before leaving them with his mother Lola to go to the Red Lion he had told them he loved them.Mr Morgan said: 'His mother and daughters were never to see him alive again.' He said Mr Knock was happy in the pub and had not been aggressive or argumentative.Estabrook had gone to the pub with a woman neighbour. During the evening she had gone outside and had a cigarette with Mr Knock. At one point Mr Knock had put his hands on Estabrook's head and he had told him to get off, the court heard. Later that night the landlord heard Estabrook say he was going to 'fill him (Mr Knock) in'. Estabrook told another punter he was going round to Mr Knock's home to 'have it out with him' and when he was advised to leave it until the next day Estabrook replied : 'No. I'm going to go round tonight.' Estabrook left the pub at about 2am. He was dropped off at his flat by a member of the pub's staff and Mr Knock had left the pub at about the same time and walked home with a friend. Mr Morgan said the victim was murdered in his front garden by Estabrook between 2am and 4am in a 'frenzied' and apparently motiveless attack. Red Lion: Both men had been drinking separately at the Red Lion in Bildeston, Suffolk before the murder . He said Estabrook's horrified sister found Mr Knock dead after she was alerted by her brother. She knocked at the front door and Mr Knock's mother came out and said: 'Oh my God. It's my son.' Estabrook had sped off and his car was found a short while later after he'd ploughed into a hedge. The killer was found hiding in a ditch and was Tasered by police who feared he had a knife on him. Cops went to his home and found his clothes, mobile and a kitchen knife in a washing machine. Steven Dyble, defending, said both Estabrook and Mr Knock had been drinking that night. He said although Estabrook had been heard to say he was going to 'do Mr Knock in' he hadn't said he was going to kill him. Mr Dyble said there was very little to explain why Estabrook had killed Mr Knock. He was ordered to serve a minimum  20 years behind bars of a mandatory life sentence at Ipswich Crown Court . He admitted: 'In many ways it is without motive.' Mr Dyble said Estabrook had expressed remorse and realised how many people's lives he had wrecked. Det Insp Kevin Hayward, of the joint Norfolk and Suffolk major investigation team, said last night: 'This was a particularly brutal attack where a defenceless man sustained horrendous fatal injuries.' Mr Knock's family have paid tribute to him, saying he had a 'big smile and a big heart'. His loved ones said he was a devoted son, loyal friend and brother who enjoyed spending time with his nieces and nephews. His family said in a statement: 'He was a big tough man on the outside but a big softy underneath who was not afraid to tell those close to him how much he loved them, or to cry and show his sadness and to laugh out loud when happy. 'Brian was a cheeky, fun-loving character with a big smile and a big heart. 'Loved by all that knew him, he will be missed beyond words. 'His life was short but he made such a big impression on everyone that he will be remembered in the memories and hearts of all that ever had the good fortune to meet him.'","Barry Estabrook, 44, stabbed 'gentle giant' Brian Knock, 38 .

Police forces are to have their crime statistics examined every year after senior officers admitted the figures are routinely fiddled. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary is being given an extra £9.4 million to fund force inspections on core policing, which includes crime recording. It is also to publish a one-off report which will expose more of the tricks used by police to keep crime rates down. Forces are to have their statistics examined after police chiefs last year admitted crime figures were routinely fiddled. File image . The Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Tom Winsor, admitted: ‘I have no doubt we will find a degree of fiddling of the figures.' The Home Office is also changing how police report clear-up rates, to stop them 'chasing targets to gain easy detections' or avoiding recording crimes they could never solve. A more detailed range of crime outcomes will be published with some categories – such as recording an offence as ‘undetected’ – being scrapped, Policing Minister Damian Green said. As the Mail on Sunday revealed, police told a parliamentary inquiry that victims are often disbelieved in a bid to keep crimes off the books, while serious incidents are downgraded and offenders encouraged to admit extra offences. Police chiefs told MPs how serious . offences including rape, child abuse and robberies were 'disappearing in . a puff of smoke' as officers manipulated figures. Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice Damian Green said a more detailed range of crime outcomes would be published . Forces were accused of downgrading the nature of crimes to make them seem less serious or erasing them from data altogether. One analyst claimed hundreds of burglaries 'disappeared' in a matter of weeks at the Met after managers intervened. The claims were made at a hearing of Parliament’s Public Administration Committee in November. Mr Winsor added: 'The accuracy and integrity of police recorded crime data is extremely important. 'HMIC is already carrying out a 43-force inspection of police crime recording policies and practices, and an interim report is scheduled for April 2014. 'In addition, in 2014/15 HMIC will begin a new annual programme of all-force inspections of core policing work, and that will include crime recording.'","HM Inspectorate of Constabulary to be given £9.4million to fund crackdown .

Vince Cable could become Home Secretary in a future coalition, friends have claimed . The Lib Dems’ economic guru has ’given up’ his dream of being Chancellor of the Exchequer, admitting that the larger coalition party should take charge of the Treasury. Aides moved today to insist the Business Secretary was not eying Theresa May's job, as Tory MPs predicted he would be a 'complete and utter disaster' if put in charge of the country's borders. Lib Dem Vince Cable would like to Home Secretary to change the direction of the coalition's immigration policy which he fears his damaging business and universities . As the Lib Dem shadow chancellor in opposition, many had assumed Mr Cable would have taken a job at the Treasury when the coalition was formed in 2010. But his relationship with Conservative George Osborne was so bad he was instead handed the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. He regularly launched attacks on Mr Osborne’s economic strategy, most recently warning the Chancellor’s flagship Help to Buy scheme to get more people on the property ladder risked fuelling a new house price bubble. However, Mr Cable has also been outspoken about the Tory target of cutting net migration to the tens of thousands, warning of the impact on attracting highly-skilled immigrants and foreign students. One source told MailOnline that Mr Cable would be open to the Home Office job 'because of the migration thing' and suggested he had 'given up on the Treasury'. Another source insisted Mr Cable did not want Mrs May's job but added: 'He has real concerns about the way the rhetoric on immigration is affecting business and universities.’ However, the idea of the senior Lib Dem taking charge of Britain's law and order was dismissed as laughable but the Conservatives. Tory MP Philip Davies said: I think Vince Cable is an idiot. If you want to have unlimited immigration then I am sure Vince Cable would be a completely brilliant Home Secretary. 'But for the vast majority of the public it would be a complete and utter disaster.’ Fellow Conservative Douglas Carswell thought the idea was a joke: ‘Is it April Fool’s Day yet? I thought we had only just had Christmas.’ Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has complained of having to intervene in policy rows with Home Secretary Theresa May on an 'almost daily basis' Mr Cable reignited coalition tensions on immigration yesterday after warning David Cameron’s target would not be met. He said: 'Setting an arbitrary cap is not helpful, it almost certainly won’t achieve the below 100,000 level the Conservatives have set, so let’s be practical about it.’ Meanwhile, Mr Clegg no longer views as Mr Cable as a threat to his leadership, but expects him to play a key role in the next election campaign. ‘Vince has been put back in his box,’ said a senior Lib Dem source. Another source close to Mr Clegg said: ‘The danger to Nick’s leadership has passed, he is in a stronger position than he has been at any point in the coalition. If the Lib Dems demanded the Home Office in a coalition deal with Labour, shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper would have to be found another job . ‘At the end of the day Vince will be part of the team up to the election and beyond.’ There is little chance of Mr Cable . becoming Home Secretary in this coalition, but it could be a key demand . of any future coalition talks. Making the Home Office a dealbreaker for a future-power sharing deal would be hugely contentious for both Labour and the Tories. It . would mean the Tories ditching Mrs May or Labour leader Ed Miliband not . keeping Yvette Cooper in the job she currently shadows. Mr Cable has repeatedly clashed with current Home Secretary Theresa May, warning curbs on numbers coming to Britain would cause ‘enormous damage’ particularly to universities which rely on income from overseas students. The Lib Dems have grown increasingly frustrated with the Tory-dominated Home Office. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg complains of having to intervene in policy disputes with Mrs May ‘on an almost daily basis’. The political battles escalated when Lib Dem Norman Baker, who claimed MI5 covered up the death of government weapons adviser Dr David Kelly, implicated the security was made a Home Office minister by Mr Clegg in October’s reshuffle. With Labour’s poll lead over the Tories narrowing, a hung parliament looks increasingly likely in 2015. Mr Clegg is being urged to consider demanding control of one, big government instead of spreading ministers too thinly across Whitehall. A Downing Street source said: 'Theresa May is an excellent Home Secretary.'","Lib Dem Business Secretary has given up hope of becoming Chancellor .

The body of Paul Bagnall, a student at Darrick Wood school in Orpington, Kent, was discovered by his mother Sandrine, 44, on Tuesday.

British diplomats are being forced to serve drinks in plastic glasses and use cheap wine following a string of government cut-backs, it has been revealed. They are also having to swap their previously lavish private residences for restaurants and commercial outlets in a bid to meet a new entertainment budget. The 'low cost' functions are a far cry from Ferrero Rocher's infamous advert, which portrays ambassador's parties as extravagant, luxurious and 'exquisite' affairs. Contrast: Ferrero Rocher's 'Ambassador's Party' advert portrays functions as luxurious and 'exquisite' affairs . The classic 'Ambassador's Party' advert - which became cult viewing in the 1990s - features an ambassador with 'exquisite taste' entertaining guests with a pyramid of gold-wrapped chocolates. It then sees a beautiful woman taking a chocolate, before declaring in a foreign accent ' Monsieur, with these Rocher you are really spoiling us'. British diplomats' more modest functions were highlighted yesterday in a report by the House of Commons foreign affairs committee, according to The Telegraph. The report warns that government cuts to . the entertainment budget are affecting morale - with staff also facing a . larger workload following the five-year £170million savings ordered by a . spending review in 2010.

Yesterday, Sir Richard Ottaway, Tory MP and . chairman of the committee, said that the Foreign Office was 'being worked to . the limit'. 'We have no problem with an . active and ambitious foreign policy, but we're getting a . distinct impression that the FCO may be trying to do too much, when . capacity is limited by a tough spending review settlement,' he said. The cuts have also forced embassies to hire local, cheaper employees - with more junior staff being given the task of entertaining dignitaries. This has led to difficulties when hiring venues for functions, as only ambassadors are permitted to rent properties large enough for official entertaining, the report said. It added that the hosting of functions at public premises is now considered to be 'the norm'. A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'The Foreign Affairs Committee’s annual inquiry into the FCO highlights the excellent work the FCO is doing in many areas despite government-wide spending constraints. 'While we continue to face budget pressures we are committed to meeting our planned headcount reduction of 10 per cent by the end of 2015-2016.

Emma Fisher (pictured) lied about having terminal cancer and losing a baby in order to cash in on fraudulent insurance claims . A conwoman lied about having terminal cancer, losing a baby, having a dead dog and being the victim of domestic abuse in order to cash in on fraudulent insurance claims. Emma Fisher, 27, went to extraordinary lengths to manipulate insurers, banks and a housing association into acting on 22 fraudulent claims and made a further 43 that were not paid out. The woman, from Willenhall, West Midlands, who was even moved into a specially-adapted home to help her cope with a non-existent disability, has been jailed. She received £8,500 from 11 bogus insurance pay-outs between August 2008 and July 2012. Fisher claimed she was left with permanent injuries after being the victim of domestic violence. And on one occasion she supplied a fake veterinary record to bolster her insurance claim for a dead Chihuahua dog. She was jailed yesterday for 22 months after pleading guilty to 22 counts of fraud by false representation at Wolverhampton Crown Court. The court was asked to take into consideration 43 additional counts of fraud relating to insurance matters when sentencing. Fisher swindled insurers by impersonating professionals in positions of authority, including doctors and police officers, and forged documentation in support of her claims. She would then hound the issuer repeatedly on the telephone until they agreed to pay out. Fisher’s crime spree was first uncovered in January 2012 when she was given a police caution for eight fraud offences committed between January 2009 and October 2011. But the true extent of her repeated offending emerged three months later following referrals to the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department (IFED) from two insurers, Direct Line and RSA. She was jailed for 22 months after pleading guilty to 22 counts of fraud by false representation at Wolverhampton Crown Court . Detective Constable Alex Cooley, who led IFED’s investigation, said: ‘Fisher was a criminal out of control who, over a number of years, devoted herself to the pursuit of making fraudulent claims in an ongoing quest to feather her own nest at the expense of others. ‘No tale was too tall, no personal hardship too extreme for her to fabricate, as she continued to offend, even after being brought to book back in 2012.’ Sean Kyne, Acting Sector Crown Prosecutor from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘Motivated by greed, Emma Fisher used highly unscrupulous methods to defraud institutions out of thousands of pounds in order to fund her lifestyle. ‘The CPS will now take steps to recover the amount stolen.’","Emma Fisher had 22 fraudulent claims acted on while a further 43 were not .

The final whistle had just brought the curtain down on Manchester United’s worst week for two decades when the questions started. Chief among the topics being fiercely discussed was the plight of one young winger, who had sat impassively on the bench as his team-mates laboured against Sunderland, suffering their third defeat in seven numbing days. What has happened to Wilfried Zaha? VIDEO Scroll down to watch the best and worst of Zaha with England U21s . Familiar sight: Many Manchester United fans would like to have seen more of Wilfried Zaha at Old Trafford . Main man and forgotten man: Zaha (right) has only played 22 Premier League minutes with Robin van Persie . With United looking for inspiration, why didn’t David Moyes turn to the jet-heeled 21-year-old? His potential has been the talk of football for 18 months and more; he has tricks, speed and his shots can be as ferocious as a clap of thunder. He can take teams apart, too. On a freezing night in Wycombe last March, he tore through Romania’s Under 21s; Zaha was also the reason Crystal Palace reached the Championship play-off final in May, with two goals against Brighton. This young man can play. So surely, United supporters argued, there was something more sinister behind Zaha’s inactivity? Why else would a player who commanded a fee rising to £15million last January be forced to endure a campaign in which his time on the pitch adds up to a meagre 167 minutes? Theorists say it is an agenda. The truth is much simpler. Moyes is not a manager who will keep a player sidelined for no apparent reason. In his world, the team is king and winning is all that matters; he wants those he chooses to go to war with to have many qualities but it would be risible to say he favours artisans over artists. Hard work and discipline are virtues he extols but, above all, he wants players who provide magic. You only have to spend time in his company, away from the glare of cameras and microphones, to see him enthuse about those individuals who have a style and swagger above the norm. Zaha has the tools to thrill – he has been known to start competitions with Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling during England Under 21 training sessions to see who can produce the best moment of skill – but does he have the correct attitude? The answer, at the moment, would have to be no. Zaha failed to impress with his body language during the European Under 21 Championship last summer; he never looked like he wanted to be in Israel and that enraged the England players who had given everything to be there. Outcasts: Both Zaha (right) and Shinji Kagawa have got used to life on the bench under David Moyes . Game-changer: Zaha was electric during his time at Crystal Palace (right) but hasn't hit those heights... yet . Wilfried Zaha has played a mere 28 minutes in the Premier League for Manchester United in two cameo substitute appearances - and he had to wait for December for his first top-flight match. Dec 7: Man Utd 0 Newcastle 1 (22 mins) Dec 15: Aston Villa 0 Man Utd 3 (six mins) He has not really made an impact in those games, having just 29 touches in 28 minutes. He has had one (off-target) shot, and has tried just 11 passes, completing 64 per cent of them. Most surprisingly for Zaha, given his style of play, he has attempted just four dribbles and only one of those has been a success. His one cross also came to nothing. Surliness is not something that will be tolerated at Old Trafford, either. Moyes will be scrutinising Zaha every day on the training pitches at Carrington; his coaching staff talk to him all the time, reporting what he has done well and the areas on which he can improve. If Zaha was hitting the levels expected of a United player, pushing himself to the limit and striving to improve, there is no question Moyes would have used him in more than just four games (and one of those was the Community Shield). As he continues to be out of the team, you can deduce that he doesn’t yet appreciate what is expected of him. 'Wilf has not appeared,’ Moyes said. ‘We have not felt we have had the opportunity. I want Wilf to get used to what happens here. The competition is hard. It is important Wilf gets to see the level of the training here, the level of the players and the quality they have got. He is getting better.’ Silverware: Wilfried Zaha holds the Championship play-off trophy after helping Palace to the top flight . Demanding: Moyes offers some advice to his young player during United's pre-season tour . Arm round the shoulder: But Moyes has rarely uttered the words, 'On you go, son' to Zaha . Those words were delivered on October 15 last year, so the fact he has started one Capital One Cup tie and made two cameo appearances in the Barclays Premier League since makes it clear Zaha has 'not got better' as quickly as Moyes would have anticipated. It would, of course, be wrong to write off his United career at this juncture but it is equally difficult to escape the feeling that Zaha needs to appreciate what an opportunity he has. If he continues to drift along, it will be gone before he realises what he had. ‘I am sure in time he will be an asset for Manchester United but I guess everything there with the new manager and everything, everybody is getting used to a new way of working,’ England Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate observed last autumn. Time to shine: Zaha will have to up his game if he is to break into the United first team . The competition: Wide men Ashley Young (left) and Antonio Valencia (right) are preferred to the youthful Zaha . Final fling: £15m Zaha was Sir Alex Ferguson's last purchase as United manager . ‘Wilf has only just arrived there and I think from his point of view, it is as important that the new manager can see what he is about as it is for him to go and play first-team football. They will make a decision (about loaning him out) based on that, I am sure.’ United are willing to let Zaha leave on loan this window. That Moyes is prepared to sanction such a move means he doesn’t feel Sir Alex Ferguson’s final buy is ready to contribute. Only time will tell if he ever is. Abject: Zaha was part of a poor England campaign at the European Under 21 Championship in Israel . That's better: In March last year, Zaha was in fine form against Romania in Wycombe . Bust up: Zaha (in ring, yellow boots) and England U21 team-mate Ravel Morrison (red boots) have a scuffle .","Winger has played just 167 minutes for Manchester United this season .

Rowan Williams, the former Archbishop of Canterbury, has criticised 'short-term' celebrity style weddings . The former Archbishop of Canterbury has attacked glamorous weddings as being part of the 'short-term, unimaginative, emotionally unintelligent' culture of modern Britain. Rowan Williams, who married the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, said marriage was now being marketed to people as a day long experience, rather than a lifetime commitment. Speaking at a debate hosted by law firm Winckworth Sherwood in London, Lord Williams also criticised pre-nuptual agreements for undermining the trust at the heart of marriage. According to The Telegraph, he said: 'We need to take a long hard look at the marketisation of marriage. 'That is the perfect relationship crystalised in the perfect wedding day - the immense economic, advertising investment in this massively fantastical experience which you go through on your wedding day, after which, of course, nothing is ever quite so good again. 'That is an aspect I think of the short-term, unimaginative, emotionally unintelligent climate that sometimes we seem forced to inhabit.' Lord Williams, who stepped down as Archbishop last year and became master of Magdalene college at the University of Cambridge, said that the modern urge for short-term gratification was also to blame. He urged people to focus on their long-term growth as a person, rather than being distracted with temporary enjoyment in fast-paced society. He added: 'Marriage has faced many changes and pressures, such as evolving working patterns and a reluctance for many people to think about their long-term well-being. 'Yet much remains unchanged; the majority . of children are, for example, still born to married couples and there . remains a strong desire for the public affirmation of commitment.' Lord Williams, who also criticsed pre-nup agreements, married the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Katie Price has famously had several short-lived marriages including to Alex Reid (pictured) which lasted less than a year. She also famously rode to one of the ceremonies in a Cinderella-style pumpkin carriage . He also criticised pre-nups as creating a relationship 'governed by contract' in which both partners were only thinking of what they could get out of it. His warning echoes that of Iain Duncan Smith, the work and pensions secretary, who said in December that a fixation with 'glitzy, celebrity' weddings fuelled by glossy magazines is overshadowing the true meaning of marriage. At the time he warned that the obsession with expensive nuptials was discouraging many youngsters from tying the knot and starting families and saddling those that do with debts from the ceremony that add strain to their relationships.","Former Archbishop Rowan Williams has criticised celebrity-style weddings .

Facial oils, once the preserve of slightly batty aromatherapists and all but the crinkliest of crinklies, have gone mainstream over the past few years. L'Oreal, always a litmus test of what’s marketable and mainstream in beauty, is preparing to launch one on January 20 for the first time in the company's history (Age Perfect Extraordinary Facial Oil, £24.99, with ingredients that include orange peel, geranium and rose), while the shelves of Boots already resemble the condiments section of Sainsbury's. As someone who has always suffered from dry skin, I've long been a fan of facial oils. I first started adding rosehip oil to my face cream in my early 20s. Slick: Sarah has long been a fan of facial oils . Back then, you could only get it from health food stores, stashed away between the bleach-free tampons and the linseed oils. Rio Rosa Mosqueta was the brand, all the way from the Chilean Andes. The packaging looked like it had been designed by a yeti - and it didn't smell much better either. The brand still exists (riorosa.co.uk) and the product has since been refined a little - although not too much. It remains basic, but excellent: 100 per cent natural, lightweight, long-lasting and, at about £10 for 20 ml, very good value for money. Its biggest and best rival is Trilogy's Certified Organic Rosehip Oil, which is a rather slicker proposition in terms of packaging and marketing, including celebrity endorsements (always a boon) from Miranda Kerr and Anna Friel. Sarah recommends... Body Shop Vitamin E Facial Oil, left, and Clarins Blue Orchid Oil . Both these oils are pure rosehip. Many of the newer facial oils on the market, however, offer a combination of ingredients, from plant and flower essential oils to other oils entirely - argan, avocado, carrot, raspberry, hazelnut, sesame and so on (if you are allergic to nuts, do please check the ingredients of any oil you are thinking of buying). Some combine elements of nature with . so-called 'cosmeceuticals': ingredients such as peptides to help . brighten and decongest the skin, for example, or plant stem-cells. The . biggest misconception about facial oils is that they are not suitable . for oily or combination skins and that they will make your face look . shiny and greasy. In fact, providing you use them judiciously, they can . benefit all types, from the most sensitive to the most troublesome. On . combination skins, for example, the right facial oil will help reduce . the chances of acne scarring and even soothe break-outs. The skin condition rosacea, for example, is exacerbated by products that dry out the skin since stripping away the natural oils simply sends a signal to the body to produce more. Acne-prone skin, especially in adults, is often also dehydrated - which is why it can be so hard to treat effectively. And anyone taking medication for their acne will also find that their skin becomes noticeably drier and tighter; again, a few drops of the right oil will soothe and treat without leaving behind a heavy patina of product. This time of year, though, is hell for all skin types - especially given some of the mad weather we've been having lately. Cold winds, freezing rain, blow-heaters in shops and bone-dry central heating: this is when the facial oil really comes into its own. The key to remember is to use only the smallest amount. I have a big face and very dry skin, but if I'm using the Trilogy Rosehip, for example, two drops in the palm of a hand is more than enough. Rub your hands together to warm the oil, and then just press your palms into your face before massaging in any excess. If you like, you can add a day or night cream over the top. If my skin is really dehydrated, I exfoliate first and then pop a treatment mask over the top (not one of those clay ones, obviously, but a moisturising mask). The only thing I would caution against is getting the stuff in your eyes - they will puff up; and if you're using an oil at night, allow it a couple of minutes to sink in before you turn the light out, otherwise you will just end up with a well-moisturised pillow case. Banish bags: Clinique under eye serum . One of the most common complaints around this time of year is dark shadows and bags under the eyes. It's a combination of factors: lack of sleep, early mornings, a general feeling of liverishness after all those mince pies and extra glasses of wine, and the kind of winter pallor that sets in after months without sunshine. The area under the eyes is a tricky one. The skin is thin, and there's also not a lot of tissue there. As we get older, this can lead to a slightly cavernous effect, as the skin slackens and the supporting fat and muscle degrades. Dark shadows deepen and loss of volume can be a problem. This can be corrected by surgery or, in some cases with filler (known as tear-trough rejuvenation); but the effects are not always an unqualified success - plus they are painful and expensive. Before you resort to any of that, there is much that can be done with a few clever tricks. Simply distracting the eye visually from your dark shadows is the first step. A good eyebrow shape, for example, opens up the eye area, framing the face and making you look brighter and more alert. Eyelash curlers too will help. It can be tempting to try to eliminate dark shadows by piling on the under-eye concealer. This is not a good idea: everyone, even the most fresh of face, has a degree of shading under and around the eye, so if you strip this out altogether, you'll just look weird, like those men from that strange Channel 4 documentary the other night (Secrets Of The Living Dolls, it was called, all about gentlemen who like to wear giant latex lady-suits in their leisure time. Most peculiar). A total white-out will also make your eyes look smaller. So be judicious, and stay close to your natural skin tone to avoid the dreaded reverse-panda effect. Dot the product on the inside of the eyes, near the bridge of the nose, under the eyes and at the edges, and blend well. CRUSH... Nars Limited Edition Multiple Duo Foolproof colour at its best - £33, narscosmetics.com . FAIL... 'Bikini bridge' aka a picture of a piece of Lycra suspended over a concave stomach. Go and eat cake, for heaven's sake. If your bags are dreadful, there is something to be said for embracing them, and working the consumptive look. Smudgy black eyeliner and muted plums are ideal, or soft greys if you're a blonde. Avoid browns: they'll just make you look even more tired. Add a feverish flush to the cheeks, and you should get away with it. In terms of eye creams, serums and gels, it's good to find one that has a rollerball applicator, since the process of circular massage will help decongest the area. Again, don't go overboard on the amount of product, but do make sure you keep the area well-hydrated, as dryness will only contribute to the look of exhaustion. Clinique All About Eyes Serum (£22), for example, is an excellent choice; for what it's worth I'm very pleased with my Nourish Kale Anti-Ageing Eye Cream (£29.50, nourishskinrange.com).","Facial oils were once the preserve of slightly batty aromatherapists .

George Cushingberry Jr, 61, was pulled over Tuesday night . around 10pm but let go after a supervisor and several police officers decided . to let him off with a warning. Early reports suggested he was leaving a strip club, had an . open bottle of alcohol in the car and smelled of marijuana, but the politician . fired back in a series of interviews in the past 24 hours. On the defensive: Detroit City Councilman George Cushingberry Jr. talks about the traffic stop during a Detroit Free-Press interview . ‘It’s a part of what I call the driving while black syndrome . amongst these white cops in Detroit who pick on people with old cars,’ he told WXYZ. A Detroit News report said that Mr Cushingberry was leaving . Starvin Marvin’s strip club, on the city’s northwest side, and almost hit two . police officers. Police sources told the paper that more than one squad car . had to chase him down before he finally stopped. Cops claim they spotted an . open bottle of liquor and smelled marijuana. Authorities then claimed that he tried to take off again . once stopped. The councilman was pulled over more than six miles south of . the strip club. Several officers then decided to let him go with a ticket . for a traffic infraction. Mr Cushingberry gave a far different account of what . happened in interviews with both WXYZ and the Detroit Free-Press. In an outdoor interview from near the Penthouse Lounge, . where he claimed to be eating dinner at with a friend, Mr Cushingberry told . WXYZ that he never went to a strip club. Cops say he was here: Police sources told the Detroit News the politician was seen Tuesday evening leaving this West Side strip club just before 10pm . Just a neighborhood bar: Mr Cushingberry claims he had dinner at this bar and was not at a strip club . ‘[After leaving] I was pulled over by the police… I was a . little down there,’ he said pointing down the street. ‘I was asked ‘turn the . car off!’ and I got scared, I didn’t know what I was doing. ‘I wait 10 minutes and nobody comes, I turn the car back on, . [the officer] jumps out of the car and tells me that I was trying to get away,’ he added, saying he drives an ‘old Buick.’ ‘There was no police chase,’ he told the station. He turned . the car back on for warmth. Mr Cushingberry then explained the marijuana odor came from . passenger Richard Clement, a medical marijuana card holder, having some in a . belt holster. The Detroit News also reported Mr Clement having a medical . marijuana card. ‘They grabbed both of us and handcuffed us to the back of . the car in the 10 below zero weather as if we were some kind of criminals,’ Mr . Cushingberry recalled. He showed his city council identification and a driver’s . license ‘to show I’m no criminal.’ He vehemently denied smoking marijuana in . the car. ‘I wasn’t doing anything wrong,’ he said, explaining the . liquor bottle was empty and in the back of the car – no drinking had taken . place in the car, it was left over from a previous event. 'It was not a strip club': The city councilman claims he was never at a strip club, but instead eating dinner at the Penthouse Lounge . On the job less than two weeks: Mr Cushingberry was recently elected, but he's already managed to generate controversy . ‘They found an old bottle, the reason the patrol supervisor . let me go was because it was empty,’ said the politician, admitting they had a . single drink during dinner – but that the lack of sobriety tests proved he was . sober. Police decided to call in a supervisor, who Mr Cushingberry . told the Free-Press ‘could see how bogus’ the ordeal was, explaining why he and . his friend were let go. ‘They had nine cops come and talk to me, they knew I wasn’t . drunk,’ said Mr Cushingberry. He was issued a ticket for ‘failure to signal,’ according to . the Free Press. A practicing lawyer, he told the paper intends to fight it. Mr Cushingberry was recently elected as president pro-tem, . or second in command of the council. He blamed the stop on racial profiling. Hellion activities: Mr Cushingberry defended telling the Detroit News to 'go to hell' and said he stands by the comments . A police spokesperson declined to comment to the Free-Press, . citing an investigation into how the stop was handled, but said ‘there may be . criminal charges’ filed against Mr Cushingberry. The incident puts a bow on what has been a wild week for Mr . Cushingberry. A Detroit News editorial from Tuesday called him a terrible . choice for pro-tem, ‘an old-school political operative’ and offered him up as . proof ‘the council is setting itself up to fall back into bad habits.’ He responded in a colorful Facebook post that drew . widespread condemnation. ‘Dear Detroit News: Go to hell.

What we can’t take is the real likelihood that Cushingberry and crew will continue the Detroit City Council tradition of taking the city to hell.' The post has since been deleted, and the politician claimed . a staffer had wrote it – but he stood by the comments in a bizarre Fox Detroit . interview. ‘That’s the truth, he told the station. ‘They can take all . that straight to hell because that's hellion activities.’","George Cushingberry Jr, 61, was recently elected as second in command of the Detroit City Council .

A little girl who was not expected to survive for 24 hours after her birth is set to take part in a 10k walk to raise money for the hospital that saved her life. Hannah Erskine, now three, was born with the main arteries in her heart the wrong way around and with a rare and potentially life-threatening infection she picked up in her mother’s womb. Her parents, Gillian and William, were delighted when their little girl arrived, but just seconds later the new born turned blue and was fighting for breath. Hannah Erskine (pictured with her parents, William and Gillian) was born with the main arteries in her heart the wrong way around and with a severe infection. Her parents were warned she would probably not survive . She was so sick doctors warned the couple, from Inverkip, near Glasgow, that they did not expect her to survive. She needed life-saving hypothermia treatment, where medics reduced her body temperature to just 32C to prevent damage caused by a lack of oxygen to the brain. She also battled countless complications, five weeks on a ventilator, and four major operations - the first at just one day old. But against all odds, Hannah is now like any healthy, active toddler. And to thank the hospital and the ‘hero’ surgeon who saved her, in April she will join family and friends by taking part in the Glasgow Wee Walk to raise money for Yorkhill Children’s Charity which supports The Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, in Glasgow. Mrs Erskine, 36, said: ‘To look at her, you wouldn’t know there had been anything wrong. She looks completely healthy. Hannah (pictured in hospital as a baby) was thought to be healthy when she was first born but she rapidly turned blue and started to struggle to breathe . ‘She’s a great wee walker and if she gets tired on the walk we can put her on our shoulders. There will be enough family there, I’m sure she’ll get there in the end. ‘She’s such a fighter and so strong-willed and I think that’s why she’s here, at the end of the day. ‘But we can never repay everyone at Yorkhill for saving her life.’ Hannah was born at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley on June 27, 2010, weighing a healthy 8lb 5oz. Mrs Erskine got to hold her briefly after she arrived, but Hannah made only the faintest of sounds and started to turn blue. Hannah had to have four major operations and spent five weeks on a ventilator but she is now a healthy child at home with her parents . She was whisked away to intensive care where she was hooked up to a ventilator. Doctors at Paisley, who thought she had swallowed potentially deadly fluids in the womb, managed to keep Hannah alive until she could be transferred to Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow for specialist care. But as the neonatal ambulances in the area were all being used, she had to wait for one to arrive from 40 miles away in Edinburgh. She was nine hours old when she arrived at Yorkhill, where tests confirmed she had transposition of the great arteries. The condition meant the main arteries were swapped around, starving her body of oxygen. Hannah (pictured in hospital with her father, William) had to have life-saving hypothermia treatment after her birth - it saw medics reduce her body temperature to just 32C to prevent damage caused by a lack of oxygen . Mrs Erskine, a teacher, said: ‘It was devastating. When she was born we were expecting this perfect baby. But when she didn’t make a proper cry it was just a tiny noise, I just panicked. ‘I was distraught. I was in my own room and my baby wasn’t with me - she wasn’t even in the same hospital. ‘At my 20 week scan she was lying the wrong way so I was called back so they could check her heart and we were told it was normal so we just assumed everything was fine. ‘We even joked, at least we know the heart’s ok.’ But at just a day old Hannah needed an emergency operation to create a hole in her heart to help her circulation. Mrs Erskine (pictured with Hannah in hospital) said: 'She's such a fighter and so strong-willed and I think that's why she's here, at the end of the day. But we can never repay everyone at Yorkhill for saving her life' The life-saving procedure is normally carried out by surgeons but as they were all in theatre, her consultant made the decision to carry it out on the ward. Mrs Erskine said: ‘The procedure involved going through a vein in the groin to get to the heart. But she was so sick it was impossible for him to tell the difference between a vein and an artery and unfortunately he chose the artery. ‘The artery collapsed and she had to have a graft of the artery to repair it. But this ultimately saved her life because if he hadn’t done it right then she wouldn’t have made it. Her consultant was just amazing.’ Doctors also confirmed she had a major infection, group B streptococcus, which affects just one in 2,000 babies, and warned that Hannah might not survive her first night. The bacteria are found in one in three women and normally have no effect on babies but on rare occasions mothers can pass it on to their unborn child. Hannah is now to take part in a fundraising walk to help raise money for the hospital that saved her life . Mrs Erskine said: ‘I was discharged from Paisley that evening and I went straight to Yorkhill and almost immediately a team of medics - there was about five of them – explained to us how ill our daughter was and that they didn’t know if she was going to make it. ‘It was just a complete rollercoaster. There were so many ups and downs. Sometimes she would seem to be doing fine, and then the next our world was turned upside down because she had crashed. ‘She was attached to hundreds of wires and machines. It was like a God send every time a machine was taken off her because it was a step closer to her getting better.’ However, she had to wait until she had battled the major infection before she could have her nine-hour open-heart surgery at two weeks old. Following the operation, Hannah seemed to be doing well and at six weeks old she was finally allowed home. After Hannah had been released from hospital for the first time, she had to be rushed straight back to have part of her bowel removed. She was in hospital for another two months before finally being allowed home for good . But the family’s joy was short-lived. Hannah was home for just one hour when she had to be rushed back into hospital for emergency surgery that night to have part of her bowel removed. Mrs Erskine said: ‘It was hurdle after hurdle. ‘It was hard to stay positive but we had a lot of support from the hospital staff and our families.’ Mrs Erskine hailed her surgeon, Mark Danton, a ‘life saver’ and a ‘hero’, adding: ‘We can never repay everyone at Yorkhill for saving her life. ‘They were just wonderful and so dedicated. We can’t thank them enough.’ Mrs Erskine said: 'It was hurdle after hurdle. It was hard to stay positive but we had a lot of support from the hospital staff and our families.' Hannah is pictured in hospital . Hannah spent two months clinging to life in Yorkhill before she was finally allowed home for good. And since that day her family has never looked back. Mrs Erskine said: ‘It was a dream come true when we finally got her home. We were just over the moon. It was great waking up each day and getting a cuddle from my daughter and being able to do normal things that families do.’ And when she attended her daughter’s nursery nativity last month, it was a moment she never thought would happen. Mrs Erskine said: ‘I was sitting watching her with a lump in my throat bursting with pride. Mrs Erskine said: 'It was a dream come true when we finally got her home. We were just over the moon. It was great waking up each day and getting a cuddle from my daughter.' Hannah is pictured after surgery . ‘When you are standing beside her hospital bed you don’t envisage seeing the next day, never mind a few years down the line. But there she was, standing on the stage as an angel, doing all the actions. She was just fantastic. ‘We’re lucky we had such a happy ending,’ said Mrs Erskine. ‘We are very fortunate and feel so blessed and thankful every day to Yorkhill and when she’s older, hopefully, Hannah will take on fundraising for Yorkhill Children’s Charity.’ In the meantime, the toddler, who loves swimming, dancing and riding her bike, will join her family and friends on April 27 at Loch Lomond for the 10k Wee Walk in aid of the charity. Mrs Erskine said: ‘What she has come through is remarkable and she amazes us every day.’ Transposition of the great arteries is a condition in which the two main blood vessels leaving the heart - the pulmonary artery and the aorta - are switched. This means the pulmonary artery is joined to the left ventricle and the aorta is joined to the right ventricle when it should be the other way around. As a result, blood flows to the lungs to pick up oxygen but is then pumped back to the lungs rather than around the body. Blood flowing around the body is unable to reach the lungs to pick up oxygen so just continues circulating. Children with the condition require surgery to correct it. Without this, they will not survive. The condition affects about one baby in every 4,000.

Astronomers are to use the distorting effects of gravity in a distant galaxy cluster as a magnifying glass to peer closer at distant galaxies than has ever been possible before. This image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows Abell 2744, a distant region of space known as Pandora's Cluster, which is so massive that its gravity distorts space time around it. The distortion creates a range of odd optical effects; but interestingly it also magnifies the light from even more far away objects hidden behind Abell 2744, allowing astronomers to see them in better detail. Pandora's Cluster: The space time distortion around Abell 2744, a massive galaxy cluster created by the collision of four previously separate clusters, is helping astronomers to peer deeper into the distant cosmos . Abell 2744 is the product of the violent and simultaneous collision of four galaxy clusters over 350million years . It was first spotted by Hubble in 2011, when observations of its weird and wonderful properties promped the nickname Pandora's Cluster. This latest long-exposure image of the cluster shows a mix of hazy elliptical galaxies and colourful spirals clumped together in the centre, Nasa explained in a statement. The effects of the powerful gravitational field can be seen in the blue arcs and distorted images scattered across the frame, that seem to be bleeding into the surrounding space. The arcs, Nasa says, are in fact the distorted images of galaxies even further in the distance. Abell . 2744 is the first of six targets for an observing programme known as . Frontier Fields, a three-year operation to probe the deepest views of . the Universe yet seen in visible light. It's continuing mission: Abell 2744 is the first of six targets Hubble will look at for a three-year observing programme known as Frontier Fields . In order to do this, the Hubble will exploit so-called gravitational lensing effects around its targets to peer beyond them into the unknown depths of the cosmos. A Nasa spokesman explained: 'Gravitational lensing is a phenomenon caused by an object's influence on the space-time around it. 'Massive . objects like galaxy clusters warp and distort this space-time. This . causes light from more distant objects hidden behind this makeshift lens . to be deflected and bent, leading to a bizarre array of optical effects . — for example, it caused a cosmic space invader to appear around . cluster Abell 68 by creating mirror images of one galaxy, as well as . smearing galaxies out into arcs, and creating multiple images of . individual objects. 'As well . as creating these weird shapes, lensing also magnifies the images so . that astronomers can see more detail. This means that distant objects . that otherwise would be too distant and faint to be seen become visible — . something that Frontier Fields aims to exploit over the coming years.' The . programme is already beginning to bear fruit. In a paper submitted to . The Astrophysical Journal last November a group os astronomers told how . they had detected a large number of possible galaxies through the . gravitational lens of Abell 2744. They found that five of these galaxy candidates are part of distant systems that appeared to have been imaged multiple times due to the cluster's gravitational effects. Nasa's spokesman added: 'These deep surveys using massive galaxy clusters like Abell 2744 show that looking through cosmic lenses can be an effective and useful way to study the distant Universe.'","The gravity around Abell 2744 is so strong it distorts space time .
This allows astronomers to use it like a magnifying glass to see beyond .

It covers very easily and gives a nice tan and you can keep building it up as you wish. I start with a small amount as it takes about a minute to rub in properly and then I can add more.

The federal government has announced it will recognize . same-sex marriages performed in Utah. Attorney General Eric Holder announced Friday the more than 1,000 . unions performed in the state prior to the Supreme Court putting them on hold . will be eligible for federal benefits such as joint tax returns and spousal . visas. Families should not be asked to endure uncertainty regarding . their benefits while courts decide the issue of same-sex marriage in Utah, Mr . Holder said in a video on the Justice Department's website. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Big announcement: Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal government will extend full benefits to same-sex couples already married in Utah . The decision flies in the face of Utah authorities who . earlier this week refused to legally recognize the marriages. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert even told state agencies this week . not authorize benefits for married gay and lesbian couples until the courts . make a decision. Neither Mr Herbert nor Utah State Attorney General Sean . Reyes had immediate comment on Holder's announcement. More than 1,000 gay and lesbian couples have taken home . marriage licenses from local clerks since Utah's same-sex marriage ban was . overturned Dec. 20 by a federal judge – a decision that came into direct . conflict with a ban voted into law nine years ago. State officials have railed against gay marriage despite . changing public sentiment around gay marriage. Almost 73 per cent of locals responding to a recent Fox 13 poll . supported allowing gay marriages to continue in the state and about 20 per cent . directly opposed the unions. The rest either felt the government shouldn’t have a say in . such matters or simply didn’t care one way or another about the issue. Perhaps even more telling, the Mormon Church has decided against a rumored court filing in support of halting gay marriages, according to a separate Fox 13 report. Finnaly: Cheryl Haws, right, and her partner Shelly Eyre have their photograph taken after receiving their marriage license last month at the Utah County Clerk's office in Provo . Happily ever after: Natalie Dicou, left, and Nicole Christensen, right, are married last month by Salt Lake City Mayor Ralph Becker, middle, in the lobby of the Salt Lake County Clerk's Office . The U.S. Supreme Court put a halt Monday to same-sex . marriages in the heavily Mormon state while the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit . Court of Appeals considers the long-term question of whether gay couples have a . right to marry in Utah. State agencies aren't supposed to revoke anything already . issued, such as a marriage certificate or a driver's license with a new name, . but they are prohibited from approving any new marriages or benefits. The validity of the marriages will ultimately be decided by . the appeals court, officials said. Mr Holder's declaration marked the latest chapter in the . legal battle over same-sex marriage in Utah that has sent couples and state . officials on a helter-skelter wave of emotions over the last three weeks. Federal government agencies have previously confirmed that . same-sex couples in other states are entitled to federal benefits, but this is . the first time the Attorney General has come out publicly and issued this kind . of guidance, said Douglas NeJaime, a professor of law at the University of . California, Irvine. ‘Symbolically, it's an important step that the federal; . government has taken,’ said Mr NeJaime. He explained it is hardly surprising, especially since the . federal government has insisted for several years that same-sex marriages be . honored. ‘The fed government has been pushing up against the states . that do not recognize same-sex marriages already,’ Mr NeJaime said. ‘This is . another step in that direction.’ Mr Holder said in a video on the Justice Department's . website that the government will coordinate among agencies in the coming days . to make sure Utah couples get the federal benefits they are entitled to. The attorney general said that ‘for purposes of federal law, . these marriages will be recognized as lawful and considered eligible for all . relevant federal benefits on the same terms as other same-sex marriages.’ Holder's declaration was greeted with applause among . same-sex couples in Utah. ‘It gives me hope moving forward in the appeals process,’ Moudi Sbeity said. ‘It shows that there really is a social and cultural shift . in viewpoints and mindsets toward marriage equality.’ Mr Sbeity and partner Derek Kitchen are among three couples . who brought the Utah lawsuit that led to the surprise Dec. 20 ruling by U.S. District Judge Robert Shelby, who said the state's ban on same-sex marriage . violated gay and lesbian couples' constitutional rights. The U.S. Supreme Court: Appeals may bring the question of gay marriage all the way to the nation's highest court . Mr Sbeity explained that he hopes Mr Holder's declaration . will persuade Gov. Herbert to shift the state's position. ‘I'm sure he doesn't . want 1,300 lawsuits on his desk,’ Sbeity said. Several hundred same-sex marriage supporters were planning a . rally at the Utah State Capitol on Friday afternoon. Organizers planned to . deliver a petition to the governor and state attorney general asking them to . let the federal judge's ruling stand and allow gay marriages to continue. Tim Wagner of Salt Lake City, one of the organizers of the . rally said Holder's announcement was ‘pretty amazing’ and a great thing for the . newly married couples. ‘It sounds like our national attorney general actually sees . the law in the way it should be acknowledged,’ Mr Wagner said. ‘The law is on . the side of rights and the people who want to love the people they love.’ Devastated: Michael Mathie proposed to his partner Tyler McCraley on Christmas. The next day, they joined the historic rush of same-sex couples getting marriage licenses in Utah but planned their ceremony too late - the unions have been halted . Now on hold:  Michael Mathie was supposed to marry partner Tyler McCraley this weekend, now they must wait . On Thursday, the Utah attorney general issued legal advice . to local clerks, advising them to finish paperwork for same-sex marriages . completed before the Supreme Court issued a temporary halt. Mr Reyes' new advice was issued to clear up some confusion . and only applies to marriages that were solemnized, a spokesperson said. ‘As long as the marital ceremony happened prior to the stay, . then the marriage can receive documentation,’ the spokesperson added. The attorney general's office said Thursday's guidance was . not a decision on whether the marriages are valid.","The federal government will extend benefits to all gay marriages performed in the state prior to the court-ordered halt issued this week .

A man who shot and killed former Major League Baseball player Danny Clyburn Jr. has been sentenced to 15 years in prison after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter of his lifelong friend. Derrick McIlwain, 38, shot Clyburn in the heart with an illegal gun on February 7, 2012, during an early-morning argument in an abandoned house in Clyburn's hometown of Lancaster, South Carolina, according to The Herald Online. McIlwain was originally charged with murder, telling police he was angry at Clyburn 'never doing anything for anybody in the ’hood' after starting to play baseball,  however a plea was negotiated on a claim of self-defense and the fact that Clyburn, 37, had marijuana in his system when he was killed. The victim's sister, Alisha Clyburn, was outraged with the sentence. Victim: Danny Clyburn Jr. was kiled in February 2012 by his lifelong friend Derrick McIlwain, who has now been sentenced to 15 years prison for involuntary manslaughter . Killer: Following his arrest for the murder of friend Danny Clyburn Jr, Derrick McIlwain told police Clyburn never did anything for anybody in the ¿hood' after he started playing professional baseball . 'That 15 years is not worth a person’s life,' she told McIlwain in court. 'My brother didn’t have any gun. You should have been a man.' Assistant public defender William Frick said his client feared for his life against the bigger, stronger Clyburn, who had 'made it out of the ’hood and out of Lancaster'. 'Unfortunately he had a firearm, a gun,' Frick told Circuit Court Judge Brian Gibbons. 'But (McIlwain) didn’t get out of the ’hood. He didn’t get out of Lancaster. A lot of people carry small pistols around the ’hood in Lancaster for protection. I don’t like it, but it is a fact of life.' According to The Herald Online, McIlwain - who had no job, no permanent home and a string of previous offenses - was angry that Clyburn hadn't given enough back to his home after becoming famous. McIlwain had expected Clyburn to buy him drinks and the two began to fight, with Clyburn saying he owed McIlwain nothing. McIlwain shot Clyburn once in the heart with an illegal gun. A statement McIlwain gave police after his arrest was read in court Friday. It stunned people in the court – even some who had heard it at previous hearings – with its harsh reality and warped rationale. Promising: In baseball terms, Danny Clyburn Jr was known as a 'five-tool player' because he could hit for average, hit for power, run, field and throw. He died before his career takeoff . 'When he played,' McIlwain told police, 'Clyburn never did anything for anybody in the ’hood.' The shooting happened in a tiny house where nobody actually lived. It was a party spot where some men drank and played cards and just a few doors down from where Clyburn grew up. Clyburn, who lived in California, was only in Lancaster that day in 2012 to visit his father, sister and two children, who live with his ex-wife. He earned about $200,000 a year when playing in the majors – but most years earned far less. That money sent to his family. As a young player in the minor leagues, Clyburn was considered a great prospect. He was what baseball people call a 'five-tool player' – he could hit for average, hit for power, run, field and throw. McIlwain claimed after the killing that he should face no charges under South Carolina’s 'stand your ground' law, but a judge shot that down. Solicitor Doug Barfield conceded that he had to offer a deal in the case because a jury in a murder trial could have agreed that McIlwain had acted in self-defense – and McIlwain might have never been held accountable for the killing. Clyburn's father, Danny Clyburn Sr., attended every one of the court hearings about the killing of his son. On Friday, he spoke quietly and with dignity about getting through the anger of such a senseless killing. He said he “doesn’t know all of what happened that night,” but he does know that his only son is dead from a gunshot.","Tampa Bay Devil Rays player Danny Clyburn was shot once in the heart following an argument on February 7, 2012 in Lancaster, South Carolina .

The human foot found on a southeast Florida beach on New Year's Day has been matched by investigators using DNA to a missing local boater, who media reports say lost a brother in similar circumstances. Dominic Porcaro, 64, had been missing since December 19, when his boat washed ashore in Juno Beach in Palm Beach County. The foot - which was inside a tube sock and midsize white New Balance athletic shoe - was found 13 days later by a beach walker about 20 miles north. DNA profiling confirms that the appendage belonged to Porcaro, a resident of Jupiter, said Amanda Phillips, a spokeswoman for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Police have confirmed a severed human foot that washed ashore a southeast Florida beach on New Years Day belonged to 64-year-old Dominic Porcaro, who had just been released from jail on a drink driving charge when he went missing on December 19 . Dominic Porcaro's foot was found  by a woman on Janaury 1 in a white sneaker under some sea grass on a Jupiter Island beach (pictured) The day before he went missing, Porcaro was released from the Palm Beach County Jail, where he had been booked on a drunk driving charge, according to media reports. Dominic's younger brother, John Anthony Porcaro, disappeared from his Hollywood, Florida, home in June 1998, after going fishing, according to the Palm Beach Post. John Anthony Porcaro was an alleged associate of the Gambino crime family in New York, according to an FBI 'Wanted' notice, and was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2003 for involvement in a South Florida telemarketing scheme in which more than 400 people were defrauded of more than $5 million. According to media reports at the time, he left a note for his wife, Filamena, saying: 'Fil, went fishing, got call, swordfish are biting. Love, J. I'll call you later.' John Anthony Porcaro has not been seen since, and no body has been found. An autopsy on the severed foot belonging to Dominic Porcaro concluded that it likely separated naturally from the decomposing body in the water, either by the force of waves or by a large fish or shark shaking the remains, according to Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. But the cause of death remains under investigation, Phillips said. 'We're not calling it because it's not enough information to go on,' he said. Porcaro's 26-foot boat had run aground near the Jupiter Inlet with damage to the bow, but no blood or personal items were found on board, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Juno Beach police found PorcaroÂ¿s 26-foot cuddy cabin Happy Day Tree abandoned near the Jupiter Inlet early on December 20, the day after he went missing, with some damage to the bow . The foot was one of three discoveries of human remains found on area beaches in recent weeks. A body discovered Saturday along the Jupiter shoreline was that of a Sebastian woman also reported missing December 19. A human bone fragment also was found on a Tequesta beach December 28. According to Fox News, at least 14 human feet clad in shoes have been found on or near beaches in Washington state and British Columbia since 2007. The strange discoveries have led to theories involving a serial killer and the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Only a few of the feet to wash ashore in Canada and Washington in recent years have been identified. Dr. Michael Baden, who served as New York City's Chief Medical Examiner, said that while clothed bodies don't last long in the sea, feet inside shoes can last for years in the ocean. 'The bones start separating naturally as the soft tissue deteriorates,' Baden said. 'And when it comes to the feet, the shoes can really keep those 26 bones [that make up each foot] together. 'Shoes and sneakers tend to be sturdy enough that they can persist for years and decades and they will protect whatever is inside them.'","Severed human foot found inside a white sneaker by a woman walking along Jupiter Beach in Palm Beach County on January 19 .

'Proud': War veteran Harry Thrush has received a photo from Camp Bastion for his 90th birthday . For the past 10 years, he has travelled around Yorkshire consoling the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan. Now, World War Two veteran Harry Thrush has been sent a special present for his 90th birthday. He has received a photo from Camp Bastion - featuring dozens of British servicemen smiling at the camera in front of the high-profile military base. It is accompanied by a touching message, wishing pensioner a 'wonderful' birthday and thanking him for his service. Mr Thrush, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, served as a gunner in Italy during the Second World War. After signing up to the army aged 18 in 1942, he trained in Yorkshire as part of the 7th Mountain Regiment, before spending eight months on mission in Salerno in Campania, south Italy. For the past decade, he has taken his legacy seriously by travelling across Yorkshire to attend the funerals of fallen soldiers. He sits through the services, before meeting the soldiers' families and offering his condolences. So, when Mr Thrust's landmark birthday approached, his family rallied round and organised the special gift. They managed to arrange the photo via his son Geoff's partner Joanne Holmes, who worked with trauma surgeon Mansoor Khan - now a surgeon commander with the Royal Navy in Afghanistan. Today, the veteran said he was 'really proud' to be presented with the photo, featuring 37 British soldiers from the Role 3 Hospital Doctors team. Special gift: The photo features dozens of British servicemen smiling at the camera from the Afghanistan base . 'All of them are smiling - it's a really good photo,' said Mr Thrust, who was handed the picture during his birthday celebrations at The Old Colonial pub in Mirfield in Kirklees, West Yorkshire. 'I would shake all their hands.' The photo's accompanying message reads: 'FAO Gunner Thrust, of 7th Mountain Regiment, Salerno war veteran. 'Happy 90th birthday. Have a wonderful birthday night celebration. We and all the trauma team and soldiers out in Afghanistan send our best wishes. 'FAO Gunner Thrust, of 7th Mountain Regiment, Salerno war veteran.

'We have the utmost respect for you and many thanks for your service. 'Best wishes, Role 3 Hospital Doctors, Camp Bastion, Afghanistan.' 'We have the utmost respect for you and many thanks for your service. 'Best wishes, Role 3 Hospital Doctors, Camp Bastion, Afghanistan.' Mr Thrust's son Geoff said his father had initially been 'overwhelmed' by the gift - adding: 'But he is as proud as punch now'. Meanwhile, his other son David told how the pensioner is very active for his age and regularly disappears on the bus or train, leaving a note to tell his family where he has gone. Mr Thrust, one of four brothers who served in the war, sailed from Portsmouth on one of a number of Gibraltar-bound ships during his mission to Italy. 'Two of the ships sunk,' he recalled. 'They were full of troops and no-one could pick them up because they couldn't stop the convoy. 'The survivors in the water were just left to drown - hundreds of people. 'That was a horrible experience. It was frightening as well at that age. You thought you were next. You were expecting this shell to come.' Finally, after a gruelling trek with mules carrying his guns, Mr Thrust reached the mountainous region of Salerno.

For the past ten years, he has travelled around Yorkshire consoling the families of soldiers killed in Afghanistan .

Above, the veteran shows off his war medals . He said the regiment's screw-guns were like 'pea shooters on wheels' as soldiers had to get extremely close to the Germans to use them. 'You could hear them talking,' he said. 'But the Germans were eventually squeezed out of position. 'I'm hoping being so close to them, we made them move.' The veteran also recalled having to use his jacket as a stretcher when two of his colleagues were fatally injured after a gun blew up.","Harry Thrush, from Leeds, served as gunner in Italy during World War Two .

The $100million wrongful death lawsuit filed against Elle McPherson's billionaire husband Jeffrey Soffer that was withdrawn last month has been refiled in a different court. Bob Martinez said that Daria Pastouhkova Gogoleva refiled the lawsuit Friday in Miami Dade Circuit Court claiming Mr Soffer is responsible for a helicopter accident that killed her husband, Lance Valdez, in 2012. The original complaint made similar claims but was filed in Miami Federal District Court. As if nothing happened: Elle Macpherson and husband Jeff Soffer attend Perez Art Museum last week in Miami . 'Soffer was flying the helicopter at the time of the... crash, and he was responsible for the crash that killed Lance Valdez,' the suit claims, according to the New York Post. 'Despite being responsible for the death of his friend, Soffer repeatedly lied to and intentionally deceived Daria about his involvement in the crash in an effort to persuade her to pursue an insurance recovery rather than a claim against him,' claims the suit. The grieving widow is suing for wrongful death, fraudulent inducement and conspiracy - she is seeking a jury trial, the Post reported. Robert Martinez, Mr Soffer's lawyer, told the paper that 'a bad lawsuit doesn’t get any better just by refiling it in another court. The lawyer claims the original lawsuit was withdrawn only one day before Mr Soffer was planning to file a motion to have it dismissed. 'That lawyer now says that he made a mistake and has filed the same complaint in another court,' he continued. 'The complaint rehashes the same mistakes and false accusations.better just by refiling it in another court.' Supermodel Elle Macpherson is also accused . of helping her billionaire husband conceal he was flying the helicopter. Macpherson urged widow Daria Valdez to take the payout after husband . Jeffrey Soffer, who also owns Miami’s Fontainebleau Hotel, piloted the . chopper into the ground November 22, 2012 in the Bahamas, the lawsuit said. -Soffer was at the helm despite not being licensed to fly. A licensed . pilot was on board the aircraft but not at the controls, the suit . alleges. The $100million wrongful death suit was filed 10 December Miami. Dropped: Daria Gogoleva has dropped a suit against Jeffrey Soffer (seen here with wife Elle Macpherson) for piloting a helicopter that crashed in the Bahamas in November of 2012, in which Lance Valdez, a prominent tax attorney, died . A copy of the lawsuit reviewed by MailOnline claimed that Soffer was at the controls when the helicopter when it crashed on Great Cauna Cay last year, taking the life of tax lawyer Lance Valdez. ‘Contrary to published newspaper reports, at the time of the helicopter crash the helicopter was being piloted by Jeffrey Soffer,’ the suit claims. ‘Soffer was not licensed to fly,’ the suit continues. ‘[Nor was he a] sufficiently experienced helicopter pilot.’ The suit also accused supermodel Elle Macpherson of taking part in the conspiracy by personally  calling close friends for the purpose of having them convince the devastated widow to take the money. 'Soffer induced…Elle Macpherson…to call Charles Holzer, another close friend of both Lance and Daria, and told him that Soffer was annoyed about Daria’s delay in signing the release, telling Holzer that ‘Soffer doesn’t have to do this you know,' the suit alleged. Taking the millions in hush money meant signing a release relieving Mr Soffer of all liability stemming from the crash, according to the suit. Shattered: Dasha and Lance Valdez in a photo from 2008, the picture of happiness . 'They knew Daria was beset with grief…at the time that they inappropriately pressured her to sign a release they knew was based upon false information,' the suit said. 'They took undue and improper advantage of her and the situation and circumstances surrounding the helicopter crash,' it continued. Pilot David Pearce also signed a lawsuit guaranteeing him a six-figure salary with Mr Soffer's company in exchange for swearing he was piloting the helicopter at the time it crashed, according to the suit. Mr Valdez, 48 and a father of three, was joined on the flight by a handful of other people but was the only one who did not survive the accident, according to the suit. Daria Valdez, now a widow, claims in the suit she was handed $2million in insurance hush money to keep quiet about Mr Soffer piloting the chopper into the ground. According to the lawsuit, co-defendants Daniel and Paula Riordan, as well as Alex Krys, were also on board the ill-fated flight and conspired with Mr Soffer and the pilot to conceal who was actually flying the chopper when her husband died. ‘The defendants] conspired and otherwise agreed to conceal… [that Mr Soffer] was flying the helicopter at the time of the crash,’ the suit said. ‘The purpose of this concealment and deception was, in turn, to induce [Mr Valdez’s widow] to accept $2million in insurance proceeds from insurance maintained on the helicopter… and to withhold from any civil or other action against [Mr] Soffer,’ the suit explains. The Riordans are employees of Mr Soffer, Mr Krys is his COO, according to the suit. Ms Valdez, who goes by Dasha, according to the Post, was convinced to keep quiet about Mr Soffer’s involvement in her husband’s death while grieving over the loss of the father of her three young children – aged two, seven and nine. Living the high life: Mr Soffer and Ms Macpherson continue to enjoy the high life while Ms Valdez is left to care for her three young children without their father . Trouble in paradise: The helicopter crash happened last year at Great Guana Cay, in the Bahamas . Head of an empire: Billionaire Mr Soffer's assets include the famed Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami . Mr Soffer took advantage of her fragile emotional state in order to avoid ‘his own liability in an exponentially greater amount as compared to the $2million,’ according to the suit. 'Despite being responsible for the loss of his friend, [Mr] Soffer repeatedly lied to and intentionally deceived Daria about his involvement in the crash in an effort to persuade her to pursue an insurance recovery rather than a claim against him.' The suit also claims that Mr Soffer led Mr Valdez to believe he was a licensed and experienced pilot, as well as fled the scene while first responders tried to revive his best friend’s lifeless body. The hotel magnate is licensed to fly - fixed airplanes, not helicopters. 'He was recklessly flying and controlling the helicopter at the time of the helicopter crash without an up-to-date and valid helicopter pilot's license,' the lawsuit further claims. ‘Soffer arranged to have himself and the Riordans transported by boat… in order to escape, flee and/or remove himself and the Riordans from the Bahamas before any investigation of the crash could be conducted,’ according to the suit. He did not contact Mr Valdez’s widow until four days later, and also skipped his pal’s funeral. 'Jeff Soffer is very sympathetic to Dasha and the children for their grave loss [and] denies all the allegations of wrongdoing,' his lawyer told the New York Post in a statement. 'Mr. Soffer has no further comments to make at this time since the lawsuit is now pending in federal court.'","A lawsuit claiming billionaire Jeffrey Soffer crashed a helicopter he was illegally piloting, killing lawyer Lance Valdez, was refiled Friday after having previously been withdrawn .

'They told me about my foot [which] got amputated.' Mrs Galette, who has a ten-year-old daughter, said she had endured 'endless pain' as a result of the botched operation. The trained medical technician claims her intestine was punctured during the original surgery two years ago, triggering an infection.

A man who was shot dead in an apparent road rage incident in Pennsylvania last Saturday made multiple calls to 911 as he was pursued by a crazed driver in a dark-colored pickup, police have revealed this weekend. Timothy Davison, 28, was driving from Florida home to Maine along Interstate 81 when the shooting occurred in Antrim Township. He told 911 in several calls in Maryland and Pennsylvania that he was being chased by an enraged driver who was very aggressive. Police have concluded that a 28-year-old Timothy 'Asti' Davison (pictured) was killed in a seemingly random act of road rage last Sunday in Pennsylvania. Driven off the road: Timothy Davison was run off the road by an enraged motorist and shot dead . Road rage: Timothy Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him just moments before he was forced off the road (pictured) and shot dead . Police believe the shooter pursued Davison for up to 15 miles before he was run off the road onto a median strip and shot several times. Officials say the shooter was driving a dark Ford Ranger XLT pickup and are asking local mechanics to look out for a car fitting that description with damage to its driver's side as well as silver paint from Davison's car. Saluted: Fellow officers gathered from multiple states to attend the June 2013 funeral for Bardstown, Kentucky officer Jason Ellis, whose murder remains unsolved . As Davison called 911 in Northern Maryland to report the rage-filled motorist, he was being shot at by the trailing vehicle. The call was dropped and he called again, this time having crossed over the border into Pennsylvania.

'I think we can call it a road rage incident,' Pennsylvania state trooper Rob Hicks told The Portland Press Herald. Police are not releasing the recordings of the calls, but Hicks said that Davison indicated that a driving issue - like one person cutting another off or braking suddenly - may have sparked the problem. The only clues that the investigators, who have been joined by FBI teams, are basing their investigation on are grainy surveillance footage and bullet remnants.

Never before seen letters written by hellraising poet Dylan Thomas to the American journalist he had a passionate affair with are to be published for the first time. Over the course of six letters, the Welsh writer tells Pearl Kazin 'I kiss your heart. I kiss you everywhere' while delighting in a secret liaison behind his wife Caitlin's back. Thomas' stormy marriage never recovered from the affair, widely considered to be the most passionate and destructive of several he was known to have had before his death from complications relating to alcoholism aged 39 in 1953. Stormy: Dylan Thomas' marriage never recovered from the affair, considered to be the most passionate of several he was known to have had before his death in 1953 from complications relating to alcoholism . Telling Kazin that he feels so close to her 'that the earth stops, the seas dry up', whenever he thinks of her, the letters provide a unique insight into Thomas' famous affair with the former deputy literary editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Thomas' birth, the collection will be published for the first time next month in a book titled 'A Pearl of Great Price' by Jeff Towns. The first letter sent by Thomas to Kazin was written in April 1950 and sent from the Savage Gentleman's Club, then based in St James', London. Beginning 'Peal, darling', the letter ends 'I'll sit here drinking Punch and reading sherry until your letter comes. The world is empty this side of the damned sea. I love you, Dylan'. His final letter, dated February 1951 and written in Iran while producing a film-script for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, is equally dramatic. Dylan Thomas' long-suffering wife Caitlin (pictured left with Thomas) is believed to have never forgiven the poet for his affair with Pearl Kazin. Caitlin was portrayed by Sienna Miller in the 2008 biopic The Edge of Love (right) In it Thomas says: 'I am writing this is tasty, stiff-lipped, liverish. British guesthouse in puking Abadan, on the foul blue boiling Persian buggering Gulf'. Thomas first met Kazin in early 1950 when he visited the offices of Harpar's Bazaar to sell an essay. Although the affair is believed to have lasted only around a year, it is widely considered have been more passionate and destructive than his relationships with Pamela Glendower and Liz Reitell. His long-suffering wife Caitlin, who was portrayed by  Sienna Miller in the 2008 biopic The Edge of Love, is believed to have never forgiven the poet for his affair with Kazin, who he took on a high-profile trip around Europe at the height of their affair. The letters were given to Dylan Thomas expert Jeff Towns by Kazin's son David after death three years ago. Tribute: The letters have been released as part of a book marking 100 years since Dylan Thomas' birth . As well as regularly writing about the poet, Towns also ran Dylan's Bookshop in Swansea for nearly 20 years. There are a number of other tributes to Thomas planned to mark the centenary of his birth, including the Dylan Thomas 100 Festival, of which Prince Charles is Royal Patron. As part of that event, a replica of Thomas' iconic writing shed, where he penned his famous work Under Milk Wood, will go on tour around the country. It will be popping up at places and . events across the country, including the Hay Festival, the Royal Welsh . Show and the National Eisteddfod. Visitors . to the shed will be encouraged to make up a new word which will be . published in a Dictionary of Dylan - in honour of his love of words. The . real writing shed in the picturesque Welsh village of . Laugharne is a magnet for fans wanting to experience where Thomas found . his inspiration. Prince Charles is Royal Patron of the year-long festival and visited Thomas' isolated home on the Taf estuary last summer with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. He said after visiting the Carmarthenshire boathouse: 'I think I can begin to understand something of the love of that county which inspired Thomas himself. 'I can only hope that these centenary celebrations will help to spark fresh interest in the genius of one of Wales's greatest poets.' Thomas lived in the boathouse, which sits below the writing shed, in the four years leading up to his death in New York in 1953. The first poem Thomas wrote in the shed was Over Sir John's Hill, in which he described the view and wrote of birds stalking their prey and bringing death in the midst of beauty. Thomas, who was born in Swansea in October 1914 became a popular national figure with his 'play for voices' Under Milk Wood, and stories and radio broadcasts such as 'A Child's Christmas in Wales'. In his later life he acquired a reputation, which he encouraged, as a 'roistering, drunken and doomed poet'. Controversy still surrounds the exact cause of his death at the age of 39 in New York in 1953 - whether it was pneumonia or a drink-induced coma during a literary tour.","Six letters detail the passionate affair Dylan Thomas had with Pearl Kazin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . PUBLISHED: . 06:20 EST, 11 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:28 EST, 11 January 2014 . A convicted killer, who was jailed for murdering a 23-year-old student, has won a £10,000 prize for his first crime novel after judges were bowled over by the tale's realism. The Private Eye Writers of America . panel had no idea that Alaric Hunt was serving a life sentence for the killing of student, Joyce Austin, in Clemson, South Carolina in 1988. Hunt's novel, entitled Cuts Through Bone they impressed them with its authenticity, and sparked interest from a publisher. Unlikely star: the winner of the debut crime fiction competition turned out to be convicted murderer Alaric Hunt, pictured here in 2013, whose novel Cuts Through The Bone impressed with its authenicity . But when the interested party rang the . Southern California number Hunt had submitted with his manuscript, they were told he unavailable as he was was in an institution. Hunt's cousin, Jade Reed, who had posted his novel to the . competition's organisers, had to reveal to Toni Kirkpatrick, an editor at Thomas Dunne Books, an imprint of St. Martin’s Press, that the author was holed-up in a maximum-security facility in the small town of Bishopville. 'Will he be out soon?' miss Kirkpatrick asked. To which Ms Reed was forced to reply: 'Well, he's there indefinitely.' Hunt, 44, has lived more than half his life behind bars. He last saw the outside world when he was 19. In 1988 he was convicted of killing a 23-year-old student, Joyce Austin, in Clemson, South Carolina. Ms Austin died of smoke inhalation from a fire started by Hunt's older brother, Jason. The brothers planned to disctract the emergency services while they robbed a jewellery shop nearby. Jason wanted to go to music school in Southern California and needed the money to do so. Six weeks later the police arrested Alaric and Jason for Joyce’s murder, and for robbery, conspiracy and several counts of arson. The spoils of their theft turned out to be women’s rings worth only US$200 in total. The brothers were sentenced to life with no parole for at least 30 years. Room with a view: prison is all Hunt has seen since his conviction when he was 19. He is currently in a maximum-security unit in Bishopville, South Carolina, thought to be this one . Hunt, who after finishing at . secondary school was found to have an IQ of 137, is understood to have immersed himself in . literature while inside. After landing a job in the prison library,  he has discovered authors . such as Ernest Hemingway, the Greek and the Roman philosophers and the . science fiction masters who wowed him as a boy and inspired him to write . his own stories. It was also in the prison library that he saw a competition advertised - the contest sponsored by Minotaur, an imprint of St Martin's Press. The prize money caught his eye – a US$10,000 (£6,000) advance and a guaranteed publishing contract for the book – three years ago. He wrote . Cuts Through Bone in nine months in sessions between his prison duties - . five to write the first draft in longhand and another four months for a . rewrite. The 320-page novel tells the story a military veteran wrongfully accused of his girlfriend's murder. Middle-aged . detective Clayton Guthrie, teams up with Rachel Vasquez, the . inquisitive teenage daughter of Puerto Rican immigrants, to investigate . the crime. The . book is set in New York, which Hunt has never visited. He said he . pieced together knowledge of the city from watching episodes of the . popular Manhattan-based detective drama, Law and Order, various novels . set in New York, and a map of the city's boroughs dating for 1916. Unlike some other states, South Carolina has no law to prevent prisoners profiting from such work. Hunt's publishers, Minotaur, stress that Cuts Through Bone book is not based on the author's own crime. But Frances Austin, the mother of the Hunt brothers' victim, told The New York Times she was incredulous to learn he had written the book. 'He caused my daughter's death, and now he's writing a book about it,' she said. 'I can't believe this.' The book has received mixed reviews. 'Sometimes, a crime novel grabs you on the first page with its plot. Sometimes, it's the writing. Rarely is it the author's background. But Alaric Hunt hits the trifecta in his debut,' wrote the critic for the Richmond Times–Dispatch in Virginia. But the Publishers Weekly reviewer was less impressed. 'Overblown prose ('dawn broke, like an egg yolk bleeding yellow into a dark pan') doesn't help an unremarkable plot.' Reflecting on his crime, Hunt told The New York Times: 'What haunts me is not seeing beyond what I wanted, and casually risking others. I killed Joyce Austin, and I killed my brother and myself. There's a hole there that can't ever fill up.' He hopes to earn parole when he is eligible to, but that day is still five years away. 'I'm afraid to choke on wistfulness,' he said. 'That has been the fate of many a prisoner. I pass them each day, still shuffling and muttering with their hands full of hope.'","Detective fiction contest judges were impressed with the novel's authenticity .

The retailer has halved the price of its Android Avoca 7 tablet from £99 down to just £49 to compete with the likes of rivals Tesco and Argos against their respective budget devices. It doesn't offer the same features as the more expensive models, but Carphone Warehouse claim it is 'perfect for families.'

The Avoca 7 comes with a 7-inch screen and has a limited amount of basic 8GB storage available - which can be increased up to 32GB using a Micro SD card. This matches the storage on the Argos MyTablet but is half of all other major 7-inch tablet rivals. Carphone Warehouse's tablet has a 1Ghz processor, 512MB RAM and a 0.3MP front facing camera. The 350g tablet also runs Android 4.2 Jelly Bean software, which means it supports Android apps from the Google's Play store, and its makers claim it has a battery life of around eight hours.

A rare child’s coffin thought to be around 1,700-years-old has been found in a field by treasure hunters. It is believed the lead coffin contains the remains of a child from a wealthy Roman who lived in third century Britain. Members of a metal detecting club made the find when they were searching a field in west Leicestershire, about two miles away from where a Roman settlement and fort that is known to have existed. A 1,700-year-old lead coffin, thought to contain the remains of a Roman child, has been found by a metal detecting club in a field in Leicestershire. The exact location of the burial is being kept a secret to protect the rare coffin from grave robbers . The location of the site is being kept secret to protect it from looters and it is thought that the coffin could be the earliest example of a Christian burial in the county. The coffin was discovered by Chris Wright, 30, a surveyor. He said: 'I cannot describe how it feels to find something like this. You spend hours walking around fields, sometimes with little reward and then you find something this. 'It is incredible, it makes all the hours worthwhile, it makes you feel so good. The lead coffin is thought to hold the remains of the child of a very wealthy individual as it is estimated the casket would have cost the equivalent of about £200,000 in the third century AD . 'We had been at it all day and then got a signal - it was quite deep so I ""ummed and ahhed"" about whether to just ignore it and move on,'he said. But luckily Mr Wright let curiosity get the better of him and began to dig. 'I was digging like mad when we began to see what it was - not in a way that might damage the item I must add - but just in an excited way,' he said. 'It would be great to have questions answered such as why a child should be given such a high status burial and why the burial took place there. 'But perhaps these are questions that may never be answered.' The location of the site - in a field in Leicestershire - is being kept secret to protect it from looters and it is thought that the coffin could be the earliest example of a Christian burial in the county. The coffin was discovered by surveyor and amateur treasure hunter, Chris Wright (pictured) David Hutchings, 47, founder of DIGGING UP THE PAST metal detecting club said: 'It was about four feet underground on a field but the coffin was made of lead so we had no problem finding it. 'It’s not been opened yet but it looks like it contains the remains of a child and it’s probably one of the earliest Christian burials in the county.' After digging down and discovering it was a coffin, they called the police and a vigil was set up at the site to protect it from grave robbers. Mr Hutchings said: 'We assumed there were human remains in there so we contacted the police and they got in touch with the archaeologists from Leicestershire County Council, who also came out. 'It seems to be third century Roman and because of the east-west alignment we think it was a Christian burial. The coffin is thought to hold the remains of the child of a very wealthy individual. 'It’s a lead coffin and we think it would have cost the equivalent of about £200,000, so it was paid for by someone very wealthy,' said Mr Hutchings. Members of DIGGING UP THE PAST metal detecting club (pictured) said the coffin was buried four feet underground and has not yet been opened . The council archaeologists told the amateur treasure hunters it is a unique discovery and a find of a lifetime. Local rector Linda Blay was invited to the scene by the club and plans to return to say prayers during the excavation. She said: 'It’s a very interesting find. They believe the body belongs to a child and it’s also thought to be a very early Christian burial. 'I’m the rector of five churches in the area and none of them date back as far as the third century.' Leicestershire County Council’s finds liaison officer, Wendy Scott, said they had to treat the find with respect and dignity. She said: 'We have to remember this is human remains - it is a child’s body - and the best procedure is to leave it alone and rest in the position it is in or rebury it. 'It is the remains of a Roman occupant of Leicestershire so of course we are interested in it. The coffin has now been removed from the site and is being kept in a secure location.","An expert believes the lead coffin would have cost the equivalent of about £200,000, showing it belonged to a wealthy Roman family .

The false-color blue has been added to show a view provided by a near-infrared filter that is often used to detect methane . ‘The raw images are transmitted from Juno in strips - like a push broom,’ Kremer told MailOnline. ‘The matchups aren’t always perfect because the Juno spacecraft is constantly rotating and moving.’ But according to Kremer, that inconsistency is what makes these images so fascinating with the Earth’s surface changing as the spacecraft flies over the planet. ‘It’s rare to get such views since only a few spacecraft have flown by Earth in this manner on there way to distant destinations,’ said Kremer. These are expected to be among the last of planetary images from Juno until it arrives at Jupiter in 2016. Here it will take the first ever images of the gas giant’s north and south poles. Launched in 2011, Juno flew beyond the orbit of Mars, Earth's closest planetary neighbour, before looping back toward our home planet for a quick visit. This reconstructed image of Earth is one of the first snapshots transmitted back home by the Juno spacecraft . By space mission standards, Juno's Earth rendezvous was low-key compared with the Curiosity rover's nail-biting landing on Mars last year, which drew crowds. Like Juno, previous missions to the outer solar system have used Earth as a gravity slingshot since there's no rocket powerful enough to make a direct flight. The Galileo spacecraft buzzed by Earth twice in the 1990s en route to Jupiter, the solar system's largest planet located 484 million miles from the sun. Juno's trajectory has carried it beyond the orbit of Mars and then back into the inner solar system where it did a velocity boosting Earth flyby to weeks ago to gain the energy needed to reach Jupiter .","Ken Kremer and Marco Di Lorenzo have assembled the latest raw imagery .

Mr Lugger, from Lienze, Austria, said: 'We always had the idea of a highline image set in the Austrian Dolomites - the highline is highlighted by the extraordinary beauty of this perfect spot. 'The light and mood increased with the sunset - Mr Ebner got a good start and did one move after the other turning it into a perfect evening. 'We go here quite a lot to climb, hike or ski.

Slacklining is seen as distinct from tightrope walking because the line is not taut. It is instead stretchy and bouncy, allowing acrobatic feats . He added: 'To fix the line you have to drill hooks into the rock on several spots. The slackline gets fixed on these hooks and has to be tensioned strongly. 'To be on the safe side there is an extra rope fixed to these hooks. It is fixed underneath the slackline with a little duct tape every few metres. 'Usually the athlete wears a harness to fix himself to the slackline and rope so it's as safe as possible. But either way there is a high and fatal risk on any climb.'

GIFs have taken over the internet, entertaining millions with their short and often amusing animations. But the viral picture format has, up until now, been trapped in digital form. Now a project is planning to liberate the GIF from the internet using a technology invented in the 1940s. Scroll down for video... Brooklyn-based designers Sha Hwang (left) and Rachel Binx (right) have created a company called Gifpop! that aims to print animated GIFs onto lenticular film - a technology that dates back to World War II . Brooklyn-based designers Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx have created a company called Gifpop! that aims to print animated GIFs onto lenticular film. Lenticular film, which shows pitted, prismatic plastic pictures, used to be popular in childhood stickers and notebooks. The image in lenticular film appears to move as the viewer moves, with its animation looping through a short number of frames. The technology dates back to World War II and, like a GIF, has its format constraints. Source: Gifpop! For instance, a lenticular image can only store about 10 frames, while a GIF has to be small enough to download easily. This got the designers thinking that the two formats may be able to share common works of art. Hwang and Binx launched their Kickstarter campaign for Gifpop! with the aim of making this a reality. The project was almost immediately funded. As well as the custom GIFs, the designers hope to be running off limited batches of works by three GIF artists, including Mr Div, 89-A, and Davidope. The Atlantic reports that the two designers were inspired to develop the company after seeing Cards Against Humanity, another card-based Kickstarter campaign. They envision a Cards Against Humanity-style game played with GIF cards. 'One card would say, ‘”My face when I see my ex with her new boyfriend,” and then players would put reaction GIF cards down,’ said Hwang. Gifpop! still has 25 days of its Kickstarter campaign to go and plans to ship its first custom cards in November. A pledge of $12 (£7.40) will get one business or postcard size GIF of your choice. The company also plans to use Instagram and Vine, in addition to GIFs, to create the lenticular cards.","Brooklyn-based Gifpop! plans to print GIFs onto lenticular cards .

Financial pressure: Sir Hugh Orde has warned that financial pressure felt by certain ranks could fuel a wave of corruption . Hard-up officers are more likely to take bribes if they are underpaid, one of Britain’s most senior police chiefs has claimed. The financial pressure felt by ‘certain ranks’ could fuel a wave of corruption, warned Sir Hugh Orde. The president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) also appeared to compare Britain to some third world countries where illegal payments to law enforcers are engrained in society. But his comments provoked a row last night when furious MPs said it was ‘appalling’ to suggest officers could commit a crime to make ends meet. Politicians said chief officers must keep a ‘sense of balance’ amid current reforms to police pay and pensions and claimed rank-and-file officers would be shocked at their integrity being questioned. Sir Hugh singled out the starting salary of £19,000 for junior PCs as too low during an interview about morale as leaders battle to slash costs. ‘There are certain ranks in the service who are vulnerable in terms of their income and expenditure, which means we should be worried,’ he said. ‘One thing around learning from corruption and integrity is that if  you underpay police officers – for example, there are some forces around the world where officers are hardly paid at all – the consequence is corruption. ‘I am not saying that is the case here at all, but it is something we should be mindful of. Some officers are under some financial pressure and they don’t dump those worries when they come to work.’ The Coalition has pushed through swingeing reforms to police pay and conditions – including longer hours, pay freezes, the scrapping of many bonuses and higher contributions to final salary pensions. But Police Minister Damian Green has said that pay packages remain ‘significantly better’ than any comparable role in the private sector. Most Police and Crime Commissioners also offer more than £19,000 to recruits. The comments by former Northern Ireland police chief Sir Hugh come after Acpo commissioned a report on integrity that claimed financial pressures increase the ‘vulnerability’ of some officers to corruption or ‘inappropriate secondary employment’. Police . A recent review found record numbers of police being investigated for corruption, mostly junior officers accused of illegally disclosing information to criminals or others. Police now face the introduction of a formal code of ethics amid calls for those guilty of misconduct to be ‘struck off’ a professional register like doctors and lawyers. Michael Ellis, Tory MP for . Northampton North, said pay reforms had been ‘misinterpreted’ in many . areas and had actually led to pay rises for large numbers of staff. He added: ‘I’m appalled at the idea that police officers of any rank will be susceptible to corruption for any reason.’ Conservative . colleague Mark Reckless, MP for Rochester and Strood, said the vast . majority of officers would be ‘horrified’ by Sir Hugh’s comments. ‘It . is the culture against corruption which is much more important than . whether a salary is being increased by one or two per cent a year,’ he . added. The row came as . Acpo’s civilian chief executive was sacked last week after being . accused of stealing from the body’s Westminster offices. Tom Flaherty, 54, was thrown out for gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing on Tuesday. He . had been suspended on full pay since he was arrested last April accused . of stealing Sir Hugh’s desk diary amid a spate of petty thefts. The case was a major embarrassment . for Acpo as it faced accusations of a cover-up and the organisation, . dubbed a ‘boys club for senior officers’ by its critics, now faces . abolition after an independent review of its work.

China's space agency today distributed fresh new pictures of the Moon's surface from its lunar lander and rover. The Jade Rabbit rover can be seen trundling across the pockmarked surface of Earth's satellite in pictures released today by the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The successful soft-landing of the Chang'e 3 lander in December made China the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and Russia. Chasing the horizon: The sky over the Moon appears inky black in this picture showing the Jade Rabbit rover trundling across the lunar surface taken from the Chang'e 3 lander and released today by Chinese scientists . Great leap forward: The successful soft-landing of the Chang'e 3 lander in December made China the third country to complete a lunar rover mission after the United States and Russia . The country's achievement comes just a decade after it first sent an astronaut into space, and has got the Chinese leadership on a patriotic high. The mission is seen as a symbol of China's rising global stature and technological advancement, as well as the Communist Party's success in reversing the fortunes of the once-impoverished nation. In a patriotic, and perhaps self-aware, spin on the ubiquity of produts 'Made in China', President Xi Jinping earlier this week called the landing 'a real and genuine Chinese product.' As he congratulated the scientists and engineers of the space programme at Beijingâ€™s Great Hall of the People on Monday morning, he insisted: 'The most fundamental point is that Chinaâ€™s space industry insists on self-reliant and independent innovation.' But it's a claim that's been called into doubt by some scientists, who have suggested the design of the Chinese rover appears to borrow heavily from its Soviet and American predecessors. And now what? A photo taken from the Chang'e-3 lander shows the barren landscape of the Moon . Chang'e-3's soft-landing was carried out 12 days after it blasted off on an Long March-3B carrier rocket . Even some engineers involved in designing the vehicle have said their version is derivative. 'There is no denying the similarities,' said Professor Wen Guilin from Hunan University in Changsha after the rover was unveiled. He admitted to the South China Morning Post that the Chinese rover 'borrowed heavily from other countries, in particularly the United States.' 'A lot of things have been drawn from the reliable and successful design of the [American] Mars rover,' he told the Hong Kong-based paper. This digitally-combined panoramic photo taken on December 23 shows the moonscape around the Chang'e-3 . A second digitally-combined panoramic photo shows the moonscape around the Yutu - Jade Rabbit - moon rover . Knock off or not, there's no denying the ambition of the China's Moon mission, which on December 14 achieved the first lunar soft landing in nearly four decades and aims at a manned mission by 2020. As colour images showing the Chinese national flag on the rover were transmitted live to the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, the Chinese Communist Party branded the touchdown a 'milestone'. Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry, said at the time: 'It's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world. 'Especially somewhere like the moon, which doesn't have an atmosphere so you can't use parachutes or anything like that. 'You have to use rocket motors for the descent and you have to make sure you go down at the right angle and the right rate of descent and you don't end up in a crater on top of a large rock.' Coming down: A photo taken by the Chang'e-3's landing camera shows the lunar surface n from a height of 7.9km . A photo from 99m above the Moon: Peter Bond, consultant editor for Jane's Space Systems and Industry, said at the time that it's still a significant technological challenge to land on another world . Chang'e-3 adopted a variable thrust engine designed and made by Chinese scientists. Its thrust power ranges from 1,500 to 7,500 newtons, according to the country's space agency. The soft-landing was carried out 12 days after the probe blasted off on an enhanced Long March-3B carrier rocket. The last soft-landing was carried out by the Soviet Union in 1976.","President Xi Xinping made the comments while congratulating scientists .
