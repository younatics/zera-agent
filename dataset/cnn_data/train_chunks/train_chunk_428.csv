"(CNN)Social Security is often described as ""the third rail of American politics"" -- touch it and you'll get zapped. So why do Republicans keep sidling up to it and sticking their fingers out? There's a brewing controversy in Congress over a small part of the program, which is just the latest version of an old routine that goes like this: Republicans say Social Security is going broke, and they propose changes that would cut benefits or otherwise undermine the program. Democrats shout ""Republicans are trying to cut Social Security!"" Then the Republicans, scared of a backlash from older voters, back off. And why do we keep going through this? Republicans will tell you it's because the program is in peril, and if we don't cut it back, it won't be there at all for future generations. Democrats will tell you it's because Republicans never liked the program in the first place, and would love to kill it. That may be an exaggeration, but the fact is that Republicans hate big government, and government doesn't come any bigger than Social Security. It's also the most successful and beloved social program in American history. Most of us are too young to remember when growing old in America almost inevitably meant a miserable descent into poverty, but until the middle of the 20th century, that's what it was. The current controversy revolves around a rule change Republicans made as soon as the new Congress was sworn in this month. Social Security is actually two separate programs, Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), and the much smaller Disability Insurance program (DI). The disability program will be facing a funding shortfall next year, and to ensure that disabled people continue to get all their benefits, Congress would have to move some money from OASI into DI. This isn't anything new -- it's been done many times in recent years. But House Republicans adopted a parliamentary rule barring the House from allowing that transfer unless it was accompanied by benefit cuts or tax increases. If it can't get worked out, people on DI could see their benefits cut substantially. So why would Republicans insist on this? My guess is that they think forcing a mini-crisis over the Disability Insurance program's finances will allow for a debate on the program that will make it easier to do what they've wanted to do for a long time: cut it back somehow, either by reducing benefits, increasing the retirement age, or even partially privatizing it. The justification is always that the program is ""going broke."" But that's just not true. When people say that, what they're usually referring to is that, according to the projections in the Social Security Trustees' latest report, in 2033 the program's trust fund will be exhausted. But even if there are no changes between now and then, the program would not be ""broke."" That's because it would still be taking in billions of dollars in taxes every day and paying them out in benefits. Even under this scenario, the program will still pay 77% of recipient's benefits after 2033, according to the report. Which would be awful. That would be a large reduction in income for millions of seniors. But 77% is not nothing. The people who tell you that the program will be ""broke"" are hoping that, faced with that (fictional) nightmare, you might be willing to accept steep benefit cuts now. But we don't have to -- the projected shortfall can be fixed with some very modest changes, like raising the payroll tax cap (right now you only pay payroll taxes on the first $117,000 of your wages, which means that the wealthy actually pay less as a proportion of their income than the rest of us) or gradually raising the payroll tax by a point in tiny increments over an extended period. The point is, it wouldn't be hard to come up with some combination of changes that could take care of the shortfall without cutting benefits. But for that to happen, both parties would have to agree on that goal. And there's reason to wonder whether Republicans really want a Social Security that's strong and stable. Programs like Social Security and Medicare -- which provide vital benefits to millions of Americans and are hugely popular -- stand as a living rebuke to conservatives' small-government philosophy. When Republicans tell voters that government can't do anything right, they hope that the voters don't respond, ""Well, the government is doing a good job keeping my grandma from having to eat cat food."" The idea that the program is perennially in crisis, on the other hand, validates everything else that Republicans say. Congress will probably work out the issue with Disability Insurance funding, just like they have in the past -- once the GOP starts feeling some political heat over it. But Republicans will be back for another attack on Social Security soon enough.","Paul Waldman: Rule change adopted by new Republican Congress could end up cutting Social Security disability benefits .
He says it's part of GOP's perennial attack on Social Security as unsustainable, but there are better ways to fix ."
"Manila (CNN)Forty-three elite police commandos were killed by Muslim insurgents in the southern Philippines Sunday, when they were ambushed while pursuing ""high value"" terrorist bomb makers. The commandos, members of the elite Special Action Force (SAF) unit of the Philippine National Police, were killed in a firefight that raged for 12 hours in Mamasapano town, Maguindanao Province, said police deputy director general Leonardo Espina. Eleven police commandos had also been wounded in the firefight, he told a press conference in Cotabato City Monday. Members of both the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), with whom the government has signed a peace agreement, and the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF), with whom it has not, were involved in the firefight, officials and rebel groups said. Grisly footage purporting to be of the aftermath of the battle was circulated online, showing uniformed bodies strewn in a rice field. ""This is the single largest loss of life in recent memory,"" Secretary of the Department of Interior and Local Government Mar Roxas told the press conference, calling for a moment of silence from assembled reporters. ""These SAF operatives are fallen heroes. They were just doing their job... That is why we salute them."" Roxas said that 392 SAF commandos been engaged to hunt Malaysian bomb-maker and Jemaah Islamiyah leader Zulkifli bin Hir, known as Marwan, and Filipino bomb maker Abdul Basit Usman. The FBI says that Marwan, who is suspected of having conducted bomb making training for Abu Sayyaf and has a $5 million State Department bounty for information leading to his arrest, is believed to have been hiding in the country's south since 2003. The U.S. government is also offering a reward of up to $1 million for information leading to Usman's arrest. Roxas said the commandos were retreating from the assault on their targets when they came under fire from members of the BIFF. In maneuvering away from the BIFF assault, they strayed into territory controlled by the MILF several kilometers away, and a ""misencounter"" ensued. The government had not been seeking to sabotage the peace agreement with the MILF by carrying out the operation without their knowledge, he said. ""We are hopeful and confident that this will not derail the peace talks,"" he said. ""This was not directed against MILF, but this is directed against a very, very specific high-profile terrorist bomber who was in the area."" Espina said that it was ""most highly likely"" that Marwan has been killed in the SAF assault, and DNA testing was being carried out to confirm this. But initial reports suggested that Usman had fled. A board of inquiry would conduct an investigation into the operation, including looking into the apparent lack of coordination with MILF forces in the area, said Espina. Mohagher Iqbal, chief negotiator for the MILF, said in an interview with Philippine radio station DZRH that a lack of coordination between the MILF ceasefire committee and the government was to blame for the outbreak of violence. It was a standard operating procedure that one side should notify the other before they began an operation, he said, describing the incident as self defense. While the area where the fighting occurred was mostly under MILF control, he said, BIFF, which was also involved in the firefight, was a mobile group, moving throughout the region. ""Chances are they were just there when it happened,"" he said. He said his group was doing everything it could to ease tensions over the fighting, and that the incident would not have an effect on the ongoing peace process. The Philippines signed an agreement with the MILF, the largest rebel group in the south, in March last year. The deal offered greater autonomy, economic and political power in return for the rebels surrendering their weapons and ending a decades-long insurgency. But hardline rebel groups opposed to the peace process, such as the BIFF, remain active. Lieutenant Colonel Harold Cabunoc, public affairs office chief for the Armed Forces of the Philippines, appealed to the hardline BIFF group Monday to return any personnel under their control. ""We are also calling on our brothers in the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters that if indeed they are still holding some of the PNP (Philippine National Police) personnel, they must respect their rights and they must be returned to their mother units and ultimately to their family members,"" he told reporters. Miriam Coronel-Ferrer, chair of the government panel responsible for overseeing the peace process with Muslim insurgents, said in a statement Monday that the violence highlighted the ""challenges that confound the peace process."" But the outbreak only strengthened the resolve of the peace panel to implement the ""Bangsamoro Basic Law""  -- the bill, currently being heard by politicians, that seeks to implement the peace deal between the government and the MILF. Hearings of the bill were suspended Monday following the violence. ""With better cooperation, we will be able to prevent these kinds of incidents,"" she said.","43 police commandos are killed in a firefight with Muslim rebels in southern Philippines .

"Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday defended his government's record on free speech and rejected a claim it uses ""Stalinist"" methods, a day after two international rights groups issued scathing reports. Putin was put on the spot during an annual televised call-in session in Moscow. It was his first since he was elected to a third term as president last May and lasted close to five hours. Journalist Alexey Venedictov, who is editor in chief of the Echo of Moscow radio station, asked Putin if Russia can use ""Stalinist tools"" if it wants to be an advanced, modern state. ""I don't think we can see Stalinist elements here,"" Putin responded. Stalin is recalled for ""the personality cult and mass violation of law, reprisals, prison camps -- we see nothing like that in Russia today and I hope we will never see that again. Our people will never allow that to happen again,"" he said. ""But that doesn't mean we should have no discipline, no law and order -- and all people in Russia should be equal before the law."" That includes the women in the punk band Pussy Riot, Putin said. ""No one puts anyone in prison for political reasons, for their political views. They get punished for violating the law. Everybody should observe the law."" Three Pussy Riot members were convicted last year of hooliganism for performing a song critical of Putin in a Russian Orthodox cathedral, in a brief but provocative protest action. Two are still in prison following the controversial trial. The reports published Wednesday by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both outlined a deterioration in the freedom of speech, citing a heavy clampdown on critics and activists . Human Rights Watch said the government has ""unleashed a crackdown on civil society unprecedented in the country's post-Soviet history"" in the 12 months since Putin regained the presidency. ""The authorities have introduced a series of restrictive laws, harassed, intimidated, and in several cases imprisoned political activists, interfered in the work of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and sought to cast government critics as clandestine enemies, thereby threatening the viability of Russia's civil society,"" it said. Putin told the audience it is OK to have demonstrations, ""but they should be legal"" and shouldn't interfere with other people's lives. Controls of the Internet are needed only to limit access to child pornography, pedophilia and education on ""suicide activities,"" Putin said. Putin said non-governmental organizations are welcome in Russia -- and play a useful role in exposing local abuses of power -- but those that receive foreign funding and are involved in political affairs should declare where the money came from and what it is spent on. The two rights groups were critical of new laws which, Human Rights Watch said, ""clearly seek to limit, or even end, independent advocacy and other NGO work."" The president also was asked about the trial for embezzlement of prominent Kremlin critic and opposition leader Aleksei Navalny, which resumed Wednesday in the northern city of Kirov. Navalny, who's also a popular anti-corruption blogger, says the charges are politically motivated. Putin responded that ""people who fight corruption have to be completely honest themselves ... if someone accuses other people of stealing, it doesn't mean he's above the law himself."" International relations . Putin urged closer cooperation between different countries' security services in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings. On two occasions -- in March and late September 2011 -- Russian authorities asked U.S authorities to investigate one of the bombing suspects, Tamerlan Tsarnaev. FBI agents on Wednesday interviewed his parents in Dagestan, in Russia's North Caucasus region. ""This tragedy should motivate us to work closer together,"" Putin said. ""If we combine our efforts we will not suffer blows like that."" Questioned about his country's external ties, Putin acknowledged that there has been ""some cooling off"" in Russia's relationship with the United States since the Iraq War, which Moscow opposed. Putin also pointed to other U.S. actions as factors in the deterioration of relations between Moscow and Washington. He highlighted the decision of U.S. lawmakers to pass the December 2012 Magnitsky Act, a law that imposes visa bans on and freezes the assets of 18 Russian officials believed to be connected to the death in prison of whistle-blowing Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky. ""Why did they do this? Nobody knows the answer to that question,"" Putin said. Russia's lawmakers responded to the Magnitsky list with their own list, slapping similar sanctions on 18 Americans it called rights violators. Putin also said he is grateful for the Obama administration's support of Russia's entry to the World Trade Organization but questioned why it still has Cold War-era legislation -- the so-called Jackson-Vanik amendment -- governing its trade relations with Russia. The United States has waived the legislation every year since 1994, but it still violates World Trade Organization rules requiring members of the body to give one another permanent normal trade relations. NATO's engagement in the Libya conflict also led to cooler relations, Putin said. The session was Putin's 11th televised question-and-answer conference, according to Russian state-run broadcaster RT.","Putin says the Boston tragedy should motivate countries to work together .

"David Michael Perez was ""terrified of parenting"" and swore it off for the first 30 years of his life. It was too much of a sacrifice: Fatherhood is expensive, for starters, and he thought he just wasn't cut out for it. ""I was afraid to do something that would make me so vulnerable.  Of course the things that cause us to feel vulnerable (and hence scared) are the things that bring us the greatest joy and connection,"" Perez, 33, wrote in an e-mail. Then he met a girl. And now they have an 11-month-old boy. He was excited to discuss this ""amazing transformation,"" but had a hard time finding equally excited fathers to commiserate with. So he created a space for sharing. He  co-founded Kindling, a literary journal that is an ""exploration in  fatherhood."" Perez is not the only one looking to be a more involved dad. In the last 50 years, fathers have taken on more child care and housework, though women still do the majority, according to a Pew Research study released in March. In 1965, dads spent an average of 2½ hours per week on child care versus mothers' 10 hours per week. By 2011, fathers were spending seven hours a week caring for kids, while mothers spent 14. Dads aren't who they used to be. Perez describes his own father as ""an incredibly selfless, loving father"" who allowed him room to be himself and let him know he was unconditionally loved, though his dad was not the touchy-feely type. ""Like most men of his generation, he definitely worked a lot and I know he wishes that had not been the case,"" he wrote. ""Being from a Catholic, Mexican family, he was definitely emotionally reserved.  I strive to be more emotionally engaged not only with my son but also with myself."" So, if today's dad is no longer the all-business provider who is less emotionally engaged than Mom, and he's not the bumbling, disconnected dad of the past 30 years in popular culture (read: Homer Simpson), then who is he? And do we appreciate him for his sacrifices as much as we do mothers? Let's hear it for dear old Dad . Sonora Smart Dodd was listening to a Mother's Day sermon at church when she came up with the idea to designate a day to celebrate fathers. Her dad, William Jackson Smart, was a Civil War veteran and a widower who raised her and her five brothers after her mother died. She took her notion to local churches and the YMCA, and in June 1910 the first Father's Day was celebrated in Spokane, Washington. But Father's Day didn't catch on as quickly as Mother's Day. The holiday did not become official until 1966 when President Lyndon Johnson issued a proclamation for dad's day.  By the time President Nixon signed it into law in 1972, Mother's Day had been a national holiday for 58 years. The foot-dragging is understandable: Most mothers share a nine-month-long physical bond with their biological children; they are typically the emotional touch stone of the family as well as the workhorse of the home, as the March Pew study made clear. Reverence for Mother as the parental nucleus is reflected in how we celebrate Mother's Day and Father's Day. Average spending last year on Mother's Day gifts was $168.94, versus $119.84 for dads, according to the National Retail Federation. This year, spending for father's day is up 2.1% from the previous year, and projected to reach $13.2 billion. For Mother's Day, that figure is $17.1 billion, up .2%, according to research firm IBISWorld. Paid leave lets dads build parenting foundation . Dads want it all, too . While fathers are contributing more labor at home these days, more women are becoming the chief or sole financial provider of the household in a recovering economy. In a first, mothers currently are the only or primary financial provider in 40% of  homes with children under 18. ""Women have always had legitimacy in the home, and the women's movement has given women legitimacy in the workplace,"" said Professor Brad Harrington of Boston College. ""Men have always had legitimacy in the workplace. But have they had a similar credibility in the home? No."" In the midst of the debate about work-life balance, leaning in and having it all, it is not just women who are examining how their roles have evolved. Experts say more value has been placed on mothers, sometimes to the detriment of the critical role fathers play. But men want it all, too, and are recognizing that a better balance means engaging more as a father. ""If we're going to be serious about fatherhood, we need to talk about how they are equally important to the well-being of their child,"" said Kenneth Braswell, executive director of Fathers Inc., a nonprofit that  encourages ""responsible fatherhood"" and mentoring. ""Responsible fatherhood doesn't mean anti-motherhood. We are trying to ensure that fathers are nurturing, protective, providers who are a compliment to the child's mother."" Tough choices . Brad Harrington remembered a three-year assignment in London as one of the highlights of his 20-year career with computer company Hewlett Packard. But In 1993, he surprised himself when he turned down an opportunity to return to Europe for a prestigious job offer after his father was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. In 1999, he was married with two children and a baby on the way when another opportunity arose for a stint abroad. This time, family considerations took priority again, and he stayed in America. That was when he realized  the outsize impact of family on career choices. At that point, he transitioned out of organizational leadership and moved into academia. The change offered fewer financial rewards, but it provided the chance to do interesting work while living a more balanced life. Now, as executive director for the Center for Work and Family at Boston College, he wants to be a catalyst for discussing how men can make progress on the home front, the way women have in the workplace. ""Young men are saying I want to be an economic provider but also provide for the emotional needs of my children,"" he said. He saw the shift in perspective in his 2011 study, The New Dad: Caring, committed and conflicted, which surveyed mainly upper-middle-class white fathers from Fortune 500 companies. In one measurement asking about the traits of good fathers, respondents placed a higher value on ""nontraditional"" aspects of fatherhood, including  emotional support, being present and teaching rather than discipline, financial security and child care tasks. Harrington noticed a difference in the evolution of fathers at home and mothers at work. While women were gaining strides in being capable in both work and home life, men, he says, have not done as good a job to gain a foothold in the home. Opinion: Fathers, stop coddling your kids . Staying engaged in fatherhood . Braswell, of Fathers Inc., said the idea of marriage and commitment is not what it was in the 1930s and 1940s. Back then there were two things that held a community together: 1. If you had a baby, you had to be married.  2.  Divorce was unacceptable. Today, he said, there are no rules. Now, census estimates show about half of first marriages end in divorce for women; the number for men is closer to one-third. Unfortunately a new parenting model has not been created to deal with this reality,  Branswell said. ""How do you do something in the place of marriage that gets the same outcome?  What you do is start talking about relationships."" He's a married, churchgoing father of four who maintains relationships with the mothers of his two kids not by his wife. His own early experience and frustrations to peacefully co-parent led him to focus his professional work on fatherhood. For him, it underscored the importance of teaching fathers who are not with their children's mother how to be involved, and he says it works. ""The vast majority of dads ... want to have a positive relationship with their child. Most of them are good dads and want to be better dads,"" he said. Fifty years ago, the idea of a great dad was little more than a father who was a good provider and disciplinarian. Today, dads are increasingly looked to as sole or single parents, to support the family emotionally and to help their partners succeed in the wider world. Society isn't just expecting more from fathers; fathers are expecting more from  themselves.","The face of fatherhood is changing from strong and silent to flexible and supportive .
Mothers are still the icons of home and family, if Mother's Day spending is an indication .
Fathers are taking on more and more household responsibility, according to studies .
Those who advocate for fathers say societal shifts demand a new model of fatherhood ."
"In the wake of an alleged terrorist attack on one of its soldiers, Britain is forming a task force that will examine the dynamics behind extremist groups in the country, Prime Minister David Cameron's office announced Sunday. The group, led by Cameron, will ""have a general focus on extremist groups, but accept that in practice the greatest threat is from Islamist extremists,"" a statement from Downing Street said. The Muslim Council of Britain said the task force needs to look at ""extremism from all quarters"" while forming an effective strategy. ""In doing so, we hope wisdom prevails as we reflect on the response of these past few days and the missed opportunities of previous years,"" said a statement from the council's secretary-general, Farooq Murad. ""We must be vigilant and ensure we do not inadvertently give into the demands of all extremists: making our society less free, divided and suspicious of each other. Lessons from the past indicate that policies and measures taken in haste can exacerbate extremism."" The brutal slaying Wednesday of British soldier Lee Rigby near the Royal Artillery Barracks in a working-class neighborhood in southeast London shocked people across the United Kingdom. It also triggered a far right-wing street demonstration Saturday in northern England, in which irate protesters called for Muslims to leave Britain. Late Sunday, a mosque caught fire in the city of Grimsby on the country's east coast, and police arrested two men on suspicion of arson.  The blaze coincided with inciting messages on social media ""by a small minority of individuals,"" according to Humberside County police. ""Those people should be aware that we are monitoring these sites in Humberside and we will take action against those intent on attempting to incite violence or post messages of a racial nature,"" police warned. Woolwich arrests . Nine people have been arrested in connection with the Woolwich attack, including three men who were taken into custody Saturday and another on Sunday. The three arrested Saturday were released early Monday on bail, police said. The men were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement. Police did not detail how they were allegedly tied to the killing nor did they release their identities, saying only that the men -- ages 21, 22, 24 and 28 -- were arrested by detectives from the Counter Terrorism Command and taken to a south London police station. Two men arrested at the scene of the killing are now under guard in South London hospitals after being shot in a confrontation with police. Britain's MI5 intelligence agency will report the results of a preliminary investigation into the suspects this week to the Intelligence and Security Committee, government sources said. The report is expected to be confidential. Two women who were arrested Thursday were released shortly thereafter without charge. Right-wing demo . Addressing the crowd Saturday in Newcastle, far-right English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson said that Rigby's killing should be a wake-up call to British citizens. ""We cannot allow this soldier's death to be in vain,"" Robinson said. ""We are the only ones who dare say it. When did the truth become hate speech?"" Police estimated that between 1,500 and 2,000 people attended the rally. A counter demonstration drew a few hundred people, police said. Rigby's family visited the scene of his death on Sunday.","Two arrested on suspicion of arson Sunday, after fire breaks out in a mosque .

"Cameroon's President Paul Biya has ordered the closure of nearly 100 Christian churches in key cities, citing criminal practices organized by Pentecostal pastors that threaten the security of the West African nation. But Pentecostal pastors said the move is evidence of Biya's insecurity about the churches' criticism of the government. Biya is using the military to permanently shut down all Pentecostal church denominations in the nation's capital, Yaounde, and the North West Regional capital, Bamenda, which have the largest Christian populations in Cameroon. More than 50 churches have now been closed, with the government targeting nearly 100 in eight other regions. ""We will get rid of all the so-called Christian Pentecostal pastors who misuse the name of Jesus Christ to fake miracles and kill citizens in their churches. They have outstretched their liberty,"" Mbu Anthony Lang, a government official in Bamenda, told CNN Wednesday. Nearly 500 Pentecostal churches operate in Cameroon, but fewer than 50 are legal, he added. On Sunday, a 9-year-old Christian girl collapsed and died during a prayer session in Winners' Chapel, a Pentecostal church in Bamenda. The girl's mother, Mih Theresa, told CNN Wednesday that the pastor intended to cast out the numerous demons that were in control of her daughter's life. ""I want the government to stop these pastors who use mysterious powers to pull Christians and kill then for more powers. All my children have ran away from the Catholic Church in search for miracles, signs and wonders,"" she told CNN while holding back tears. Another Christian, Mveng Thomas, said his marriage ended abruptly when a Pentecostal pastor ordered his wife to dissolve their union. He said the pastor described him as ""an unrepentant devil."" Pastors marched against the government's decision Wednesday in Bamenda and Douala. Pastors said the Biya government sees the mass proliferation of churches as a threat. Boniface Tum, a bishop of the Christian Church of God in Yaounde, said that Biya, who has been president since 1982, is becoming insecure about the freedom of speech within these churches. ""Authorizing only the Catholic, Presbyterian, Baptist, Muslim, and a few other churches, is a strict violation of the right to religion,"" Tum added. Targeted Pentecostal Christians in Bamenda are transforming their private homes into churches. North West Regional governor Adolphe Lele L'Afrique said Wednesday that police had discovered the abduction of 30 children under age 18 by a pastor in Bamenda. The pastor said he wanted to remove the children from a bad society, Lele added. Government officials also say that some pastors convince congregants that they do not need professional medical treatment for their ailments. ""How can a pastor say the sick needs no medical doctor? We need sanity in our Christian lives,"" Nyang Blaise, a youth leader for Biya's ruling party, CPDM, told CNN. One woman said her mother was refusing cancer treatments because of her pastor. ""My mother's condition is worsening after doctors confirmed she had cancer. She is dying silently, and yet we cannot persuade her to see a doctor for proper treatment, against her pastor's wish,"" Deborah Tanyi said.","President Paul Biya has ordered 100 churches closed throughout Cameroon .

"Egypt's new temporary government began to take shape on Sunday, with reformer and Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei sworn in as the country's interim vice president for foreign relations. Nabil Fahmy, former Egyptian ambassador to the United States, accepted the post of foreign minister, he told CNN. Ahmed Galal, a liberal economist educated in the United States and a World Bank veteran, has been appointed as finance minister, and Hisham Zaazou will retain his post as tourism minister, the state-run MENA news agency said. These are key first steps in establishing a civilian governance, after the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsy in a coup early this month. And it's the first phase of a transition that is expected to usher in presidential elections next year. Ruling authorities are focused on choosing technocrats -- nonpolitical people with expertise in particular fields -- who will help bring back efficient governance and foster a functioning economy. Critics of Morsy's government have decried what they said was rife administrative incompetence and political cronyism during the ousted president's administration -- dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood and its political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party. A reason for staging the coup was offered in a statement from Egypt's top military officer, Gen. Abdel-Fatah El-Sisi. In a statement posted on the military's Facebook site Sunday, he said that the armed forces decided to side with ""the people"" against the Morsy government when the president refused a demand for a referendum that would authorize a new presidential election. ""The people were worried that the state and its tools will be used against their rights, and therefore, the armed forces had to confirm the legitimacy of the people and help them restore their inherent rights to choose and decide, and that is what we did,"" the statement said. Morsy, Muslim Brotherhood face probe . A technocracy in the making . The choices represent a change in direction, away from the Islamist bent of the Morsy government. ElBaradei -- who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his work as director general of the U.N. International Atomic Energy Agency -- and the others are people with whom Western governments have been comfortable. The head of the IAEA from 1997 to 2009, ElBaradei has been regarded as an outsider in Egypt because of his international achievements. While he ran unsuccessfully for president last year, he persisted as a reformer and has a reputation as a technocrat. Fahmy is the founding dean of American University in Cairo's School of Public Affairs and a ""career diplomat,"" according to his bio on the school website. He has ""played an active role in the numerous efforts to bring peace to the Middle East, as well as in international and regional disarmament affairs."" Galal is managing director of the Economic Research Forum -- a research institution covering the Arab countries, Iran and Turkey -- and fits the bill as a technocrat. His bio on the ERF website calls him ""a noted, non-partisan, proponent of the importance of growth with equity"" and of the ""vital role of politics for sound economic policies. Zaazou was one of the few ministers in Morsy's Cabinet who hadn't been connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. He resigned from the Morsy government in the weeks before the coup, because a man associated with an Islamist group tied to militants who killed tourists in 1997 was appointed as governor of Luxor province. International tourism is a huge business in Egypt, and Luxor, with its ancient monuments, has been a major tourist attraction. The ongoing political unrest in Egypt has hurt tourism. Interim Prime Minister Hazem El-Beblawi will meet with Cabinet nominees Sunday and Monday in an effort to complete formation of a new government by Tuesday or Wednesday, state-run EGYNews reported. Egypt's fever of violence: Where is accountability? U.S. diplomacy . The United States has long had a close relationship with Egypt and a high-ranking diplomat is visiting there to ""underscore U.S. support for the Egyptian people,"" the State Department said. Egypt gets $1.3 billion in annual military aid. During the rule of Hosni Mubarak -- ousted in 2011 at the beginning of the Arab Spring -- the government had been pro-Western and a bulwark against Muslim extremism. It continues to maintain a peace treaty and diplomatic ties with Israel. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns is visiting Cairo through Tuesday. He will meet with ""interim government officials and civil society and business leaders."" Civil society is a reference to nongovernmental groups and entities independent of government and business. Burns will be emphasizing ""an end to all violence, and a transition leading to an inclusive, democratically elected civilian government.""

"The family home where a young Steve Jobs built the first Apple computer may soon become a protected historical site. The seven-member Los Altos Historical Commission has scheduled a ""historic property evaluation"" for the single-story, ranch-style house on Monday. If  the designation is ultimately approved, then the house on 2066 Crist Drive in Los Altos, California, will have to be preserved. The faux religion of Steve Jobs . Jobs moved to the house with his foster parents as a 7th grader, and lived there through high school. In the attached garage, he and Steve Wozniak toiled to assemble the first 50 Apple 1 computers.

"(CNN)The city of Portland is losing one of its most beloved institutions: its airport carpet. But the carpet is going out in sentimental style, with a wave of commemorative T-shirts, beer and now even a new edition of hoop shoes bearing the iconic design. The latest entrant: Adidas with an addition to Trail Blazers' star Damien Lillard's line of sneakers made to resemble the iconic floor covering. The shoe is the result of ""a really quick-turn creation process"" to jump on the ever-hottening trend, according to Adidas U.S. public relations director Michael Ehrlich. Portland is home to the German shoe company's North American headquarters. ""Something special for my PDX fans,"" Lillard tweeted Wednesday. The abstract teal design has become a symbol of home for Portlanders over the last 27 years, welcoming an estimated 300 million people to the city. And after all those feet, it's showing its age. The 2013 decision to replace the carpet with a new design sparked an outpouring of affection -- and not a small amount of capitalism -- from the Portland crowd. The Portland Timbers soccer team and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers have commemorated the  PDX carpet, as it's known by locals, by selling limited-edition T-shirts of the pattern in the team colors. A handful of true fanatics have even had the design permanently etched onto their skin. ""It is definitely an endearing statement of how much (Portlanders) like the pattern,"" says Kama Simonds, a communications officer for the Port of Portland. Jeremy Dunn, who sells socks with the PDX pattern through his online store, The Athletic Community, says the item has been a best-seller from the start. ""My wife and I joke about it all the time, because when I made the initial order of 72 pair of socks she was, let's just say, not that stoked about having that many pairs of teal socks lying around our apartment. But they sold out in the first hour that we posted them on our Instagram accounts,"" he said. The impending demise of the carpet has also inspired a Facebook page, three Twitter accounts and an Instagram account -- all run independently by carpet groupies. Ceara Chewning, who manages the PDX Carpet Facebook page, notes that the carpet has a certain ""Je ne sais quoi."" ""It seems like in most places, the carpet is there to fade into the background, but this has such a bright, cheerful eye-grabbing pattern. It's also a symbol of making it home,"" explains Chewning. ""It's also ugly, but in a really cute, endearing way, and Portland seems to love that."" Despite the rampant nostalgia for the old floor covering, Simonds says the carpet is overdue for a replacement: . ""We're starting to see more than general wear and tear. The seams are showing, and you're seeing frayed edges. In some spots, it's so threadbare, the underlying mat pokes through,"" she says. ""It's been on the floor for more than 20 years. Someone did a calculation and figured about 300 million people have passed over it."" The new carpet design, created by Hennebery Eddy Architects, hasn't quite received the same love (though it does at least have its own Twitter account). ""I get that the old design is cool. It's kind of quintessential 1980s, and it's like an old friend we don't want to leave behind, but it's OK to have a new friend, too,"" says Michelle Vo, principal at Hennebery Eddy.

"In minutes, the world's most-watched new father sent a message about millions of dads. Stepping outside the hospital with his wife, Catherine, and their newborn son, Prince William was a picture of confidence. Each parent held the baby, now known to the world as George Alexander Louis -- and they looked equally comfortable doing so. He got his newborn all set in the car seat, and drove off. Analysts noted that he was projecting an image of equality. To many dads, he was representing the reality that we know: The image of bumbling, clueless dads is an outdated stereotype. Of course, that doesn't mean we think we're picture-perfect -- a point that came up when CNN recently asked dads what it means to be a father in today's world. Some decided to use the iReport assignment as a chance to open up about their insecurities. ""Although I know that the intent of this report is to stand up proudly and say, '... I'm a dad and I'm damn good at it,' the truth is I don't feel that way half the time,"" stay-at-home dad Chase Roper wrote from Puyallup, Washington. ""Most days, if I'm being honest, I feel like I'm faking my way through this."" That's how just about all parents feel sometimes: overwhelmed. Yes, that includes, I'm sure, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, even in the life they lead. ""I am far from perfect in my role as a father,"" writes Lance Somerfeld, who has been a stay-at-home dad in Manhattan for five years and founded the NYC Dads Group.  ""I lose my temper, get impatient, too structured, don't do the laundry, and fail miserably, often. It's the most challenging job I have ever encountered as well as the most rewarding."" We were looking for dads' thoughts on the 30-year anniversary of ""Mr. Mom"" -- a movie that made sense at the time, when a dad taking on traditionally female roles at home was so rare. And when it was more believable that he would have so much trouble figuring out how to do basics around the house. Little did those behind the film know that it would ultimately stand as something of a historical demarcation. The funniest thing about the idea of ""Mr. Mom"" now is that it was such a funny idea in the first place. Modern fathers face new expectations . Statistics tell a piece of the story. There are about 189,000 stay-at-home dads now, caring for 369,000 children, according to the U.S. Census. These are defined as married fathers with kids younger than 15 who have stayed out of the labor force for at least a year primarily to care for the family. A more striking figure: 18% of preschoolers are regularly cared for by their fathers during the mother's working hours. As these numbers keep growing, the perception that child-rearing and homemaking are ""women's work"" that dads sometimes do becomes increasingly anachronistic. ""1983 was Mr. Mom's Year. It's 2013. Just call me dad,"" Chris Bernholdt, stay-at-home father in Devon, Pennsylvania, writes on his blog, ""DadNCharge."" The National At-Home Dad Network, which provides support and advocacy to its members, has even launched a campaign to banish the term, citing a Wall Street Journal declaration: ""Mr. Mom is dead."" Many people who use the term certainly mean no harm.  But for some dads, getting past the term is an important way to end the mindset that suggests their work at home is any less ""manly"" than bringing home a paycheck. ""I was called 'Mr. Mom' by a random guy at my wife's hair salon,"" says Joseph Carlson, full-time dad of a 14-month-old boy in San Diego. ""He said, 'You can't play Mr. Mom too long.' I was pretty stunned."" And a female relative asked Carlson, ""When are you going to get a job? You can't stay home forever."" ""She said 'Mr. Mom' without saying 'Mr. Mom,'"" Carlson says. ""I just let the comments go. I know I'm not going to change any person's worldview with a 30-minute debate."" Those of us who work full-time but are more committed to our kids than to our jobs are just as quick to reject the stereotypes of bumbling, clueless fathers in commercials, TV shows, or online.  That's partly because negative portrayals of dads can cause problems -- like affecting how the judicial system views fathers' parental capabilities. We also speak out to share ideas and advice -- because modern dads understand each other.  We know what it is to be fathers in changing times, facing challenges and pressures, and committed to keeping parenthood our top priority. There's a kind of communal celebration going on. On blogs and at conferences, dads are sharing with each other how awesome it is to live in a time that's so far beyond ""Mr. Mom."" We know we're part of something special: A generation that's helping turn American fatherhood into something more emotional and deeper -- something I referred to in a TEDx Talk as a part of the ultimate dream. But saying a loud, vociferous ""no"" to ""Mr. Mom"" doesn't mean claiming the mantle of Superdad. It just means we're trying to do our best. Just like good moms across the country. American dads have come a long way in 30 years. And we're not alone, as Prince William showed. Just imagine what's ahead.

"A deeply divided Supreme Court nudged the nation toward broad recognition of same-sex marriage on Wednesday in rulings that advocates hailed as a ""joyous occasion"" -- but still left many questions unanswered. Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions, justices threw out part of a law that denied hundreds of federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California. At the same time, the high court declined to make a sweeping statement on the broader issue of same-sex marriage rights nationwide, rejecting California's same-sex marriage ban but leaving intact laws banning such marriages in 35 other states. New Jersey has civil unions for same-sex couples, while New Mexico's marriage law is gender neutral and recognizes valid marriages performed in other states. While the rulings fell short of the goal same-sex marriage advocates have set -- eliminating all laws limiting the rights of gays and lesbians to marry -- celebrations erupted outside the Supreme Court, as well as in San Francisco and around the country. Map: Same-sex marriage, state by state . In Washington, the couples who sued to dismantle the Defense of Marriage Act and its ban on federal benefits for same-sex couples emerged from the Supreme Court to thunderous cheers, simply holding their arms aloft in victory. In San Francisco, Crispin Hollins, who had already set a date for his wedding in the wake of the decision, said there was too much to celebrate to be disappointed by what the rulings didn't do. ""I'm confident that opinion in the United States is shifting towards being in favor of same-sex marriage, so it will simply take more time and allow the nation to come along in a way that will provide more lasting support for equality,"" he said. Opponents of same-sex marriage saw both peril and promise in the rulings, expressing dismay in the court's decision on the Defense of Marriage Act but taking some comfort in the decision not to dismantle same-sex marriage bans nationwide. ""Their refusal to redefine marriage for all states is a major setback for those seeking to redefine natural marriage,"" said Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. ""Time is not on the side of those seeking to create same-sex 'marriage.'"" What's next for gay rights movement? What the rulings say . In its divided ruling on the federal Defense of Marriage Act, the high court said legally married same-sex couples must receive the same benefits provided to heterosexual couples. The act had defined marriage as only between a man and a woman, but the court said the law violated the rights of same-sex couples by demoting their marriages to second-class status when compared to their heterosexual peers. The court said law wrongly ""instructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others."" Now, the federal government recognizes the marriage of those same-sex couples who are legally married in their states. More on the Defense of Marriage Act ruling . A divided high court also handed a victory to same-sex proponents when it cleared the way for gay and lesbian couples to marry in California, dismissing an appeal to the state's voter-approved Proposition 8 that banned such marriages. The 5-4 decision avoids, for now, a sweeping conclusion on whether same-sex marriage is a constitutional ""equal protection"" right that would apply to all states. More about the Prop 8 ruling . Practical impact . In addition to restoring same-sex marriage in California, the decisions will eventually allow same-sex couples in states where they're legally allowed to marry to apply for retirement, survivor and other benefits as married couples. They'll also be able to benefit from hundreds of other federal programs that have been, until now, reserved for heterosexual married couples under the Defense of Marriage Act's definition of marriage as between a man and a woman. But exactly when they'll get those benefits is unclear. What the rulings mean in terms of taxes, benefits . After the decisions were announced, President Barack Obama ordered a review of federal statutes to ensure the ruling is ""implemented swiftly and smoothly."" But he didn't give a more precise timeline. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said he would work to get benefits to service members as soon as possible. ""That is now the law, and it is the right thing to do,"" he said. It's also unclear when same-sex marriages might resume in California. Gov. Jerry Brown said he wants marriage licenses to begin flowing to gay and lesbian couples the moment the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals confirms that a court order preventing their issuance has been lifted. Attorney General Kamala Harris said weddings could begin as soon as the order is lifted, which she said she was urging the court to do quickly. In Los Angeles, the county registrar's office said they're ready. Hollywood celebrates: Guess who's getting hitched? ""Couldn't be more proud' Same-sex marriage advocates were, in a word, elated. ""I did not count on them moving this far,"" said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who called it the rulings ""an incredible victory."" ""Today's historic decisions put two giant cracks in the dark wall of discrimination that separates committed gay and lesbian couples from full equality,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, who called the rulings ""a joyous milestone."" ""While we celebrate the victory for Californians today, tomorrow we turn our attention to the millions of LGBT people who don't feel the reach of these decisions,"" he said. American University student Mollie Wagoner was waiting outside the Supreme Court for the decision with her girlfriend, Sharon Burk, when the word came down. ""I don't even have words. I'm just so happy, and just overwhelmed with emotion,"" she said. ""I couldn't be more proud of my country and of the Supreme Court today. I'm so happy to be here and be a part of it."" 'A devastating thing' Of course, not everyone was pleased by the ruling. While public opinion has shifted strongly toward support of same-sex marriage in recent years, many conservatives, particularly faith-based conservatives, find the idea of same-sex marriage incomprehensible and dangerous. The Rev. Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, found the decision on the Defense of Marriage Act, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, immensely troubling. ""Justice Kennedy's opinion takes us to the brink of nationwide same-sex marriage. And I believe that will be a devastating thing for this country,"" he said. Yes it will, said John Eastman of the National Organization for Marriage. ""When you destroy or redefine the institution, all of society will be harmed, society that's put such stock in the institution as a counterbalance to government and the way we raise and educate our children,"" he said. Reaction among the U.S. religious community . Others on both sides found mixed messages in the rulings. Casey Miller said he initially cheered Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling that essentially recognizes same-sex marriages. But, he told CNN's iReport, ""As soon as I read some of the news articles describing the decision, it sucked for us and for the majority of same-sex couples living in states with state marriage bans."" Miller, 50, married John Martin in California before Proposition 8 was overturned. The couple now lives in Texas where same-sex marriage isn't recognized. ""Are we still second-class citizens?"" he asked. He called Wednesday's ruling ""an expensive baby step."" On the other side, the Rev. Rob Schenck, chairman of the Evangelical Church Alliance, said he was disappointed ""in the short-term results and the short-term questions that remain unsettled."" ""But,"" he said, ""the public conversation continues and that's a good thing."" What about couples who still can't marry?","California's attorney general urges quick action to allow same-sex marriages .

"One of the men accused of gang raping and fatally beating a woman on a New Delhi bus was found dead in his jail cell Monday. Police say Ram Singh hanged himself. But his lawyer and parents claim he was murdered. ""There was no reason for him to commit suicide. There is some foul play,"" Singh's attorney V.K. Anand said. Singh was housed in New Delhi's Tihar Prison. Last year, the prison recorded 18 deaths, including two suicides, according to CNN affiliate CNN-IBN. ""Ram Singh did not kill himself. He was murdered,"" Singh's father, Mangi Lai, told the affiliate. New Delhi's Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said she has ordered an inquiry. Authorties say Singh was the driver of the bus aboard which several men brutally raped a 23-year-old woman on December 16. The gang rape, and the woman's subsequent death from injuries, prompted angry protests over the country's treatment of women and handling of sexual attacks. Police charged Singh and four other men with murder, rape and kidnapping. Their trial began in February. If convicted, the men could face the death penalty. A sixth suspect is 17 and will be tried separately in juvenile court. The December rape gripped India and led to calls for stricter laws on sexual assault and changes in cultural attitudes toward women. Most Indian women have stories of sexual harassment and abuse on public transportation or on the streets, according to the Indian Council on Global Relations.","Suspect's lawyer: ""There was no reason for him to commit suicide""

"Last year, voters in Colorado approved legalizing recreational marijuana, and on Tuesday night, they resoundingly supported taxing it. With nearly all votes counted, 65% supported the new tax, while 35%  opposed it. The measure would impose a special 15% excise tax on marijuana to help fund school construction, along with a 10% sales tax to bolster marijuana-related law enforcement efforts. The passage was widely expected, despite opponents arguing it's unfair to single out marijuana for higher taxation than products such as beer. Strong support for the measure is pegged largely to the money it is expected to bring in. The nonpartisan Colorado Legislative Council projects that the measure will generate nearly $70 million in additional state tax revenue next year. There were 30 other measures on the ballot in six states Tuesday, all of which were too early to call for CNN. Here are highlights from a few: . Colorado: secession . Voters in 11 counties in northern Colorado are being asked if they want to secede from the state. Ten counties in conservative, rural northeastern Colorado would theoretically form a 51st state known as North Colorado.  Moffat County, located in the northwest corner of the state, would become a panhandle for neighboring Wyoming. The plan has no chance of becoming reality. Among other things, it would also require statewide and congressional approval. But approval or even a close vote at the county level would send a loud message of growing grassroots conservative anger toward a more liberal Denver-based Democratic establishment that has taken up controversial measures related to gun control, gay rights and green energy. With more than 50,000 votes counted in Weld County, the most populated county of those trying to secede, 58% of votes were against secession and 42% were in favor of it. CNN, however, does not yet have a projection on this measure. Similar secession measures have been floated in a number of other states in recent years in a reflection of the country's growing ideological and partisan divide. Washington: Labeling genetically modified food . Voters in Washington state are considering a hotly contested initiative that would require labeling all foods containing genetically modified ingredients. The measure pits local consumer advocates, who argue that the measure is needed for consumers to make better informed choices, against large agribusinesses such as Monsanto, which argue that such a law would spook potential customers and unfairly imply that such products are unsafe. Washington is the second state to consider such a ballot measure. A similar proposal was narrowly rejected by California voters last year. With more than 800,000 votes counted, 53% of Washington State voters opposed the labeling, while 47% supported it. It is still, however, too early for CNN to call this race. According to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures, 95 bills relating to the issue have been introduced in various legislatures so far this year -- a reflection of growing public interest in the controversy surrounding genetically modified foods. Other noteworthy measures . Voters in New Jersey are considering whether to amend their constitution to raise the state minimum wage from the federal level of $7.25 to $8.25 per hour. Future annual increases would be tied to changes in the cost of living. Eighteen states have a minimum wage that exceeds the federal requirement, according to the NCSL. New York voters are being asked to revise their constitution to allow the legislature in Albany to authorize seven casinos, with the goal of generating new revenue for public schools and potentially cutting property taxes.","Voters in Colorado resoundingly supported taxing marijuana on Tuesday .

"A team of international investigators is exploring a site for chemical weapons when a sudden explosion rips through the air, scattering the workers and terrified civilians, who make a frantic run for cover in the ensuing chaos. In a split second, this group of inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have become de facto field medics, scouring the scene for survivors and administering first aid to those injured in the blast. It is only after the inspectors have dressed the wounds of all the victims that an instructor appears and tells the men he is satisfied with their performance. And although this is merely a training exercise being acted out in a foggy field in central Germany, the lessons inspectors learn here could potentially save lives on their next deployment. OPCW inspectors have been tasked with cataloguing and monitoring the destruction of all of Syria's chemical weapons. They have been in hostile environments before, but never as a war is still raging on the ground. The conflict in Syria has claimed at least 100,000 lives since 2011, and dozens more are being killed every day. EXCLUSIVE: Inside an OPCW chemical weapons lab . Franz Ontal is the head of training for OPCW inspectors in Germany. ""We are performing our inspections in the middle of a conflict,"" he tells CNN. ""We've never done this before. It's not something you could have foreseen two years ago and planned for."" This hostile environment training course, conducted by the German army, is teaching OPCW inspectors to identify dangerous situations and to avoid getting kidnapped, but also to help if they witness violent events -- knowledge that may be indispensable in war-torn Syria. In August, snipers opened fire on a convoy of U.N. experts investigating a suspected chemical weapons attack in the suburbs of Damascus. One U.N. vehicle was disabled in the attack, and the inspectors were forced to turn back. Reinhard Barz, the head of hostile environments training for the German army, believes the biggest threats could emerge when the inspectors move into areas contested between rebel fighters and the regime forces of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. ""We have different players in Syria and I think [it will not be] easy for the trainees here,"" Barz tells CNN. ""They have to be prepared for ambushes, but also fighting might break out in some areas. The key is to try and get out of those situations quickly."" The OPCW, which has been on the ground in Syria since October 1, was awarded this year's Nobel Peace Prize. The organisation has two branches. One is comprised of the laboratory scientists who analyze field samples and send them to other independent partner labs for separate analysis. The other branch is the inspectors who catalogue stockpiles of chemical weapons, oversee their destruction, take samples after alleged attacks and speak to witnesses on the ground. Many inspectors have a background in science, but their ranks are also made up of logistics experts, weapons experts who identify munitions that may have been used to deploy chemical weapons, and health and safety experts to make sure the teams do not get overexposed to potentially dangerous chemicals. Twenty-five inspectors from 17 nations have taken part in the training program in Wildflecken, Germany this week. The head of training tells CNN he is happy with their performance. ""They identified what had happened and quickly helped everyone. I think they did really well."" But as realistic as the training was, it was just an exercise. And the next stop for some of inspectors could be one of the most dangerous places in the world.","OPCW inspectors are preparing for deployment to Syria with a training program in Germany .

"Joshua Wong, the most prominent of Hong Kong's student protest leaders, alleged he was assaulted by police who used excessive force -- including repeatedly grabbing his genitals -- during his arrest at pro-democracy demonstrations. Wong, 18, made the claims after appearing in court Thursday charged with obstructing officers clearing a protest site in the city's Mong Kok district the day earlier. Wong's lawyer, Michael Vidler, told CNN his client had been ""clearly targeted by police."" ""Excessive force was used and he was assaulted while he was on the ground,"" said Vidler. ""Police kicked and punched him and effectively sexually assaulted him -- his private parts were grabbed repeatedly and painfully. We're considering our next steps and will decide over the next few days how to proceed."" READ MORE: Who is Joshua Wong? Glasses gone . Footage of Wong's arrest shows the teenager being suddenly rushed by a man wearing a police vest, then forcefully dragged away and disappearing beneath a huddle of police officers. Wong, who had earlier been filmed in heated but non-violent exchanges with people clearing the road of barricades, later tweeted he had lost his signature glasses during the arrest. In response to Wong's claims, police issued a statement saying that if anyone believed they had been treated unfairly by police, they could take action through the Complaints Against Police Office. Vidler said Hong Kong police were displaying ""increasingly brutal"" behavior as the protests entered their third month. ""People are learning the other side of the Hong Kong police and it's not an attractive side,"" he said. Seven Hong Kong police officers were arrested this week for an alleged assault at a pro-democracy protest in October, in which officers were filmed apparently punching and kicking a demonstrator on a side street. The alleged victim, a social worker and member of the 1,200-strong election committee that currently chooses Hong Kong's leader, was photographed with facial bruising and numerous welts on his back in the wake of the incident. READ MORE: Hong Kong police arrested for alleged assault on protester . Pelted with eggs . Wong was granted bail Thursday, along with two other prominent protest leaders arrested in the efforts to clear the Mong Kok site -- Lester Shum, of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, and Leung Kwok-hung, an activist and lawmaker known as ""Long Hair."" The trio was released under the condition they steer clear of parts of Mong Kok, and their cases will be heard in January. Speaking to reporters after his court appearance, Wong denied the charge against him, saying he had had no physical conflict with officials working to clear the protest site. Following his remarks, he was pelted with eggs by members of the public. Police said two men, aged 26 and 32, had been arrested and charged with common assault over the incident. After his court appearance, Shum also told reporters he had been violently arrested, and complained that the bail restriction banning him from parts of Mong Kok was unreasonable, as the Federation of Students' office was in the district. Scores arrested . The protest leaders were among nearly 200 people arrested in Mong Kok since police began a major operation Tuesday to clear two main thoroughfares in the district of protesters. Standoffs between police and protesters continued throughout the week into Friday night, when 28 people were arrested for charges including unlawful assembly, assaulting police, possessing an offensive weapon and hindering police officers, police said. Protesters calling for universal suffrage have occupied camps around the semi-autonomous Chinese territory for two months, including a main protest site outside government buildings in Admiralty on Hong Kong Island. They want to be able to nominate candidates for the election of the city's chief executive in 2017; China's central government has said they'll be able to vote only for candidates approved by a pro-Beijing committee. Mong Kok has been the site of some of the most violent clashes of a predominantly peaceful protest movement. Authorities began clearing the streets of barricades and shelters Tuesday in accordance with court injunctions obtained by local business interests, following complaints that the protests have disrupted commercial life in the city. The operation sparked occasionally heated clashes with protesters, and prompted threats by demonstrators to reoccupy the site. 'Abandon Mong Kok' But on Friday morning, Wong called for protesters in Mong Kok to relocate at the other protest sites in Admiralty and Causeway Bay instead. In comments to a local radio station, he said the protest movement lacked the manpower to occupy three sites, and cited concerns about police enforcement in Mong Kok. As well as the alleged use of excessive force during protests, police have used a pepper spray-like solution in confrontations with protesters. In tweets, Wong also called on fellow protesters to continue their fight. ""I ask my friends not to surrender. We still have a chance to battle once more,"" he wrote. On Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Federation of Students, Yvonne Leung, indicated the group might also shift its focus to government buildings in order to build pressure against the city's leaders. ""I think we have made it very clear that if they [the police] continue the violent way of clearing up the place, we will have further actions,"" Leung told public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK). ""The further actions include a possibility of some escalations pointed at government-related buildings or some of the government-related departments."" Following the clearance of the Mong Kok thoroughfares, Hong Kong Chief Executive C. Y. Leung urged people to return to the busy commercial precinct to go shopping, RTHK reported.","Hong Kong protest leader Joshua Wong accuses police of excessive force against him .

"""What is Prince William like?"" It's a question I often get asked, and in this interview I think people will, for the first time, get a real sense of his character. I would love to say it was purely down to me, but it probably has more to do with the moment. William was less than two weeks into parenthood when I spoke to him. He was tired, elated and still grappling with how he'd changed since becoming a father. I could sense how he had been consumed by his new way of life -- I've been there myself and other fathers will pick up on it too. He may be a prince but he's doing it the old-fashioned (non-royal) way. He and his wife are the ones getting up at night and changing the nappies/diapers. William was the one who, outside the hospital, fixed his son's car seat in, then drove home for the first time with his new family. He's a royal duke and he has people who can do all these things for him, but he's doing it himself. As a result, this heir to the throne has been given a rare insight into what it's like to be ordinary, and we're able to connect with him. I met William at Kensington Palace. I had been chasing an interview with him for more than two years, so I wasn't there by chance, but in the end it all felt quite informal and relaxed. It was almost as if we had bumped into each other as we both walked into a room at the same time. We started chatting, he was on great form and I knew immediately that he was going to give a great interview. The plan was to discuss African conservation and specifically a new award scheme organized by one of his charities, the Tusk Trust. Inevitably we ended up chatting about fatherhood as well. The conversation continued as we walked out of the main building, past the small cottage he's currently occupying with his family and into their walled garden where the interview would take place. The duke only had his press secretary with him and neither of them raised any notable questions or concerns. In fact before I knew it, the cameras were rolling and the interview was under way. I had decided not to rely on notes and just have a conversation. It worked.  William was very comfortable and revealing about his conservation work, and I can't wait for people to see the full version of the interview in next month's special. The subject of Prince George came up several times during the discussion about conservation, and his father was happy to talk about his son in his own right too. I was struck by how he had what felt like a particularly tight family unit. It was the way he said: ""For me, Catherine, and now little George are my priorities ... and Lupo (the dog)."" I also thought it was interesting that he isn't sending out a message about modern monarchy in the way that he's handling things, he's just doing it his own way, being himself. It could be any new dad, and that's what I like about the interview. His honesty even stretched to admitting he's looking forward to going back to work ... something other new dads will relate to, but perhaps won't admit quite as easily. There's more next month when we air what's set to be a stunning documentary.","CNN's Max Foster had been chasing the interview with William for two years .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A woman in central China has been prosecuted for selling her newborn baby for $7,000, state media reports said, the latest of a string of shocking cases that have shed light on the country's trade in children. The 30-year-old woman, surnamed Huang, allegedly colluded with an obstetrician, Yang, in Xinxiang county, Henan province, to sell the baby boy, according to details published in the Procuratorial Daily, a legal publication. Yang sold the baby boy to a couple in the same county for 42,000 yuan. She gave 35,000 yuan to Huang and kept 7,000 yuan for herself, the report said. The case came to light in August after the boy's grandmother alerted police. The grandmother said Huang had left the village to go to her parents' home after quarreling with her husband. When Huang returned two weeks later, she said the baby had died but the grandmother grew suspicious as her daughter-in-law didn't seem sad. A relative then discovered that the boy had been sold. Huang had a son from a previous marriage and thought a new baby would be bad for the elder child, reports said. The boy is now in the care of his father's family. Child trafficking is a long-standing problem in China. A traditional preference for sons and the country's one-child policy means that boys are particularly prized. Earlier this month, a Chinese man who was abducted from a vegetable market as a toddler enjoyed an emotional reunion with his father after 24 years apart. The news came  the same week police said they had busted a trafficking ring involving at least 103 people, and rescued 37 newborn babies that were transported in handbags and suitcases to prospective buyers. According to the U.S. State Department's 2014 Trafficking in Persons Report, China does not fully comply with the recommended minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking; however, the report says it is making significant efforts to do.

"Hackers have attempted more than a dozen cyber attacks against the Obamacare website, according to a top Homeland Security Department official. The attacks, which are under investigation, failed, said the official. Authorities also  are investigating a separate report of a tool designed to put heavy strain on HealthCare.gov through a so-called distributed denial of service. It does not appear to have been activated. ""We received about 16 reports from HHS that are under investigation and one open source report about a denial of service,"" according to Acting Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Roberta Stempfley of the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications. Related: Many in Congress avoiding health care exchanges . Stempfley testified at a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee that the attempts were made between November 6 and November 8, but none were successful. The DDOS program, called ""Destroy Obama Care,"" was recently spotted on a ""torrent"" file sharing web page, and first reported last week on a blog by Arbor Networks, which said it found no evidence the program had actually been launched to attack the troubled federal portal for consumers to shop for health coverage. ""We have not monitored any attacks. We have not seen any sizable, or anything to believe that these problems are related to DDOS,"" said Dan Holden director of security research for Arbor Networks, adding ""I don't believe that the problems with the site's availability is due to any kind of DDOS attack."" Related: White House officials get earful from Democrats on Obamacare . In a separate hearing, a top Health and Human Services official, Chief Information Officer Frank Baitman, said his department had engaged an ""ethical hacker"" on staff to test the defenses of the health care site. The hacker discovered between seven and 10 items related to attempted security breaches which were disclosed in a report. Baitman said he would not describe these items as serious and said the majority had been resolved. The use of hackers employed to test on line site security is common, Holden said. ""That's pretty standard practice, generally referred to as penetration testing,"" Holden told CNN. ""There are many companies and individuals out there that have done that for a very long time. The idea being, you want to know where your weaknesses are and what the potential of attacks could be."" Related: Obamacare's first month: 106,000 signed up . But others are still concerned about the security of the site. In statements made before the House Homeland Security hearing, database expert Luke Chung --whose company did not work on HealthCare.gov -- provided his technical assessment, saying that the problem with the roll out of the website was far deeper than ""too many users."" Chung said that in his estimation the skill set of the designers of the website were subpar, adding that ""when you have an environment where the developer can barely get the web site functional, security is way down on the list of things to take care of. Security has to be built-in at the very beginning not at the very end."" But, critical infrastructure protection specialist and CEO of Lunarline, Inc., Waylon Krush told the committee, ""There's not a system out there that's perfect in nature, by any means, from a cybersecurity perspective.""

"It has been a rough month or so for the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration, which has been struggling to get its signature health insurance program off the ground. Obamacare, the effort to extend health coverage to every American, has already achieved some of its biggest goals: no more denials of coverage for pre-existing conditions, allowing parents to keep children on their policies up to age 26, the eventual phase-out of the ""doughnut hole"" for Medicare's prescription drug coverage. But the big enchilada was the rollout of the online federal and state exchanges for Americans to shop for insurance coverage, and that has been plagued by delays since the October 1 launch.  Obama also was forced to admit that his longstanding reassurance that people could keep their insurance plans if they liked them wasn't holding up, as insurers began sending cancellation notices to an estimated several million people whose individual policies don't meet Obamacare requirements for comprehensive coverage. So, here's a quick look at some of the problems the Affordable Care Act has encountered and what is being done to address them: . Issue: Enrollments . Target: 7 million by March 31 . Status: More than 106,000 people had signed up by Wednesday -- but nearly 80,000 of those joined through the exchanges set up by 14 states and the District of Columbia. The buggy federal website, which handles enrollments for 36 of the 50 states, produced fewer than 27,000. Another 396,000 people were determined to be eligible for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, but it wasn't clear how many had joined those state-administered programs. The reaction from Republicans, who unanimously opposed the legislation, was swift. House Speaker John Boehner called the results ""a symbol of the failure of the President's health care law. It is a rolling calamity that must be scrapped."" White House spokesman Jay Carney conceded before the numbers came out that they would be lower than expected. But Jonathan Gruber, the economist who helped design the Massachusetts health care program used as the model for the Affordable Care Act, said the first month's figures are ""meaningless."" ""The real deadline we have to focus on is March of next year,"" Gruber, who also advised the Obama administration, told CNN's The Lead. ""That's when the individual mandate kicks in. That's when people need to be signed up, and what we saw in Massachusetts was a large rush before the mandate kicked in."" The latest on Obamacare enrollment . Issue: HealthCare.gov . Target: A capacity of 50,000-60,000 users at any given time . Status: Currently 20,000-25,000, White House Chief Technology Officer Todd Park said Wednesday. Henry Chao, the chief information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the site can process nearly 17,000 registrations per hour. ""We have much work still to do but are making progress at a growing rate,"" Park told the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. The administration has said it aims to get the website working for a ""vast majority"" of Americans looking to enroll by November 30. ""The team is working really hard to hit that goal,"" Park said Wednesday. But Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, expressed some skepticism about that target: ""As a former web developer, that was what I was telling clients when we were gonna miss a deadline."" Official: Hackers tried repeatedly to attack Obamacare website . Issue: Retaining existing plans . Target: In touting the Affordable Care Act, Obama repeatedly said, ""If you like your health insurance, you can keep it."" Status: No longer a selling point, as at least 1 million individual policy holders have been told their plans are being discontinued or changed at the end of the year. Congress is weighing different proposals to address the problem. Obama and other administration officials say those plans offered substandard coverage, leaving people at risk of bankruptcy if they were hospitalized or developed other major medical needs, and that the 80% of Americans who are covered through their jobs or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid won't see any changes. But they are now qualifying the pledge by saying that people who had individual plans dating back to before the 2010 passage of the Affordable Care Act can keep their plans as long as the policies hadn't been changed by the insurance companies; the ones that have been changed must now meet new minimum standards set in the law. There are multiple proposals on Capitol Hill to allow people to keep policies that are being canceled. But there's little indication they would have any immediate effect, and industry experts say the two leading legislative plans leave many questions unanswered.

"Ever the gentleman, nothing could stop William Gordon from escorting his wife, Nelly, on her greatest journey. He lovingly watched their children crowd around their mother to say goodbye. Suddenly, Nelly stretched her arms, smiled as if she were a blushing bride, lay down on the bed and died. Gordon, though, had died five years earlier. Legend has it that when Nelly, the mother of Girl Scouts founder Juliette Gordon Low, died in 1917, her husband came back to escort his wife to the great beyond. According to the Gordon family, the butler saw the late master walking down the stairs and out the front door of their stately Savannah, Georgia, home, appearing young, handsome and happy. It's one of many ghost stories told around the city of Savannah, where centuries-old cemeteries and antique houses betray a bloody history of battles, fires, epidemics and storms -- a supernatural tourist delight. Gordon Low was even born on October 31, 1860, on Halloween. But Gordon Low's childhood home, a beloved Scouting destination, doesn't seem creepy at all. Photos capture how scared you look inside a haunted house . Katherine Keena, the interim director for the Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace, is quick to mention its bright, happy feeling. The stone facade and double-staircase entry, blessedly shaded from the hot Georgia sun by oaks and hanging moss, looks like the destination for a grand ball, not a big scare. ""I always think of haunted houses being unwelcoming or scary,"" Keena said. ""That's certainly not what this house is like."" So why have columns, turrets, widow's walks, mansard roofs and gingerbread trim of Victorian-styled houses -- not to mention overgrown grounds, Spanish moss and cobwebs -- become the hallmarks of spooky, sinister places? To start, all those details signal that a house has history. ""With old houses of any style, especially those that have been in the same family for generations, more than likely, there will be legends,"" said Sarah Lea Burns, a professor emeritus from Indiana University's department of art history, who researches haunted houses. ""These historic houses, especially the beautiful ones, embody what it is we feel that we've lost."" And they're a living reminder of a time when ghost stories took on greater meaning. Early architecture in the United States drew on popular Georgian styles from England. As the country grew, neoclassical homes incorporated columns and pediments better known from ancient Greece, the bed of philosophy and political theater. Later still, American Victorian homes borrowed romantic architectural elements from Gothic churches of Rome and castles of Northern Europe. As all those styles became fashionable, the early founding fathers were dying. Residents of a young America feared they were losing their sense of morality along with them, said Bret Carroll, an American history professor at California State University Stanislaus. This national anxiety, along with a strong tradition of folklore and ghost stories, led to radical ways of thinking about the dead that rejected the limits of the scientific method. Some believed that spirits of the dead not only existed in our universe but were able to understand it better than the living. By the 1840s and '50s, stories of ghostly communiques were making headlines in newspapers around the country. Through seances, self-proclaimed ""spiritualists"" sought wisdom and advice from the dearly departed. They were, for the most part, progressive middle- to upper-class people, Carroll said, who owned fine homes that might still be standing today. Legend has it that Winchester rifle heiress Sarah Winchester was haunted by the deaths of her child and husband when she sought guidance through a spiritualist. She went on to build a sprawling Victorian home in San Jose, California, perhaps under the guidance of a medium -- or perhaps because she was an enormously wealthy widow with a home-building hobby. Either way, the home -- now a tourist attraction -- became an architectural testament to turmoil. In the years Winchester was building, there was nothing farfetched about ghost stories or the idea that houses could be haunted, said Carroll, the history professor. ""Back in those days, religious belief -- especially the physical reality of the afterlife -- was more widespread than it is today,"" Carroll said. ""There was no reason for these folks to deny or disbelieve that spirits actually existed."" Of course, Queen Anne and French Second Empire-style houses didn't start off sinister. ""At the time they were built, they were fashionable, trendy and modern,"" said Burns, the art historian. But the taste for such houses vanished in the 20th century, she said, and elements of Victorian architecture gradually gained a dark aura. Few were wired for electricity, and they hardly suited modern tastes for light, efficiency and ease in cleaning. People began to look at Victorian houses as unsanitary, gloomy and dark, Burns said. Even the architecture itself gained a mongrel reputation because of its appropriation of historical styles -- Gothic, Roman, Greek -- mixed together in what seemed like an incoherent and disorderly manner. The South was especially susceptible to that attitude as once-grand Antebellum homes stood empty after the Civil War, dilapidated to the point of ruin.  Loaded with architectural elements that had fallen out of style, Southern homes were ""burdened by a history of violence, whether it was family violence or the violence of the slave system,"" Burns said. ""There's almost this wholesale rejection of the Victorian style, which is thought to be literally unhealthy for people because of the darkness and gloom,"" she said. Pop culture helped to seal the deal on what seems spooky. Think of the home from ""Psycho,"" and the dark room filled with bric-a-brac and rotting lace where Norman Bates' mummified mother sat, or the stately manors of ""The Addams Family"" or ""The Munsters."" Even Walt Disney turned to the Southern Victorian to create the façade of Disneyland's famous Haunted Mansion. The wrap-around porches festooned with New Orleans-style wrought iron, massive columns and pediment and crowning turret recall the houses of the coastal South, Burns said. (Indeed, even that home is rumored to be the final resting place of a departed soul.) So no matter how many haunted homes break from tradition, there's always something chilling about just the right spooky style. ""I love a Victorian house,"" Burns said. ""It makes me wonder where the bodies are buried.""","Victorian homes have developed a spooky reputation .

"The National Federation of Independent Business is one of the most influential small-business advocacy groups in the country. They battle against government regulation, higher taxes and, perhaps most famously, Obamacare. And they do it all as the self-described ""voice of small business."" But it turns out that the champions of Main Street America got more money last year from a group backed by billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch than any other single source. NFIB and its affiliated groups received $2.5 million from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, a conservative advocacy group with deep ties to the Koch empire. Of the five men that sit on the group's board, four are current or former employees of Koch companies and one is a friend of Charles Koch's. Freedom Partners gave the NFIB $1.5 million last year, the biggest single contribution the federation received, according to tax records. The Koch-backed group gave three other NFIB-affiliated group another $1 million, making Freedom Partners among the top two biggest contributors to those groups, records show. The big-money donations are raising questions about whose agenda NFIB is serving, that of mom-and-pop businesses or the captains of big industry. Lisa Gilbert of the government watchdog group Public Citizen said the NFIB is ""taking the name of small business in vain."" ""The idea that Koch brothers money in some way is going to help small businesses is laughable,"" Gilbert said. ""What they're buying is the ability to help set the agenda."" And that agenda has included taking the lead on the lawsuit challenging Obamacare (NFIB v. Sebelius) that went to the U.S. Supreme Court. They also opposed increasing income tax rates on people making $250,000 or more, even though the vast majority of small businesses aren't affected by the rate hike. NFIB spokeswoman Jean Card said the organization brings in the bulk of its revenue, about $86 million, from dues its 350,000 members pay. Members, she said, set the group's agenda. Any suggestion to the contrary, is ""simply not true."" ""We do what our members tell us to do. We've been doing it since 1943,"" she said. On taxes, the organization asked its members in 2010 if the federal government should extend all the Bush-era individual tax rates, 89% said yes. In November 2010 they asked members if Congress should repeal the Affordable Care Act and 93% said yes, Card said. Freedom Partners advocates for lower taxes and supports NFIB's work on reducing government regulations, group spokesman James Davis said. Many of the group's more than 200 members started small businesses. ""Freedom Partners, many of the businesses that are represented -- and I can't prove this to you because I'm not going to give you a list of our businesses -- but they are small businesses,"" he said. ""They aren't publicly traded companies."" Robert Tappan, a spokesman for Koch Industries, said the company's roots are as a small business. ""Koch supports small businesses all over the country through our relationships with our vendors and suppliers and we support wholeheartedly the fundamental mission of NFIB --principled entrepreneurship,"" he said. This isn't the first time NFIB has taken money from big corporate interests. In 2011, NFIB took $850,000 from the nation's top insurance industry trade group as part of a campaign to repeal a key Obamacare tax. The back-channel transfer by America's Health Insurance Plans to the NFIB allowed insurers to fund a much more politically popular ally in the fight against a tax on health care premiums.","National Federation of Independent Business advocates for small business .

"Tony Scott, the British film director behind films such as ""Top Gun"" and ""Beverly Hills Cop II,"" had an anti-depressant and a sleep aid in his system when he jumped to his death this summer, the Los Angeles County coroner's department announced Monday. Scott died August 19 after jumping off the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro, California, into the Pacific Ocean, and an autopsy was conducted the next day. The county coroner's department determined the final cause of his death was ""multiple blunt force injuries,"" with drowning another ""significant"" factor. Toxicology tests, meanwhile, indicated that Scott had a therapeutic level of mirtazapine (Remeron), which is an anti-depressant, and zopiclone (Lunesta), a sleep aid . His death initially led to reports that the director suffered from inoperable brain cancer, but his family disputed he was ailing. The 68-year-old wrote two notes before his death, including a message left in his Los Angeles office for family members, a coroner official said. A second note detailing contact information was found in his Toyota Prius parked nearby, but the notes did not provide a motive for why he took the suicidal plunge, authorities said. Nor did they mention any health issues, Deputy Chief Coroner Ed Winter said. Born Anthony D.L. Scott in North Shields, England, in 1944, the director got his start as a teenager in front of the camera, starring in his older brother Ridley Scott's film ""Boy and Bicycle."" In 1995, the two joined forces to create the production company Scott Free Productions. Director Tony Scott: An appreciation . Tony Scott became a household name in 1986 as director of the megahit ""Top Gun,"" starring Tom Cruise and Kelly McGillis, which he followed up the next year with the Eddie Murphy action movie ""Beverly Hills Cop II."" He cemented his reputation for big-budget action films with 1990's ""Revenge"" starring Kevin Costner and ""Days of Thunder"" with Tom Cruise. In 1998, he directed ""Enemy of the State"" with actors Will Smith and Gene Hackman. Despite the theatrics found in many of his films, he was known around Hollywood for his low-key demeanor. ""He wasn't a showy kind of guy,"" longtime entertainment reporter Jeanne Wolf said. His unexplained death shocked stars who worked with him on a long list of successful movies over the past three decades. Denzel Washington, who starred in several Scott-directed thrillers, including 2010's ""Unstoppable,"" said it was ""unfathomable to think that he is now gone."" ""He had a tremendous passion for life and for the art of filmmaking and was able to share this passion with all of us through his cinematic brilliance,"" Washington said. While Scott's movies garnered box office success, they never received the acclaim that generated Academy Award nominations. In 2002, Tony and Ridley Scott won an Emmy for the television movie ""The Gathering Storm."" He also was nominated for the Emmy as a producer for the CBS drama ""The Good Wife.""

"The disastrous roll out of the Affordable Care Act raises a litany of questions about President Barack Obama's leadership and management ability. But it also begs for an answer to who would take the fall. As problems mount, Rep. Nick Rahall, D-West Virginia, said Thursday that ""heads should have rolled"" at the White House. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the woman in charge of implementing Obamacare, took the blame for a flawed HealthCare.gov website, even as calls mounted -- inside and outside of Washington - for her to be fired. Testifying before a hostile congressional committee, Sebelius said she should be held accountable for the online site that stumbled out of the starting gate on October 1 and won't be functioning smoothly for most people -- according to Obama, himself -- until the end of the month. ""I'm responsible,"" she told lawmakers. But Obama had her back. White House Spokesman Jay Carney said the President has ""full confidence"" in Sebelius. Eric Dezenhall, crisis management expert and CEO of Dezenhall Resources, said that an age-old White House policy is that federal agencies take the blame and the White House collects the props. But as letters started landing in people's mailboxes, notifying them that their health insurance plans were being canceled, Sebelius might have been in deeper hot water, except that Obama promised when selling Obamacare that people could keep their plans if they like them. That was not true in the end. Obama takes brunt of new storm . People were given false assurance. Sebelius shrunk out of the spotlight as Obama's unkept promise took the brunt of a new storm. It culminated in a public apology on Thursday when Obama -- also talking about the website -- acknowledged that he ""fumbled"" the launch of his signature domestic policy achievement. While Obama is taking responsibility publicly, internally he is faced with many questions, including why his staff let him make such a claim if it wasn't true. Should Sebelius have known? She was responsible for overseeing the implementation and creation of the specifics of Obamacare. Additionally, as a former insurance commissioner responsible for approving or rejecting coverage plans for Kansas consumers, it seemed like she would have had an understanding of the impact as federal coverage standards changed to become more robust. And some insurance commissioners are troubled by the President's proposal to allow a one year extension of individual health plans -- those most likely to be canceled. Sebelius' successor, Sandy Praeger, said she and her fellow insurance commissioners around the country warned the administration early on. ""We said from the get-go that if you start taking pieces out of this, it will collapse,"" Praeger told the Lawrence Journal World. Should someone be fired? ""I think there is limited utility in just firing people, but if you need to do it for political reasons, it's always an option,"" Dezenhall said. Dezenhall cautioned, however, that this is not an acute problem but a chronic one, and firing Sebelius won't make everything magically better. Even if Obama chose to fire Sebelius, he would need to replace her, and that may be the ultimate reason why she may stay on for now. Not only would it take time for a new health secretary to get up to speed, a permanent replacement requires Senate confirmation -- lately an unappealing prospect for Obama. Finding someone else would likely subject Obama to a damaging political fight with Republicans determined to draw as much attention to the problematic components of Obamacare. CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein said that a new health nominee would ensure ""virtual certainty"" for Republicans to ""use this as kind of a way to leverage more concessions from the administration."" CNN's chief political analyst, Gloria Borger, said Sebelius' head would roll at some point. ""He's very deliberate. In the end, will she go? Eventually. But there are lots of other issues she's got to deal with first,"" Borger said. But for now, this is Obama's problem. It is called Obamacare, not Sebeliuscare. ""Hiding ceases to be an option,"" Dezenhall said. ""Hiding is an option when you have a place to hide and when no one is looking. It's not an option when there's no place to hide and everyone's looking.""","More trouble for Obamacare puts more pressure on Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .

"Virginia State Sen. Creigh Deeds, who was stabbed multiple times by his son, said he will work to change how mental health services are delivered so that ""other families don't have to go through what we are living."" Deeds' son, Austin ""Gus"" Deeds, committed suicide after the fight. ""I hope we can make a positive change as a result of this tragedy,"" Deeds told The Recorder, a newspaper based in Monterey, Virginia. ""I think there may be a bigger problem here. I am alive for a reason, and I will work for change. I owe that to my precious son,"" he said. The stabbing came one day after Deeds' son was taken to a hospital under an emergency custody order. Police confirmed that Gus Deeds, 24, was brought in by the local sheriff for evaluation by mental health professionals. The young man was released after the evaluation because no open psychiatric bed could be located across a wide area of western Virginia, Dennis Cropper, executive director of the Rockbridge Area Community Services Board, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch. Cropper declined to comment on the specifics of the case but said not finding a bed was unusual for his agency. Deputies called to Deeds' home day before fatal fight . CNN later learned that at least three Virginia hospitals had psychiatric beds available the day before the stabbing and suicide. Officials at Western State, Rockingham Memorial and UVA Charlottesville hospitals said beds were available, but they had not been contacted by medical personnel who evaluated the younger Deeds. The hospitals are within an hour or two from Bath County, where the incident occurred, but it was unclear whether those who had the initial contact with Gus Deeds reached out only to hospitals closer to Bath County.

"Sumptuous velvet, delicate sequins, intricate beading: They are dresses fit for a princess -- Princess Diana, that is -- and if you've got a big pocketbook (with a designer label, naturally), they could have been yours. Ten dresses worn by the late Princess of Wales went under the hammer at Kerry Taylor Auctions in London on Tuesday. The top seller was the midnight blue number Diana famously wore to dance with John Travolta at a gala dinner at the White House in November 1985. That dress sold for $362,424 (240,000 British pounds) and was bought by ""a British gentleman as a surprise to cheer up his wife,"" the auction house said. The entire collection fetched $1.2 million (800,000 British pounds), the auctioneer said. TV footage and photographs of the princess and the Hollywood star gliding around the room to the music of ""Saturday Night Fever"" were seen around the world, and Travolta later described the experience as having been ""like a fairy tale."" Diana also wore the ""Travolta"" dress, designed by Victor Edelstein, for her final portrait by Lord Snowdon in 1997. Auctioneer Kerry Taylor told CNN before the auction that putting a price on such items was ""difficult,"" but that their high profile added value. Rare photo of teenage Diana sold for $18,369 . ""You can look at what they sold for, you can look at how simple the thing is,"" she explained. ""If it was worn on a state occasion, or if it was for a private dinner, are there photographs of the princess wearing it, are there film reels of the princess wearing it, and is there a human story that adds to it?"" For example, as Taylor pointed out, a bottle green velvet evening dress, also by Victor Edelstein, bears what could be the traces of a young prince: ""what looks like a little boy's (or little child's) handprint -- sticky fingerprints on the fabric."" The dress sold for $36,281, including the buyer's premium. Also included in the sale were dresses by some of Diana's other favorite designers. Six werer by Catherine Walker, including the beaded black dress Diana wore for Vanity Fair's 1997 photoshoot by Mario Testino -- that sold for $163,264 -- and the black Bruce Oldfield gown she wore to the gala opening of ""Les Miserables"" in October 1985 and for another official portrait by Snowdon. That dress sold for $76,190. The outfits were originally sold in a charity auction at Christie's in New York in June 1997, just months before Diana's death in a Paris car crash in August of that year. Kerry says that despite the passing of the years, the princess remains hugely popular. ""Diana was different,"" she said. ""She was very much a 'people's princess' and the ups and downs of her life, her loves, people followed them avidly. I think there will always be a special place in people's hearts for Diana."" Taylor also auctioned off the skimpy mesh dress worn by the Duchess of Cambridge -- then known as Kate Middleton -- during a fashion show at the University of St. Andrews, at which she is reputed to have attracted the attentions of her future husband, Prince William.","Dress worn by Diana to dance with John Travolta sells for $362,424 .

"A ""big f***ing deal"" has become an equally big fight, with Republicans relentlessly attacking President Barack Obama's signature health care reforms over the new reality they are bringing to the health insurance market. One reason is the GOP's ideological opposition to big government, as manifested by the health care overhaul intended to hold down rising costs that threaten U.S. fiscal stability. Another is the long-term political benefit to Obama and Democrats from the sweeping changes intended to give people previously unable to afford health insurance or deemed ineligible the chance to obtain coverage. Coupled with Obama's stated second-term priority -- proposed immigration reform that would remove the ""illegal"" label for millions of undocumented aliens -- the legislative power play could provide an electoral boost for Democrats certain to last a generation or longer. The combination of Obamacare -- as the 2010 Affordable Care Act is known -- and immigration reform ""would be a huge boon to the Democratic Party,"" said Darrell West, the Brookings Institution's vice president and director of governance studies. ""It would provide insurance to millions who don't currently have it, and it brings aboard undocumented people who are very likely to be Democratic supporters,"" he told CNN. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, said such an outcome is the goal of all presidents and their congressional allies who seek to ""enact policies that will hold their base and attract new voters in successive election cycles."" Republicans know that, which explains their fierce opposition to Obamacare dating back to well before Vice President Joe Biden's off-color description whispered too loudly to Obama as the President prepared to sign the law in 2010. Now a confluence of factors -- including the overall impact of the reforms as well as major problems in their implementation and continued GOP efforts to derail them -- have further hardened already entrenched partisan positions on the issue. What's up with Obamacare and my health care? Effects of Obamacare . It has taken more than three years since the Affordable Care Act became law to begin to understand its effects. The concept leans heavily on a conservative Republican idea adopted for the Massachusetts state health care program that creates large markets to hold down prices. To work, the program must include less-expensive young people to offset the higher costs of older people, who generally need more health care. Such a system would provoke competition between insurers for lucrative markets, meaning lower premiums and a minimum standard of benefits to provide security against financial ruin over a major illness or bad accident. However, an analysis by CNN found that consumer options vary significantly from state to state, and many Americans are discovering they have few options. For example, West Virginia and New Hampshire have one insurance company offering coverage, meaning no choice between providers, while eight other states -- Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming -- have two. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 12 million people live in counties with only one insurer, compared with 117 million in counties with more than five insurers. The foundation's Cynthia Cox found that in counties with more than five insurers, the average premium was about $20 a month less than in areas with only one insurer. In addition, CNN's Tom Foreman reported Thursday that in some cases, the same company will charge more for a policy in a rural area, compared with a big city. The differences generally reflect the smaller pool of consumers in less populous rural areas, compared with more densely populated urban and suburban areas. Such disparities also tend to follow a political fault line in many places, with Democrats more prevalent in big cities and suburbs, while Republicans generally get more support in rural areas. While definitive correlations would be overly simplistic and premature, increased options in urban areas versus rural areas indicate that on a broad level, more Democrats than Republicans are realizing benefits from Obamacare so far in terms of choice and cost. To Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who helped design  the Massachusetts and federal health care laws, it is too early to understand the full effects of Obamacare. ""It's not like Obamacare's chasing insurers out"" of rural areas, Gruber told CNN on Thursday. ""These are just markets that didn't have many insurers to choose from before, and there hasn't been a lot of entry in the recent times since the law has passed."" In Massachusetts, he said, a major new provider entered the market two years after the reforms took effect. ""You don't need 16 choices. You don't need 12 choices,"" Gruber said. ""It's nice to have that many, but having one or two new entrants, which will happen over time -- it did in Massachusetts -- can really shake up the market in lower prices."" GOP on insurance cancellations: 'We told you so' Botched website rollout . Conservative critics long warned that Obamacare amounted to a government takeover of health care that would be too big to manage effectively and deny people the ability to choose their own doctor or coverage. So far, some of the predictions have proved true. While initial stages of implementation proved relatively uneventful, the biggest single step -- the October 1 launch of exchanges to give people the chance to buy required health coverage -- was badly botched when the government website proved dysfunctional. The administration scrambled to try to get it working, announcing a ""tech surge"" with outside experts deployed to bolster the joint government-private sector team that created HealthCare.gov. In addition, insurers recently began informing some of the relatively small percentage of people who buy their own health coverage, instead of getting it through their employer or government-run Medicare and Medicaid, that their policies were being discontinued or changed because they failed to comply with Obamacare requirements. The shift undermined Obama's mantra-like pledge in selling the reforms that no one would be forced to change policies or doctors they liked. Obama ""has broken many promises about Obamacare,"" Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a prepared statement Friday that solicited stories from people about how they were hurt by Obamacare. On Monday, the RNC announced it was launching a campaign of robocalls and targeted Facebook posts to encourage people to ask why their elected representatives supported what it called ""Obama's lie that people could keep their healthcare plans under ObamaCare."" At the White House on Friday, spokesman Jay Carney emphasized that the individual policies being discontinued or changed represented a fraction of the overall U.S. population. He reiterated the administration line that consumers would get a better deal under Obamacare -- more benefits at what likely will be a lower price than they pay now if they qualify for federal subsidies available under the reforms. For many, Obama's promise of health care choice does not ring true . Early figures . The latest battle line between the parties is about early enrollment figures. Republicans are pushing the administration to release numbers for how many signed up in the first month of the new exchanges, but Carney and others say complete and reliable information will only be available by mid-November. Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the GOP chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has threatened to subpoena information on enrollment figures as soon as this week. Carney and other officials have said they expect the initial figures to be low, because of the website problems and a cautious approach by consumers in the early days of such programs. He and others note that the Massachusetts health care plan had most people sign up in the final days before the enrollment deadline, and they expect the same thing to happen with the federal program. That deadline is March 31. Gruber of MIT called the focus on the early figures premature. ""According to the Congressional Budget Office, it will be about a three-year ramp-up period until Obamacare is fully effective at its full level of functioning,"" he said. '""That's what we saw in Massachusetts as well. So we need to just calm down and stop worrying about days and weeks and focus instead on months and years."" However, Gruber warned that the HealthCare.gov website must be fully operational by the end of November to ensure that people being forced to change policies have time to enroll by January 1, when their current coverage ends. The Republican goal in demanding the figures is to depict Obamacare as an immediate failure in order to try to generate public momentum for delaying or dismantling the law. Some Democrats facing tough re-election battles next year also have proposed a delay to allow people more time to sign up and avoid the fine, but the Obama administration opposes such a step because it would undermine the immediate creation of large new markets needed to keep costs down. 5 things we learned from Sebelius Obamacare hearing . The immigration connection . Even if Obamacare works as planned, Gruber told CNN, about 40% of people currently uninsured would remain without coverage. As many as a half of that group -- 10 million or so -- would be undocumented immigrants living illegally in the country, he said. ""Today, these undocumented immigrants end up in the emergency room. Next year, they'll end up in the emergency room again,"" he said. ""That may be something we want to take on eventually as a society, but we don't seem prepared to do so now."" To West of the Brookings Institute, the Obamacare and immigration issues ""do intersect in interesting ways."" He noted the Affordable Care Act specifically excludes undocumented immigrants from getting health insurance under the reforms. A Senate-passed immigration reform proposal would give temporary legal status to the undocumented, but make them wait 10 years before they could seek citizenship. It is unclear if the plan will get a vote in the Republican-led House. The decade of waiting to seek citizenship should ease the fears of Republicans over an immediate impact on elections, as only U.S. citizens can vote, West said. However,  any undocumented immigrants who eventually become citizens would probably be Democrats, because ""they've seen Democrats have been the people pushing for immigration reform while Republicans have been resistant,"" he added. Schiller, the Brown University political science professor, said the issue of Obamacare eligibility could be a sticking point in the immigration reform debate, adding: ""Republicans will absolutely insist that (undocumented immigrants) are not eligible for Obamacare during that 10-year-period"" before they can seek citizenship.","Obamacare and immigration reform could boost Democrats for a generation or more .
Parties in power always try to use policy to secure future voter support .
Ideology aside, Republicans know health care, immigration reforms help Democrats .
GOP attacks focus on the health care law, not just website woes ."

"A grand jury investigating the 2012 rape of a 16-year-old girl in Steubenville, Ohio, and educators' responses to a separate rape allegation in the city that year has led to the indictment of four school employees, including the school superintendent, who faces felony charges, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced Monday. Steubenville City Schools Superintendent Michael McVey faces three felony counts: one charge of tampering with evidence and two counts of obstructing justice. He also is charged with making a false statement and obstructing official business, both misdemeanors, DeWine said. Also indicted were an elementary school principal, Lynnett Gorman, and wrestling coach Seth Fluharty, both of whom are charged with misdemeanor failure to report child abuse. Volunteer assistant Steubenville football coach Matt Belardine was charged with four misdemeanors: allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business, making a false statement and contributing to the unruliness or delinquency of a child. This brings to six the number of people the grand jury has indicted after two students were convicted of rape, DeWine said. A school technology director and his daughter were indicted in October. Most of the charges relate to the August 2012 rape of a girl at a party in the small eastern Ohio community -- a case that got national attention after photos and videos of the incident made their way onto social media. In March, Steubenville High School football players Ma'lik Richmond and Trenton Mays were convicted of the rape. Richmond was sentenced to a minimum of one year in a juvenile correctional facility. Mays got two years. But some of the charges announced Monday relate not to the August 2012 rape, but to a separate alleged rape in April 2012 in the Steubenville area, DeWine said. Gorman was charged with not reporting the alleged April 2012 incident, said her attorney, Steven Lemetris. That case ""was not prosecuted because there was no crime. If there was a crime there would be a victim,"" Lemetris said. Lemetris said Monday night the principal has been an educator for 30 years with a spotless record. He said Gorman is not guilty, but she now risks losing her teaching administrative credentials. ""She is a good person"" Lemetris said. DeWine's office confirmed that it investigated the April 2012 case and declined to prosecute. New arrest, jail without bond . All of McVey's charges cover a time period from April 2012 -- the time of the first alleged rape -- through this month, when the grand jury finished its investigation of the two cases. ""When I announced that we were going to have this grand jury investigation to answer all the questions and to see if adults had not done what they should have done, I did say in answer to a question that we would look at this previously reported (April 2012) incident,"" DeWine told CNN Tuesday morning. ""I stated right at the beginning ... (that) frankly the grand jury would go wherever the facts took it."" After Richmond and Mays were convicted tin the August 2012 rape, the grand jury began investigating whether others should be charged. In October, it indicted William Rhinaman, 53, the director of technology for Steubenville City Schools, on charges of tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice, obstructing official business and perjury. His daughter, Hannah Rhinaman, 20, of Mingo Junction, Ohio, was also indicted that month on two counts of receiving stolen property and one count of grand theft, according to a news release from DeWine's office. The charges against Hannah Rhinaman are separate and unrelated to the indictment against her father, the October news release said. If convicted, William Rhinaman could be sentenced to four years in prison, which is longer than the two teens convicted of rape will serve.

"California is the latest state to allow testing of Google's self-driving cars on the roads, though only with a human passenger along as a safety measure. Gov. Edmund ""Jerry"" Brown signed the autonomous-vehicles bill into law Tuesday afternoon alongside Google co-founder Sergey Brin and State Sen. Alex Padilla, who authored the bill, at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. The bill, SB 1298, will set up procedures and requirements for determining when the cars are road-ready. Brin hopes that self-driving cars will be able to drive on public streets in five years or less. You won't need a driver's license by 2040 . ""Anybody who first gets in the car and finds the car is driving will be a little skittish. But they'll get over it,"" said Brown when asked if the California Highway Patrol was on board with the plan. The cars use a combination of technologies, including radar sensors on the front, video cameras aimed at the surrounding area, various other sensors and artificial-intelligence software that helps steer. Google is the most visible company working on these types of vehicles, but similar projects are under way at other organizations, including Caltech. Google has already been testing the cars on the road in Nevada, which passed a law last year authorizing driverless vehicles. Both Nevada and California require the cars to have a human behind the wheel who can take control of the vehicle at any time. So far, the cars have have racked up more than 300,000 driving miles, and 50,000 of those miles were without any intervention from the human drivers, Google says. Overheard on CNN.com: Autonomous cars reduce 'crashes'? There have been no accidents while the cars were controlled by the computer. The only documented accident with one of the Google vehicles was a fender bender that took place while a human was in control. Brin, who sported a pair of Google glasses at the media event without comment, said the cars could address a variety of current transportation issues. First and foremost, he said, the self-driving cars would be safer than human-driven cars. There were just under 33,000 deaths from motor vehicle accidents in the United States in 2010. They also could ferry around people who are usually unable to to drive, such as blind people. ""Some people have other disabilities, some people are too young, some people are too old, sometimes we're too intoxicated,"" said Brin. Ideally, a car that drives itself can minimize traffic by chaining together with other self-driving vehicles and using highways more efficiently. Drivers wouldn't be limited to listening to NPR and honking during their morning commute; instead they could use that time to be productive, like the millions of people who take public transit currently do. Atlanta turns to variable speed limits to ease traffic . Brin also discussed the many parking lots in urban and suburban areas, calling them ""a scar to the surface of the Earth."" Self-driving cars would be able to drop you off at work and then pick up another person instead of idling in a parking lot. If you did opt to own your own car, it could park itself in the most efficient way possible. Consumer Watchdog, a consumer-rights group, has expressed reservations about the cars on privacy grounds, saying they would allow Google to gather personal information about passengers. Google's fleet of vehicles started with Toyota Prius Hybrids and later added the Lexus RX450h, a crossover SUV, to test on different terrain. The project is directed by Sebastian Thrun, who also co-founded Google Street View. There are many legal and technical problems still to be worked out before the cars are commonplace. Asked who would get the ticket when a driverless car runs a red light, Brin replied, ""Self-driving cars do not run red lights."" You can drive 85 - in Texas .","Gov.

"Zintan, Libya (CNN) -- Over the past two days, Moammar Gadhafi's forces have unleashed their biggest attack yet against one of the mountainous rebel strongholds in western Libya, according to one of his former generals. Haji Usama, as he is known to the rebels, was once a top commander in Gadhafi's forces. He spent decades in the Libyan army including a tour of duty in neighboring Chad, and now commands in Zintan, population 40,000. Today, he hates that his former commander in chief regards him as a terrorist. Haji Usama says that early Thursday morning about 150 of Gadhafi's infantry troops -- supported by about 40 vehicles, including long range ""Grad"" rocket launchers and heavy, long-range machine guns -- began an attack on three fronts near Zintan. Zintan sits about 90 miles southwest from the capital of Tripoli, and is at the eastern tip of a 170-mile long ribbon of rebel held mountains stretching westwards from the Tunisian border. The trim, gray-bearded rebel commander says he's never seen such an attack here before. Gadhafi ""has never used infantry like this"" -- normally he shells from a distance, he says. He says he took immediate action, dispatching what he called a brigade of men to cut off Gadhafi's advance. A brigade he said consisted of ""hundreds of fighters,"" but he declined to give exact numbers. So far, the fighting has cost him dearly: one rebel killed and three injured, including one in critical condition. Deep, fresh trenches in the stark red sand here are testimony to the battle rebels say they are ready to fight should Gadhafi's forces manage to break through. So far they have not and confidence among the rebels, if not high, is certainly up. Some of the fighters seen returning from the front lines crammed in the back of open top pickup trucks late Friday appeared remarkably young -- a few appeared to be school age. Among them, only a handful of weapons, a few hunting rifles and old bolt-action shot guns. Haji Usama admits many of his fighters are young, but he says ""they are keen and determined to fight for their freedom."" He believe that Thursday's attack was to regain control of the nearby town Rayayan. He says the east of Rayayan ""declared their support for the rebels a month ago."" The rest of the town is loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security, Nasar al Mabout, whom Haji Usama claims lives there. Gadhafi's forces simultaneously attacked on three fronts, to the north of Zintan firing Grad rockets at the east of Rayayna, and attacking to the southeast and to the east of Zintan, Haji Usama. In previous battles, Haji Usama says, Gadhafi's artillery forces have taken over homes in Zuwail al Bagul and simply shelled from a distance. The latest attack is different. Since the raids began at dawn on Thursday, Haji Usama says he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayan with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling. As dusk fell Friday the shelling that could be clearly heard and seen from the roof tops of Zintan earlier abated before picking up with sporadic barrages of fire shortly before 10 p.m. The rebels say the night-time shelling is simply to terrorize Zintan's residents into fleeing. ""Some have,"" he says, but most are staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over.","Haji Usama was once a top commander in Gadhafi's forces .

"(CNN)The United States has launched a fresh drone strike on Yemen and closed its embassy to the public, days after the U.S.-backed government crumbled under an uprising from Shiite Houthi rebels. The drone strike -- the latest in a long string of them by the Obama administration -- is the first since last week's dramatic events in the capital, Sanaa. Three U.S. officials tell CNN the CIA conducted a drone strike in Marib, which is east of Sanaa. It is not thought that any major leaders of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula were targeted in the latest U.S. strike. The CIA itself did not comment. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, announced what was happening with the embassy.

"(CNN)""Birdman"" won the big prize -- outstanding motion picture cast -- at the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, but it was talk about heritage and diversity that captured the evening. On the TV side, the winners included ""Orange Is the New Black"" -- a series about a women's prison, created by a woman, featuring a cast that includes a transgender performer -- and black actresses Viola Davis and Uzo Aduba. And the movie winners included Patricia Arquette, who won for a performance in ""Boyhood"" that she filmed over 12 years -- and wasn't afraid to show it. Arquette comes from a long line of performers. Her siblings, including Rosanna Arquette and David Arquette, are actors. So was her father and grandfather. She paid tribute to all of them in her speech. ""I'm a fourth-generation actor,"" she said, visibly overwrought, adding that her family has been performing for more than a century. But it was the wins by Davis, Aduba and ""Orange"" that caught the attention of social media, which erupted 10 days ago when the Oscar nominations put forth a very un-diverse crowd. Complete list of winners . Davis' speech, in particular, was particularly moving. After beginning with an observation about how she tells her daughter stories, she paid tribute to the producers who thought of her for their ""How to Get Away with Murder"" story. ""I'd like to thank Paul Lee, Shonda Rhimes, Betsy Beers and Pete Nowalk for thinking that a sexualized, messy, mysterious woman could be a 49-year-old dark-skinned African-American woman who looks like me,"" she said. Several tweeters highlighted her words and their significance. In general, however, the SAG Awards were a relatively quiet and brisk affair. (Yes, it can happen, even for Hollywood awards shows.) The film awards generally went as expected, with Arquette, J.K. Simmons (""Whiplash""), Julianne Moore (""Still Alice""), Eddie Redmayne (""The Theory of Everything"") and ""Birdman"" taking home the trophies. Only Redmayne was a mild surprise, given that ""Birdman's"" Michael Keaton has been considered the leader in the best actor race by a number of handicappers. The actors' branch is the largest bloc of Oscar voters, so the SAG Awards are closely watched for indicators about which way the Academy Award wind is blowing. Still, the SAG Awards had their moments. There were Davis' and Aduba's emotional speeches, of course. And there were also a few laughs. Frances McDormand got some chuckles for turning her speech into a cheeky bit of promotion for her film, ""Olive Kitteredge"" (""You can stream it -- I don't know how. You can watch it on an intercontinental flight, I've been told. You can get the DVDs on February 9, give it to someone as a Valentine's Day present!"" she said) and the witty Carrie Fisher got off a couple jokes while introducing her mother, Debbie Reynolds, who won a lifetime achievement award. ""Birdman"" took home only one prize in the end, but it was the biggest one of the night. It also won at the Producers' Guild Awards Saturday. How that will fly at the Oscars, however, is anyone's guess. How the winners reacted backstage .","Viola Davis' speech, ""Orange"" showcase TV diversity at SAG Awards .

"Los Angeles (CNN)The cheering, clapping fans are greeting them with choruses of oohs and ahhs, hero worship for the rock stars of the sea: whales. Whale-watching boats out of Southern California are reporting almost every excursion returns to harbor with giddy patrons carrying images of large marine mammals in their cameras and minds. ""This season has just been magical, there's just no other way to describe it,"" said Dan Salas, a captain for Harbor Breeze Cruises.  ""And this is just the beginning of gray whale season. It's going to go all the way until May."" The gray whales are making their annual migration south from the Arctic Ocean where they feed, down to Mexico, where they breed during winter and late spring. ""We know that the ocean is changing, the Earth is warming, the ice melting, and this might be giving the gray whales more (easier) access to food,"" said Kera Mathes, marine biologist with the Aquarium of the Pacific. ""With more access to food, the gray whales might be able to leave the Arctic waters earlier."" During a recent Salas trip, the captain closely followed two gray whales making a parallel journey south near Long Beach. The whales flipped their flukes out of the water and took dives, while dozens of eyes and cameras followed each move. Salas left that pair of migrating gray whales to search for a second set of gray whales, a rarity, a mother and her brand new calf. ""There's mama and there's baby,"" the captain shouted over the boat's loudspeaker.  ""The baby was born today. Happy birthday."" The mother and baby cetaceans dipped underwater and reappeared, often with a spritz from their blowholes. On this trip, the gray whales did not breech out of the water completely, looking like some sort of slick television commercial. Those picture postcard breeches are uncommon, according to biologists and whale tour boat captains, but any sight of any part of a whale caused celebration. ""CNN had that pretty interesting documentary, ""Blackfish,"" and it brought a lot of attention to our customers, to where they mentioned how excited they were to see the whales in the wild, their natural environment,"" said Salas. ""Since that documentary our business has increased and we will hear the kids cheering, 'They are free.'"" Orcas, killer whales in captivity, were the subject of ""Blackfish."" Free-swimming orcas have been spotted this season in Southern California along with some Humpback whales and the usual preponderance of a variety of dolphins playfully jumping in clusters. Wide-eyed and smiling children chattered with each sighting. ""I've been seeing Mother Nature and the birth of a new whale,"" said 11-year-old Connor Parrish from Missouri.  ""And the awesome dolphins, which are my favorite ocean animal, so it's been good.""","""This season has just been magical, there's just no other way to describe it,"" says boat captain .

"Eighteen errors lines up to cause last summer's catastrophic derailment of a runaway train in the Quebec town of Lac-Mégantic, Canadian accident investigators said Tuesday, concluding an investigation that has revealed serious safety lapses in the transport of crude oil through Canada and the United States. Among the factors: a ""weak safety culture"" in the railroad that transported the oil; a government agency that required safety plans from industry but did little to check them; and a train that consisted almost entirely of substandard tanker cars. Those tanker cars -- known as DOT 111s -- still carry the bulk of the oil from the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota to ports on the east coast of the United States and Canada, although both countries -- spurred by the Lac-Mégantic tragedy -- are taking steps to phase them out. The Lac-Mégantic derailment was among the most disastrous in modern North America. Forty-seven people died, some 40 buildings were destroyed and 53 vehicles were demolished when the 63 tank cars and two boxcars derailed and erupted in flames. About 2,000 residents of the community were evacuated. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) listed 18 factors contributing to the disaster, but declined to say whether any were more serious than the others. The accident may have been avoided if any one of the 18 factors were not present, the TSB's Jean Laporte told reporters. ""Accidents never come down to a single individual, a single action or a single factor. You have to look at the whole context,"" said TSB Chair Wendy Tadros. Crude oil shipments by rail have increased dramatically in the past decade as oil companies have perfected technologies to extract oil from shale. The increase took a number of people by surprise, including government regulators, Tadros said. Police: Evidence criminal act may have led to crash . In Canada, rail shipments of oil have increased from a mere 500 carloads in 2009 to 160,000 in 2013. In the U.S., shipments have increased from 10,800 carloads to 400,000 in the same period. Tadros and Laporte said Transport Canada has taken measures of phase out the use of DOT-111 tankers -- one of three recommendations made in January in an unprecedented joint recommendation by the safety boards of both countries. But they sidestepped questions about whether newer, stronger tankers would have remained intact in the Lac-Mégantic derailment. TSB investigator Don Ross said there are ""not enough data points"" to determine whether newer tankers would have survived the incident. The incident occurred July 6, 2013, when an engineer for the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railway (MMA) parked the train for the night on a descending grade. Runaway train devastates Canadian town: The route, the damage, the aftermath . Investigators said the engineer set seven of the train's hand brakes, far fewer than the 17 to 26 needed to prevent the train from rolling. The additional holding power of the train's air brakes kept the train secure at first. But when a fire broke out in the lead locomotive because of a mechanical problem, the locomotive was shut down, an no additional air was provided to the air brakes. A slow air leak led to the failure of the air brakes, and the unattended train rolled down the incline, reaching a top speed of 65 miles per hour before derailing seven miles away at a curve in Lac-Mégantic. Many of the cars were split open, releasing large amounts of  crude oil, which ignited, causing large fireballs and a pool fire. The TSB said the railroad cut corners on engine maintenance and training, and that crude oil trains ""ran largely unchecked"" by Transport Canada, the Canadian equivalent of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Opinion: Stop shipping volatile oil by rail . MMA filed for bankruptcy after the disaster. The railroad's Canadian assets have been sold. Investigators also discovered that the oil was improperly described in shipping documents. It was labeled as a ""Packing Group II"" product, but was shipped as a less volatile Group III product. Following the Lac-Mégantic disaster, the U.S. Federal Railroad Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a safety advisory and announced an operation to conduct unannounced inspections and testing of the crude oil that is being shipped by rail. Tadros, the TSB chair, said governments and the rail industry have made improvements, but more needs to be done. Canada ""still allows trains to be left unattended on a descending grade,"" she said. The government needs to do more than rubber-stamp companies' Safety Management Systems, which are intended to detect and address safety issues. ""It's not enough for a Safety Management Systems on paper; that SMS has to work, to do what it was designed to do,"" she said. Loss, now anger, fuel a town forever changed .","The Lac-Mégantic rail disaster of July 2013 killed 47 people, .

"When President Barack Obama took to the podium for Thursday's news conference/cum-mea culpa on the disastrous Obamacare roll out, the commander-in-chief said repairing his damaged credibility was on him and no one else. John King: For Obama, a bad turn or a tipping point? The bloodletting was a near-acknowledgment that his presidency is at a tenuous point. The Obama administration's mismanagement of his signature legislative achievement threatens to sink the rest of his second-term agenda. With more than three years left in office, Obama teeters on the brink of lame-duckedness. But the problem of a tortured second term is not unique to the 44th President. Many before Obama triumphantly won reelection only to be sunk by a scandal, a debacle or a mistake. Obamacare: Now what? 3 hurdles Obamacare fix must overcome . For George W. Bush, public weariness over wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the debacle over the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, made his second term seem longer than four years. Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment by the House marked his second term. Those aren't the only instances. Ronald Reagan had the Iran-Contra scandal; Harry Truman's final years in office were dominated by the war in Korea and Richard Nixon resigned over Watergate. Related: Most former presidents look better through history's eyes . Such woes have become so commonplace that they are summed up with this moniker: the second-term curse. Gone is the energized A-team . When a President first takes office, political and other pros are lining up for jobs. The President can pick from the best and the brightest to make the wheels turn. ""When you come into the White House, that is the moment of great promise,"" said Russell Riley, presidential scholar and associate professor at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. But ultimately the demands of working for a President take their toll and attrition sets in. ""People get worn out,"" and leave, Riley said. ""Over time, there tends to be some deterioration in the quality of the team that you are able to put together."" Borger: How could Obama not have known? Obama: HealthCare.gov needs more than technical fixes . Riley points to the Reagan administration as an example. When Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, he brought with him three confidants who became ""The Troika."" James Baker, Ed Meese and Michael Deaver effectively ran the White House staff and it paid off with reelection and a historic 525 electoral votes in 1984. But then the team began to fray. Baker became Treasury Secretary and Meese, Attorney General, while Deaver left the White House for lobbying. Under new leadership, Act II of the Reagan White House did not hit on all cylinders. The Iran-Contra affair, in which the Reagan administration was fingered for selling arms to Iran and circumventing a congressional ban by using the proceeds to send arms and money to anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua, became a huge scandal. ""It was disaster at the White House,"" Riley said. ""That is not a mistake you make typically in a first term. It is case where you are trying to juggle the staffing apparatus later on."" Digging for dirt and sensing a lame duck . To David Nichols, a presidential historian and expert on President Dwight Eisenhower, the reason for second-term woes is a combination of leverage and time. ""Their leverage on lawmakers in the Congress and with the voters is just inevitably diminished,"" Nichols said, pointing out that once Congress begins to smell presidential weakness, they seize on it as a way to speed up the ""lame duck"" process. ""The longer Presidents are around and when people get to know you well, they begin to know where your soft spots are and they know what you are good and what you aren't good at,"" Nichols said. ""People eventually begin to figure out how to get to the Presidents. That is just a function of the number of years."" To Nichols, this could already be happening with Obama. Cruz talks about 'vindication' Obamacare enrollment numbers give GOP second wind . Republicans in Congress have been attacking Obama since his 2009 inaugural. And while Obama has won some legislative victories, those have been hard fought. The health care law he championed and got with only Democratic support in Congress is off to a rocky start with the public, and Republicans are sensing weakness. Poll: Approval of Obamacare drops . And with that, Nichols said, comes Republican dreams of a larger majority in the House, control of the Senate and a pathway to the presidency in 2016. ""For the opposition party, the more bad stuff they can dig up, the better they make it for themselves in the next election,"" Nichols said. ""So tearing down the incumbent is a good way to prepare the way for a change and the American public tends to keep people for a while but quickly push them out."" Clinton's experience is a good example. While accusations of infidelity plagued Clinton since his time as governor of Arkansas, it wasn't until years into his presidency that an accusation of impropriety was able to stick and severely damage him politically. The chickens come home to roost . When Obama ran for office in 2008, he made a number of promises: immigration reform, healthcare, ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dealing with climate change. During his first term, he addressed some of those -- ending the war in Iraq and slowly drawing down the conflict in Afghanistan. His administration also won on Obamacare. 6 things presidents wish they hadn't said . But the implications of those promises were not felt right away, Riley said. Romney on Obamacare promise: 'It was not honest' ""You make policy decisions in the first term and because it usually takes a while for these things to mature and to ripen and to get enacted, you can easily be in your fifth year before the full consequences of your first term become apparent,"" Riley said. ""When you get to the second term, the days of reckoning appear."" Riley's point is that when Obama promised to reform the health care system, he and his advisers had to know there was going to be pain involved with executing the law. But as with most administrations, Riley said, the White House also knew those problems weren't going to come about for years. ""Presidents will always make decisions either to defer judgment on something or will make hard decisions, recognizing the consequences won't come down on them until after reelection,"" Riley said. ""I think it is just a general pattern."" The history of two terms . Although two terms is now the law, it was once just a tradition started by George Washington. After serving two terms, Washington declined to run again. ""While choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it,"" Washington said, acknowledging he could have run again had he wanted to. He didn't and the tradition was formed and stood until Franklin Roosevelt ran and won four times, dying soon into his final term as World War II was drawing to a close. After FDR, the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution set a two-term limit.

"(Kaiser Health News)The Obama administration Monday announced a goal of accelerating changes to Medicare so that within four years, half the program's traditional spending will go to doctors, hospitals and other providers that coordinate their patient care, stressing quality and frugality. The announcement by Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell is intended to spur efforts to supplant Medicare's traditional fee-for-service medicine, in which doctors, hospitals and other medical providers are paid for each case or service without regard to how the patient fares. Medicare is the federal insurance program that provides health care to the elderly. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, the administration has been designing new programs and underwriting experiments to come up with alternate payment models. Last year, 20% of traditional Medicare spending, about $72 billion, went to models such as accountable care organizations, or ACOs, where doctors and others band together to care for patients with the promise of getting a piece of any savings they bring to Medicare, administration officials said. There are now 424 ACOs, and 105 hospitals and other health care groups that accept bundled payments, where Medicare gives them a fixed sum for each patient, which is supposed to cover not only the initial treatment for a specific ailment but also all the follow-up care. We need to rethink dying . Other Medicare-funded pilot projects give doctors extra money to coordinate patient care among specialists and seek to get Medicare to work more in harmony with Medicaid, the state-federal health insurer for low-income people. Burwell's targets are for 30%, or about $113 billion, of Medicare's traditional spending to go to these kind of endeavors by the end of President Barack Obama's term in 2016, and 50%, about $215 billion, to be spent by the end of 2018. The administration also wants Medicare spending with any quality component, such as bonuses and penalties on top of traditional fee-for-service payments, to increase, so that by the end of 2018, 90% of Medicare spending has some sort of link to quality. These figures do not include the money that now goes to private insurers in the Medicare Advantage program, which enrolls about a third of all Medicare beneficiaries. Monday's announcement did not include any new policies or funding to encourage providers, but Burwell said setting a concrete goal alone would prompt changes not only in Medicare but also in private insurance, where some of these alternative models are also being tried. Leavitt Partners, a consulting firm, counts 317 commercial ACOs and 40 in the Medicaid program. Baby Boomer Generation Fast Facts . ""For the first time we're actually going to set clear goals and establish a clear timeline for moving from volume to value in the Medicare system,"" Burwell said at an announcement at the department's headquarters, where she was joined by leading physicians and leaders from the insurance and hospital industries. ""So today what we want to do is measure our progress and we want to hold ourselves in the federal government accountable."" Some providers have eagerly embraced the new payment models, with success. Roughly a quarter of ACOs saved Medicare enough money to win bonuses last year. Others are wary, particularly since they could lose money if they fall short on either saving Medicare money or achieving the dozens of quality benchmarks the government has established. ""ACOs are quite expensive to set up,"" said Andrea Ducas, a program officer at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a New Jersey charity that is funding research into ACO performance. ""There's a significant upfront investment and if you're not sure you're going to make it back, there's a pause."" In the largest ACO experiment, the Medicare Shared Savings Program, 53 ACOs saved enough money in 2013 to get bonuses from the government, but 41 spent more than the government estimated they should have. Transgender woman feels 'complete' thanks to Obamacare . Those ACOs did not have to repay any money, but in future years Medicare intends to require reimbursements from those who fall short. Providers have been pushing Medicare to increase the cut they get from these programs and lessen the financial risks in ACOs and the other programs. ""Government needs to do more to make sure there's more shared savings going back to the providers,"" said Blair Childs, an executive with Premier, a company that assists hospitals and providers in establishing ACOs and other models. It is still too early to know whether these alternate payment models improve health of patients and whether the savings that have been achieved so far, often by focusing on the most expensive patients, will plateau. Studies on the success of these programs have shown mixed results. ""We still have very little evidence about which payment methods are going to be successful in getting the results we want, which are better quality care and more affordable care,"" said Suzanne Delbanco, executive director of Catalyst For Payment Reform, a California-based nonprofit that has been tracking the spread of alternative payment models in the private sector. ""We're just wanting to avoid a situation where a few years from now, where we've completely gotten rid of fee-for-service,"" Delbanco said. ""We don't want to wake up and say, 'Oh my gosh, we did it and we're no better off.'""","Obama administration plan to redirect spending to health care provides that stress quality, frugality .

"A petty crime sealed a final decision to retire to the Greek island of Crete -- but it could be legitimate government action to rescue Greece from economic melt-down that eventually forces Bob and Anna Scott back to the UK. Lured by the Mediterranean diet and climate, the couple moved to the village of Kokkino Horio in western Crete from Gloucester in 1997. The burglary at their UK home was enough to seek a permanent move to a country known for its friendly welcome. ""There was no crime here in those days... and it's still the case,"" said Bob who recounted the story of leaving a camera in a taverna and returning the next day to find it still hanging on the back of the chair where it was left. Initially they rented but seven years ago they bought a plot of land, built their own home, learned Greek and settled. The couple still love the people and the country they have adopted but Bob paints a picture of a nation in a mess -- one where strikes are commonplace, officialdom is mistrusted and illegal payments and tax evasion are part of everyday life. However, the medicine needed to fix it could force out those who have retired to a country which is imposing higher taxation to rid itself of a chronic debt problem. According to Eurostat, Greece owed more than 140% of its annual GDP in 2010, and the country is currently reliant on a huge bailout. The European Commission says Greece's projected debt for 2011 stands at nearly €353 billion ($487 billion). Bob and Anna say they are facing an extra property tax of €500 ($690) next year and for the moment they say they can manage, but accountants are already sending letters to their clients warning that there may be more taxes on the way. Another British couple, Roy and Kate Cooper, who have also settled in Crete, say future tax increases may hit some ex-pats quite hard, particularly those on pensions. ""Luckily we haven't got a swimming pool or big house or big car which are being targeted to raise extra cash,"" said Roy. As well as extra taxes, the Greek government is working hard to stamp out tax evasion and reform public pensions. According to the Greek finance ministry's figures, last year it seized 555 yachts and imposed fines of  €3.4 billion ($4.7 billion). But Bob Scott says he continues to see regular evasion, explaining that shops may charge €25 ($35) for a purchase but give a receipt for €15 ($21) or no receipt at all. And he says many workers will ask for a small cash bribe to carry out a favour. ""Graft is a way of life,"" said Bob. ""People are looking for it. We've got used to it but we don't pay backhanders to people if they ask."" Despite the frustrations, the couple are sympathetic to the plight of the Greek people and understand their anger. ""The current situation is driving most people to distraction because they realize the things being imposed on them are punitive -- absolutely nothing is being done to promote growth,"" said Bob. ""They see people at the top getting away with what they perceive as blue murder. ""There are so many good things about this place. The people are very nice, friendly, helpful and generous when they know you. We really enjoy it here and we wouldn't want to go back to the UK unless we were forced to."" However, the couple believe an increased tax burden on their UK pension, which is their only income, could make it a possibility. The prospects for Greece are not promising. It has teetered on the edge of defaulting on its debts and the population is resentful of the austerity measures introduced so far. There are frequent protests and a public sector strike last week brought the country to a standstill. And there are other problems. According to Bob, local hotels have pegged their room prices for three years, but he said taxi driver strikes leave tourists stranded at the airport, and extra taxes could further discourage visitors and drive away those who have already moved to Greece and spend their money there.","Retired couple face extra property tax of €500 ($690) in the next year .

"Over the last 20 years, the narrative on the African continent has shifted from Afro-pessimism to Afro-optimism. The truth lies somewhere in between. Now is the time for Afro-realism: for sound policies based on honest data, aimed at delivering results. The potential of our continent is huge. Compared to developed countries, or even to some major emerging countries, burdened by aging populations, financial crises, widening budget deficits, faltering faith in politics and growing social demands, Africa has become the world's last ""New Frontier"", a kind of ""it-continent"". By the end of this century, half of the world's young people will be African. Twenty years from now, by 2035, Africa's working age population will exceed that of China or India. Youth is our major resource. But our continent also harbors most of the world's proven mineral reserves: 95% of platinum, over 75% of phosphate, 60% of diamonds, nearly half of cobalt and chromium, more than a quarter of bauxite. Diamonds aside, 90% of this huge potential remains untapped. In a world of growing food demand, Africa is home to two-thirds of the world's unexploited arable land. Its solar, water, wind and nuclear energy potential are considerable. Already, over the last 10 years, Africa's overall GDP growth has reached an annual average of 5.4%; more than four times the European Union average. In 2012, 16 African countries experienced GDP growth in excess of 5%. The latest iteration of the Ibrahim Index of African Governance shows that 94% of the population of the continent is now living in a country where the overall level of governance has improved since 2000. All of this is promising -- but we are still a long way from realizing our potential. Let us first stop talking about ""Africa"" as a homogeneous and uniform whole. We are a mosaic of 54 countries, each with its own flag, its own borders, and its own embassies. The African Union, whose 50th anniversary we have just celebrated, is still a long way from European-style Union, with its common market, single currency, supra-national political bodies and common and shared budget. And the road to convergence between the 54 countries is a long one. Without effective economic and political regional integration, we will not carry sufficient weight in this globalized world, no matter how much ""potential"" we may have. Only unity, coherence, and internal solidarity will allow us to assert ourselves on the global stage. The building blocks to effective integration are not political declarations, expansive Heads of State Summits or our presence and commitments at impressive multilateral gatherings. The building blocks are the free movement of people, goods and financial resources between our countries. This is the way Europe was built. As we approach Africa with an Afro-realist view, the progress made over the past decade must be understood in a nuanced fashion. The major regional conflicts of the former century have mostly ended. However, the dawn of the new century has also seen a rise in social tension, domestic unrest, and trans-national problems. Terrorist networks have gained geographical ground and widened their operating sectors, often in direct association with large, cross-border criminal networks. Young people are becoming the demographic majority. They are receiving better education than their elders. But they are also more unemployed and out of step with the demands of the global labor market. They are also feeling increasingly disconnected from the political process and devoid of economic prospects -- a trend reflected in the rise in the trafficking and consumption of drugs on the continent. Impressive economic growth is taking place all over the continent. However this coincides with a worrying rise in inequality, which deepens the divisions between countries and within them. Africa has a vast reservoir of natural resources. But to leverage this, and guarantee ownership of the African citizens, much remains to be done: ensuring transparency of contracts, creating local jobs, upgrading the value chain and redistributing wealth. Today, 90% of Nigeria's oil is still being exported from the continent, while just 25% of the sub-Saharan population has access to electricity. We must focus less on international support and more on African unity. While the Marshall Plan was important for Europe's recovery, Europe's prosperity was really built on economic integration and policy coherence. Moving from international aid to foreign investment is progress, but it is not enough. We must move towards increasing continental investments on the continent. We must prioritize regional integration; the reduction of inequality between and within countries; the employment of our young people and the governance of our natural resources. Our continent has secured its political independence. It is time now to build our autonomy. READ THIS: How access to power can fuel Africa's growth .

"(CNN)Sepp Blatter has issued a defiant message to his rivals for the FIFA presidency and challenged European governing body UEFA to put up a candidate of its own in the election later this year. Blatter, who is seeking a fifth term at the helm of world football's governing body, told CNN in an exclusive interview that he still had unfinished business and would not step aside without a fight. ""I have to say I have not finished my mission because it's a mission to be in football. We have started in 2011 with the reform process. The reform process is not over. I would like to have these four years to finish it and to show that football is more than a game."" But FIFA has been mired in controversy since its decision to award the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar. Criticism reached a fever pitch when the man hired to investigate the bidding process for those World Cups, U.S. lawyer Michael Garcia, resigned in protest last year, unhappy that the published summary did not accurately reflect his findings. Blatter has faced calls to stand down and although UEFA is yet to declare its official position, he clearly believes they are campaigning behind the scenes to depose him. ""They want to get rid of me,"" he told CNN. ""All this opposition is coming now it's unfortunate to say it, it's coming from Nyon, from UEFA. They don't have the courage to come in. ""So let me go (on)  - be respectful! Because in football you learn to win but you also learn to lose. So I'm going now. If I win the better, if I lose ok!"" A UEFA spokesman told CNN Sunday that they had no immediate comment to make over Blatter's remarks. Three candidates have so far stated their intention to challenge Blatter;  Frenchman Jerome Champagne, Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein of Jordan and former star footballer David Ginola. All must get the backing of at least five of the 209 member associations of FIFA by a deadline of January 29th to get on the ballot paper for the election on May 29. Blatter appears unfazed by his likely opponents, with or without another candidate throwing their hat into the ring at this late stage. ""I have been asked by the national associations to be our candidate again because nobody that is strong was in. So I go there,"" he said. He also appears to be relishing the fight ahead, despite closing on his 79th birthday in March. ""I'm now 40 years in FIFA. I've been the president since 1998. ""You know it is impossible to make everybody happy. ""If I would have only positive press then it would not be good. And I like criticism as long as the criticism is... I would say fair criticism. I like the discussion to go with that. But listen I've been there such a long time now and I just want to finish that,"" he added. But perhaps at odds with his other comments, Blatter also called for unity in football, effectively inviting UEFA to put up or shut up. ""Football is a team sport. Let's go together with the team. I invite the confederation of UEFA and especially the leaders of UEFA that are so bitterly attacking me: join! Join! Football is a unity. And we need this unity in this world."" And if he cannot find the necessary level of support and extend his tenure as the most powerful in world football, Blatter came up with a surprising choice of new career. ""The day I'm going to retire the first thing I'm going to do is radio. I always said I will do radio. ""Because radio is even more popular than television, than all electronics ... I said one day - this was my boy's wish - to be a radio reporter one day. I don't know but I'm not so bad."" The first indication of whether Blatter will be seeking out new horizons may well come on February 7th or 8th, the date he revealed to CNN when FIFA will make public the full list of qualified candidates for the election. ""Anyway, I'm in and I don't mind. It's not my first battle for the presidency. I still have the conviction and I believe in myself and I believe in football, "" the Swiss said.","Sepp Blatter seeking fifth term as FIFA president .

"(CNN)As expected, the radical left party Syriza was the big winner of the Greek elections, coming only two seats short of an absolute majority in parliament. But it's unclear if new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will be able to effectively pursue his anti-austerity agenda and renegotiate the terms of the Greek bailout with creditors -- and he will surely need to make a number of concessions to its coalition partners, the Independent Greeks, a right-wing anti-immigration party. What does this victory mean for Greece and for the debt-ridden countries of southern Europe? For Greece, this is a decisive step in the demise of PASOK and New Democracy, the parties that have been in power for 40 years. Secondly, it shows the failure of the political strategy pursued by the Troika (the European Central Bank, IMF and European Commission) to implement austerity in southern Europe by relying on centrist parties to form a cartel that is insulated from voters. Austerity is of course the main culprit for the death of traditional politics in Greece. This is mainly because it has undermined the system of mass party patronage on which the two traditional big parties on the center-left (PASOK) and center-right (New Democracy) have relied on to alternate in power. READ MORE: What's next for Greece? For four decades, politicians from both parties built their electoral success on the distribution of political spoils in exchange for votes: public sector jobs (for their affiliated trade unions), infrastructure projects, protection from competitors through licensing and closed shops (for taxi drivers; truck drivers), and social benefits targeted at particular occupations, among other perks and benefits benefiting party supporters. ""Pork barrel politics,"" as it is known, has long been the cornerstone of Greek politics -- and also one of the causes of the deep economic problems it is facing now. This immensely costly system was able to survive at the cost of high inflation and currency devaluations (before the euro) or mounting public debt (since Greece's entry into the euro). But when the interest rates on government bonds shot up and debt could no longer be used to finance the spoils system, Greece was taken to the brink of bankruptcy. When the Troika imposed a drastic program of austerity and liberalization, PASOK and New Democracy were deprived of the very tools they had relied on for so long to stay in power. Turning off the tap of public spending was like slitting their own wrists: voters and their traditional clienteles abandoned them because they had no real ideological program other than running the state. This problem was particularly brutal for PASOK, which collapsed from nearly 40% support before the crisis to 4% today. This opened up room for new challengers on the left (Syriza) promising a rupture with the old elites, but also on the far right (Golden Dawn). The victory of Syriza also signals the broader failure of the political strategy that has been employed to implement austerity in the debt-ridden countries of southern Europe -- a strategy best described as ""cartel politics"". Cartel politics involves the formation of political alliances between the ruling centrist parties to implement austerity. Just as competing firms sometimes agree to fix prices or production levels, competing political parties agree to put their ideological differences aside to cling to power together in spite of the huge unpopularity of the policies they put in place. This is essentially what happened in Greece with the PASOK-New Democracy government, but also in Italy with the technocratic cabinet of Mario Monti or the grand coalition of Enrico Letta, which united the center-left Democratic Party and Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing PdL. In Portugal, another country in dire economic conditions, the socialist minority government of José Socrates also benefited from the informal support of its main center-right counterpart to carry out austerity measures and avoid a bailout (which failed). In Spain, the nascent rise of the left-wing Podemos party can also be explained by the lack of differentiation of center-left and center-right policies before and after the crisis, even if it never materialized in a de facto coalition. Forming political cartels is understandable in a context where any party in office is bound to have to pass unpopular policies (spending cuts, tax hikes) imposed by creditors that will cost votes and alienate a sizable share of the electorate. It is a good way to stay in office in the short term, but it is a terrible way to keep votes in the medium and long term, because no choice is presented to citizens. Whoever they vote for, the policies will be the same, and they will be painful. Abstention and apathy grows and voters become attracted to challengers promising an alternative. As the electoral base of centrist parties shrinks, the only way for them to remain in power is to band together to compensate for the loss of voters, until this electoral base becomes too small to stay in government. Syriza is the first challenger to break the Greek political cartel. Greece may be a special case because of the extent of its economic collapse, but other movements elsewhere are also looming on the horizon. In Spain, Podemos has been leading the polls in spite of the fact that it was created less than a year ago. In Italy, Beppe Grillo's 5 Star movement has made a breakthrough in the last European elections. Others will surge if politicians continue to believe that democracy can be put on hold to satisfy markets.","Anti-austerity party Syriza claims victory in Greek elections .

"(CNN)The estate of the late comedian Joan Rivers filed a lawsuit Monday in New York County Supreme Court detailing alleged missteps by the outpatient endoscopy facility and the physicians caring for Rivers during an August 28 procedure that the New York medical examiner said ultimately led to her death. Rivers died at Mount Sinai Hospital on September 4, 2014. Attorneys for the estate said they are suing for damages and said the family wants to ""make certain that the many medical deficiencies that led to Joan Rivers' death are never repeated by any outpatient surgery center."" The lawsuit alleges that the doctors who performed the procedure at Manhattan's Yorkville Endoscopy clinic were ""reckless, grossly negligent and wanton."" The lawsuit says they performed procedures to which Rivers did not consent. It also alleges that one of the doctors did not have credentials or privileges to treat patients at the facility. Clinic that did Joan Rivers' procedure to be cut off Medicare . The comedian went to the medical center for a procedure to evaluate her ""voice changes"" and to determine what was causing her stomach reflux, according to the New York medical examiner. The lawsuit says Rivers signed an authorization and gave her consent to let the doctors perform an upper endoscopy, or EGD, with possible biopsy/possible polypectomy and possible dilation of the esophagus.  It was unclear if Rivers had given verbal consent to any other procedure before being sedated.  The lawsuit maintains she did not. During an upper endoscopy a camera is inserted to examine the upper part of the digestive system.  A doctor controls the tiny camera on the end of a flexible tube.  It is used to diagnose stomach, esophagus and small-intestine problems. A biopsy would be done if a doctor found an area that looked like there was some kind of cancer. Voice changes can be a sign of throat cancer. Federal agency claims major violations by clinic that treated Rivers . A polypectomy is done to remove nasal polyps, which are benign growths originating in the mucous membrane that can block the nasal passages. During esophageal dilation doctors dilate or stretch the narrowed area of the esophagus, which they may do as part of a sedated endoscopy procedure. It's most commonly done because the esophagus has narrowed from acid reflux. Often patients with this problem have trouble swallowing and sometimes have pain.  Less commonly, narrowing happens because of cancer of the esophagus. Rivers first underwent a laryngoscopy. This is a procedure she did not consent to in writing.  It is used by doctors to get a look at the vocal folds and glottis.  It was during this first procedure that her doctors had ""difficulty maintaining"" her oxygen saturation at an ""appropriate and safe level to ensure that her airway was not compromised"" the lawsuit says. Then Dr. Lawrence Cohen and Dr. Renuka Bankulla performed the upper endoscopy, the procedure for which they did have written consent.  When Bankulla noticed the oxygen saturation level again dropped, the lawsuit says she requested that the EGD be stopped and the endoscope removed to increase Rivers' oxygen level. Once her level was raised, Cohen reinserted the laryngoscope and continued the EGD. The lawsuit argues that during this part of the procedure Cohen and Bankulla failed to ensure Rivers' airway was appropriately maintained and that they ""failed to properly observe and monitor Joan Rivers' vital signs which were deteriorating"" and that her blood pressure ""dropped significantly"" as did her pulse and oxygen saturation level according to the lawsuit. After Cohen completed the EGD he took a selife with Rivers while she was under sedation during the procedure, without her consent, according to the lawsuit. When he took the photo, the lawsuit says, Cohen announced that maybe Rivers would ""like to see these in the recovery area."" Dr. Gwen Korovin then said she wanted to ""go down again"" and take another look, doing another laryngoscopy, the procedure for which the facility did not have written consent, according to the lawsuit. E!'s 'Fashion Police' to continue without Rivers . Korovin performed the laryngoscopy despite a concern voiced by Bankulla that the procedure could compromise Rivers' airway, the suit says, adding that Cohen told Bankulla she was just ""being paranoid,"" and the doctors proceeded with the second laryngoscopy. According to an October investigation by the medical examiner's office, the cause of death was ""anoxic encephalopathy due to hypoxic arrest,"" a medical description of brain damage caused by lack of oxygen ""that happened during the laryngoscopy."" 25 of Joan Rivers' best jokes . Rivers had a laryngospasm, a spasm of the vocal cords that makes it difficult to breathe, according to the investigation. Her body was unable to take in enough oxygen and eventually her heart stopped delivering fresh oxygenated blood to her brain, which shut down. When the doctors did notice that Rivers' vital signs had dropped, as had her oxygen saturation level, they tried to get her breathing better.   When 10 minutes of ambu bagging didn't work, the lawsuit says Bankulla asked another doctor to get the tracheotomy kit ready. In that case, the lawsuit says the doctors should have performed an emergency tracheotomy. Bankulla looked for Korovin to perform a cricothyrotomy, but the lawsuit says Korovin had left the room. Korovin is a well known doctor who has successfully treated an impressive list of celebrity clients who have come to her with voice trouble. The list of famous patients who have sung her praises include actors Hugh Jackman and Nathan Lane and singers Celine Dion, Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande. Korovin is a licensed medical doctor, but she ""did not have privileges to perform surgical procedures"" at Yorkville Endoscopy nor was she credentialed to perform procedures at the facility, according to the lawsuit. After Rivers started to deteriorate further, the lawsuit alleges that Korovin left the room ""because she knew she was not permitted to perform medical services or procedures"" at that particular clinic and wanted to ""avoid getting caught."" Joan Rivers gave misfit girls permission to dream . The lawsuit also says the doctors were inadequately trained to handle an emergency like the one they encountered. CNN left voice messages and emails for all the individuals and facilities named in the suit. So far, none has responded to CNN's inquiries. In relation to this case in the past, the Yorkville Endoscopy clinic has said, ""Our anesthesiologists monitor the patient continuously utilizing state-of-the-art monitoring equipment, and remain at the bedside throughout the procedure and into recovery."" It added that all its doctors are certified for advance cardiac life support. Korovin's lawyer sent a statement in relation to past stories that said the doctor ""is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients."" ""As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr. Korovin does not publicly discuss her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr. Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient. ""For these reasons, neither Dr. Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press please respect Dr. Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients, as well as the privacy of her patients,"" the statement said. In reaction to the lawsuit, Rivers' daughter, Melissa Rivers, released a statement. ""Filing this lawsuit was one of the most difficult decisions I've ever had to make,"" said Rivers. ""What ultimately guided me was my unwavering belief that no family should ever have to go through what my mother, Cooper and I have been through. ""The level of medical mismanagement, incompetency, disrespect and outrageous behavior is shocking and, frankly, almost incomprehensible,"" Rivers said. ""Not only did my mother deserve better, every patient deserves better.  It is my goal to make sure that this kind of horrific medical treatment never happens to anyone again.""

"Google Street View, the interactive panorama feature within Google Maps, has shared eye-level images of Antarctica, gone inside NASA's Kennedy Space Center, floated down rivers in the Amazon and strolled the halls of famous museums. Now the company is going underwater. The company on Wednesday added panoramic undersea images of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, the waters off the Apo Islands in the Philippines and underwater life around the Hawaiian islands. The stunning photos capture fish, plants, turtles and other marine critters going about their business in faraway oceans. Now anyone can get an immersive view of the seas without getting wet or worrying about the bends. Zoom in to check out a manta ray's belly, join a school of fish or study intricate coral up close. More Australia wildlife news: Albino whale puts on show . The photos are part of a partnership with the Catlin Seaview Survey, an ambitious project focused on documenting the world's reefs using high-resolution 360-degree images. Catlin is working to create a thorough archive off the world's reefs that scientists can use to study the effects of climate change. By documenting reefs with photographs, it will be possible to determine the impact increased water temperatures and acidity will have on the areas over time. ""If you want to reach millions of people worldwide, the first place you knock on the door is Google,"" said Richard Vevers, project director of the Catlin Seaview Survey. The partnership with Google (which also involved a live Google Hangout with a diver and a sea turtle earlier this year), is an attempt to get people invested in the fate of these ecosystems and the role the oceans play in sustaining the planet. For the 99% of people who have never been diving, a panoramic photo is a vivid introduction. ""It's about introducing to the wide number of people on this planet the impact we're having on these coral reefs,"" said Vevers. ""Until we make coral reefs and the important ecosystem in the ocean relevant to people on the planet, we're not going to get action."" Google has used cars, trikes, snowmobiles and people outfitted with custom cameras to capture 360-degree images around the world. For this project, the images were taken by a camera custom-designed for the Catlin Seaview Survey, the SVII, whose design was inspired by sharks. The rapid-fire camera can be controlled by a tablet in watertight housing, and it records GPS data as well as the exact angle at which the photo was taken. To capture images at greater depths, between 30 and 100 meters (about 98 to 328 feet), the group plans to send down special remotely operated vehicles outfitted with remote-controlled digital single-lens reflex cameras. Nearly 90% of the Great Barrier Reef is below 30 meters of water. So far, the project has taken 15,000 panoramic photos underwater, and each of those is made of three separate shots. They hope to have between 50,000 and 100,000 panoramic photos by the end of next year. Future sites will include Bermuda, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the Coral Triangle, an area where coral reefs retreated to after the last ice age. Only the most interesting images will be used for Google Maps, but all will be accessible to scientists through the project's main site. ""One of the central concepts of this activity is to bring people on this jouney with scientists,"" said Ove Hoegh-Guldberg, director of the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland. The Street View (perhaps Reef View?) ocean project was first announced in February. Since it launched in 2007, Google Street View has captured 20 petabytes of data in 48 countries. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that 95% of the ocean is still unexplored.","Google and the Catlin Seaview Survey are capturing underwater imagery .

"Virgin chief Richard Branson has put a time frame on his plan to launch tourists into space, claiming he and his family will blaze a trail for hundreds of fare-paying passengers by blasting off in December 2013. Branson also announced that Virgin Galactic, his fledgling commercial space company, was expanding to include a satellite-launching service that would use a low-cost rocket system to propel payloads into orbit. Speaking at the UK's Farnborough International Airshow, the British entrepreneur said his adult children, Holly and Sam, would accompany him on board the SpaceShipTwo on its pioneering two-hour voyage into sub-orbital space. ""It'll certainly be the most momentous moment of my life and my children's lives,"" Branson told CNN. ""It'll be very difficult to ever cap it I think.  Anyone who has ever been into space says the same thing."" See also: Farnborough 2012 in pictures . Some 529 would-be astronauts, including celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher, have so far signed up for $200,000-a-seat flights which will last two hours. Virgin executives said the figure was a milestone as it exceeds the existing number of space veterans. Six hundred are expected to fly in the first two years of service. Launched from a carrier vessel known as WhiteKnightTwo, Virgin Galactic's space ship can carry two pilots and six passengers. SpaceShipTwo is currently undergoing testing in the Mojave Desert in California, although a replica was on display at Farnborough. Branson acknowledged the existing price tag means that his goal of opening space travel up to ordinary people was some way off. He insisted, however, that it would drop over the next few decades as Virgin's space ambitions went further. ""The initial flights will be sub-orbital, which will give people a taste of space,"" he said. ""From there we'll go into orbital flights and maybe one day hotels in space."" Outlining details of his new satellite service, LauncherOne, Branson said the two-stage rocket would also be carried into launching position by WhiteKnightTwo. Infographic: State of global aviation . He said the service, capable of launching 500-pound payloads, would drastically reduce the cost of putting satellites into orbit. This, he said would open up the market to researchers, small businesses and even schools. Several clients have already signed up for the service including Earth observation company GeoOptics and Planetary Resources, an asteroid mining company which counts Google founders Eric Schmidt and Larry Page, and movie director James Cameron as investors. Virgin Galactic's commercial director Stephen Attenborough told CNN that the goal was to be able to offer a reliable satellite launch system for $10 million, a price tag he says undercuts existing services by up to 50%. George Whitesides, the company's chief executive and president, said: ""This will radically revolutionize the small satellite business in the way we have the space tourism business."" Read more: Rolls-Royce showcases jet engine made of Lego . But Branson insisted his chief aim was to open space to researchers studying the ""global crisis"" of climate change. ""In America you've got a lot of skeptics about global warming, what you need is the scientific evidence that it is there one way or the other,"" he said. ""The majority of scientists believe we have a problem, we need to know that conclusively and we need to work towards resolving it and I think LauncherOne will make it clear one way or the other, and sadly I think it'll be the other."" On the sidelines of Wednesday's announcement, Virgin Galactic officials offered more details of what customers can expect for their money. Blog: Branson's busy bathroom break . Whitesides said astronauts on board SpaceShipTwo would experience a little less than five minutes of weightlessness, during which time they will be free to unclip their seat harnesses and float within the cabin. ""Some people will want to focus their time looking out of the vehicle, looking down at the planet or Milky Way, whereas others may want to do spins or tricks,"" Whitesides told CNN. ""There's one guy who wants to assume a neutral position, close his eyes and get back to the womb. ""My big concern is getting people back to their seats. This is one of the central design considerations. My guess is it will be as simple as saying 'OK everybody; get back in your seats. Then gravity will kick in."" Branson, meanwhile, confessed he hadn't yet planned his time in space. ""I'm sure we will do something but we haven't got that far thinking about it. If we're allowed to put up a flag up there... who knows?"" Quiz: Are you a plane geek? Test your aviation knowledge . Adam Wells, Virgin Galactic's head of design, said the cabin's interior was being kept as minimal as possible to reduce weight and maximize space for floating. There are unlikely to be comforts familiar to airline passengers. Television screens will probably be too heavy -- and there will be no toilet. ""The intent is to keep the volume as uncluttered as possible,"" he told CNN. ""From an ideal standpoint we want everything, including the seats to disappear, which is a fascinating design challenge."" Among would-be astronauts attending Wednesday's announcement was Portuguese diplomat Angelo Araujo. Araujo, 62, described his journey into space as a ""spiritual journey"" during which he would pay homage to his late father, a poet and composer also called Angelo Araujo. ""As we age and we approach the end, we are part of the universe and I think it's wonderful to see it from another angle. ""I want to read some poetry from my father. He will be the first Portuguese poet to be read in space. Perry Sporn, a jeweler from Burlington, Vermont, who will be among the first 500 to fly said the $200,000 price tag was money well spent. ""I was a poor kid but I had an amazing opportunity to be productive and make a good living, so to me it's a ridiculously small sum."" As Virgin Galactic's chief pilot, David Mackay is likely to helm the first flights and may even break records for space travel as he clocks up at least one voyage per week when the service is up and running. ""I'm not on some ego trip to enjoy the greatest number of space flights,"" he told CNN. ""If it's successful, it will eventually become much more common and whatever record I set will quickly be broken.""","Branson confirms rumors the first Virgin Galactic space tourists will take off in 2013 .

"Authorities are investigating why a University of South Alabama officer fatally shot an 18-year-old freshman who they say was naked and acting erratically outside the campus police station early Saturday. With few details of the shooting in the Gulf Coast city of Mobile, the student's mother and one of his friends said they could not understand how a six-year varsity wrestler and good-natured teenager could have died under such strange and sad circumstances. According to a statement from the school, the campus police officer heard a loud banging noise on a window at the station at 1:23 a.m. CT (2:23 a.m. ET) Saturday. When he left the station to investigate, the school said, ""he was confronted by a muscular, nude man who was acting erratically."" Minnesota: police officer facing charges for hitting man in detox . The man, later identified as Gilbert Thomas Collar, of Wetumpka, Alabama, repeatedly rushed and verbally challenged the officer in a fighting stance, the school said. The officer, whose name hasn't been released, drew his weapon and ordered Collar to stop, the school said. The officer retreated several times to try to calm the situation. ""When the individual continued to rush toward the officer in a threatening manner and ignored the officer's repeated commands to stop, the officer fired one shot with his police sidearm, which struck the chest of the assailant,"" the school statement said. ""The individual fell to the ground, but he got up once more and continued to challenge the officer further before collapsing and expiring."" Collar's mother, Bonnie, said the two people who called her with the news of her son -- someone from the school and another involved in the investigation -- did not mention that her son was trying to attack anyone when he was shot. ""He was wearing no clothes and he was obviously not in his right mind,"" she told CNN. ""No one said that he had attacked anybody, and obviously he was not armed. He was completely naked."" Bonnie Collar said she did not know why her son was acting that way when he was killed. She said he weighed 135 pounds and was 5-foot-7 with a wrestler's build. ""The first thing on my mind is, freshman kids do stupid things, and campus police should be equipped to handle activity like that without having to use lethal force,"" she said. Campus police immediately contacted the district attorney's office to request an external investigation, and the Mobile County Sheriff's Department will assist, the school said. The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of internal and external investigations, according to the school, which enrolls about 15,000 students. Philadelphia: Officer who struck parade-goer will be fired . Investigators are looking at security camera tape of the shooting, Collar's mother said. CNN's calls about the tape were referred to school spokesman Keith Ayers, who did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Earlier Saturday, Ayers called it a ""campus tragedy"" for the university family but offered no other details, citing the active investigation. One of Collar's oldest friends was Chris Estes, 18. He said the boys became friends at age 5 and grew up playing baseball together. Along with their friend Jared, they became three best friends with the slogan ""JGC for life,"" Estes told CNN by e-mail. ""Gil was a very 'chill' guy, mellow and easy going,"" Estes wrote. ""That's why I don't understand the story that he attacked the cop. He got along with anybody at school no matter who you were. He could always have a conversation with anyone. As many times as I've hung out with Gil, I've never seen aggression in him, especially not towards a cop."" As the boys grew up in Wetumpka, Estes said, Collar stopped playing baseball to focus more on his dominant sport, wrestling. Collar's mother said he was a two-time state qualifier in wrestling, and Estes said he could have wrestled at the collegiate level if he chose. ""Gil loved to hang out with friends, he loved having a good time and made the best out of every situation, always keeping his head up,"" said Estes, who stayed behind to attend nearby Auburn University at Montgomery. Estes said it's unfortunate he didn't go off to college with his friend. ""If I did, I think the whole situation would have been avoided,"" he said. Collar's mother said their hometown of nearly 8,000 people is in disbelief about the shooting.  On Twitter, some used the hashtag #WetuFam (Wetumpka Family) on Saturday in remembering Collar. ""Our entire community is in shock because this is so different than his demeanor and his personality that we've seen for the 18 years that he's been on this earth,"" she said.

"After her husband's failed 2008 run for president, Ann Romney said she would never do it again -- until she decided she would. And now that Mitt Romney is in the political fight of his life, Ann has become a key advocate and character witness. And when he's attacked, she's his chief defender -- as this race has become an increasingly personal crusade for a woman who wants the voters to see her husband the way she sees him. ""His whole life has been a preparation for him being where he is right now. His whole life has been an experience of working in very troubled situations, turning around troubled situations. His whole life has been in the private economy.  He understands job creation. He understands the difficulties of an economic decline. He understands what's missing in an economic recovery,"" she told CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger in a recent interview in Reno, Nevada. What questions went unanswered at the first debate? Share your thoughts with CNN iReport. She also stresses, in appearances, the personal side of her husband to try to combat a perception of him as an uncaring, rich businessman. ""He has a character that is so strong, and is caring, and is good, and is -- he's just such a good, decent human being,"" she said. Just this week, she headlined events in Las Vegas -- near where President Barack Obama was preparing for Wednesday's debate -- and outside Denver. Her popularity is higher than her husband's, and she makes sure to do a series of local television interviews at most stops to help spread the message. In campaign speeches, she describes how her husband helped those in need or who were sick, including visiting those in the hospital -- even taking their sons with him to help teach them. ""That is where Mitt is when someone is in trouble. He is there. He is by the bedside,"" she told a campaign rally in Littleton, Colorado, on Tuesday. She also has encouraged others with personal stories of how he has helped people to share them, a campaign aide confirmed to CNN. Ann Romney: 'Dad' is always with Mitt at the debates . Since Mitt Romney is known as someone who doesn't like to talk about himself and his record spanning private business and turning around the 2002 Olympics, his wife is trying to fill the void. ""One thing I know about Mitt. He doesn't fail. ... I have seen him be successful in everything he tackles,"" she told the Colorado audience. ""We've seen Mitt do so many turnarounds. I am guessing this country is due for a turnaround, and I am guessing there is somebody who knows how to do turnarounds, and his name is Mitt Romney."" In light of polls that show a large majority of Americans say they don't believe Mitt Romney understands the concerns of average Americans, one of his wife's main missions is to convince them otherwise -- especially after the secretly recorded video at a fundraiser where he said 47% of people would not vote for him because they don't pay income taxes. Michelle Obama: Debates make me nervous . ""I think the first and most important thing is to recognize is that's not an accurate perception, that he's obviously running for 100 percent of the Americans. ... This is a guy that does care, that does understand. That's why we're running,"" she told Borger. After the 2008 campaign, Ann Romney made a video emphatically telling her husband she would not endure another campaign. She, however, changed her mind because she said the state of the economy convinced her he was needed. Her frustration with some of the recent Republican criticism of how her husband's campaign is being run recently became public. When Radio Iowa asked her what she would say to those critics she responded ""Stop it. This is hard ... you want to try it. Get in the ring."" Ann Romney touts her husband's softer side . She was more cautious in the CNN interview. ""You know, there's -- there's always days when you just go -- you know, everyone's a critic. And you just go, 'If -- if you really understood what you're up against when you do run for president, it's a very difficult thing,""' she told Borger. ""It's really hard for a family member, a person that loves this person that you see going through these difficulties, and just -- know, you know -- how tough it is on -- on that person that you love."" Mrs. Romney is also her husband's major defender. Originally she wanted to go to back to the press section of the campaign plane to complain to reporters about some of the coverage of his European trip this past summer, but officials urged her not to do that, campaign aides confirmed to CNN. She makes gentle jabs at Obama and his record, such as describing to CNN the question people should ask themselves when going into the voting booth: . ""They should be thinking about, 'Have the past four years been good? Do you expect the economy to get better under this president? Or do you think it's gonna just go on as it has been, just dribbling along?'"" While she continues to suffer from multiple sclerosis, which was diagnosed in 1998, it is not stopping her from a vigorous campaign schedule. She is expected to be out on the trail constantly between now and Election Day at rallies, fundraisers and doing television interviews. Debate advice: Obama, light a cig; Romney, throw deep .","Ann Romney: husband's best surrogate?

"Calling all fans of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee and Donnie Yen. Hong Kong may be a well-known shopping and foodie destination, but the birthplace of Chinese martial arts films now offers some butt-kicking activities and scenic attractions for kung fu fans too. Nunchuks not mandatory. 1. Free kung fu lessons . You'll never be able to punch like Jackie Chan, but you can pick up some basic moves to show off to family, friends and local ne'er do wells. The weekly kung fu demonstration at Kung Fu Corner teaches introductory techniques used in traditional combat. Instructors incorporate different weapons and kung fu styles in their routines. Kung Fu Corner; Sculpture Walk, Kowloon Park, 22 Austin Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon; +852 2508 1234; Sundays only, 2:30-4:30 p.m. 2. Selfie with Bruce Lee . Bruce Lee died 40 years ago, but a selfie with the martial arts hero is a classic Hong Kong souvenir. You can strike a pose with Lee on the Hollywood look-alike Avenue of Stars, where a life-size bronze statue of the '70s ass-whomping legend -- striking his iconic high kick pose -- stands next to the harbor front. The statue commemorates Lee's global martial arts triumphs in classics like ""Enter the Dragon"" and ""Fist of Fury."" After snapping that selfie with Bruce, you can ""hold hands"" with kung fu superstars Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. Their hand prints are a few meters in front of Lee's statue. Avenue of Stars, Promenade, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon . 3. Movie locations . In the movies, knife-wielding gangsters lurk on every Hong Kong street corner. Not exactly true in real life, but the city is loaded with spots where kung fu stars flashed their heels and beat back endless waves of thugs. Jackie Chan filmed his death-defying act in ""Police Story"" at Tsim Sha Tsui's Wing On Plaza. The mall looks the same as it did when he leaped five stories down to its atrium. Remember ""Don't think! Feeeeel""? That Bruce Lee moment of zen instruction in ""Enter the Dragon"" was shot in Tuen Mun's Tsing Shan Monastery.

Apart from watching his movies, you can get a glimpse of Bruce Lee's early life in Hong Kong with a visit to his high school and family home. First stop: Bruce Lee's alma mater -- St. Francis Xavier College -- where bathroom doors were his enemies. Records show that Lee destroyed the school bathroom doors while fighting his classmates. Instead of punishing Lee, a teacher advised him to join the school's boxing team. The rest is kung fu cinema history. St. Francis Xavier College, Sycamore Street, Tai Kok Tsui, Kowloon . Second stop: the superstar's former home -- now a love motel. Lee's onetime two-story family home now operates as a ""romance hotel,"" where guests rent rooms by the hour. Hong Kong's government originally planned to construct a Bruce Lee museum at the residence, but that project has been scrapped. According to reports, the owner declined to donate the house as a permanent museum space due to construction disputes. Bruce Lee's former home, 41 Cumberland Road, Kowloon Tong, Kowloon . 5.

The class is led by Master Sam Lau -- a student of Bruce Lee's mentor, the legendary grandmaster Ip Man. The 2008 blockbuster ""Ip Man"" was based on his life. Visitors can train with Lau's teaching assistants. ""Wing Chun is all about defense and attack at the same time,"" says Master Lau. ""The class focuses more on basic and practical skills, rather than theory."" The young Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung once practiced their kung fu on the roof of the same  building where classes are held, according to Master Lau. The ""Experience"" includes a guided tour of the $3.2 million ""Bruce Lee: Kung Fu. Art. Life"" exhibition at the Hong Kong Heritage Museum. The superstar's legacy is recalled through personal artifacts. Lee's sentimental and quirky sides are evident in his hand-written poems and cha cha choreography notes.

"(CNN)Opening statements begin Tuesday in the trial of Kendrick Johnson's parents in a case growing increasingly controversial after reports that a Georgia judge had the media removed from his courtroom. Exactly what happened is unclear, as The Valdosta Daily Times reported that its reporter, a citizen journalist and two television reporters were escorted out of the courtroom by a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office deputy who said she was following State Court Judge Mark Mitchell's order and offered no further explanation. However, the Johnsons' attorney, Chevene King, said that only CNN affiliate WCTV-TV had its reporter booted from the courtroom. WCTV had no reporting to that effect on its website, nor did CNN affiliate WTXL-TV. A clerk in Mitchell's office referred questions to Lowndes County Clerk Beth Copeland Green, who had not returned messages as of late Tuesday afternoon. Mitchell, a judge from Thomas County, is presiding over the case after Lowndes County Superior Court judges recused themselves from all proceedings involving the Johnsons in order to maintain fairness. Johnson's mother and father, along with five other relatives, are in court on misdemeanor charges related to a 2013 protest. Jury selection wrapped up Monday, and opening statements were scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday. One black juror and five whites compose the six-man jury, WCTV reported. The alternate is also black, the station said. The ""KJ 7,"" as the defendants are known, each face a charge of interference with government property for allegedly blocking the entrance to the Lowndes County Courthouse in Valdosta and blocking access to the security checkpoint inside the building. The demonstration was planned after Johnson's parents became frustrated with the lack of information they had received from local investigators regarding their son, who was found dead inside a rolled gym mat at his South Georgia high school in January 2013, King said. Footage published on YouTube shows authorities arresting family members who held hands, blocking a door to the courthouse. Another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. The family and others can be heard chanting, ""No justice, no peace,"" as officers step in to arrest them. The relatives were arrested and released on bond in the April 25, 2013, incident, King said. ""It wasn't until seven days after that protest that the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department released the investigative file of the teen's death,"" King said. All seven have pleaded not guilty. Upon her release from jail, the same evening she was arrested, Jacquelyn Johnson told WCTV, ""I'm going to be right back out at the courthouse in the morning, ready to do it all over again, until we get justice."" Each of the seven family members could face up to a year in prison, a $1,000 fine, or both. There are no plans to entertain any potential plea deals, King said. In May 2013, the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office announced it was closing its investigation into Johnson's death after determining Johnson, 17, slipped into the mat while reaching for a shoe and got stuck. An autopsy completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation concluded Johnson died of accidental positional asphyxia. Months later, a pathologist hired by the Johnsons conducted a second autopsy, found evidence of ""unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma"" to the 17-year-old's neck and concluded the death was a homicide. In October 2013, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched a federal investigation, which is ongoing. Johnson's parents, who have been steadfast in their claim that their son's death was no accident, filed a wide-ranging $100 million lawsuit this month, alleging former classmates beat their son to death inside the high school gym. The suit names 37 people, mostly members of local law enforcement, plus the city of Valdosta as defendants. ""We know who killed him. We just have to prove it,"" Jacquelyn Johnson said. CNN's Devon M. Sayers contributed to this report.","Despite reports that judge removed media from courtroom, it's unclear what happened .

"(CNN) -- Effective Saturday night, Yemeni Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi took over Ali Abdullah Saleh's responsibilities as president, Yemeni government spokesman Abdu Ganadi told CNN. The power transfer comes as a source close to the Saudi government said that the long-time Yemeni ruler arrived in Riyadh around midnight Saturday, a day after being hurt in an attack on a mosque in his palace. Some Yemeni officials continue to insist that Saleh, who for months has resisted calls to step down, is still in Yemen. Yaser Yamani, Sanaa's deputy mayor, told Yemeni state TV Saturday night that ""Saleh is still being treated in the military hospital in Sanaa."" Yet the Saudi source said that Saleh was immediately taken to a nearby hospital after his plane landed in Saudi Arabia. A senior Yemeni government official had told CNN that Saleh was fine after sustaining a slight head injury in Friday's attack, and he gave a nationally broadcast speech later that night. But Saleh's medical condition is worse than originally thought, according to the Saudi source. In response to that attack, Yemeni security forces on Friday pounded the home of Sadeq al-Ahmar, the tribal leader whose supporters are suspected of being behind the presidential palace offensive. The flurry of shelling left 10 people dead and 35 others wounded, according to Fawzi Al-Jaradi, an official with Hamil al-Ahmar, a Hashed tribal confederation led by Sadeq al-Ahmar. The Saudi government source said Saturday that the Riyadh government has helped to broker an open-ended cease-fire aimed at ending spiralling violence in Yemen. Demonstrators have demanded Saleh's ouster for months, and fighting between Yemeni government forces and Hashed tribesemen has spiked considerably in recent weeks. Key members of all pertinent parties agreed to the deal, with the signatories including Brig. Gen. Ali Mohsen al Ahmar, who defected to the opposition; Sadeq al-Ahmar, the Hashed and Hamil al-Ahmar leader; and Saleh's sons, representing the government. The Saudi source said that King Abdullah and Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz Al-Saud have been heavily involved in setting up the framework for the cease-fire. This is not the first time that the opposition and Saleh, who has led Yemen for 33 years, have seemingly agreed to a peace deal. The Gulf Cooperation Council, which consists of representatives from six neighboring nations, helped broker a pact that involved Saleh stepping down from power -- but that agreement ended up breaking down weeks ago. Meanwhile, the popular unrest in the impoverished Arab nation continued Saturday. Tens of thousands of demonstrators congregated Saturday in Sanaa's Change Square. Meanwhile, in the flashpoint town of Taiz, protesters retook an iconic square in the city's center Saturday after government forces cleared it out last week. Eyewitnesses said security forces tried to disperse crowds of anti-government demonstrators by shooting at them and that at least two were injured. Yemen's tough crackdown against peaceful protesters in Taiz prompted a new denunciation by Human Rights Watch, an international organization that monitors human rights violations. ""First the security forces kill and wound protesters, then they keep medical workers from treating the wounded and raze the protesters' camps to wipe out all traces of them,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. ""Foreign countries need to respond. They should freeze the assets of the president and other top officials until these horrendous abuses stop and those responsible are brought to account,"" said Stork, whose group also called for the export bans on arms and security equipment to Yemen. Friday's presidential palace attack illustrates the escalating violence. A Yemeni official who asked not to be named told CNN that Saleh was in the mosque when two ""projectiles"" were fired during Friday prayers. He confirmed the death of Sheikh Ali Mohsen al-Matari and four bodyguards. State-run news agency SABA, citing a source in Saleh's office, said three guards and the sheikh were killed. Others taken to Saudi Arabia for treatment include Prime Minister Ali Mujawar; deputy prime ministers Rashad al-Alimi and Sadeq Amin Abu Rasand; Shura Council Chairman Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghani; parliament speaker Yahya Al-Raee; and Shura Council Chairman Abdul Aziz Abdul Ghan. In a televised speech Friday night, the president said the attack occurred as talks were taking place between himself and affiliates of Sadeq al-Ahmar, the Hashed tribal leader whose break with Saleh has been followed by spiraling violence. Eyewitnesses, residents and government officials say Hashed tribesmen were responsible. But the spokesman for Sadeq al-Ahmar insisted this was not true. ""The Hashed tribesmen were not behind these attacks on the presidential palace and if they were, they would not deny it,"" Abdulqawi al-Qaisi said. In his speech, the president said those behind Friday's attacks were not connected with the youth-led movement in Sanaa's Change Square. Rather, he said that ""gangsters"" perpetrated the strike as part of their bid to overthrow his government and destroy Yemen's economic achievements. ""I salute the armed forces everywhere and the courageous security forces who are keen on combating the attacks by a criminal gang that is acting outside of the law and is not affiliated with the youth's revolution present in Change Square,"" Saleh said. Mohammed Qahtan, the spokesman for the Joint Meeting Parties, Yemen's largest opposition coalition, said ""the attack on the palace was preplanned by President Saleh to make people forget about the attacks that he has committed over the last two weeks."" Qahtan said Saleh's forces have ""bombarded most of the al-Ahmar family properties after the palace attack"" and have killed hundreds over the past two weeks. According to the independent International Crisis Group, tensions escalated May 23 when fighting erupted between military forces controlled by ""Saleh's son and nephews and fighters loyal to the pre-eminent sheikh of the powerful Hashed confederation, Sadeq al-Ahmar."" While Saleh has been unpopular among many inside his country, he has been a longtime ally of the United States in the war against terror. The United States has counted on his government to be a bulwark against militants, including al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, but it believes he should transfer power in order to maintain stability in the country. White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said on Friday that John Brennan, the president's homeland security adviser, traveled to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates for meetings with government officials to ""discuss options to address the deteriorating situation"" in Yemen. Human Rights Watch has confirmed the deaths of 166 people in attacks by security forces and pro-government assailants on largely peaceful protesters since February. It said at least 130 people have died in heavy fighting since May 23, though it could not confirm how many of those were civilians. CNN's Nic Robertson, Mohammed Jamjoom, Hakim Almasmari, Chris Lawrence, Jamie Crawford and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.","NEW: President Saleh has arrived in Riyadh for medical treatment, a source says .

"(CNN) -- Fighting raged in a major Syrian city Tuesday, with at least two people killed and several others wounded, an activist group said. Clashes erupted between protesters and security forces in Homs, according to the Local Coordination Committee in Syria, a network of activists that promotes and documents demonstrations across the country. They occurred in al-Khalidiya neighborhood, and video said to be from the Homs unrest shows protesters running and throwing rocks and contains sounds of heavy gunfire. CNN cannot independently confirm the information. Demonstrations critical of the government began in the southern city of Daraa and were swiftly suppressed by security forces. Anti-government fervor caught on nationwide as more protests were met with tougher crackdowns. After three months of protests, more than 1,100 have died and thousands more have been jailed, according to human rights activists. Ammar Qurabi, chairman of the National Organization for Human Rights in Syria, said Tuesday that dozens of protesters were arrested the day before during peaceful anti-government demonstrations in the city of Aleppo. Meanwhile, state TV showed images Tuesday of thousands joining pro-regime rallies in Daraa, Aleppo and Homs. Referring to President Bashar al-Assad, some in the crowds chanted, ""With our blood, with our souls, we will sacrifice for you, Bashar"" and ""God, Syria and Bashar only."" The world's attention has been focused on the plight of Syrians displaced from their homes by violence. At least 10,718 Syrian refugees, many of whom fled a military advance in and around the city of Jisr al-Shugur, have crossed the border into Turkey. The U.N. refugee agency Tuesday said it participated in a government-sponsored mission to Jisr al-Shugur the day before, a trip that included diplomats, reporters and U.N. agencies. The group ""approached Jisr al-Shugur from Idlib to the east"" and ""villages were increasingly empty from around 40 kilometers away from Jisr al-Shugur."" ""There was no evidence of people working in the fields. Jisr al-Shugur itself was almost deserted, with most shops shuttered and closed."" The agency said the fact that Jisr al-Shugur and nearby villages were ""empty indicates significant displacement."" The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said 500 to 1,000 people have been crossing from Syria into Turkey daily since June 7. It also praised Turkey and the Turkish Red Crescent whose efforts ""to provide protection and shelter and cater for the needs of Syrian refugees were commendable."" The agency said many people are ""severely traumatized"" by the ordeal and those most vulnerable need help, particularly women with children. ""Syrian refugees spoke to our team about their fears and trauma. Many had lost family members, who they said were either killed, missing or in hiding. Our team heard accounts of murders, targeted assassinations, assaults, civilians getting killed in crossfire, torture and humiliation by the military,"" the agency said. ""Most of these people had lost virtually all their belongings and property. In many cases their livestock were shot, fields were torched, and homes and businesses destroyed or confiscated."" Robert Ford, the U.S. ambassador to Syria, traveled north with ambassadors and members of the media, all of whom appeared to be local, an American diplomat said. Two sites said to be mass graves were shown to the group. It was not possible to tell how many bodies were present, but the stench was strong. Ford mentioned the predicament of refugees and a Syrian officer told him they could ""return at any time without fear of retribution."" He visited Jisr al-Shugur, largely empty with evidence of fighting. The International Committee of the Red Cross said it has been asking for ""unrestricted access to areas and people affected by the unrest."" ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger ended talks with Syrian Prime Minister Adel Safar and Foreign Minister Walid Muallem in Damascus on the issue, ICRC said Tuesday. ""The Syrian officials were receptive, and agreed to give the ICRC and the Syrian Arab Red Crescent wider access to areas of unrest. I will closely monitor how this understanding is put into practice,"" Kellenberger said. He also asked that ICRC delegates be permitted to visit detainees. ""The Syrian government has expressed its readiness to discuss terms and conditions relating to ICRC visits,"" Kellenberger said. ""This is a first step forward."" This move comes as the Syrian president offered another general amnesty Tuesday for those accused of crimes, Syrian state TV reported. It's the second known amnesty overture from the embattled Syrian leader since protests erupted in March, and it concerns any alleged unlawful acts that occurred before Monday. Al-Assad issued a similar amnesty on May 31 that included the arrests of people belonging to various political groups. But that offer and mentions of reform in a rare public speech Monday have done little to quell widespread anger toward al-Assad's regime. On Monday, al-Assad offered vague promises of reform and called for refugees to go back home. Al-Assad said he was ""working on getting the military back to their barracks as soon as possible"" but also warned the government would ""work on tracking down everyone who shed blood or plotted in shedding the blood of the Syrian people, and we will hold them accountable."" In his third speech to the country in three months, he raised the possibility of amending the Syrian Constitution and referred to the need for a ""national dialogue,"" but he made clear his government would not engage in one-on-one talks with the opposition. Al-Assad blamed armed gangs and conspiracies for the violence that has gripped Syria, saying the unrest has tarnished the country's image and weakened its security. ""There are those who are killing in the name of religion and want to spread chaos under the pretext of religion,"" he said, referring to conspiracies as ""germs"" that cannot be ""exterminated."" The speech was met with demonstrations in a number of Syrian towns and cities, opponents of the government said. .

"(CNN)In 1982, songwriter San Bao fell in love with musical theater  -- then an alien art form in China  -- when he saw a videotaped version of CATS, which became the longest running musical in Broadway history. Fast forward three decades, and San Bao, who has enjoyed a successful career writing pop songs and helming music production at the Beijing Olympics, wants to make home-grown musicals to rival some of Andrew Lloyd Webber's biggest hits. ""This is what I want -- a real musical with Chinese characteristics,"" he told CNN. San Bao has made seven musicals since 2005 and his latest  ""Nie Xiaoqian and Ning Caichen""  -- currently on tour in China -- draws on a collection of supernatural tales written during the early Qing Dynasty. Underwritten by government funding, none of his musicals has yet made a profit, let alone smashed box-office records -- although a 2005 production called ""Butterflies"" made it to South Korean stages in a 2008 tour. ""It takes time for people to appreciate this art form,"" said San Bao. ""Ten years ago, nobody in China would spend money buying a movie ticket, but now? People don't talk about what movies they watched but about which ones they missed."" READ MORE: Shanghai Culture Plaza: Building Asia's Broadway . Rave reviews . Some Broadway shows have captivated Chinese audiences.  French revolution epic ""Les Miserables"" was a hit when it debuted in Shanghai in 2002. More recently, a Chinese-language version of ""Mamma Mia!"" that toured in August 2011 grossed 20 million yuan ($3.2 million) in less than a month and according to the China Daily, a 2013 production of ""The Phantom of the Opera"" sold out five months before its premiere. But high ticket prices mean these shows reach a limited audience, and it's typically only the most accessible Broadway hits that resonate with a Chinese audience, says Zhou Yinchen, the head of the Folk Music and Musical Research Center at Peking University's Academy of Arts. ""'Mamma Mia!' is entertaining, that's why Chinese accept it,"" she says.  ""Of course there are other Broadway musicals but it's only those with the highest entertainment value work in China,"" she adds. Nonetheless, the rave reviews audiences have given to these shows make musical producers like San Bao confident that combining Broadway showmanship with Chinese plot lines will one day result in a sure-fire hit. Cartoon character . As well as China's imperial past, San Bao has also made shows about a Chinese cartoon character similar to Tintin, and the Chinese Communist Party's Long March -- a 6,000 mile journey that helped cement Mao Zedong's stature as a great leader. San Bao says one of the biggest challenges he faces is the dearth of all-round performers. Few Chinese actors and actresses have equally strong singing and dancing skills that musical theater requires, he said. And while China does offer some undergraduate courses in musical theater, these departments are relatively new and the level of expertise is not deep. Xu Luyang​, a classical music critic, also says that musical productions often can't afford the high pay necessary to attract top talent. ""The musical industry is China is still immature,"" he said. ​ . Rather than continuing to rely on the government's largesse, San Bao says he is looking for investors to fund his next project and hopes that will give him freer creative rein. ""The reason why I produce musicals and will keep doing it is because I like it very much."" READ MORE: 'Spin': Chinese musicals take center stage .

"(CNN)President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has proposed the dissolution of Argentina's domestic intelligence service, as the country deals with the fallout from the mysterious death of a federal prosecutor who accused its leaders of a criminal cover-up over Argentina's deadliest terror attack. Kirchner has sent a draft bill to the country's parliament which, if passed, would mean the Secretariat of Intelligence (SI) is replaced by the Federal Intelligence Agency. In a taped statement aired Monday night on national TV, Kirchner said the service had ""not served the interests of the country."" The body of Alberto Nisman, a special prosecutor investigating the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, was found inside his apartment on January 18 -- the day before he was due to testify before Congress about his claims. The previous week, he had filed a report alleging that the President, foreign minister and other officials conspired to cover up Iran's involvement in the bomb attack, which killed 85, in exchange for an oil-and-grain-for-meat deal. Nisman died of a gunshot wound to the temple. A gun and a shell casing were found near his body and the apartment was locked from the inside. At first glance, a suicide. But the untimely death raised suspicions immediately. Then investigators looking into his death said there was no gunpowder residue on his hands, as would have been expected, and a locksmith who let Nisman's mother into the apartment told reporters that anyone could have opened the lock. Kirchner, who initially called Nisman's death a suicide, soon reversed her thinking and called it ""the suicide (that I am convinced) was not a suicide."" However, while Fernandez does not believe that Nisman took his own life, she still insists that his allegations against her government are false. Nisman was not a hack with an agenda against the President, but a naive investigator who was used by others who fed him false information, Fernandez said. Nisman's report promised to provide evidence ""of the existence of a sophisticated criminal plot, deliberately conjured to cover up and provide impunity to the Iranians accused in the investigation of the attack"" of the Jewish community center in 1994. The 289-page report makes its case based on tapped telephone conversations between representatives of Argentina and Iran. CNN's Michael Roa, Shasta Darlington and Margot Haddad contributed to this report.","Argentina's President proposes dissolving the Secretariat of Intelligence .

"The fishing industry is the backbone of Iceland's economy, but a row over quotas is threatening the country's application to join the European Union. It's a quarrel reminiscent of the Iceland Cod Wars of the 1950s and 1970s, but this time it's over mackerel. The country is at loggerheads with Ireland, Norway and EU members over how much mackerel it should be allowed to fish. According to scientific studies, mackerel colonies are increasingly migrating to Icelandic waters, which means these white, pelagic fish are now an integral part of the economy. President's tough decision . The devaluation of the Icelandic Krona in 2008 led to a boom in the export market, of which fishing accounts for 40%. Vilhjalmur Vilhjalmsson, CEO of HB Grandi, one of the country's largest fisheries, said his company caught 22,000 tonnes of mackerel last year, valued at $25 million. ""If I am going to name one thing that has saved us, or helped us, from the crisis it is mackerel,"" he told CNN. ""It is vital that we make an agreement about the stock, so we hope the nations will come to an agreement."" Read more MarketPlace Europe: Yacht sales slump . The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), an intergovernmental advisory and research organization, recommends a total number of mackerel allowed to be caught in order for fish stocks to remain sustainable. Of this total allowable catch the EU and Norway claim 90%, leaving Russia, Iceland and the Faroe Islands with just 10%.  Yet, Iceland continues to decide its share of the quota unilaterally at 16%. Fridirk Arngrimsson, the general manager of the Federation of Icelandic Fishing Vessels, says the quota Iceland calculates is based on science. ""The EU has simply to recognize and test the migration pattern of the mackerel,"" he said, ""there were more than 1.5 million tonnes of mackerel in the Icelandic zone this year, the task is simply to reach an agreement on fair share for everybody and that is not 10% for Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Russia.""

Ireland has called for the EU to impose sanctions against Iceland for over-fishing, and talks in September between Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the EU were inconclusive. The Minister of Fishing and Agriculture, Steingrimur Sigfusson, said the dispute has called into question whether Iceland wants to become an EU member. ""These negotiations have been delayed, partly because of disputes like the mackerel,"" he said.  ""It's becoming increasingly difficult to continue, and needless to say, sanctions or things like that, would be very detrimental to the atmosphere.""","The fishing industry is the backbone of Iceland's economy .

"(CNN)The story of his selfless act went viral, but for Raymond Burse it was simply second nature. ""I'm not extraordinary,"" said Burse. ""I've assumed that people do those kinds of things all the time."" In summer 2014, Burse, who is president of Kentucky State University, gave up $90,000 of his almost $350,000 salary so that 24 of the university's lowest paid workers could earn $10.25 an hour. The move gave them a 40% pay increase. ""I don't mind giving up some of what I have been able to obtain through life in order to be a small help to them in their own lives,"" Burse said. Burse's help didn't end there. The 63 year-old later surprised KSU football player Deshon Floyd with the remaining $2,000 he needed to do an internship abroad.  In December, Burse offered high school shooting victim Javaugntay Burroughs a full scholarship. ""With all the things they had to deal with, one of the things they shouldn't have to deal with is whether this young man was going to be able to go to college,"" said Burse. Burse's actions spurred a pay-it-forward movement around the university, with an increase in small acts of kindness and donations to the school. ""I was amazed at how many people got involved,"" said Burse. ""It really mushroomed, so it has not stopped. We are still talking about paying it forward."" Did you have an inspirational coach? Share your story . It is not often you meet a person who is ingrained with a giving spirit. Burse said he has his mother and father to thank for grooming him to be both a giver and an achiever. ""My mother was very active in the community. We didn't have much, but she would always share a part of what we had,""  Burse said. A country boy at heart, Burse grew up as the youngest of 13 children in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. ""There wasn't a lot of money to go around,"" said Burse. ""Going through that process I learned a lot about sacrificing, waiting your turn and being thankful for what you have."" Although his father attended school only through the third grade and his mother the seventh, Burse was a Rhodes Scholar, a graduate of Harvard Law School and a university president by age 30. ""What they believed was if their children got an education, the education would serve them well for their entire lives,"" said Burse. That education did indeed serve Burse well. After serving as Kentucky State University's president for eight years in the '80s, he went on to have a highly successful career with General Electric as vice president and general counsel of GE Consumer & Industrial. After working at GE, Burse didn't have plans to come out of retirement. ""We would say that for every year you work at GE it is like working eight years somewhere else, just in terms of what GE required and demanded of you,"" said Burse. Burse remembers going into his retirement ""happy, content and enjoying"" himself. But when KSU President Mary Evans Sias announced her retirement in May 2014, Burse immediately got a call about filling her seat. At first, he said he wasn't interested. ""I did that for three to four weeks and finally I went to lunch with a couple of my friends, a couple of them Kentucky State graduates,"" said Burse. ""They played the guilt card on me."" Burse discussed it with his wife for a few weeks, and then decided he could come back for at least a year to help the university stabilize. Burse came in expecting to be at KSU for a year, but he's now signed on to be there another three-plus years. ""I think we are all placed on this Earth to do something, to do something good,"" Burse said. ""I consider Raymond Burse to be an ordinary individual who works hard, who believes in people and in the power of people. If you give and work with people, good things will happen,"" he said.

"Two seconds. That's when Internet users start ditching online videos if they're not loading properly, according to a new study from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Akamai Technologies. By the 10-second mark, if the video still hasn't loaded, about 40% of Web users will have abandoned it, according to data presented in the study. On average, for every second that the video doesn't start playing after the two-second mark, there's a 5.8% increase in the rate at which the video viewers bail. The findings vary depending on the video. ""Viewers are less tolerant to startup delay for a short video such as a news clip than a long video such an hour-long TV episode,"" the authors say. But, in general, the findings seem to confirm a truism in the twitchy world of the Internet: Online users don't like to wait. ""The study ... contains no startling surprises -- most of us probably suspected that people give up on watching videos that don't load,"" Jeff John Roberts writes on the site GigaOm. ""But it does provide useful empirical evidence for companies who must decide how to invest architecture to support their video platforms."" Some technology bloggers were surprised people didn't click away from glitchy videos faster. And previous reports, including one from the New York Times, suggest Web users are even more impatient when it comes to text-based Web pages. The Times in February cited Harry Shum, from Microsoft, as saying that people will go to a website less frequently if it loads 250 milliseconds slower than a competitor's. As this graphic highlights, that's faster than the blink of an eye. ""Every millisecond matters,"" a Google engineer told the paper. The UMass-Amherst paper was based on data collected from 6.7 million unique video viewers over a 10-day period, according to the report. The test subjects played a total of 23 million video views. The study finds video quality has a potentially longtime impact on a website's popularity. A ""viewer who experienced failure"" is about 2% less likely to come back to that same site that week, compared to a person whose videos loaded smoothly. Finally, the video-loading game seems to be one of expectations. People who are trying to watch videos on a mobile phone are likely to be a bit more patient than those on desktop computers with high-speed connections. It's easy to see how that would be the case. Think back to the hee-hawing days of dial-up Internet and remember how long you used to wait for a single photo to load on a super-slow Internet connection. In part because of this, Dante D'Orazio writes for The Verge that efforts to make online video load faster and faster may amount to an ""unwinnable battle."" ""There may very well be a point when we'll no longer notice,"" he writes, ""but for now, it seems that you can never have enough speed."" Hate online wait times? Have thoughts on the report? Take two seconds and let us know what you think of all this in the comments section.","Study: Users begin to leave online video after two seconds if it doesn't load .

"(CNN)The winning machine that is Lindsey Vonn proved unstoppable again Sunday with rivals left trailing in the World Cup super-G at St Moritz. Vonn had disappointed in the downhill on the same slopes 24 hours earlier, but reasserted her dominance in the speed events with an emphatic victory. It extended the 30-year-old American's all-time record to 64 World Cup wins and she became the first woman to win a super-G at the famous Swiss resort on three occasions. Vonn only leveled with Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proll on 62 wins last weekend in Cortina d'Ampezzo, then watched by her boyfriend Tiger Woods, broke the record with a super-G success at the same venue. Her latest triumph repeats a feat she last achieved in December 2012 of back to back super-G wins. Vonn has returned to the World Cup circuit in superlative form after the injury woes which cost her the chance to compete in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and starting number 17 on Sunday produced a near-perfect run of one minute 23.55 seconds. Only second placed Anna Fenninger of Austria got within a second of Vonn, the Olympic champion in super-G finishing 0.24 seconds adrift. A second Austrian, Nicole Hosp, took third at 1.10 seconds slower. Home home Lara Gut, who won Saturday's downhill, crashed out in the netting, while overall World Cup leader Tina Maze of Slovenia again disappointed in 18th spot. It is completing perfect preparation for Vonn ahead of next month's world championships in Vail, Colarado. On the men's World Cup circuit., Sweden's Mattias Hargin claimed victory in the slalom at Kitzbuehel. He took full advantage of a mistake on the second leg by home favorite Marcel Hirscher, who was relegated to second after leading first time down. It was Hargin's maiden World Cup win, with last year's winner Felix Neureuther of Germany in third.","Lindsey Vonn wins World Cup super-G at St Moritz .

"Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Monday tried to douse a political firestorm over the deadly assault on a U.S. diplomatic mission in Libya, saying she's responsible for the security of American diplomatic outposts. ""I take responsibility,"" Clinton told CNN in an interview while on a visit to Peru. ""I'm in charge of the State Department's 60,000-plus people all over the world, 275 posts. The president and the vice president wouldn't be knowledgeable about specific decisions that are made by security professionals. They're the ones who weigh all of the threats and the risks and the needs and make a considered decision."" But she said an investigation now under way will ultimately determine what happened at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed on September 11. ""I take this very personally,"" Clinton said. ""So we're going to get to the bottom of it, and then we're going to do everything we can to work to prevent it from happening again, and then we're going to work to bring whoever did this to us to justice."" VP debate left unanswered national security questions . The attack took place in the eastern Libyan city that was the cradle of that country's 2011 revolution. Obama administration officials initially blamed a mob inflamed by a U.S.-produced movie that mocked Islam and its Prophet Mohammed, but later said the storming of the consulate appears to have been a terrorist attack. With criticism growing, Vice President Joe Biden said during last week's vice presidential debate that the White House did not know of requests to enhance security at Benghazi, contradicting testimony by State Department employees that requests had been made and rejected. After the debate, the White House said the vice president did not know of the requests because they were handled, as is the practice, by the State Department. Fact Check: Benghazi security . ""In the wake of an attack like this, in the fog of war, there's always going to be confusion,"" Clinton said. ""And I think it is absolutely fair to say that everyone had the same intelligence. Everyone who spoke tried to give the information that they had. As time has gone on, that information has changed. We've gotten more detail, but that's not surprising. That always happens."" She added, ""What I want to avoid is some kind of political gotcha or blame game."" ""I know that we're very close to an election,"" Clinton said. ""I want to just take a step back here and say from my own experience, we are at our best as Americans when we pull together. I've done that with Democratic presidents and Republican presidents."" Her remarks drew a quick response from three Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, including ranking member John McCain. Clinton's statement of responsibility was ""a laudable gesture, especially when the White House is trying to avoid any responsibility whatsoever,"" the Arizona senator said in a joint broadside with Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. However, they added, ""The security of Americans serving our nation everywhere in the world is ultimately the job of the commander-in-chief. The buck stops there."" Stevens, State Department computer expert Sean Smith and security contractors Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods died in the Benghazi assault, which State Department officials now say was the work of dozens of armed men. Clinton also described a desperate scene in the State Department during the hours of the attack, as staff tried to find out what had happened. ""This was a many-hour ordeal that we were all involved in, and I was deeply concerned as you would obviously assume, to hear about an attack,"" she said. Not only was the picture coming out of Libya murky, but also, ""Then we couldn't find Ambassador Stevens, and we were trying desperately to figure out what happened to him and to Sean Smith and to the others who were there."" Actress sues filmmaker . Clinton said her mission now is to make sure such an attack will never happen again, and also to ensure the work of American diplomats won't be stopped even in dangerous areas like Benghazi. ""We can't retreat. We have to continue to lead. We have to be engaged,"" she said. ""We can't hang out behind walls."" She said Stevens, who came to Benghazi on a cargo ship to start building ties with rebel leaders during last year's revolt, ""knew that more than anybody.""

"Veteran news producer and former NBC Universal chief Jeff Zucker will become the president of CNN Worldwide in January, the network announced Thursday. ""Jeff's experience as a news executive is unmatched for its breadth and success,"" said Phil Kent, chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting System, CNN's parent company. ""In a career that has seen significant professional success in both broadcast and cable, Jeff has demonstrated his ability to run multiple lines of business and fiercely defend journalists and journalism."" Zucker succeeds Jim Walton, who has headed CNN Worldwide since 2003. As president, Zucker will oversee 23 branded news and information businesses, including CNN's U.S. television network, CNN International, HLN and CNN Digital. The latter includes CNN.com, one of the world's leading news websites. ""I am thrilled to join the distinguished team of journalists across the worldwide platforms of CNN,""  Zucker said in a statement. ""The global reach and scale of the CNN brand is unparalleled in all of news. Outside of my family and the Miami Dolphins, there is nothing I am as passionate about as journalism."" His first challenge is likely to be turning around CNN/US television ratings, which have been declining in recent years. Zucker, who had most recently produced Katie Couric's new daytime talk show, had been widely rumored to be in line for the position. It's been that kind of whirlwind life for Zucker, who has had a rocket-like rise in the news and entertainment business. Zucker, who was born and raised in the Miami area, started his professional career as a researcher for NBC's Olympics operation in 1986. Within three years he was a producer for the ""Today"" show; three years after that, in 1992, he became its executive producer at age 26. He helped propel the morning show to the No. 1 position, which it consistently held through the rest of his tenure. In 2000 he was promoted to the head of NBC Entertainment -- essentially the network's programming chief -- and followed that with continued ascensions until becoming head of NBC Universal in 2007, overseeing the broadcast network including its news division and all its cable entities, such as MSNBC, CNBC and Bravo. Zucker had his struggles during his latter years at NBC, with the broadcast network falling into fourth place in the ratings and a much-publicized controversy over late-night programming involving Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno. Nevertheless, his news judgment and leadership made the ""Today"" show the most profitable show on television. Zucker's portfolio will include all CNN networks and digital properties. The original 24-hour news network, CNN has the greatest reach of any domestic news network. The CNN brand on television extends to 100 million households in the United States and 265 million households abroad, with significant online and mobile reach and a global newsgathering network with 45 locations.","Jeff Zucker to become new head of CNN Worldwide .

"(CNN)It's been called ""the sacred place where life begins."" Yet, until a surprising announcement from the Obama administration on Sunday, that's rarely what the public has heard about Alaska's highly politicized Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. We heard that it was full of oil. Or it wasn't. That it would create a bunch of jobs. Or it wouldn't. That it would solve the energy crisis. Or, you know, maybe not. A former U.S. rep actually said ""there's no wildlife"" there. But after decades of fighting over data and political talking points, the refuge -- also called ANWR -- started to emerge for me this week as an actual, living-breathing place. The shift came in how the White House announced that it would now treat the refuge as wilderness, which has infuriated Alaska Republicans since it could prevent oil and gas drilling on a contentious piece of land, at least for now. The administration asked Congress to give a disputed part of the refuge a wilderness designation. And the Interior Department released a new conservation plan that aims to protect the area. Instead of arguing the demerits of drilling, the White House basically turned the old Sarah Palin argument on its head. ""The Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge, one of the few remaining places in the country as pristine today as it was when the oldest Alaska Native communities first set eyes on it, is too precious to put at risk,"" John Podesta, a counselor to Obama, and Mike Boots, head of the Council on Environmental Quality, wrote at WhiteHouse.gov. ""By designating the area as wilderness, Congress could preserve the Coastal Plain in perpetuity -- ensuring that this wild, free, beautiful, and bountiful place remains in trust for Alaska Natives and for all Americans."" Instead of ""Drill baby, drill,"" it's ""protect, baby, protect."" Or maybe Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society, put it better: ""Some places are simply too special to drill,"" he said in a statement. That's a sorta new -- or at least very retro -- way of talking about the refuge, said Cindy Shogan, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League. The go-to arguments for environmentalists, she said, have concerned a lack of economic impact from drilling. ""The most compelling arguments are the ones we forget about using -- and that is the beauty and the special nature and the wildness of the place,"" she told me. ""It's not everybody's cup of tea, but the fact of the matter is it is unique. It truly is the last great wilderness. A lot of people like the idea that there's a place like that that's still left, and they want it to be left for future generations. ""It sounds corny, but it really is the last place we have left to do this."" It's a throwback to John Muir, the Sierra Club founder, who wrote, according to that group's website, that ""our bodies were made to thrive only in pure air, and the scenes in which pure air is found."" To underscore the rhetorical shift, the White House released a nature video about the refuge in which President Barack Obama says he hopes this ""amazing wonder can be preserved for future generations."" The administration is proposing that 12.3 million acres of the refuge be protected as wilderness. Now, about 7 million of the far-north Alaska refuge's 19.8 million acres are managed in that way. ""If Congress chooses to act, it would be the largest ever wilderness designation since Congress passed the visionary Wilderness Act over 50 years ago,"" the U.S. Department of Interior said in a news release. If the administration wanted to take this a step further, it could argue that the Arctic Refuge is not just threatened by oil and gas development in its backyard, but also by oil and gas development worldwide. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the Earth, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Already, substantial changes are being seen. ""(The Arctic and Antarctic) are kind of the canary in a coal mine of global warming,"" says Walt Meier, a research scientist with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in this video about climate change and the melting of the Arctic sea ice. Another scientist in the video says the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet. But back to the central argument here: I tend to get overwhelmed by sweeping generalizations about the grandness and wonderment of nature. I mean, how wonderful is it? Or in what way? Why should we all be happy it's there? So I asked Shogan, from the Alaska Wilderness League, to give me a little more detail about what's actually going on in this epic wilderness. What lives there, and why is it unique? She told me about the porcupine caribou, of course, which migrate along the Porcupine River and are somewhat analogous to the migratory animals of the Serengeti. That's a parallel that hadn't occurred to me before and really puts it in context. ""Like antlered gypsies, barren ground caribou are always on the move,"" the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says on its website. ""Exactly when and where they go is impossible to predict. Most herds, however, are drawn to a specific calving area. The 169,000 member Porcupine caribou herd has such a connection with the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge."" Shogan told me about the birds, such as the lesser yellow legs and the plovers, which migrate into the ""Lower 48."" She told me how this is ""the only place that all three kinds of bears hang out"" -- polar, black and grizzly. But the factoid that made me most love this refuge was also the strangest and most apocalyptic: There are so many mosquitoes in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the summer that they literally can swarm and kill large mammals, such as caribou. They get in their noses and jab their backs. It's so brutal, so panic-inducing, that the caribou retreat to the ocean. ""It's really awful, but that's the wilderness right? That's wildlife,"" she said. Well, at least it's wild. So much of the United States has been carved up by people -- from the farmers' plows on the Great Plains to the mountain-blasting miners in Appalachia -- that it's comforting to know this place is left. Bears, caribou -- and, yeah, mosquitoes. But maybe I'm too swept up in this. I'm curious what you think of the President's framing of the Arctic Refuge -- and his request that Congress protect it more permanently. Do those arguments convince you, especially at a time when oil and gas prices are low and when the United States is already, without ANWR, the top oil and natural gas producer in the world? Or do you agree with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who said called the move a ""stunning attack on our sovereignty and our ability to develop a strong economy that allows us, our children and our grandchildren to thrive."" Let me know in the comments or by writing me on Twitter. I'm @jdsutter.","The Obama administration asks Congress to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .

"For a week each spring, the heart of Internet culture relocates to Austin, Texas. And this year, one lucky Web startup will get some help making the move to the tech hotbed a permanent one. At this year's South by Southwest Interactive Festival, considered a sort of mashup of the Super Bowl and spring break for the tech elite, Austin startup accelerator Capital Factory is launching a contest to ""move your company to Austin."" Ten startups will be chosen to compete for the chance to relocate their business to the Texas capital. The winning company will receive a package of prizes worth around $100,000 donated by Austin area businesses. They include $15,000 for housing, $25,000 of venture capital investment, $24,000 worth of server hosting and $6,000 in moving expenses, a year's worth of free storage and even six months' worth of groceries. Capital Factory will provide free work space for six months. The contest is the brainchild of Josh Baer, managing director of Capital Factory.  He's been nicknamed the ""Austinpreneur"" for his efforts to to nurture Austin startups and attract new ones. ""The idea came from thinking about how to make the most of all the awesome entrepreneurs coming to Austin for South by Southwest and to capitalize on the large influx of people to Austin and Texas,"" he said. The South by Southwest Festival, which begins March 8, keeps getting bigger and Austin has benefited from its success. Previous festivals have served as a launching pad for companies like Twitter and Foursquare, and tech giants from around the world have taken notice. Over the past few years companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook have all opened offices in Austin. The five days of the interactive festival, which coincides with movie week and comes a week before the festival's trademark music showcase, attracts many of the biggest names and brightest minds in startups. This year over 25,000 people from all over the world are traveling to Austin for networking, demoing products, and to find out what's next in tech. Silicon Valley may have a larger tech scene,  but with a low cost of living, a business friendly tax code, and South by Southwest, Austin has become a serious player, advocates like Baer say. For Shawn Bose, Vice President of Global Business for uShip, the reason for Austin's rise is easy to define.

"11,466. That's Hawaii's magic number on Election Day. If voter turnout stayed exactly as it did in 2008 (impossible, I know, but hear me out) then 11,000-some new voters would push the Aloha State out of last place for voter participation. Watch out West Virginia, Hawaii is coming for you. If 11,466 more people voted in the presidential election in Hawaii, then the state's turnout rate would hit 50% of the eligible population, based on numbers compiled by George Mason University's Michael McDonald on a site called the United States Election Project. That would push Hawaii past West Virginia, which had a 49.9% turnout. That's a lot of numbers, I know. And there are plenty of caveats, since turnout obviously won't be the same as it was, thanks to Superstorm Sandy and a host of other factors. But my takeaway is this: Hawaii is really close. That's an attainable goal. For the past few weeks, I've been working on a new CNN project called Change the List that's focused, at the moment, on boosting Hawaii's lowest-of-the-low voter turnout rate. It's not that I don't love West Virginia and the other 49 states, too, but I'm also a sucker for an underdog story. When it comes to voting, Hawaii's story is just that. Shortly after statehood in 1959, more than 90% of the state's eligible voters cast ballots. In 2008, with Hawaii's own Barack Obama on the ticket, fewer than half of eligible people voted. When I traveled to the Aloha State to talk to nonvoters, I met people who didn't know the election was coming up in November, those who feel like their votes don't matter because they're so far (in distance and psychology) from ""the mainland,"" and those who don't want to participate in a political system that values conflict over compromise. I can't help but think that our national politics -- bogged down in money and aggression -- could use a healthy dose of the Aloha Vote. Hawaii's voice should finally be heard. Here are a few reasons for optimism on this front: . 1. Kanu Hawaii: This volunteer group, whose name means ""to plant"" in Hawaiian, has been working this year to register new voters and engage communities that typically have been left out of the political conversation. As of last month, the group had registered 2,397 new voters and knocked on 789 doors asking people to vote. If all of those new registered voters actually go to the polls (if that's you, do it!) then the contest is already 20% taken care of, thanks to the work of 40 Kanu volunteers. 2. Close races and big issues: It's a generally held belief in the world of voter-turnout-ology that competitive elections tend to drive up turnout. Nationally, the presidential election could hardly be closer -- and the candidates are as different as Gaga and Taylor. But it's the local and state races that will really push people to the polls in Hawaii. Ask just about anyone on Oahu what his or her top political issue is and they'll likely say one word: ""rail."" A commuter-rail project has become the divisive topic of the Honolulu mayor's race, and both sides are quite polarized. A Civil Beat poll shows the race is very much up for grabs, with Ben Cayetano, the anti-rail candidate, leading Kirk Caldwell 50% to 45%. ""A lot of it is going to come down to turnout,"" a pollster told the news site. 3. The surf: Before I left for Hawaii, a state representative, Angus McKelvey, gave one very Hawaii-specific reason for the state's low turnout: surf. When the surf's up, he said, people won't go to the polls. The theory is a little wacky, of course, but even if it's true, there will be better surf in Hawaii on Monday than Tuesday, Election Day, said Gary Kewley, ""chief surfing officer"" of the Surf News Network. ""Most people only surf on average for an hour and a half to 2 1/2 hours,"" he told me by phone. ""That leaves plenty of time to go to the voting booth."" Waves on Monday are expected to crest at 15 feet. Tuesday, they'll still be big, but more in the 8-foot range. By the way, Kewley votes. 4. The conversation: Take this with a grain of salt, but it seems from where I'm sitting (far-far away, in Atlanta) that lots of people in Hawaii are talking about voting this year. Maybe it's the people I chat with, like Nani Teruya, in Maui, who told me that her phone has been ringing off the hook (she described this phenomenon as the phone having ""diarrhea"") since she was featured on CNN.com as one of six nonvoters in Hawaii. And then there's the news coverage. TV stations and newspapers in Hawaii have been talking about Hawaii's low level of voter participation in recent weeks. All of this chatter has to help raise awareness about an important election. On my trip, I learned that one reason people don't vote is that they've never been asked to participate. I hope the state of Hawaii feels a collective plea from those of us on the mainland to vote this year. Of course, none of this is up to me. It's up to people in Hawaii to go to the polls -- even if they never have before. If everyone in the state encouraged a few of their friends to vote, the list certainly would be changed. Just look at what Kanu has done with only 40 volunteers. If you want to help keep the conversation going, here are two small things you can do: Share this ""Mahalo for Voting"" image on Facebook or Tumblr and do the same with this ""11,466"" image. It's a small thing, sure, but a reminder that this goal is in reach.","Based on 2008 numbers, Hawaii needs 11,466 new voters to jump out of last place .

"The Winter Olympics' motto was ""​Hot. Cool. Yours."" From eye-popping helmet designs to Formula One-influenced bobsleigh, the Sochi 2014 Games offered a bewildering array of technological innovation as well as some seriously ""pimped up"" athlete equipment. As well as the funky headgear, who could forget the Norwegian curling team's pants, which were reminiscent of an abstract Mondrian painting? Bobsleigh was in the vanguard of exploring new technological improvements, with a number of teams hooking up with leading F1 marques or car manufacturers. While the Italian National Olympic Committee worked with Ferrari, the U.S. two-men bobsleigh team benefited from its collaboration with BMW. The result? The first American two-man bobsleigh medal in 62 years. The U.S. speed skating team had less luck with its Mach 39 Under Armour suits, leaving the Winter Olympics without a medal for the first time since 1984. Despite the criticism of the team's suits, last week U.S. Speed Skating renewed its partnership with Under Armour for another eight years. ""Look, we got beat up a little bit last week and speed skating is obviously getting beaten up,"" Under Armour chief executive Kevin Plank told CBS' ""This Morning"" show. ""So what we don't do is we don't retreat. We dust ourselves up and we come back bigger, better and stronger than we ever were before.""

"London (CNN)A UK public inquiry into the 2006 death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko opened Tuesday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, after years of wrangling over what evidence can be heard. In a deathbed statement, Litvinenko blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for ordering his poisoning by tea at a London hotel. The Kremlin has always strongly denied the accusation. Sir Robert Owen, who's chairman of the inquiry, said Tuesday that sensitive material relating to possible Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death would be heard behind closed doors. The British government initially rejected requests to hold a public inquiry, but the decision was reversed last summer after Litvinenko's widow, Marina Litvinenko, challenged it in court. She argued that a public inquiry would enable the fullest possible investigation. An inquest -- a coroner-led investigation that is held as a matter of course in the case of unnatural deaths in England -- had been opened after her husband's death. But unlike a public inquiry, it cannot hear evidence behind closed doors. In Alexander Litvinenko's case, such evidence could involve matters of national security. ""The issues to which his death gives rise are of the utmost gravity and have attracted worldwide interest and concern,"" Owen said. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent and fierce critic of Putin, came to Britain in 2000 after turning whistle-blower on the FSB, the KGB's successor. He died at a London hospital on November 23, 2006, after being poisoned by the radioactive material polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square. UK prosecutors have asked for the extradition of two men, Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun, from Russia in connection with Litvinenko's murder. But Moscow has refused, saying Russia's constitution does not allow the extradition of Russian citizens. Both men deny involvement in Litvinenko's death. Owen said that Lugovoi and Kovtun had been invited to give evidence to the inquiry by video link from Russia and that he hoped they would do so. The public inquiry will look at possible Russian state involvement in Litvinenko's death. However, it will not address the question as to whether the UK government could, or should, have taken steps to prevent the murder. Litvinenko is said by his widow to have been a British agent, with a handler at MI6, Britain's foreign security service. In 2012, the counsel to the inquest, Hugh Davies, said evidence provided by the UK government showed Russian involvement and ""does establish a prima facie case as to the culpability of the Russian state in the death of Alexander Litvinenko."" The inquest has been put on hold while the public inquiry is held. Owen, the coroner in the inquest, said the open hearings in the inquiry should conclude before Easter; that is, early April. More than 70 witnesses are due to be called over the coming weeks, including family and friends of Litvinenko, those who worked with him before his death, medical staff who treated him after he fell ill and the pathologists who conducted his autopsy, the court heard. The pathologists will testify Wednesday on the postmortem results. The presence of radiation in Litvinenko's body complicated the autopsy, the inquiry heard. A nuclear scientist will also give evidence Wednesday about polonium-210, its qualities, where it can be found and what effect it has on the body once ingested. In the course of the inquiry, evidence may also deal with the contamination risk posed to the wider public by the transfer of such highly radioactive material. Owen said polonium could have been used to ""kill large numbers of people or spread general panic and hysteria among the public.""","A public inquiry into the former KGB agent's poisoning death opens in London .

"(CNN)Rafael Nadal firmly put to rest fears over his form and fitness with a straight sets demolition of big-serving South African Kevin Anderson Sunday to reach the Australian Open quarterfinals. Nadal came into the opening grand slam of the season short of match practice and survived an almighty scare when sick on court and taken to five sets by American Tim Smyczek in the second round. But with each passing match, the world number three looks to be building momentum. He took just over two hours to see off 15th-ranked Anderson 7-5 6-1 6-4 on the Rod Laver Arena. The Spaniard oozed confidence after his victory as he bids for his second Australian Open title. ""After a tough period of time for me it's a fantastic result and I'm very happy with the way I played today,"" he said in his courtside interview. ""It was probably my best match here this year so that's very important for me and very special."" Nadal, beaten by Stanislas Wawrinka in a dramatic final in Melbourne last year, will face Czech seventh seed Tomas Berdych in the last eight. Berdych will doubtless prove a dangerous opponent and showed his intentions with a straight sets victory over Australian hope Bernard Tomic in their last 16 clash Sunday, but he has a 3-18 career record against Nadal. The route to the final in that half of the draw has been eased by the upset exit of second seed Roger Federer to Andreas Seppi of Italy Friday. Seppi looked set to build on those heroics when he took a two-set lead against the poster boy of the championships, 19-year-old Nick Krygios, but the Australian teenager was made of sterner stuff. He fought back to level -- saving a match point in the fourth set-- and amid a mounting frenzy on the Hisense Arena took the deciding set 8-6 after over three and a half hours of riveting action. The 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6 8-6 victory earned him a quarterfinal against two-time grand slam champion Andy Murray. The British star's match with Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov on the Rod Laver Arena was briefly interrupted by fans cheering Krygios' victory and there is a sure to be a partisan following for Tuesday's intriguing clash with a semifinal berth at stake. Murray had to dig deep to avenge his Wimbledon defeat last year to Dimitrov, rallying from 2-5 down in the fourth set before closing out a 6-4 6-7 6-3 7-5 victory. In the women's singles, Maria Sharapova and Eugenie Bouchard set up their eagerly-awaited quarterfinal clash with contrasting victories Sunday. Second seed Sharapova was rarely troubled in dispatching 21st seed Peng Shuai of China, 6-3 6-0, while Canadian Bouchard struggled to defeat Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania 6-1 5-7 6-2. Bouchard, who has had to cope with increased media attention after the ""Twirlgate"" controversy, lost concentration to drop the second set, but was impressive in the opener and the decider. She has never beaten Sharapova, one of her inspirations but came close in the semifinals of last year's French Open. Five-time grand slam winner Sharapova conceded as much when asked to reflect on the upcoming clash Tuesday. ""It was a really tough three setter. She's been playing incredibly well -- confident aggressive tennis. I have a tough match ahead of me,"" she said. Third seed Simona Halep of Romania later joined them in the last eight, battling past Belgian Yanina Wickmayer 6-4 6-2 to earn a match with Russian 10th seed Ekaterina Makarova.","Rafael Nadal into quarterfinals of Australian Open .

"When Typhoon Rammasun swept through the South China Sea in July, a tiny ship was trapped in its path. The deadly storm whipped up waves over 10 meters high and winds approaching 200 miles per hour. Any regular boat would have been smashed to pieces, but this craft just a few feet long sailed through without pausing in its work. The Wave Glider is an ocean drone developed by Californian start-up Liquid Robotics. It had been collecting environmental information when the storm hit, and continued throughout the encounter to compile a unique dataset of the conditions created by Rammasun. The craft's instruments recorded the speed and movement of waves, current and wind from the epicenter, the first such measurements from such a powerful storm, which are now available for scientists to use in the development of warning systems. The Glider consists of two parts: a surfboard-like shell that floats along the surface, bearing a row of solar panels that power the craft. This is connected by cable to the sophisticated measuring tools that float five meters below, protected from the fiercest elements, propelled by wave-powered wings that also serve as an anchor to make it almost indestructible. ""We can put them in places where humans would not be happy to go ... there is huge potential to save lives and prevent damage,"" said Graham Hine, co-founder of Liquid Robotics. ""It's pretty clear that we can forecast the direction of a hurricane, the intensity, and better understand the original formation of storms."" Read this: Robot furniture builds itself . Beyond averting disasters, the drone is being used on missions to break new water in understanding the 95% of the world's oceans that remain unexplored. Wave Gliders are measuring acidification levels and environmental damage, and monitoring wildlife to aid conservation efforts. They are searching for new sources of fuel, chemicals and medicines, and providing security against mines and other hazards. Hine believes the drone has already transformed exploration and foresees rapid progress. ""The more you use the more efficient they are because if you launch 50 you only use one ship -- which is the bulk of expense,"" he says. ""It's a paradigm shift toward using large fleets for wider coverage and research. And the (sensor) technology gets better the more you use it."" The fleet is expanding steadily -- this summer saw the largest set of Gliders yet probing the Arctic ice to chart the effects of warming as well as to search for hydrocarbons. Such capabilities have earned the company a growing list of conservation, fuel and military clients. The current SV3 model is being upgraded to improve power storage, reliability and the sophistication of its algorithm, but experts believe the systems are already mature. ""In the last 20 years these platforms gone from experimental one-offs to workhorses,"" says Chris Roman, professor of oceanography at University of Rhode Island, who uses drones in research on oil spills. ""We can't afford to go everywhere in manned submarines so these offer a greater range -- if submarines are like searching with a microscope, these are like satellites."" Read this: Electronic nose sniffs out cancer . The Wave Glider is ""an important arrow in the quiver,"" says Roman, as it offers valuable insights within its field but limited to the surface region. He would like to see its work combined with that of crafts such as the Nereus, the deepest ranging autonomous vessel, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), one of which was lost in May in the Kermadec Trench 10,000 meters deep. The fastest-growing applications in the field have been military and fuel, but Roman believes there are greater prizes on offer. ""The important things are to measure CO2 levels and acidification, the major indicators of the state of the ocean,"" he says. ""This is a huge question and the more observation we have in different parts of the ocean greatly improves our ability to measure it."" Looking ahead, Liquid Robotics is opening up its platforms to research institutions to develop new and improved sensors to create new fields of investigation. A more ambitious vision is to build on communication -- between drone and command center, but also between swarms of drones working together. Beyond this, innovators in this field are seeking another level of information that combines the research of drones on the surface with drones on the sea bed, aerial drones and satellites in space. It has taken humanity until now to explore 5% of the world's oceans, but in the unmanned era we are making up for lost time. Read this: Robot furniture builds itself .

"McKenna Pope's 4-year-old brother wanted an Easy-Bake oven for months and she was more than happy to get it for him. She wants him to know it's OK for boys to enjoy baking cookies. But she's worried that toy makers are sending boys a different message. The 13-year-old reached this conclusion last week during a shopping trip with her parents. They searched the shelves for an Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven and found pink and purple boxes that show only girls using the kid-friendly appliance. They decided not to buy it because they thought the packaging would make him feel like he was playing with a ""girl's toy"" he wouldn't want. Still, McKenna decided to take it up as a cause and launched a petition asking Hasbro to feature boys in the packaging of Easy-Bake Ultimate Ovens. ""I feel that this sends a clear message: women cook, men work,"" Pope wrote in her Change.org petition, which has earned more than 30,000 signatures since it went up Friday night. ""I want my brother to know that it's not 'wrong' for him to want to be a chef, that it's okay to go against what society believes to be appropriate."" With more people shopping for children's toys during the holiday season, McKenna and others are reviving debate over the effects of gender-biased toy marketing in a year that has seen intense discussion on the issue and even some progress. It's easier for girls to play across gender lines, said McKenna, who spoke from experience. When she played with Nerf guns, people called her a tomboy, at worst, she said. But she has seen male classmates endure harsher name-calling for playing with dolls. ""I'm sure there are a lot of kids out there like my brother who want Easy-Bake ovens but don't ask for them because they're told they're not supposed to want them,"" she said. ""There's a lot toys specifically marketed towards boys and girls, but guys need to learn to cook and take care of children, too."" Hasbro did not respond to a request for comment. Not everyone believes children should play across gender lines. In a previous CNN story on the topic, some commenters said that allowing children boys to play with dolls or other toys typically associated with girls could make them targets of bullies. Others suggested that some color-coded marketing works and that selling pink LEGO or science kits packaged in purple attracts girls to toys that they might shy away from otherwise. Toys come in different colors based on feedback from consumers and retailers, said a spokeswoman for the Toy Industry Association, a non-profit trade association that represents businesses involved in the creation and marketing of toys. ""Toy companies are basically businesses that respond to consumer requests,"" spokeswoman Adrienne Appell said. ""If there's a market to explore, a company is going to want to put their marketing efforts behind products that families are going to buy."" Comments on the petition echoed McKenna's views about how the packaging and marketing might enforce gender stereotypes. Some parents, including men, agreed with her statement that boys benefit from playing with kid-friendly appliances and other toys typically associated with girls. ""I loved my Easy-Bake oven when I was a boy and I love cooking today. All boys should have access to the kitchen. And it's never too early to let them have that access,"" one commenter wrote. ""This goes for craft kits, too! My son (also loves cooking), has shown an interest in sewing, yet the kits out there are all geared toward girls. Cooking and sewing are basic life skills that all our children should learn ... especially when they show an interest,"" another commenter wrote. Activists are heartened that a teen is speaking up on behalf of a sibling, rather than the usual advocates and opinion writers. McKenna's voice lends credibility to the argument that traditional gender stereotypes are losing relevance among her generation, said Deborah Tolman, co-founder of SPARK, a nonprofit group that trains teens and young women to be media activists. ""People really listen when it comes from a young person or the actual consumer. It's different from adults making arguments in sophisticated words,"" Tolman said. ""How can you ignore young people when they say they don't like what you're selling them and they want choices? It's pretty much a win-win situation for the advertiser and the consumer."" It's an issue close to SPARK, whose teen activists have orchestrated several campaigns in the past year to raise awareness of portrayals of women in media and popular culture. Last November, they launched a petition over LEGO's busty, pinkwashed ""Friends"" line asking the company to return to its gender-neutral approach to marketing. SPARK's efforts continued in 2012 by pressuring Seventeen and Teen Vogue to stop photoshopping models. The fact that McKenna did it on her own -- as she and her mother claim -- shows that people her age are capable of scrutinizing media messages, said Dana Edell, executive director of SPARK. ""It matters most when it comes from them because they're the future leaders of the world who will be making decisions about marketing and advertising,"" Edell said. ""So many people like to say, 'Who cares? Girls will always play with dolls and boys will always play with trucks and it doesn't matter.' So, it's encouraging to see someone who's not an adult stand up and say 'Wait a minute, actually, it does matter.' "" Toy marketing saw a shift this year when British store Harrod's re-opened its toy department organized by themes rather than gender. More recently, Sweden's Top-Toy Group, a licensee of the Toys ""R"" Us brand, published a catalog featuring a girl aiming a toy gun and a boy styling hair with beauty accessories. The gender-blind catalog prompted Carolyn Danckaert to start her own Change.org petition asking Toys ""R"" Us to follow suit in its catalogs and marketing materials in the United States. The company did not respond to a request for comment. ""People are recognizing that the divisions being created aren't necessary and it just makes more sense to be sorting toys thematically rather than by gender,"" said Danckaert, founder of ""A Mighty Girl,"" an online marketplace for books and movies that feature females as main characters. ""We hear from parents all the time who see the value in allowing boys to play with baby dolls,"" she said. ""A lot of people believe that it's desirable to encourage boys to become nurturers and develop the whole child, from analytical skills to the ability to empathize."" Since launching the petition, McKenna said she has learned a bit about scrutinizing ads. ""Now, whenever I see a toy commercial, I feel my mind automatically shooting to: 'Why are they marketing it this way?' "" she said. ""I can't help it. I wonder who this is being marketing to -- should they do it in a different way?""

"A 90-year-old former Nazi lost a crucial legal battle to stay in the United States when a federal appeals court unanimously rejected his appeal. John (Ivan) Kalymon sought to overturn a lower court ruling that ordered him removed from the country. His lawyers still have a long-shot chance to win a rehearing or a Supreme Court hearing, but government sources said officials think Kalymon's hopes of remaining in the United States are slim. Kalymon, a resident of Michigan,  was ordered removed by a Detroit judge in January, 2011. The court found that as a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police in German-occupied Lviv, Ukraine, he had rounded up and shot Jews. He served voluntarily as an armed member of a pro-Nazi police unit, U.S. officials said. A U.S. government source said the biggest problem the United States faces is finding a European country willing to take Kalymon. U.S. sources confirmed European newspaper accounts that Kalymon is under investigation by a unit of the German police, which could eventually lead to him being taken into German custody. The number of aging former Nazis being prosecuted by the United States is dwindling. Kalymon is one of only four remaining targets of Justice Department Nazi hunters.

"Maurice Herzog, a celebrated French mountaineer who was the first person to reach the top of an 8,000-meter peak, died early Friday in France, the French presidential palace announced. He was 93. Herzog and fellow climber Louis Lachenal arrived at the summit of the 8,091-meter (26,545-foot) Annapurna in the Himalayas in June 1950. They did not use oxygen masks during their ascent. In his best-selling book ""Annapurna,"" Herzog gives a painful account of the difficult descent, which cost him and Lachenal several fingers and toes due to frostbite. But without this expedition, Herzog said, ""I would not have had the life I had after."" Back in France, Herzog, who had taken part in the resistance during the Second World War, turned his attention to politics. Under President Charles de Gaulle, Herzog became the French minister for youth and sport in 1958, and he served a mayor of Chamonix from 1966 to 1977. Herzog's legendary status was marred in 1996 by the second publication of Lachenal's ""Vertigo Notebook,"" which included sections omitted in the from 1956 version. The book challenged Herzog's version of events and he was criticized for stealing the glory and ignoring the fact that the ascent had truly been a team effort. Reaction to Herzog's death poured in from veteran mountaineers and high-powered politicians. ""He was a very complex character who was undeniably charismatic, and a number of gray areas will remain over his mountaineering career,"" Denis Crabieres, head of the French Mountain Guides Association, said in an interview with CNN affiliate BFMTV. ""He was a great mountaineer, beyond all controversy, who was able to reinvent himself and succeed in public action,"" former French Foreign Minister Michel Barnier told French radio RTL. French President Francois Hollande issued a statement expressing his condolences to Herzog's family, and added that the climb was an ""exploit that will remain in our collective memory.""","Maurice Herzog and a fellow climber reached the top of Annapurna in 1950 .

"Hawaii tied West Virginia for 49th place in voter turnout in the November election -- and I'm pretty pumped about it. That may seem like a strange thing to be excited about, or even to know about, but hear me out on this: Since September, I've been writing about Hawaii's lowest-of-the-low voter turnout rate for a new CNN project called Change the List. The goal, as the project name spells out in even-Ke$ha-can-understand terms (sorry, Ke$ha, I'm sure you're smart, but that dollar sign ...), was to bump Hawaii off the bottom of that list. And I wanted to do that with your help. Dozens -- probably hundreds -- of you responded, making online pledges to vote for the first time and sending sometimes-pestering, sometimes-sweet messages to six nonvoters in Hawaii whose stories we highlighted on this website. Change the List: 47 of your pro-voting arguments . In the end, both Hawaii and West Virginia registered turnout rates of 44.2%*, according to Michael McDonald, an associate professor at George Mason University who runs a site called the United States Election Project. Both states -- and many others -- saw a decline in turnout from the 2008 election. Nationwide, turnout dropped by about 3%, McDonald said by phone. (It's impossible to be more precise because several states still haven't submitted their certified turnout numbers; blame funding and mail-in ballots for that, he said.) Hawaii's turnout dropped 4.6%, by comparison. That sounds like bad news. And, in some respects, it is. The situation at some polling places didn't make it easy to vote. More than two dozen of them on the island of Oahu alone ran out of ballots on Election Day. A polling place volunteer at one elementary school told me he had to start handing out Japanese-language ballots to English speakers just to keep the line moving. The state should institute same-day voter registration and other reforms that would encourage new voters to go to the polls. But if the goal of this project was for Hawaii not to be ranked 50th out of 50 states, then a tie for 49th has to be seen as some sort of victory. If nothing else, it's a step in the right direction. Plus, your participation in this effort resulted in several unequivocal successes. My favorite: A single message from a Facebook fan of CNN iReport persuaded Michael Remen, a sous-chef in Hilo, Hawaii, to vote. He told me he wouldn't have cast a ballot otherwise. Here's the note that did the trick: ""Send him a free ticket to Arlington Cemetery and (show) him how many reasons there are to vote, since all those there died for that right, here and abroad."" Three of the six nonvoters we featured decided to vote because of your messages. Of course, six people won't move the needle on a state's voter turnout rate, but those three people's voices were heard by their government when they otherwise wouldn't have been. CNN, of course, can't take credit for the people who woke up in Hawaii, way out in the middle of the Pacific, on November 6 and decided to vote. This project received ample coverage in local news, and for that I'm very grateful to websites like Civil Beat and TV stations like KITV for spreading the word about Hawaii's low voter turnout rate. But voting ultimately is an intensely personal act. The people who really can improve Hawaii's voting record are those who live in Hawaii and who want to make a difference. They're people like Elle Cochran, who never voted until an issue moved her so much that she decided to run for office. She now is a county councilwoman in Maui. And they're people like Joe Heaukulani, who goes door to door on Oahu trying to persuade people to vote -- for any candidate, regardless of political party. There are people like that in every state, working to make the U.S. government more accountable to all of its people. Progress may be slow, but thinking back on this project I'm reminded of something Heaukulani said while I was canvassing with him. ""Even if you convince one person,"" he said, ""that means you did make a difference."" Thanks to all of you who were a part of that difference. We'll do it again soon. *Data nerd note: The voter turnout rates are rounded to one decimal place because of a margin of error associated with voting-eligible population data and with prison population estimates, McDonald said.

"The Republican congressman and Democratic senator charged with hashing out a federal budget deal are ""closer"" to an agreement but not there yet, according to senior aides in both parties. A senior Democratic aide told CNN that House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chairwoman Patty Murray met Wednesday afternoon and are narrowing down the issues in a potential spending deal. The two lawmakers are the primary negotiators for, and leaders of, a budget conference committee that has a week and a half to come up with an agreement on spending levels. The talks are especially important because the bill funding government now runs out in mid-January at nearly the same time as another round of forced budget cuts is due to hit. If Murray and Ryan can agree on spending levels and whether to roll back some of the budget cuts, that would settle the most contentious issues in the January spending debate and essentially pave a shutdown-free road to the next funding bill. The two sides have a nearly $100 billion gap to bridge. Entering the talks, Republicans had pushed for an annual spending level of $967 billion, while Democrats set their level at $1.058 billion. Lawmakers pass more blame than bills in do-nothing Congress .","The bill funding government now runs out in mid-January .

"Eric Tyler is Research Fellow with New America Foundation, a non-profit U.S. think tank, based in Washington DC. He is currently at sea. Hilo, Hawaii What happens when you mix 11 budding startups with Google executives, Stanford professors, a Nobel Peace Laureate and 600 college students and put them on a ship to circumnavigate the world? An experiment launched this month called Unreasonable at Sea hopes that this eclectic group will unleash global entrepreneurship. A 590-foot ocean liner has become the incubator for this experiment, attracting aboard both multinational companies and international foundations, venture capitalists and environmental philanthropists, even a Saudi Arabian prince and the founder of WordPress. All want to take part in fostering the entrepreneurial efforts of those on the ship. From Hawaii, the program will visit a range of developed markets from Japan to Spain as well as developing markets from Burma (also known as Myanmar) to Ghana. This allows for a crucial opportunity to not just tweak business models but more importantly test products in local contexts. For many of the founders, who come from countries around the world, this is their first voyage on a ship. As such, seasickness on the choppy waters of the Pacific has been a recurring struggle, but it has not deterred the entrepreneurs from diving head first into the business workshops, one-on-one meetings and pitch events. The program is spearheaded by Stanford University's Institute of Design and the Unreasonable Institute, which has teamed up with Semester at Sea to embark on a 105-day journey to 13 countries around the world. It also has financial support from backers including Microsoft and SAP. At its core, the program believes in creating a melting pot of individuals with different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives while also maintaining a context of openness that doesn't shy away from experimentation and failure. And it's no surprise to hear lunch conversations focused on intellectual property challenges in China and supply chain strategies for Sub-Saharan Africa. When I boarded the ship, the co-founder of the program, Daniel Epstein, explained to me the unique criteria he sought for the chosen entrepreneurs. ""We are not looking for typical Silicon Valley startups,"" he said. ""We are hedging our bets on the black swans: startups who are leveraging technology to solve seemingly intractable social and environment challenges and who are positioned within billion dollar market opportunities. We hand selected these ventures from nearly 1,000 applications coming from just shy of 100 countries."" The handful of participating startups could be from a technocrat's dream with products ranging from a tablet teacher training software to a solar-powered cooking stove. They are also geographically diverse with founders joining from China, Botswana, Spain, India, and Mexico, among other destinations. George Kembel, the co-founder of Stanford's d.school, also leads the seaboard program. He told me: ""We find ourselves at a time in which we're shifting from a most industrialized era to a new era. And almost all of the institutions that were built on that last model that got us this far aren't really adapted for carrying us much farther."" After an orientation session on the deck, I spoke with Deepak Ravindran, founder and CEO of Innoz, one of the more developed companies participating in the program. His idea began when he noticed that his friends in his Indian home state of Kerala didn't have access to internet, but they all had mobile phones. So in 2009, Ravindran and three classmates dropped out of college to focus on bridging this information gap through the development of a text message-based search engine. Currently, the company has 120 million users and receives five million text message queries a day. And he says this is only the beginning. ""There are a lot of dumb phones in the world, and what I want is to make every dumb phone smart with information. Maybe because of this chance to visit 14 countries, we can see whether we can launch at scale."" In the end, Unreasonable at Sea is moving into uncharted waters, and to a large degree, nobody on the ship knows exactly what the end result of this bold experiment will be. But despite this ambiguity, there is sense that this social alchemy might very well lead to innovation.","Execs, academics and students set sail on a global business enterprise .

"Three Kurdish women political activists were found dead with gunshots to the head early Thursday, police in Paris said, in an unexplained act of violence that has shocked the Kurdish community. CNN's Ivan Watson explains what the impact of the killings is likely to be, and how the conflict between Kurdish nationalists and Turkey affects the rest of the world. Q) What are the possible consequences of the killings? A) A spokesman for the leadership of the PKK and its affiliate the KCK in Northern Iraq, Roj Welat has confirmed to CNN that one of the women killed, Sakine Cansiz, was one of the founding members of the PKK. He called the murders an ""ideological and political assassination, a terror attack against the Kurdish people."" These murders have clearly dropped a bombshell on the tightly-knit Kurdish community in France and probably throughout the substantial Kurdish diaspora in Europe. We can certainly expect protests and memorial demonstrations in Europe. And the murders in Paris are already having ripple effects all the way over here in Turkey, where the Kurds make up the country's largest [and historically oppressed] ethnic minority. Kurdish leaders in Turkey are calling for Kurds to ""rise in protest wherever they are to condemn this massacre."" A huge concern is what impact the killings might have on a new historic round of talks between the Turkish government and the jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, as well as other figures in the Kurdish movement. Many Turkish commentators fear it may derail these negotiations. Aliza Marcus, author of ""Blood and Belief: The PKK and the Kurdish fight for Independence,"" an inluential book on the PKK, wrote to me in an email, saying: ""One thing is for sure, this isn't good for the rumored peace process."" Q) Is it possible to speculate about who might have done it, and why now? A) There is much speculation already about who might have carried out these murders. Kurdish groups and Turkish commentators are already interpreting this as a politically-motivated act of violence, even though it will certainly take some time for investigators to conclude who carried out the shootings. There are extremists on both sides of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict who may seek to derail the negotiation process that has been under way for more than a month between the Turkish government and Ocalan, as well as other figures in the Kurdish movement. Huseyin Celik, the spokesman for Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party, already told journalists that ""when you look at how it was carried out, it seems like an internal settling of scores within the PKK."" Certainly, the PKK has a history of killing dissidents within the Kurdish movement, says Hugh Pope, senior Turkey analyst for the International Crisis Group. He told me: ""You do have to remember that the PKK has a long history of killing its own people."" Meanwhile, the Turkish state has long relied on military force, arrests and law suits to crush the Kurdish movement inside Turkey. The Turkish-PKK war is one of the longest-running conflicts in the Middle East, with more than 40,000 people killed since the 1980s. Many Kurds view the Turkish government and armed forces as mortal enemies, while many Turks label the PKK and anyone affiliated with the PKK as ""terrorists."" So certainly I can expect some Kurds will accuse Turks of assassinating these three women, even if there is no evidence to back up that claim. Q) Who are the PKK and what are they fighting for? A) The PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, was founded in 1978 in Turkey as a Marxist, pan-Kurdish nationalist movement. In 1984, it started armed combat against the Turkish state with the goal of establishing a broader Kurdistan in the Middle East, which would unite Kurdish minorities divided between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. That goal has been largely dropped over the last decade -- certainly since Turkish authorities arrested Ocalan in 1999. Now the PKK appears to have much more limited goals: battling for Kurdish ""cultural freedoms"" in Turkey as well as some degree of autonomy for the Kurds, who are predominantly settled in south-eastern Turkey. There are PKK fighters battling Turkish security forces in the hills of south-eastern Turkey, as well as camps and training bases strung out along remote mountains in northern Iraq, along the border with Turkey. The PKK enjoys substantial support and reportedly relies on fund-raising from within the Kurdish diaspora in Europe. Finally, given the pro-PKK demonstrations I've covered, there is support for the PKK in Istanbul, which is not only Turkey's most populous city, but also the largest Kurdish city in the world. Why? Because hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled the war and punitive Turkish military operations in south-eastern Turkey in the 1990s and were forced to resettle in western Turkish cities. The PKK has been officially labeled a terrorist organization by Turkey, as well as the US and many european countries. Q) How many expat Kurds live in European cities? Where are most based? A) Europe is home to a substantial Kurdish diaspora, with large communities in France, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium. According to a report from the International Crisis Group, there are 1 to 1.5 million Kurds originating from Turkey living in Europe; the bulk of them, with an estimated population of 800,000, are in Germany. The pro-PKK television station Roj TV, is believed to broadcast from Europe. Q) How do the killings, possible consequences, and the guerrilla war that the PKK has fought for nearly three decades against Turkey affect the rest of the world? A) The Turkey-PKK conflict is one of the longest-running conflicts in the Middle East. It is a conflict that constantly bleeds across borders, destabilizing relations between Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria. It also ripples throughout Europe, with the Turkish government constantly accusing European countries of not doing enough to stop PKK fund-raising and recruitment in European cities. At the height of the Turkish-PKK war, PKK activists were reported to shut down highways in Germany. I personally recall first encountering the PKK when I worked in Moscow in 1999, when the CNN bureau received a terrifying video of several PKK supporters setting themselves on fire in Moscow to protest the arrest of Ocalan. In recent months, the conflict has reached the deadliest levels in at least 13 years, with hundreds of Turkish soldiers and security forces as well as Kurdish rebel fighters killed over the last year. Q) Haven't the talks between Turkey and the Kurds been making progress recently? A) There is surprising support for the talks not only from the Turkish government, but also from opposition political parties as well as from influential voices in the Turkish media. I get the sense that Turkish society is exhausted by the weekly and daily deaths of conscript soldiers. Turkey will have to make substantial, long overdue compromises if it is ever to make peace with its Kurds, such as removing discriminatory statements in the constitution and allowing Kurdish language education in schools. There have been other, largely covert attempts at negotiations over the last 4 years, but they have been accompanied by a parallel increase in violence and killing in the blood-soaked hills of south-eastern Turkey.","The murder of three Kurdish women political activists remains a mystery .

"The U.S. government issued rules on Friday for the first time allowing banks to legally provide financial services to state-licensed marijuana businesses. The Justice Department issued a memorandum to prosecutors that closely follows guidance last August largely limiting federal enforcement priorities to eight types of crimes. These include distribution to children, trafficking by cartels and trafficking to states where marijuana isn't legal. If pot businesses aren't violating federal law in the eight specific priorities, then banks can do business with them and ""may not"" be prosecuted. The Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidelines that Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery said was intended to signal that ""it is possible to provide financial services"" to state-licensed marijuana businesses and still be in compliance with federal anti-money laundering laws. The guidance falls short of the explicit legal authorization that banking industry officials had pushed the to government provide. Opinion: Why D.C.'s push to legalize pot is a good thing . But because marijuana remains illegal under federal law, classified alongside heroin as among the most dangerous substances, officials say this is as far as the government can go. Calvery said the government can't give any legal guarantees and acknowledged that some financial firms won't likely choose to do business with pot businesses. Marijuana has been legalized for recreational and other uses under state laws in Colorado and Washington state. Eighteen other states and the District of Columbia allow marijuana use for medicinal purposes. Attorney General Eric Holder said recently that he was moved to act as ""an attempt to deal with reality that exists in these states."" Speaking at the University of Virginia's Miller Center last month, Holder said forcing marijuana businesses to be cash businesses, because they can't access banks, was a public safety problem. ""Huge amounts of cash, substantial amounts of cash, just kind of lying around with no place for it to appropriately deposited is something that would worry me from just a law enforcement perspective,"" he said. FinCEN's legal guidance creates two new categories for banks to report transactions with marijuana businesses. All transactions will be labeled as ""suspicious"" and banks will have to file so-called Suspicious Activity Reports. Those transactions that banks believe are legal marijuana business can be reported to FinCEN as ""marijuana limited"" transactions. Those that banks believe may be illegal would be filed as ""marijuana priority"" transactions and would generate further scrutiny from regulators. Up in smoke: Obama administration's pot politics problem . Reaction to Friday's announcement in areas where marijuana is legal, at least in some form, was mixed. Michael Elliott -- executive director of the Marijuana Industry Group, the largest marijuana business association in Colorado -- said members were pleased with the decision. ""While we believe today's guidance should provide banks some of the assurances they need to begin doing business with the marijuana industry, it doesn't solve all the problems,"" Elliott said in a statement. Elliott's group wants Congress to approve pending legislation that would ""provide certainty for banks and allow our industry to operate just like any other business,"" he said. Yet Colorado's governor, John Hickenlooper, noted concerns because ""it appears the language does not provide the clarity that Colorado banks are seeking to provide basic banking services to the emerging marijuana industry."" ""While we understand the federal government is in a difficult position, we also hope it realizes that compelling a new industry to conduct all their transactions in cash is an invitation to corruption and criminal activity,"" Hickenlooper said. ""We hope that Congress will act to resolve the risk and liability that Colorado banks are being asked to accept."" And Frank Keating, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, said the new rules aren't enough to reassure banks. ""While we appreciate the efforts by the Department of Justice and FinCEN, guidance or regulation doesn't alter the underlying challenge for banks,"" he said. ""As it stands, possession or distribution of marijuana violates federal law, and banks that provide support for those activities face the risk of prosecution and assorted sanctions.""","Governor says new rules don't provide ""the clarity that Colorado banks are seeking""

"At least four people were killed and 14 more injured when a car bomb exploded outside a popular restaurant in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on Wednesday, police officials there said. Meanwhile, the scene in Iraq's restive Anbar province was chaotic Wednesday after Sunni tribes took over at least three police stations -- two in Ramadi and one in Falluja, police officials in Ramadi told CNN. At least one person was killed and 12 others were wounded in clashes between the Iraqi army and Sunni tribes in al-Karma, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Baghdad on Wednesday, police in Ramadi said. The latest violence came as the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq confirmed that last year was the deadliest for civilians in Iraq since 2008. The total number of civilian casualties in 2013, including civilian police, was 7,818 killed and 17,981 injured, according to UNAMI figures released Wednesday, compared with 6,787 dead and 20,178 injured in 2008. ""This is a sad and terrible record which confirms once again the urgent need for the Iraqi authorities to address the roots of violence to curb this infernal circle,"" said the U.N. special representative for Iraq, Nickolay Mladenov. He urged Iraqi leaders to take steps to prevent ""terrorist groups"" from fueling sectarian tensions. Violence in the country has reached its worst levels since the height of the Iraq war, when sectarian fighting pushed the country to the brink of civil war. Anbar unrest . UNAMI said its 2013 figures don't include casualties of the unrest in Sunni-dominated Anbar province in recent days. Police said Wednesday that dozens of fighters belonging to different Sunni tribes in Anbar province raided several police stations and confiscated weapons and vehicles from inside the buildings. They also released at least 100 detainees from inside a detention center within Falluja police headquarters, they said. On Tuesday, Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said the army would leave cities in the province after tensions between the Iraqi army and Sunni tribes reached new heights. Clashes Monday in Ramadi and Falluja left at least five people dead and 20 injured. The fighting broke out as Iraqi security forces moved in to dismantle tents at two protest camps, just days after the arrest of a prominent Sunni lawmaker in a deadly raid on his Ramadi home. In response to the unrest, Shiite tribes in the Shiite-dominated Nasriya province organized a demonstration near the governor's office in which they asked to march on Anbar and fight the tribes there.","Chaos reigns in Anbar province as Sunnis seize police stations; one death reported .

"As my official bio reads, I was made in Cuba, assembled in Spain, and imported to the United States -- meaning my mother, seven months pregnant, and the rest of my family arrived as exiles from Cuba to Madrid, where I was born. Less than two months later, we emigrated once more and settled in New York City, then eventually in Miami, where I was raised and educated. By the time I was 45 days old, I belonged to three countries. My first newborn photo appears on my U.S. alien registration card. As an adult, I see this as a foreshadowing of what would eventually obsess my writing and my psyche:  the negotiation of identity. My first encounter with this was with cultural negotiation. My childhood was braced between two imaginary worlds. The first was the nostalgic world of 1950s Cuba in the hearts and minds of my parents, grandparents, and immediate family, but also the exile community at large in Miami.  ""Somewhere"" there was an island paradise we all came from, a paradise we lost (for complex reasons I was too young to comprehend), but nevertheless, a paradise, a homeland known as la patria -- to which we'd all return someday, exactly as we were, to find it exactly as it was. Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address . That storyline was what I knew of that homeland I imagined from family folklore told across the dinner table, gossip at beauty salons with my mother, or in the aisles of the mercados shopping for Cuban staples like chorizo and yucca with my grandmother; or from old photo albums that they had managed to smuggle out of Cuba, and the rum-drunk talk about ""what happened"" from the men playing dominos on the terraza in the backyard. The other imaginary world -- America-- was at the other end of the spectrum. Although technically we lived in the United States, the Cuban community was culturally insular in Miami during the 1970s, bonded together by the trauma of exile. What's more, it seemed that practically everyone was Cuban: my teachers, my classmates, the mechanic, the bus driver. I didn't grow up feeling different or treated as a minority. The few kids who got picked on in my grade school were the ones with freckles and funny last names like Dawson and O'Neil. Against that setting, America seemed like some ""other"" place. And as a child, I truly believed that the real America, just beyond my reach, was exactly like the America I saw on TV reruns like ""The Brady Bunch"" and ""Leave it to Beaver."" In my case, the stereotypical American family was the ""other,"" the exotic life yearned for, as much as I yearned to finally see that imaginary Cuba. Sorting out these contradictions and yearnings was an everyday part of my childhood, and one of the main themes of my writing today. Gergen: Obama 2.0 -- tougher, wiser? The other negotiation was the engineer versus the poet. As might be typical, my exile/immigrant family pushed for me to pursue a career that would ensure I would have a better life than they did. Also, in a working-class family, the idea of pursuing a life in the arts was outside the realm of possibilities. My family even thought architecture was too ""artsy."" Add to that the cultural-generational divide when it came to the arts in America. Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot were not dinner conversation at my house. My parents didn't even know of the Rolling Stones. They wanted me to continue the story of the ""American dream"" that they had begun. Fortunately -- or unfortunately -- I was a whiz at math, and when the time came to decide on a career path, I succumbed to their loving insistence. But I always harbored a creative spirit throughout my childhood, completely taken by Legos, paint-by-number sets, latch-hook rug kits -- anything that gave me expression. Richard Blanco, America's first Latino, openly gay inaugural poet . My sexual identity was something I also had to negotiate. The antagonist in my coming-out story was my grandmother, a woman as xenophobic as she was homophobic. Anything she perceived as culturally ""weird,"" she also labeled as ""faggotry"" -- ""mariconería."" This included my playing with toys like G.I. Joes and action figures of super heroes (Wonder Woman being my favorite). Convinced that I was queer -- she had good intuition, I guess -- she was verbally and psychologically abusive because she was also convinced she could make me a ""real"" man. She scared me into a closet so deep and dark that the idea of living as a gay man was completely, like a career in arts, out of the realm of possibilities. And so, like many gay men of my generation, I led a straight life, and was even engaged twice to be married, until I came out in my mid-20s. A tale of two terms: Obama's unfinished business and battles ahead . Being named poet laureate for the inauguration personally validates and stitches together several ideals against which I have long measured America, since the days of watching ""My Three Sons"" and ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" reruns. For one, the essence of the American dream: how a little Cuban-American kid on the margins of mainstream America could grow up with confidence, have the opportunity to become an engineer thanks to the hard work of his parents who could barely speak English, and then go on, choosing to become a poet who is now asked to speak to, for and about the entire nation. The most powerful quality of our country is that each day is full of a million possibilities:  We are a country of fierce individualism, which invites me to shape my life as I see fit.  As I reflect on this, I see how the American story is in many ways my story -- a country still trying to negotiate its own identity, caught between the paradise of its founding ideals and the realities of its history, trying to figure it out, trying to ""become"" even today -- the word ""hope"" as fresh on our tongues as it ever was. Regardless of my cultural, socioeconomic background and my sexuality, I have been given a place at the table, or more precisely, at the podium, because that is America.","Richard Blanco grew up surrounded by Cuban exiles, finding America in sitcom reruns .

"Hong Kong (CNN)A British transport minister on a trade visit to Taipei got a lesson in the perils of diplomatic gift giving Monday when she presented a pocket watch to the city's mayor -- a taboo act in Chinese culture. Baroness Susan Kramer apologized for the inadvertently inauspicious gift -- the word for a watch or clock in Chinese sounds like ""the end"" and many associate it with death. ""We learn something new each day. I had no idea a gift like this could be seen as anything other than positive: In the UK a watch is precious - because nothing is more important than time,"" she later said in a statement. But the recipient, Mayor Ko Wen-je, also came under fire for his ""rude"" response. Ko, who was recently elected and isn't a career politician, told reporters that he had ""no use"" for the pocket watch. ""I can just regift it to someone or take it to a scrap metal dealer and sell it for cash,"" he was quoted as saying. On Tuesday, he apologized and said he would undertake some ""diplomatic etiquette"" training. Kramer and Ko can take comfort that it's not the first time an exchange of official gifts has stirred controversy. President Obama was widely slammed by the British press in 2009 when he gave then British prime minister Gordon Brown a set of DVDs, which did not play on the British system. Brown's gift of a pen holder carved from the timbers of a Victorian anti-slavery ship seemed to be the more thoughtful half of the exchange. The same year, the President Obama raised eyebrows again when he gave Queen Elizabeth II an iPod loaded with video footage of her visit to the United States in 2007.","British transport minister presents a pocket watch to Taipei mayor .

NBC Universal disputed the accusations Friday. ""There was no intent to portray Mr. Zimmerman unfairly,"" the company said in a prepared statement. ""We intend to vigorously defend our position in court."" The defamation lawsuit accuses the network of sensationalizing and manipulating a potential ""racial powder keg that would result in months, if not years, of topics for their failing news program, particularly the plummeting ratings for their ailing Today Show."" The edited recordings included multiple deletions, removed intervening dialogue between Zimmerman and the dispatcher, and juxtaposed unrelated content ""to make it appear that Zimmerman was a racist, and that he was racially profiling Trayvon Martin,"" the lawsuit says. NBC aired various edited versions of the 911 call on March 19, 20, 22 and 27, the suit says. The suit accuses the network of malice, highlighting correspondent Ron Allen's segment on ""The Today Show"" on March 27. Timeline of events in case . ""Allen's broadcast removed a critical aspect of the dialogue between Zimmerman and the dispatcher, bringing the 'up to no good' and 'he looks black' statements even closer together, to further the false and defamatory implication that Zimmerman had said he believed Martin was 'up to no good' because 'he looks black,'"" the suit says. The lawsuit accuses NBC of falsely claiming that Zimmerman said ""f------ coons"" on the February 26 call. ""The truth, as known to the defendants, was that Zimmerman said 'f------ punks' and there was no evidence, or reason to believe, that Zimmerman uttered a racial epithet during the call,"" the suit says. Zimmerman mentioned Martin's race only when prompted by the dispatcher, the suit says. NBC never aired an ""earnest"" retraction and never apologized to Zimmerman, who has since experienced death threats, a bounty on his head and a genuine fear for his life, the suit says. He now lives in hiding, court documents say. NBC News President Steve Capus ""made a bogus non-apology that claimed the doctoring was merely a 'mistake,'"" the suit says. Because of the death threats, Zimmerman wears a bulletproof vest and was even dismissed from his college because it felt fellow students could be endangered, the lawsuit says. At the time of the incident with Martin, Zimmerman was living in a community known as The Retreat at Twin Lakes in Sanford, Florida, court papers say. ""Due to the defendants' journalistic crimes, Zimmerman has been transformed into one of the most hated men in America,"" the suit says. Zimmerman's attorney, Mark O'Mara, told ""In Session's"" Jean Casarez that NBC tried ""to get ahead of the curve coverage thinking that they had themselves a person who was a racist, and they were wrong."" The suit also names as defendants Lilia Rodriguez Luciano of Dade County, Florida, who was reporting directly from Sanford. Her employment was terminated by NBC as a result of her reporting, the suit says. Also named as a defendant is Jeffrey Burnside of Dade County, another journalist who was reporting from Sanford to his station, NBC-owned WTVJ in Miami, the suit says.

"New York (CNN)The men would sometimes say they needed to meet to exchange tickets, but they never seemed to end up actually attending or discussing a sporting event or a concert. They once talked about going to a movie. But that was it. The reason for the puzzling behavior, according to a federal complaint unsealed Monday, is that the men were Russian spies exchanging intelligence information in New York City. They used tickets and other everyday objects -- like books, umbrellas and hats -- as part of their code. When they did meet, on dozens of occasions between early 2012 and late 2014, it was usually outdoors in order to lower the risk of surveillance. At the short meetings, one man would hand a bag, a magazine or a slip of paper to another. But the FBI was watching and listening to them. On Monday in New York, authorities arrested one of the men, who they say had been working as a covert agent for the Russian government. He was identified as Evgeny Buryakov, 39, who posed as an employee in the New York City office of a Russian bank, according to the federal complaint. The man he met regularly for the handoffs was Igor Sporyshev, 40, who worked as a trade representative for the Russian government in New York, the complaint says. A 27-year-old man serving as an attache to Russia's mission at the United Nations, Victor Podobnyy, is also alleged to have been part of the conspiracy. All three men are accused of working for Russia's foreign intelligence agency, the SVR. Sporyshev and Podobnyy, who no longer live in the United States and haven't been arrested, both had diplomatic immunity because of their jobs for the Russian government. But Buryakov, who entered the United States as a private citizen, was operating under what officials called ""non-official cover."" Agents like that, known as ""NOCs,"" generally receive ""less scrutiny by the host government, and, in many cases, are never identified as intelligence agents by the host government,"" a statement from U.S. law enforcement authorities said. ""As a result, a NOC is an extremely valuable intelligence asset for the SVR,"" the statement said. Buryakov needed the other two men to get mesages to and from the communications systems kept in the SVR's office in New York, according to authorities. As he was undercover, he couldn't go near the office. The subjects about which the men were tasked with gathering intelligence are believed to have included possible U.S. sanctions on Russia and U.S. efforts to develop alternative energy resources. Sporyshev and Podobnyy also tried to recruit U.S. citizens as intelligence sources in New York, the complaint said. Their targets included people working for ""major companies"" and ""young women with ties to a major university located in New York,"" according to authorities. The FBI says in its complaint that its surveillance of the men heard them discussing various aspects of their work. In one conversation, Podobnyy is alleged to have talked about his technique for recruiting sources, which included ""cheating, promising favors, and then discarding the intelligence source once the relevant information was obtained by the SVR,"" according to authorities. But in another discussion, he apparently complained to Sporyshev about how unexciting his everyday job was, saying it was ""not even close"" to James Bond movies. ""Of course, I wouldn't fly helicopters, but pretend to be somebody else at a minimum,"" he said. Sporyshev seemed to concur, lamenting, ""I also thought that at least I would go abroad with a different passport."" The two men also chatted about the 2010 unmasking of a Russian spy ring in the United States. In that case, 11 intelligence personnel, living and working in the U.S. as ""sleeper"" agents, were arrested and later allowed to return to Moscow as part of a spy swap. According to the complaint, Podobnyy suggested those agents ""couldn't do anything."" ""They studied some people, worked out some exits, but they didn't get any materials,"" he said. The FBI investigation into Buryakov, Sporyshev and Podobnyy began ""within a few months"" of the guilty pleas in the 2010 case, according to the FBI. A source working for the FBI met with Buryakov in the summer of 2014, posing as a representative of a wealthy person wanting to invest in the casino business in Russia. Over the course of the meetings, Buryakov ""demonstrated his strong desire to obtain information about subjects far outside the scope of his work as a bank employee,"" authorities said. He also accepted documents that the source claimed had come from a U.S. government agency and ""purportedly contained information potentially useful to Russia, including information about United States sanctions against Russia,"" according to the U.S. law enforcement statement. Prosecutors announced charges Monday against Buryakov, Sporyshev and Podobnyy on two counts. The first is participating in a conspiracy for Buryakov to act in the United States as an agency of a foreign government without first notifying the Attorney General, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. In the second count, Buryakov is charged with acting in the United States as an agent of a foreign government without first notifying the Attorney General, while Sporyshev and Podobnyy are charged with aiding and abetting that offense. The maximum sentence for that count is 10 years imprisonment. The charges and Buryakov's arrest ""make clear that—more than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War—Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy,"" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. A federal judge in Manhattan on Monday ordered that Buryakov be detained because he was considered to pose a flight risk, the U.S. Attorney's Office said. His federal public defender, Sabrina Shroff, spoke to The New York Times. She declined to comment on the charges other than to say that she had argued for bail because Buryakov was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, the newspaper reported. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report.","The men discussed meeting to swap things like tickets, books and hats .

"A former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan was ordered Thursday to pay thousands of dollars but avoided prison time in a case that put a spotlight on the military's handling of sexual misconduct among troops. Army Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair was told he'd get a reprimand, and he must forfeit $20,000 and pay restitution of $4,157 related to travel fraud charges, his lawyer, Richard Scheff, said. Sinclair's court-martial came at a time when many have accused the military of not doing enough to address sex crimes and harassment targeting women. The sentence was handed down days after Sinclair pleaded guilty to adultery and mistreating one of his accusers in a deal that saw the sexual assault and sodomy charges against him dropped, according to Sinclair's defense team. He had previously pleaded guilty to other charges in the court-martial, including committing adultery, engaging in inappropriate relationships with three women, conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and obstruction of justice. Prosecutors said Sinclair broke military law through sexual relationships -- including threats to some women involved who held lower ranks -- between 2009 and 2012 in Iraq, Afghanistan and Germany, as well as Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and Fort Hood, Texas. Once the deputy commander of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, Sinclair was moved to the North Carolina post from Afghanistan in 2012, the same year the last alleged incidents occurred and when he was originally charged. Opinion: Military justice bungles sex cases . After he left Thursday's hearing at Fort Bragg, Sinclair said he was glad ""the system worked."" ""All I want to do now is go up north and hug my kids and see my wife,"" he said. Scheff said that he, too, was ""very, very grateful"" for how everything played out. He added that Sinclair plans to file his retirement papers with the Army. ""It restores our faith in the system,"" Scheff said of the outcome, repeating his assertion that ""we would not be here at all"" if the same allegations were leveled in the civilian justice system. ""Somebody who is neutral and objective looked at the evidence (and) did the right thing."" Retired Rear Adm. Jamie Barnett, a partner with a law firm that represented one of Sinclair's accusers, called Thursday's sentencing a ""slap on the wrist"" that is ""beyond disappointing. It is a travesty and a serious misstep for the Army."" He said the ordeal shows remaining ""challenges"" in the military when it comes to sexual abuse and assault. ""She had her day in court to speak the truth about the horrible things he did, and based on Judge (James) Pohl's sentence, that will have to be enough,"" Barnett said of his client. ""But it shouldn't be."" The testimony of his client, an Army captain, was never fully aired. She testified for several hours on March 7, telling the court that an affair started with intimate exchanges and evolved into groping and demands for sex and oral sex, CNN affiliate WTVD reported. She also said the general threatened to kill her and her family, the station reported. The woman was scheduled to continue her testimony on March 10, but  Pohl dismissed the jury after 22 pages of e-mails emerged that appear to point to alleged Pentagon interference in the case. At least one of the e-mails also seemed to indicate that a senior Army official felt the accuser had a credibility issue. A recent Pentagon report showed that there were estimated to be 26,000 incidents of sexual assault and unwanted sexual contact in 2012, and just over 10%  of those were reported. These concerns fueled a push championed by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, for legislation to remove military commanders from deciding whether most serious allegations of wrongdoing by their subordinates should be prosecuted. The responsibility would have been shifted to prosecutors outside the chain of command. Opponents said that such a measure would undermine the critical military principle of command authority. Earlier this month, Gillibrand's bill failed to get the needed 60 votes to pass the Senate. However, a separate measure to largely disallow the ""good soldier"" defense -- which permits defendants to enter evidence of their good military character at trial to mitigate the charges against them -- did make it through the chamber.

"A Libyan military plane crashed in Tunisia's Nabeul province Friday, killing all 11 people on board, the Libyan government said. The plane was carrying five crew members, a doctor, three patients and two others who were accompanying them on the flight, Libyan officials said. Among those killed was Sheikh Muftah Mabrook al Dwadi, a senior Islamist figure and deputy minister of Libya's Ministry of Martyrs' Affairs, the Libyan air force said. Col. Ali Sheikhi, a Libyan military spokesman, said the plane crashed amid ""mysterious circumstances."" Engine fire . The Libyan air force said an engine caught fire as the plane made a gradual descent into Tunis Carthage airport and the pilot tried to land it before reaching the airport. Libya's culture minister, speaking on behalf of the government, confirmed the death of all 11 on board and also said an initial investigation indicated one of the engines was on fire, leading the whole plane to catch fire and crash. A plane is being sent to bring the bodies of the victims home, the minister said in a post on the official Twitter account of Libya's interim government. The director of Libya's civil aviation authority has been dispatched to Tunis to coordinate the investigation with Tunisian authorities, he said. ""We express our condolences to victims' families and hope investigations will reveal reasons behind the crash,"" he tweeted. Air ambulance . The Libyan aircraft came down about 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the capital, Tunis, near the town of Grombalia, Tunisian state news agency TAP reported. Army units, a military medical team and civil protection workers were sent to the scene of the crash, the news agency said. The plane was an Antonov An-26, which was flying from Mitiga Airport in Libya, TAP said. Libyan officials said the plane, part of the country's air force, was used as an air ambulance to transport patients inside and outside of Libya.

"Conestoga Wood Specialties was founded a half-century ago in a Pennsylvania garage. The Hahn family's commitment to quality is driven in large part by their Christian faith, which in turn may soon threaten the company's very existence. That financial and constitutional dynamic is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, in a high-stakes encore to the health care reform law known as Obamacare. The justices will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a dispute involving contraception coverage and religious liberty. The court will review provisions in the Affordable Care Act requiring for-profit employers of a certain size to offer insurance benefits for birth control and other reproductive health services without a co-pay. At issue is whether certain companies can refuse to do so on the sincere claim it would violate their owners' long-established personal beliefs. ""Our religion is Mennonite; that is our faith. Our company was founded on that religion as well,"" said Conestoga's President Anthony Hahn, son of the privately held company's co-founder. ""We feel the government has gone too far in too many instances. It's been troubling to us as a family."" The modest furniture maker's pending lawsuit is one of nearly 50 that have been filed in federal courts from various corporations, challenging the birth control coverage benefits in the law championed by President Barack Obama. That law has come in for separate, fierce political criticism over its rocky public introduction last fall. Two separate appeals will be heard together in the high court's one-hour public session. A ruling expected by late June could clarify whether businesses have a religious liberty right, or whether such constitutional protections apply only to individuals. 5 things to know about Obamacare and contraceptives . The companion legal challenge comes from Hobby Lobby, an Oklahoma-based retail giant that will have more than 700 arts and crafts stores nationwide by year's end. Both corporations emphasize their desire to operate in harmony with biblical principles while competing in a secular marketplace. That includes their leaders' publicly stated opposition to abortion. Under the ACA, financial penalties of up to $100 per day, per employee can be levied on firms that refuse to provide comprehensive health coverage. ""The fines and implications are, in my mind, astronomical,"" said Hahn, who employs about 1,000 people. ""It's devastating to any company."" Hobby Lobby, which has about 13,000 workers, estimates the penalty could cost it $475 million a year. The church-state issue now in the spotlight involves three-pronged rules negotiated last year between the Obama administration and various outside groups. Under the changes, churches and houses of worship are completely exempt from the contraception mandate. Other nonprofit, religiously affiliated groups, such as church-run hospitals, parochial schools and charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor, must either offer coverage, or have a third-party insurer provide separate benefits without the employer's direct involvement. Lawsuits in those cases are pending in several federal appeals courts across the country. The Hobby Lobby and Conestoga claims are in yet another Obamacare category: for-profit corporations claiming a religion-based exemption. These suits follow the high court's decision two years ago that narrowly upheld the key funding provision of the health care law, a blockbuster ruling affirming that most Americans would be required to purchase insurance or pay a financial penalty, the so-called individual mandate. The constitutional debate now shifts to the separate employer mandates and whether corporations themselves enjoy the same First Amendment rights as individuals. Three federal appeals courts around the country have struck down the contraception coverage rule, while two other appeals courts have upheld it. That ""circuit split"" made the upcoming Supreme Court review almost certain. David Green and his family are Hobby Lobby's owners and say their evangelical Christian beliefs clash with parts of the law's mandates for comprehensive coverage. They say some of the drugs that would be provided prevent human embryos from being implanted in a woman's womb, which the Greens equate with abortion. Those drugs include Plan B contraception, which some have called the ""morning after"" pill. The large retailer says it already provides coverage for 16 federally approved forms of contraception -- such as condoms and diaphragms -- for its roughly 13,000 employees, who Hobby Lobby says represent a variety of faiths. The White House has said it believes a requirement on contraception coverage is ""lawful and essential to women's health"" and expressed confidence the Supreme Court would ultimately agree. Obamacare's supporters say it does not require individual company owners to personally provide coverage they might object to but instead places that responsibility on the corporate entity. ""Throughout our nation's history, corporations have been treated differently than individuals when it comes to fundamental, personal rights of conscience and human dignity,"" said lawyers for the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive public-interest legal group. ""The First Amendment's free exercise guarantee has always been viewed as a purely personal liberty."" But lawyers representing the Hahns say they deserve freedom from what they call state intrusion into private moral decisions. ""The question in this case is whether all Americans will have religious freedom and will be able to live and do business according to their faith,"" said Matt Bowman, senior legal counsel with the Alliance Defending Freedom. ""Or whether the federal government can pick and choose what faith is, who are the faithful, and where and when they can exercise that faith."" A key issue for the justices will be interpreting a 1993 federal law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, requiring the government to seek the ""least burdensome"" and narrowly tailored means for any law that interferes with religious convictions. Can companies, churches, and universities be included, or do the protections apply only to ""persons?"" The justices have a good deal of discretion to frame the competing issues and could reach a limited ""compromise"" decision through narrow statutory interpretation. They could conclude individual owners can make the religious freedom claim, bypassing the corporate rights argument. Liberals have criticized the conservative majority high court for being overly sympathetic to business interests. The botched rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal Obamacare website, has become another political flashpoint along with other issues that many Republicans say proves the law is unworkable. Some legal analysts say the birth control mandate cases are only the beginning of a broader legal fight that could extend to end of the decade. ""It wouldn't be surprising if we had a case at the Supreme Court every year for the next five about Obamacare, as the lower courts get in the nitty-gritty of exactly how to implement this complicated statute,"" said Thomas Goldstein, a leading appellate attorney and the publisher of SCOTUSblog. ""There are a lot of ambiguities; there are a lot of new rules that agencies are (adopting). There's a lot of anger and a lot of contention about putting this statute into effect."" As for Conestoga, Anthony Hahn and his wife, Carolyn, believe they are on the right side of the legal and moral argument. They live in Lancaster County with their four children, just down the street from their second-generation kitchen cabinet business, which has expanded over the years into four other states. Nearby are Anthony's two brothers, who also work at the company, and his parents, Norman and Elizabeth Hahn. ""It's really not only just for Conestoga. We're taking a stand for other businesses as well,"" said Anthony Hahn about his appeal. ""This is a religious liberty issue that is concerning to us."" The cases are Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. (13-354); and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Sebelius (13-356).","Hobby Lobby, Conestoga Wood Specialties say they run their firms with Christian values .

"Nicole Uvieghara  is only 18, but that's old enough to remember the good old days on Facebook. ""I used to log in to Facebook every day,"" said Uvieghara, a Murrieta, California, native and freshman at Arizona State University. ""Now, I go, like, once a week. On my news feed, I rarely see posts from my friends and I have not posted things on my wall in the past year."" Her experience isn't unusual. Teens are cooling on Facebook, a trend suggested by recent research and acknowledged, this week by Facebook itself. The shift was confirmed time and time again in e-mail and phone interviews with dozens of teens and their parents in CNN's reporting of this story. While the social-networking juggernaut continues to chug along among adults, boasting more than 1 billion active users, younger users are flocking to newer, and arguably hipper, networking tools. Sherman Watson of San Francisco said he's noticed a dip in Facebook use by both his 18-year-old son and the younger employees at the retail store he manages. ""I think his generation, and definitely the younger ones, view Facebook as boorish and -- let's face it -- something that their parents use,"" Watson wrote in response to a Facebook post seeking thoughts on the issue.  ""Funny how history repeats itself in this regard."" Instead, he said, mobile apps like Facebook-owned Instagram, and Vine, Twitter's video tool, are where teens increasingly go to share. For the first time this week, Facebook confirmed the trend is real. ""We did see a decrease in (teenage) daily users, especially younger teens,"" Facebook Chief Financial Officer David Ebersman said Wednesday during a quarterly earnings call. It was just months ago that Ebersman called the decline of teens using Facebook an ""urban legend,"" saying they were active on more sites, but not cutting back on their Facebook visits. CEO Mark Zuckerberg added that it ""just isn't true"" that Facebook has a teen problem. But even then, there were signs of a slide. In May, a survey by the Pew Internet & American Life Project included focus groups with teens who said their enthusiasm for Facebook had waned. They cited the increasing presence of adults on the site, as well as stressful ""drama"" among friends. The survey showed use of Twitter among teens jumping from 11% to 26% between 2011 and 2012. Teen Facebook use, on the other hand, remained essentially flat. (Albeit at a massive 93-94%). Instagram use, which wasn't measured in the 2011 survey, was at 11% in last year's. Most teens in the focus groups said they kept their Facebook pages, but had migrated to new tools and sites for most of their activity. That sounds about right to Alex Hager, 16, a high school junior in Darien, Connecticut. He said the rise of new networks -- video-clip app Snapchat and messaging tool KiK are other popular choices -- has met a desire among his peers who would rather communicate directly than broadcast to hundreds of Facebook friends. ""Everybody was Facebook friends with everybody in my grade, regardless of how well they knew each other,"" he said. ""This meant that whenever somebody publicly interacted with somebody else in your grade, you would see it instantly."" Now he'll post things like the YouTube videos he and some friends make about his school's sports teams to the site, but said  ""I rarely ever use Facebook to post statuses or photos anymore."" While Facebook has downplayed the importance of the trend, the site simultaneously appears to be taking steps to address it. Earlier this month, Facebook changed privacy settings for teens, allowing them for the first time to make their profiles public. Teens may now also turn on the site's ""Follow"" feature, which allows people to view their posts whether the teen has accepted a friend request from them or not. Teens who join the site will still have their settings default to ""Friends Only"" and, if they switch to public, they will get pop-up warnings explaining what having a public profile means. The public nature of Twitter has been appealing, teens say, because they can build bigger followings and interact with people up to and including their favorite celebrities. The same goes for other apps. ""It makes you feel relevant and wanted because of the number of followers a person can have and the likes you can have on your photos,"" Uvieghara  said, describing Instagram. She said she doesn't think her Facebook use will ever pick back up. Hager, meanwhile, wasn't so sure. His thoughts might provide a ray of  hope for Facebook. Because, given enough time, the teens who are fleeing Facebook become the adults who still flock to it. ""I hope that my peers continue to use Facebook in the future,"" he said. ""It will be a valuable means of staying in touch as we move on to college and careers.""","Facebook acknowledges that teen users are becoming less active on the site .
Newer social tools like Snapchat, Instagram and Vine are picking up steam instead .

But teens who don't use Facebook as much don't close their accounts ."
"As 2013 drew to a close, Laurie Wood had no realistic plans to marry, after being told for years it was illegal in her home state of Utah. She and her partner had once even filled out an official license application, but were politely sent away by a county clerk. Yet the couple was urged to save the paperwork just in case, with the clerk's refrain, ""You never know."" Then a dramatic, unexpected ruling from a federal judge last December transformed the lives of Wood and Kody Partridge in an instant. The lesbian couple could legally wed, and they wasted no time. ""We rushed -- like hundreds of other couples -- to the Salt Lake County Building with identification in hand to get our license to marry, knowing we wouldn't be turned away this time,"" said Wood. ""As we again nervously filled out the paperwork, the same clerk who had previously denied our application caught our eye. She beamed a huge smile and said, 'I guess you didn't have to wait so long after all.'"" Now Utah's legal, political, and social journey to define the limits of civil marriage -- playing out in surprising and rapidly evolving ways -- will be publicly debated Thursday in a federal courtroom. There a three-judge appeals panel will hear oral arguments over Proposition 3, Utah's decade-old, voter-approved measure that defines marriage as only between one-man and one-woman. It also does not recognize the unions of Utah same-sex couples legally married elsewhere. An important question . What the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals does in the Utah case and a similar challenge over Oklahoma's ban could be the driving legal force that seems certain to land again at the steps of the  Supreme Court, perhaps by year's end. The justices could then finally answer one of the most important constitutional questions of our time: do gays and lesbians have the same equal protection or due process right as opposite-sex couples in all 50 states to wed? But perhaps the high court will wait, allowing the lower courts for now to control the legal conversation. ""This is a conservative court, conservative ideologically, and conservative in the sense that they like to take baby steps,"" said Thomas Goldstein, publisher of SCOTUSblog.com. ""There are times when the court decides to act aggressively over time, then there are other times when the court is more uncertain and wants to move more modestly. In the same-sex marriage cases it may not want to force the entire country in one direction or another."" That makes what is happening in Utah so important. Round Two . The high court's recent precedents set the stage for Round Two of the debate, and now the 10th Circuit will become the first federal appeals court to confront the over-arching constitutional questions over gay marriage. Appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar challenges over current bans in Virginia, Nevada, Texas, Kentucky, Ohio, and Michigan. A near unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year gives marriage equality supporters unbridled encouragement their ultimate goal will be achieved: eliminating all laws limiting the rights of gays and lesbians to wed. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Shelby struck down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage five days before Christmas, saying the state's ""current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason. Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional."" The ruling drew national attention partly because Utah is viewed as among the more conservative states, and because the justices ruled this past summer on separate issues involving same-sex marriage. In June, the nation's highest court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend a voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. More importantly, the court also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act in its 5-4 Windsor decision, citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits such as tax breaks. Measure of uncertainty . Citing that high court precedent, Shelby's ruling was hailed by civil rights groups. But it also created a measure of uncertainty. Because the judge -- an appointee of President Barack Obama -- did not immediately stay enforcement of his decision until the subsequent appeals process is exhausted-- as other judges have done-- it prompted same-sex couples to quickly obtain marriage licenses, despite the state's ongoing legal challenge. More than 1,300 such couples like Wood and Partridge were wed before the Supreme Court agreed to the state's request for a stay. ""It is very unfortunate that so many Utah citizens have been put into this legal limbo,"" said the state's attorney general, Sean Reyes. His office later admitted it was a confusing situation, and announced that while it would provide marriage certificates to those who properly applied during the 17-day window between the ruling and the stay, it would not recognize them as valid, at least for the time being. Utah may seem like an unusual battleground over homosexual rights, but the level of activism and growing public support is no surprise to many in that state. A recent Williams Institute survey found among large cities, the Salt Lake City metropolitan area had the nation's highest rate of same-sex couples raising children, at 26 percent. Memphis, Virginia Beach, Detroit, and San Antonio were not far behind. Among states, Mississippi led the list, also at 26 percent. When it was passed in 2004, Utah's Prop 3 had 66-percent voter support. But after Shelby's ruling, a Salt Lake City Tribune poll found residents there equally divided 48 percent on whether same-sex couples should be allowed to get state-issued marriage licenses. Controversial politically . Politically, the issue remains controversial, a reflection nationwide over how it will be resolved: whether the courts, state legislatures, or the voters should decide the future of same-sex marriage. Wood and Partridge are among three Utah couples who brought the original lawsuit. The case could turn on defining the boundaries of marriage, within the context of family and children. ""This challenge is about real people with long-term loving relationships who believe they are entitled to respect and honor in this state, just like heterosexual couples,"" said their Salt Lake City attorney, Peggy Tomsic, who will argue before the appeals court. In their legal brief, the committed couples say Utah law ""communicates to them and to all the world that their relationships are not as real, valuable, or worthy as those of opposite-sex couples; that they are worthy of no recognition at all; and that they are not, and never can be, true families."" The National Center for Lesbian Rights is also leading this legal challenge. Will of the voters . But the state cites the will of the voters -- and a wealth of social science -- to argue ""that moms and dads are different, not interchangeable, and that the diversity of having both a mom and a dad is the ideal parenting environment. ...  As between mutually exclusive models of marriage, the man-woman model is simply the one the state and its people believe is best for children."" And officials argue in their brief that ""By defining marriage as being between one man and one woman, Utah does not interfere with adults' ability to commit to an exclusive, loving relationship with others of the same sex, or to bring children into that relationship. ""Instead, the laws at issue here simply encourage a familial structure that has served society for thousands of years as the ideal setting for raising children. Nothing in the federal Constitution prevents Utah's citizens from making that choice."" Seventeen states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage within its borders: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Just a decade ago, there were none. The Utah case is Herbert v. Kitchen (13-4178). A ruling on that and Oklahoma's same-sex marriage ban could come within weeks.","Utah's efforts to define the limits of civil marriage to be debated at appeals court .

"(CNN) -- Anyone who has been deceived by a punchbowl at a party, or a diet-busting cake, will recognize the value of knowing exactly what you are eating. A new pocket scanner promises to deliver that power by giving the user an instant breakdown of alcohol, sugar, or calorie content before they consume. The USB-shaped 'SCiO' device was launched through a Kickstarter campaign earlier in the week and reached its target within 24 hours, with devices available for as little as $149. The product of Israeli start-up Consumer Physics, it uses spectrometry to read the ""molecular fingerprint"" of an object, shining near Infra-Red light on it which stimulates the molecules and then records their reactions. An accompanying app then displays the nutrient values on a smart phone, measuring fat, protein and carbohydrate levels to the milligram, as well as overall quality. This underlying technology has been industry standard for decades in quality control of oil, sewage or chemicals. But SCiO is the first portable spectrometer for consumers, and offers far greater versatility of application. The product, developed by engineers from leading institutions such as MIT and Harvard, has been tested in live demonstrations with high accuracy. The final product will be sent to backers this year. ""The first application is for consumers interested to know the nutritional value of what they're eating"", Dror Sharon, CEO of Consumer Physics, told CNN. ""I often meet people who don't know what's in cheese, fruit and vegetables and have a hard time discerning what they should eat. ""I think this can be empowering if people want to change their intake, whether for medical reasons or training, and can be educational in teaching us to make better nutritional choices."" Uses do not end with food. Apps are available to analyze medicine or the health of houseplants. SCiO could be a protective tool for clubbers keen to check if their drink has been spiked, or patients to see if their pills are as advertised. The device could be applied to the environment as well as consumed objects -- an athlete could scan their track or field in order to optimize its playability. Sharon acknowledges the device has limitations, suggesting it can identify elements between ""0.1% to 1%"" of the overall chemical makeup, and that it would need to be more robust to be an effective guide for allergy sufferers. The sensor can also be disrupted by interference such as packaging. Yet hand held spectrometry still represents a long sought-after breakthrough for the industry. ""The challenge has always been calibration that works for different materials"", says Dr Bryan Curtiss, molecular scientist and head of technology at spectrometry firm ASDI. ""What they've done is quite an ingenious approach as the device only measures the spectrum, and then applies calibration (in the algorithm cloud) and sends results, so the lab system and software have been centralized."" The success of the Kickstarter campaign indicates a substantial market, and addresses a genuine need says Quantified Self technologist Maarten Van Braaben: ""This is answering a question as food checking has never been automated well, and this offers a less tedious process."" SCiO will have rivals in this new marketplace. Canadian company TellSpec will launch their own hand held spectrometer this year, focused on food, while calorie sensing wristbands such as the HealBeGoBe are also close to market. Van Brabben foresees further innovation with the technology. ""If you could have the same spectrometry analysis through the camera on your phone that would be a popular concept, and I think it's not far off, perhaps two or three years."" Consumer Physics are providing a 'maker kit' for developers to use their technology in any form they wish, and Sharon hopes they can become as ubiquitous as smart phones with billions in circulation.","New device allows users to check the nutritional value of food .

"A wave of violence swept across Iraq on Friday, resulting in at least 38 deaths, police said. Most of the casualties occurred in Sunni towns and cities, according to police in Baquba, Ramadi, Mosul, Samarra, Kirkuk and Tikrit. • The deadliest attack occurred about 105 miles (170 kilometers) north of Baghdad in Anjana, where a suicide bomber drove a truck loaded with explosives into federal police headquarters, police officials in Tikrit and Baquba said. Officers were among the 14 people who were killed and 18 others wounded, the officials said. • In al-Dibis, about 186 miles (300 kilometers) north of Baghdad, at least two people were killed and 28 others wounded when two car bombs exploded near where people in the streets were celebrating Nowruz, a Persian new year festival marking the arrival of spring, police officials in Kirkuk said. • At least six people were killed and 40 others wounded when a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest among dozens of mourners attending a funeral inside a building in central Ramadi, about 62 miles (100 kilometers) west of Baghdad, police officials said. The funeral was for a leader of a local Awakening Council who had been killed Thursday when a roadside bomb exploded near his car, also in Ramadi. As mourners gathered in the aftermath of Friday's attack, another suicide bomber detonated a bomb, resulting in dozens more casualties, police said without providing specifics. Awakening Councils, also known as the Sons of Iraq and Sahawat, are composed primarily of Sunni Arab fighters who turned against al Qaeda in late 2006. The U.S.-backed movement is credited with having contributed to a drop in violence across Iraq, but council members have become targets for remaining jihadists. Ramadi is a predominantly Sunni city in Anbar province that has seen intense fighting between Sunni extremists and Iraqi security forces aligned with tribesmen since the beginning of this year. • At a military base in eastern Mosul, about 260 miles (420 kilometers) north of the capital, a suicide bomber drove a car loaded with explosives into a security checkpoint. Four people were killed, three of them Iraqi soldiers, and nine others wounded, including five soldiers, police said. • In Samarra, 62 miles (100 kilometers) north of Baghdad, men attacked a police headquarters with guns, hand grenades and rocket-propelled grenades, killing eight police officers and wounding 13 others, police officials in Samarra and Tikrit said. • In Baiji, about 124 miles (200 kilometers) north of Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near a convoy that included a police commander, Col. Ahmed Saleh, killing him and two other officers and wounding another, police said. The attacks came a day after the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad noted that hundreds of Iraqis, including women and children, have been killed or wounded in recent weeks ""by terrorists who pursue their goals through the senseless slaughter of the innocent.""","Most of the attacks occurred in Sunni towns and cities, police say .

"After learning that Ashton Kutcher had landed in the hospital trying to follow Steve Jobs' all-fruit diet, CNN reader Sumday had just one question: ""All I really wanted to know was why this diet was bad?"" Jobs first fell for extreme diets during his freshman year of college, according to Walter Isaacson's biography ""Steve Jobs."" Jobs and his college friend Daniel Kottke became vegetarians after reading ""Diet for a Small Planet."" Then Jobs read ""Mucusless Diet Healing System"" by Arnold Ehret; Ehret believed in eating nothing but fruits and starchless vegetables like spinach, carrots and cucumbers. Jobs began with two-day fruit fasts, eventually going for a week or more. ""I got into it in my typical nutso way,"" Jobs told Isaacson. Ehret's fruitarian diet, also called the Eden Garden Diet or Ehretism, is often used as a type of cleanse, according to LiveStrong.com. Designed to detoxify the system, it can do more long-term harm than good. When you only eat fruit, you're excluding a lot of valuable nutrients from your diet, says Marisa Moore, registered dietician and spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Protein is one of the main ones that comes to mind,"" she says. ""(Without protein) you lose body weight. Protein acts like a building block for your muscles and skin and organs."" The same goes for fats, Moore says. Although they often get demonized, fats play an important role in our hormone levels and brain function. Kutcher told reporters at the Sundance Film Festival that he ended up in the hospital with pancreas levels that were ""completely out of whack."" Steve Jobs movie premieres to mixed reviews . Fruit contains a lot of natural sugar, which needs to be controlled by insulin in the body, Moore says. It's the pancreas' job to release that insulin; Kutcher's pancreas may have been overworked if his body was receiving an overload of sugar. Many readers wondered if an all-fruit diet could have led to Jobs' pancreatic cancer, which led to his death in October 2011. Scientists don't know what causes pancreatic cancer, according to the American Cancer Society. Certain inherited DNA mutations might play a role, as well as chemicals in our environment or diet. Even if you don't overwork your pancreas, you're probably not eating enough calories on an all-fruit diet, Moore says. That puts the body into starvation mode, which can result in serious medical conditions like osteoporosis, severe dehydration and even heart failure, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. Here's the bottom line: Fruit is natural. It's nutritious. The government recommends eating 1 to 2 cups of it a day. Just don't go all ""nutso"" on it.","Ashton Kutcher is playing Steve Jobs in Joshua Michael Stern's biopic ""Jobs""

"(CNN)Kiev will ask the Hague tribunal to investigate alleged ""crimes against humanity"" in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko announced Monday. There has been a surge in fighting between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russian separatists in recent days. On Saturday, at least 30 civilians were killed in shelling in the southeastern city of Mariupol, while eight people died when a transit stop in the city of Donetsk was shelled Thursday. Both sides blamed the other for the deaths. Speaking after a meeting with the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Poroshenko said ""the actions of Russian-backed terrorists and regular Russian troops"" had caused Ukrainians to suffer. ""We are going to file a suit to the Hague tribunal, which must investigate into these crimes against humanity,"" Poroshenko said. ""It is a test for humanity and moral dignity. Because turning a blind eye to such horrible and shameful crimes means indulging terrorists and aggressors and violating high European values for which Ukrainians are suffering and dying."" On Sunday, Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council authorized the government to initiate the Hague action, it said in a statement. It said it would ask for the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic to be designated terrorist organizations. The International Criminal Court at the Hague is a permanent body established by 120 nations to investigate ""the most serious crimes of concern to the international community."" Earlier Monday, Moscow stepped up its war of words over Ukraine, warning Western countries not to give Kiev the impression it had their automatic support regardless of its actions. At a press conference in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov blamed Kiev for the renewed fighting and civilian deaths and questioned the West's lack of condemnation. Lavrov said Moscow -- which accuses Ukrainian forces of responsibility -- had not heard a single statement from the West criticizing Kiev. ""We hope our Western partners won't stay away, and European countries, primarily France and Germany who are taking part in so called Normandy format, and mainly the U.S. won't do anything to create an illusion for Kiev's government that its actions lead to automatic support in the West."" Lavrov said there was no other path to resolve Ukraine than direct dialogue between Ukraine's conflicting sides. Fighting between Ukraine government forces and pro-Russian separatists broke out last spring, slowing for a short-lived ceasefire agreed to in  Minsk, Belarus, in September. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending troops and equipment over the border to help the separatists, allegations that Russia denies. The United States and European Union have imposed financial sanctions against Russian interests. The U.S. State Department on Sunday said Secretary of State John Kerry and Lavrov had spoken by phone about the shelling of civilians. ""The secretary reiterated our condemnation of the separatists' grad missile attack on civilians in Mariupol yesterday 25 kilometers beyond the Minsk line, and other separatist attacks in blatant violation of the agreement. ""The secretary reiterated the need for an immediate resumption of the ceasefire, a withdrawal of heavy weapons, and closing the border. He also underscored U.S. readiness to participate in serious settlement efforts, making clear that de-escalation is in everyone's interests, that Russia will be judged by its actions, and that the costs to Russia will only increase if attacks continue,"" a representative said. The White House says Vice President Biden also spoke with Ukrainian President Poroshenko on Saturday. They ""expressed grave concern over Russia's blatant disregard for its commitments under the September Minsk agreement and unilateral escalation of the conflict,"" the White House said. The two leaders vowed to ""ensure that the costs continue to rise on Russia for its aggressive actions against Ukraine."" ""Those who give such criminal orders bear responsibility for this. People doing that should know that there is no other way of resolving such conflicts than peace negotiations and political measures,"" he said. On Monday, the state-run Itar-Tass news agency reported Russian President Vladimir Putin as saying a ""NATO legion"" was working in Ukraine with the aim of containing Russia. ""In essence, this is already not an army, but a foreign legion, in this case NATO's foreign legion that certainly does not pursue the goal of defending Ukraine's national interests,"" Itar-Tass quoted Putin as saying. But following a special session of NATO's Ukraine commission in Brussels, Belgium, Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told journalists that Putin's allegations were ""nonsense."" Stoltenberg said there was no NATO legion and ""the only foreign forces in Ukraine are Russian."" The conflict in eastern Ukraine broke out last spring after Russia annexed Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region and as pro-Russia separatists claimed control of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. The ceasefire from Minsk crumbled long ago. From mid-April to January 21, the conflict killed at least 5,086 people and injured at least 10,948 others, according to the United Nations. No truce with Ukraine, rebel leader says . ""We fear that the real figure may be considerably higher,""  the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said about the death toll in a report released Friday.","Ukraine's President says Kiev will ask Hague tribunal to investigate alleged crimes .

"A silent, nimble, two-wheeled killing machine. That's what Pentagon researchers envision, now that they've greenlighted developing a hybrid motorcycle powered by two sources: an engine that burns several types of fuel and a stealthy, super-quiet electric motor. Imagine an elite U.S. fighting force deployed in a mountainous region of Afghanistan, riding motorbikes that are nearly silent. The loudest sound is tires on dirt as they twist and turn down dried river beds and up narrow goat trails. When they launch their assault on a Taliban stronghold, the enemy is taken by surprise. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has tapped defense contractor Logos Technologies and motorcycle maker BRD to design the motorbike. As a platform for the project, Logos is talking about BRD's 250-pound RedShift MX. Although the RedShift MX is totally electric, Logos wants to combine that with an engine that burns regular gasoline, as well as jet fuel and diesel. It's expected to have a range of 100 miles and make very little noise, even when the conventional engine is running. ""It looks like a nice bike,"" said Michael Golembesky, a former Marine Corps special operations staff sergeant, after watching a CNN video of the RedShift MX. ""I don't know about that wheelie action though,"" he laughed. ""I can't see any of our guys doin' that."" Troops mounted on stealth bikes could deploy via helicopters or verticle-landing V-22 Ospreys and later switch to silent mode for the final leg of their ground approach, Logos said. Controlling engine noise would be an important weapon for bike-mounted forces, Golembesky said. But Golembesky said Pentagon motorcycle developers should keep this in mind: ""The guys on the ground love to keep it simple. It has to be simple because as soon as you start making things complex, things break, fall apart, it's less feasible."" Golembesky -- now a 30-something Colorado-based defense contractor and writer -- knows a thing or two about fighting Taliban on wheels in the Afghan mountains. He did it for about a year with the U.S. Marine Corps Forces Special Operations Command after two deployments in Iraq. During his time in Afghanistan with MARSOC, Golembesky and his teammates used small, four-wheeled, all-terrain vehicles to push quickly through rough topography during anti-Taliban missions. Soon after he left the unit in 2010, Golembesky said Marine special ops in Afghanistan began improvising and bringing motorcycles into their weapons arsenal. They started acquiring cheap ""Chinese knockoff"" motorbikes in Afghan bazaars and customizing them. ""They'd weld racks on the back and repaint them, camouflage them down,"" he said. ""The bikes mainly became a way to overcome covering long distances over harsh terrain."" It was really a case of fighting fire with fire. Taliban have been riding mopeds and motorcycles to attack U.S. forces since the beginning of the war in 2001, said Golembesky. ""They know the most practical, low stress, low impact way to get around the battlefield and maneuver."" Soon the Marines developed tactics using the bikes. They announced a formal training program in 2012. Troops rode the motorcycles regularly during MARSOC combat reconnaissance patrols, Golembesky said. ""The bikes allowed Marines to patrol larger areas, to easily and quickly zip up hills. Quick access to higher terrain allowed a tactical advantage which was often safer than, say, a low-lying village, where Marines might risk getting caught in an ambush. Another advantage: By constantly moving on motorbikes, special ops forces keep enemies guessing about their location. Taliban ""don't know where you're going and they don't know what your intent is,"" Golembesky said. ""The motorbike just amplifies that."" U.S. forces can use the bikes to sneak up behind enemies or block their escape. ""You can do a lot of damage, just having that mobility."" American special forces including Navy SEALs and Air Force combat controllers have been using motorcycles for their operations for years. Logos says the widely used current U.S. military motorcycle -- imaginatively dubbed the M1030M1 -- is based on a platform that's nearly 30 years old. Golembesky's forthcoming book on MARSOC operations in Afghanistan, ""Level Zero Heroes,"" is set to drop in September. The book follows a 2012 article that grabbed attention on military blogs. Its title: ""MARSOC Motorcycle Gangs in Afghanistan."" ""Whenever you get a bunch of guys together on motorcycles with firepower, it's basically a gang,"" Golembesky said. ""A very lethal gang.""","The Pentagon is developing a silent, rugged combat motorcycle .

"Ever wondered how to drive from the center of Pyongyang, the showcase capital of North Korea, to Yongbyon, the location of the secretive regime's main nuclear complex? Well, a recent update to Google Maps has the answer for you. It has filled in the big, largely blank space that previously lay north of the well-mapped South Korea with streets, towns and landmarks. Users curious to virtually explore one of the world's most reclusive states can zoom into the heart of Pyongyang and pull up photographs of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, which houses the bodies of the revered former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. The availability of photos quickly thins as users scroll into the North Korean countryside and dries up almost entirely around more controversial areas marked on the map, like the Yongbyon nuclear complex and what Google labels the Yodok and Hwasong gulags. Human rights groups say as many as 200,000 people may be being held in North Korea's network of political prison camps. The Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Facility, where the regime may be about to carry out a new nuclear test in defiance of international pressure, doesn't appear to be featured on the map at the moment. 'A community of citizen cartographers' In a blog post Monday announcing the update, Google said that North Korea had been one of the largest places with limited map data in the world. Unsurprisingly, the details added to the map didn't come from the young North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's regime. Google said ""a community of citizen cartographers"" used the Internet search giant's Google Map Maker software over a period of years to pinpoint road and place names. Google Map Maker works in a similar way to Wikipedia, allowing users to add, edit and review information. The company encouraged people to keep working on the maps, saying, ""Creating maps is a crucial first step towards helping people access more information about parts of the world that are unfamiliar to them."" It said the North Korean maps could be particularly useful to South Korean citizens, ""who have ancestral connections or still have family living there."" Restrictions inside . But people inside North Korea, where the Internet is extremely restricted, are unlikely to be able to see the mapping information Google is making available. The company's executive chairman, Eric Schmidt, visited North Korea earlier this month along with former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson in a trip that left many observers puzzled. Schmidt, who has in the past written at length about the Web's ability to empower citizens oppressed by autocratic governments, urged North Korea to embrace the Internet or face further decline in its impoverished economy. Schmidt's daughter Sophie, who accompanied him on the trip, said in blog post about the visit that they had been able to take a look at North Korea's national intranet, which she described as ""a walled garden of scrubbed content taken from the real Internet.""","Google publishes detailed maps of North Korea for the first time .

"Got bottled water? Food? Sandbags? Batteries? Toilet paper? Those are questions that millions of people in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast are asking themselves this weekend, as they prepare for Hurricane Sandy -- which has already proven to be a deadly storm and is threatening heartache, and headaches, as it creeps toward the region. Local and state officials have joined meteorologists in trumpeting the storm's potential breadth and impact, especially if it collides with a cold front from the West to create a ""superstorm"" that stalls over the Eastern Seaboard for days. Computer models predict portions of Delaware, Maryland and Virginia could see up to a foot of rain, according to the CNN Weather Unit. And even though it's still October, communities in and around the Appalachian Mountains could be socked by heavy snow. A state-by-state breakdown of hurricane preparation efforts . Anne Hargrove, for one, has gotten the hint -- and, as evidenced by her fruitless trips Friday night to Northern Virginia supermarkets, pharmacies and big-box stores such as Walmart, so, too, have many of her neighbors. She found no C or D batteries and no small water bottles, but did come away with other essentials just in case the storm knocks out her electricity. ""Basically, I got (jugs of) water, toilet paper, paper towels, paper plates, paper cups, flashlights,"" Hargrove said Saturday in Alexandria. ""The reason I did it last night was because I knew if I waited until today, I'd have to drive like 50 miles to find the place that still had it."" Sandy already disrupting transportation . The rush to stay ahead of the storm is something that Richard Heilman noticed, too, as he stood in front of empty shelves at his Ace Hardware store in the Virginia city. If the emphatic warnings from officials weren't enough, fresh memories of recent long stretches without power over the past year or so -- including a devastating and deadly storm system this summer that left millions in the dark for about a week -- have spurred many to get out and not be caught flat-footed. Keep a hurricane preparation checklist . ""People are a little bit more, hey, maybe I should go get my batteries now instead of waiting until they're all gone,"" Heilman said. For some, simply stocking up is not enough. Residents of New Jersey's barrier islands, from Sandy Hook south to Cape May, were ordered to evacuate by Sunday afternoon, as were people at Atlantic City casinos. ""I would much rather people stay in their homes,"" said Gov. Chris Christie, who issued the order Saturday. ""But the fact of the matter is, if we're looking at hurricane force winds on the barrier islands sustained for 24 hours or more,  it is simply unsafe for people to be there."" Carol Elliott said she was concerned, but won't be leaving her North Wildwood home -- because she doesn't have anywhere else to go. Others, though, planned to abide by the order -- and keep their fingers crossed that Sandy doesn't prove to be as fierce as feared. ""I'm heeding the warning and we're going,"" Cheryl Nolan told CNN affiliate WKYW. ""And I'm hoping that I have a house when I come back."" It won't be until late Sunday, and in some cases Monday, when the Category 1 hurricane makes its full impact known on the United States. But the storm, which Saturday night boasted 75 mph sustained winds that extend out 105 miles from its center, has already proved its might as it spun northward from the Caribbean. Officials blame Sandy for at least 45 deaths. That figure includes 29 people in Haiti, with four more reported missing, Civil Protection spokesman Joseph Edgard Celestin said. Another 16 people were reported dead in Cuba, Jamaica, Panama, the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. While locales as far south as Charleston, South Carolina, got drenched, strong winds and pelting rains lashed North Carolina's Outer Banks late Saturday afternoon. The National Weather Service estimates places such as Kill Devil Hills will get between 4 to 7 inches of rain over several days, though storm surges were a parallel and, in some places, more severe concern. Farther south in Atlantic Beach, North Carolina, Jimmy Butts raised hurricane warning flags over his seaside bar Saturday. ""It's going to be a ... strong mullet blow, what we call here in the fall,"" Butts told CNN affiliate WSOC. ""(There will) be a lot of rain and maybe 30, 40 mph winds."" 'Superstorm' meets barnstorm as weather and politics collide . As of 11 p.m., Sandy was centered about 360 miles east-southeast of Charleston and 305 miles south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, according to the National Hurricane Center. Now heading northeast at a 14 mph rate, the storm is expected eventually to boomerang toward the shore and begin seriously impacting heavily populated areas Sunday. Forecasters are still trying to pinpoint where it will its biggest impact when it finally does come entirely over land. Computer models show it striking somewhere along a roughly 700-mile stretch -- from North Carolina to as far north as Connecticut. Its potential merger with the cold front could ""energize this system"" and make it more powerful, said Louis Uccellini, who is responsible for environmental prediction at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Such a scenario is not unlike the weather system that led to 1991's ""Perfect Storm,"" when moisture flung north by Hurricane Grace combined with a high pressure system and a cold front to produce a tempest in the north Atlantic during Halloween. But Grace never made landfall. Hurricane safety: When the lights go out . Anne Kennedy headed on Saturday to RFK Stadium, like many other Washington, D.C., residents, to fill up her car's trunk with sandbags that she'll pass onto her daughter, who has two babies at home. Amid all the frenzy, Kennedy said she's gotten the point. ""I just turned off the news,"" she said. ""It's too much."" Some have resigned themselves to the fact that Mother Nature is in charge -- and that, whatever they do, it won't stop the wind, rain or storm surges. ""The most stressful thing is to stand in your house, watch the water come up, and there's nothing you can do,"" Norfolk, Virginia, resident Bill Sawyer told CNN affiliate WVEC. ""It's going to keep coming. And then you're stuck, because now you can't get out of your house."" Stay well-fed in any disaster .","Hurricane-force winds extend 105 miles out from Sandy's center .

"(CNN)Twice-convicted murderer Warren Lee Hill is set to be executed in Georgia on Tuesday night despite pleas from human rights groups and legal representatives who say his intellectual disability should make him ineligible for the death penalty. Hill has an IQ of approximately 70 and the ""emotional capacity of a young boy,"" said his attorney, Brian Kammer. Federal law stemming from a 2002 Virginia case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court says executing intellectually disabled individuals violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. But the case also allows states to define intellectual disability. In Georgia, that means attorneys for death row inmates have to prove mental impairment ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""This is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation,"" Kammer said. Hill's execution would come two weeks after the state executed Andrew Brannan, a Vietnam War veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who killed Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller in 1998. Kammer also was Brannan's counsel. Kammer, who has represented Hill for 20 years, said in any other state, Hill would be serving a life sentence. Hill was sentenced to death in 1990 for killing fellow prison inmate Joseph Handspike, beating him to death with a nail-studded board. At the time, Hill had been serving a life sentence for the 1985 shooting death of his girlfriend Myra Wright. ""We acknowledge that Mr. Hill should be held accountable for his actions and behavior,"" Torin Togut, president of the Arc of Georgia, said in a letter written on Hill's behalf. ""However, it is our contention that Mr. Hill, who has an intellectual disability, should not be subject to capital punishment."" The Arc is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Hill also has the support of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, the Georgia NAACP and former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter. The victim's family and former jurors have also expressed support for mercy in Hill's case, saying they weren't given the option of life without parole when sentencing him to death. Kammer said seven doctors agree that his client is intellectually disabled, including three doctors for the state who initially evaluated Hill and said he didn't meet Georgia's standard. Kammer said those doctors have since signed an affidavit admitting they felt rushed during Hill's examination and now believe he does meet the standard for ""intellectually disabled."" In previous clemency hearings, attorneys for the state have argued that Hill served in the Navy, held a job and managed his money before killing his girlfriend -- signs that he didn't necessarily meet the legal standard for intellectually disabled, even though he has a low IQ. But Kammer said examples of Hill achieving ""self-sufficiency"" don't make a strong case for his execution. Several of the letters supporting Hill's clemency cite last year's Supreme Court decision that struck down a Florida law that used ""unscientific standards for determining intellectual disability"" for death row inmates.

"A very old spy plane and a very new computer system played pivotal roles in last week's computer glitch that temporarily paralyzed flight operations in southern California, officials tell CNN. The problem involved a U-2 aircraft, the type famed for conducting reconnaissance missions over the Soviet Union during the Cold War. A Federal Aviation Administration computer system interpreted the U-2's flight path at a very high altitude as if it were flying in a much lower and more crowded airspace. The computer -- which anticipates the flight path and looks for possible conflicts such as other aircraft or restricted airspace -- was overtaxed by the many flight changes the U-2 had plotted, officials said. That work used much of the computer's memory and interrupted its other flight-processing functions, FAA spokeswoman Laura Brown said in a statement. The agency said it has added computer memory to prevent a recurrence, while others said officials are racing to install a more permanent computer patch. The hourlong computer shutdown Wednesday afternoon led to dozens of delayed, diverted and canceled flights but did not result in any mishaps. It had the most impact in the Los Angeles area, where flights were grounded while experts sought to troubleshoot the problem. The side effects lasted almost half a day. To resolve the issue, the FAA ""has enabled facilities that use the computer system to significantly increase the amount of flight-processing memory available. The FAA is confident these steps will prevent a reoccurrence of this specific problem and other potential similar issues going forward,"" Brown said. Two FAA officials, speaking on background Monday, blamed the shutdown on the unlikely convergence of two events. First, a U-2 aircraft flew a path that involved numerous waypoints and altitude changes in airspace controlled by three facilities. Those facilities were the Los Angeles and Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Centers, and the High Desert TRACON at Edwards Air Force Base. Simultaneously, there was an outage of the Federal Telecommunications Infrastructure, a primary conduit of information among FAA facilities. ""That (U-2) flight plan, coupled with the FTI outage, in essence created a perfect storm,"" one official said. The U.S. Air Force has 32 U-2 aircraft, which are capable of flying at altitudes up to 90,000 feet, according to IHS Jane's. U.S. stealth and spy planes . The fact the plane was a U-2 was not significant, one FAA official said. But the plane's many waypoints, or geographic fixes, and its numerous altitude changes overwhelmed a system that projects the flights path and anticipates problems. The situation was complicated by the FTI outage, one official said. That overtaxed the FAA's flight-processing system, which in turn brought down the FAA's new En Route Automation Modernization system, which manages high-altitude air traffic. The FAA official likened it to a problem with a software program causing a laptop computer to crash.","An FAA computer system misinterpreted a spy plane's altitude and path .

"Davos, Switzerland (CNN)  -- Despite deep public spending cuts that triggered waves of protests last year, Greece will not default on its debt payment obligations, Prime Minister George Papandreou told CNN. ""This is not on the books ... it's not on our road map. And this is why we are talking about these other measures, which we think are enough to be able to make things sustainable,"" Papandreou told CNN's Richard Quest on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos Thursday. ""Obviously (it will be) difficult, but we have been doing our work, and we will be successful,"" he said. The economic troubles in Greece last year sparked a wave of sovereign debt woes across Europe, especially hitting Ireland, Spain and Portugal. The value of the euro cratered during the debt crisis and raised lingering questions about the viability of the 17-nation monetary union. A Bloomberg Global Poll released this week at Davos show 59% of respondents believe that at least one or more euro nation would break from the monetary union by 2016, and nearly three-quarters polled thought Greece would default on its loans. ""Well, maybe people will believe things, but that's why we politicians are here, to put things on the right course,"" Papandreou said when asked about the poll. ""And there is the political will of our peoples and the leaders of the European Union ... to make sure that in 2016 and 2020 and on, the euro will exist."" His comments echoed the sentiment French President Nicolas Sarkozy who in his Davos address Thursday said: ""We will never abandon the euro. Never! Euro spells Europe, the euro is Europe. Europe has meant 60 years of peace on our continent. We will never abandon that."" Sarkozy's spirited defense of the euro underlined how high the stakes have become for the economic evolution of the continent. ""To imagine that we might pull out of that is to ignore the fact that as people who have been at each other's throats for centuries, we now have one wish, and that is lasting peace,"" Sarkozy said. But European Monetary Union has been challenged as the bailout of Greece thrust the spotlight on the uneven economics among member nations. Besides debt woes in Greece, countries like Ireland and Spain were deeply exposed to the crash of the housing bubble. Meanwhile, the German economy -- the largest in Europe -- enjoyed its fastest expansion in two decades last year and its largest growth in GDP since Germany reunified in 1990. Concern has grown of an unfair burden placed on larger economies by the problems of smaller economies like Greece. But Papandreou said Greece is well on its way toward reducing its debt. ""We have made very good progress, because we're on track, and I would say, even, beyond. We have cut the deficit by over 6.5 percent, which is a huge cut,"" Papandreou said. ""We've changed our pension system, it's now a viable pension system, one of the most viable in Europe. We've changed our tax system, it's transparent, more effective, hitting tax evasion,"" he said. ""But the structural things we're changing are actually going to bring growth."" Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the European Central Bank, told CNN ""this is no time for complacency -- that is absolutely clear. But let me tell you, nevertheless, that the real economy is giving signs that are encouraging. ""The main risk is to practice benign neglect ... as soon as things are going better, to forget that we had to cope with a very, very demanding crisis,"" Trichet said. ""So, we have to draw all the lessons."" CNN's Richard Quest, Kevin Voigt and Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","Prime Minister Papandreou: Greece will not default on its debt payment obligations .

"Google Reader, one of the best-known feeds through which users can pull together their favorite Web content in one place, will be shutting down, the company announced. In an age of Facebook posts and retweets, Google Senior Vice President Urs Holzle said in a post on the official Google blog that Reader was losing popularity. ""While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined,"" Holzle wrote. Reader will be shut down on July 1. Users wanting to port their content to another RSS (rich site summary) feed can use Google Takeout to move it over the next four months. The move is part of a massive ""spring cleaning"" that Google began in 2011 and which has nuked about 70 of its wide array of products. The point is focus in a time when mobile technology is dramatically and quickly changing the computing world, said Holzle. ""It's been a long time since we have had this rate of change -- it probably hasn't happened since the birth of personal computing 40 years ago,"" he wrote. ""To make the most of these opportunities, we need to focus -- otherwise we spread ourselves too thin and lack impact. Among the 40 shutdowns announced Wednesday also were the Google Voice app for BlackBerry, the desktop version of photo app Snapseed, Google Cloud Connect and Google Building Maker, which lets users create models of buildings on Google Earth and Google Maps. Released in 2005, Google Reader was begun four years earlier as a project called JavaCollect by independent software engineer Chris Wetherell. After joining Google, he worked with a team to perfect and enhance it. ""We know Reader has a devoted following who will be very sad to see it go,"" said software engineer  Alan Green on the Google Reader blog. ""We're sad too."" Reader, and RSS feeds in general, remain popular with active, Web-savvy users who rely upon them to pull together the best of the Internet in one easy-to-read stream. But they never caught on among more casual users content to visit their favorite sites or rely on friends on social media to share interesting posts. The feeds are also difficult to make money from, and Google never tried to place ads on Reader or charge for its use. Indeed. Within hours of the announcement, several online petitions to save the service had gotten thousands of signatures. On petition site Change.org, more than 46,000 people had signed the petition ""Google: Keep Google Reader Running."" ""Our confidence in Google's other products -- Gmail, YouTube, and yes, even Plus -- requires that we trust you in respecting how and why we use your other products,"" wrote Dan Lewis, of New York City, who created the petition. ""This isn't just about our data in Reader. This is about us using your product because we love it, because it makes our lives better, and because we trust you not to nuke it."" There are several alternatives for Reader users, some of which have sprung up recently. Feedly and Pulse offer Web-based RSS feeds that also have mobile apps for Apple's iOS and Android. Zite (which is owned by CNN) lets users create a feed based on their interests then refine the feed by voting content up or down. It uses Google Reader info to help select content. Rival Flipboard allows users to directly import their Google Reader content, a point they expressly made in a post Thursday.","Google announces plans to shut down Google Reader .

"Ten months ago, Vanessa Thiemann lay in bed unable to sleep. The 42-year-old single mother of two had a sinus infection, and the pain was making her restless. She tried getting comfortable on her left side, then her right, but she ended up staring at the ceiling in complete darkness, her left hand coming to rest on her chest. It was at that moment her fingers brushed a tiny knob under her skin. ""I felt a rock-hard lump next to my nipple,"" Thiemann recalls.  ""I just knew at that moment I had cancer."" Thiemann did have cancer.  And while her breast surgeon assured her the tumor was isolated to her right breast, and she knew she had no family history of the disease, Thiemann opted for a double mastectomy. ""It was important to me to remove both breasts,"" she says.  ""I knew that if I kept my other breast, I would obsess over it, and I'd always worry that cancer would develop there, too."" Researchers are paying close attention to the increasing rate of double mastectomies in the United States. The number of women with early stage breast cancer who went on to remove both breasts (even though only one breast had cancer) increased by more than 150% between 1998 and 2003, according to a study presented by Dr. Kelly Hunt at the annual conference for the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Since that meeting, Hunt has continued crunching the numbers. In unpublished reports released to CNN, 8% of patients sought prophylactic removal of their unaffected breast at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston in 2010.  The percentage increased to 12.6% in 2011, and rose again to 14.1% in 2012, according to Hunt, who is chief of breast surgery at MD Anderson. Data from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center echo these numbers. The rate for women choosing to remove both breasts when only one has cancer jumped from 6.7% in 1997 to 24% in 2005, according to a 2011 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. And from 2005 to 2009, the latest year data is available, the proportion of women undergoing mastectomies overall also rose, according to Kathy Cronin, a statistician with the National Cancer Institute. Experts say several intersecting factors could be fueling this trend. Actress Kathy Bates recovering from double mastectomy . Access to genetic screening . Since testing became available in 1996, nearly 1 million people have been screened for BRCA1 and BRCA2, the genetic mutations associated with increasing a woman's lifetime risk of developing breast cancer as much as 87%, according to Myriad Genetics, the diagnostic company that helped isolate the two genes and later developed a test to detect them. For women who test positive, removing both breasts is seen as a viable, cancer-preventing option -- especially in the United States. In a global study conducted by Dr. Steven Narod, senior scientist at Women's College Research Institute in Toronto, the United States had the highest rate of prophylactic mastectomy in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. The U.S. rate was 36.3%, far outpacing the number of preventive surgeries performed by the majority of other countries Narod studied, including France and Canada. One reason for the spike may be that American women fear cancer more than women in other regions. About 70% of women in the United States who have both breasts removed after a cancer diagnosis don't have a proven medical reason for undergoing the procedure, according to a 2012 study conducted by the University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center. ""The dilemma we're facing is more and more women are choosing to remove both breasts,"" said Dr. Michael Sabel, associate professor of surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School, in a statement announcing the findings. ""We're greatly overestimating the risk of women with breast cancer developing another breast cancer."" However, authors of the study indicate that a double mastectomy may make sense for women with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer, or for women who've tested positive for genetic mutations in the BRCA genes. Dr. Susan Domchek, executive director of the Basser Research Center for BRCA at the University of Pennsylvania, said the escalating rate is linked to easy access of information. ""The data we've been collecting is evolving quickly, and these women are living with this information in real time,"" she said in an e-mail.  ""Since 1994 enormous progress had occurred: (T)he genes have been cloned, clinically available tests for gene mutations have been developed, and the implications of having BRCA1/2 mutations are better understood. Women as young as 25 are using this data to make informed choices."" Sharon Osbourne opens up on double mastectomy . Advances in plastic surgery . Women today have access to breast reconstruction options that were unavailable to their mothers and grandmothers. Doctors are increasingly avoiding the use of implants by taking fat from a patient's stomach, upper back, buttock or thigh to construct and shape new breasts. If a woman decides to go with implants, they've been made safer and more comfortable, and surgeons increasingly offer immediate implant reconstruction instead of the traditional multistep process that took months of additional doctor visits. Cosmetic outcomes have never been better, said Dr. Malcolm Roth, chief of plastic surgery at Albany Medical Center in New York and past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. ""It's hard to believe that implants have only been widely available since the 1970s. Before then, and it's really not that long ago, women were subjected to wearing falsies. The options available today have dramatically improved the way a woman looks after surgery. And with even better microsurgery options on the way, I imagine we'll see even higher numbers of women choosing mastectomy."" One such technique, if put into commercial practice, may raise ethical red flags. According to Roth, doctors are working on a new procedure that would one day make it possible for individuals to donate their excess fat -- similar to the way blood is donated today -- so women seeking a more natural breast reconstruction could take advantage of somebody else's flesh. ""The possibility is being explored with our regenerative medicine task force, and it's very exciting,"" he said.  ""If we can figure out how a patient's body won't reject the tissue, I think we'll see even more women choosing preventative mastectomy down the line."" Why a cancer-free beauty queen wants mastectomy . 'Pink ribbon' culture . A growing awareness of breast cancer survivorship makes undergoing mastectomy not as foreign or frightening as perhaps it once was.  An online search shows a seemingly limitless number of breast cancer support groups, with a growing collection dedicated to women considering preventive surgery. Dr. Mark Sultan, chief of the division of plastic and reconstructive surgery at St. Luke's/Roosevelt and Beth Israel Medical Centers in New York, said he's seen a 20% increase in five years of high-risk, yet cancer-free women coming to his office seeking mastectomies. These patients often arrive telling him what kind of surgery they want because they've read about certain procedures online, and in many cases, they've viewed hundreds of before-and-after photos as well. In addition, surgeons are marketing themselves directly to information-hungry patients online. Doctors are holding Twitter chats and creating websites to promote their services. At the Stanford University School of Medicine, a breast surgeon has even launched an online guide to help women decide if preventive surgery is right for them. Dr. Deanna Attai, a board member at the American Society of Breast Surgeons and Thiemann's breast surgeon in Los Angeles, was heading into two back-to-back surgeries last month when she spoke. One of her patients, just like Thiemann, had cancer in one breast and not the other. ""This is the American culture,"" she said. ""We want quick solutions, and we expect there's an answer to every problem. In many cases these women don't need double mastectomies, but my job is to listen, make sure they have all the information and give them what makes sense and puts them most at ease."" Which is certainly the case for Thiemann. ""I chose to remove both breasts, even though I'm sure some would say it was a hysterical choice,"" she said. ""I don't have BRCA1 or BRCA2, but I do have two daughters. I wanted to do whatever I could to be around for them as long as possible.""","Study: Rate of women with early stage cancer choosing double mastectomies rose 150% .
Availability of genetic testing, better plastic surgery options may be behind the increase .
""Pink ribbon"" culture also may be spreading awareness about women's survival options ."
"Ukraine released 67 people Sunday who were detained for participating in violent clashes after pro-Russian protesters stormed the police headquarters in Odessa, demanding they be let go. ""Based on the decision taken by Odessa's regional prosecutor's office and due to the demands of the protesters, 67 people previously detained for participating in mass disturbances on May 2nd in Odessa were released Sunday,"" said a statement on the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's website. The local prosecutor's office immediately denied it was involved in the decision. The choice to release the detainees, it said in a Sunday statement, was made by police after officers failed to fulfill their duties. The prosecutor's office said it has opened a criminal investigation into their actions. Earlier, hundreds of pro-Russian activists shouting, ""Odessa is a Russian city, one for all and all for one,"" attacked the police headquarters, forcing open its gate and breaking windows as they called for the release of their detained comrades. In a tense scene filled with arguments -- but with no shots fired -- the separatists took down the Ukrainian flag and persuaded the officers to release the detainees, according to a CNN team on the ground. The crowd cheered as the detainees left the police compound, and many were embraced by friends and relatives. Elsewhere in Odessa, hundreds of pro-Ukrainian supporters marched to a trade union building where a fire had previously broken out. They held a memorial there. The protesters demanded an explanation for why the pro-Russian detainees were released. A pro-Ukrainian demonstrator replaced a Russian flag on the union building with a Ukrainian one. There were no reports of violence. Prime Minister visits Odessa after bloodshed . Earlier in the day, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk had visited  the Black Sea port city, two days after a street battle between Russian supporters and opponents ended in a deadly blaze that killed more than 40 people. Yatsenyuk met with social, political, cultural and economic leaders from the region, his office said. A minute's silence was held at the start of the meeting for those who died in Friday's bloodshed, the worst so far in a region that has seen spiraling violence. Speaking to reporters, the prime minister called for unity as he accused those ""sponsored by Russian Special Services"" for the unrest in the eastern part of his country. He also said that in the last 24 hours, there had been a ""very active relocation of the troops from Russia to Crimea"" -- which Moscow annexed in March -- but he did not provide details. The violence in eastern Ukraine pits pro-Russian separatists against Ukrainian forces and those who support the new Western-backed government in Kiev.  It has escalated into a diplomatic crisis, with Russia demanding an end to what it called Ukrainian aggression and Western powers accusing Moscow of funding the violence. ""The process of dialogue had begun, only it was drowned out by the shots from Russian-made Kalashnikovs,"" Yatsenyuk said, accusing those behind the unrest in the east of ""trying to split our people by history, culture, language, ideology, territory ... We can only win through a dialogue and unity."" Seeking to reassure a local population that has grown increasingly weary of the new leaders in Kiev, Yatsenyuk also talked about decentralizing power locally as well as providing guarantees, potentially in the constitution, for minority languages. Many in the east are Russian speakers. ""We need to preserve the country, Odessa and each human life; this is our common duty,"" he said. Forty-six people died in the bloodshed, a representative for the prosecutor's office told CNN.  Six were killed in the clashes, the remainder in the fire. Of those, 32 people died due to smoke inhalation, while eight were killed trying to jump out of the burning building. Video posted on YouTube appeared to show supporters of Kiev's government throwing Molotov cocktails at the building where pro-Russian separatists had reportedly taken up positions. The footage, which CNN could not independently confirm, showed people sitting on ledges trying to escape the fire and thick smoke. Military action . On Saturday, a team of international military observers seized by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine was freed, as Kiev resumed military action to tackle the pro-Moscow gunmen who have overrun the region. Residents in Kramatorsk, which is some 16 kilometers (10 miles) south of the flashpoint city Slavyansk, reported hearing gunfire, as Ukraine's embattled new leaders launched their most intensive effort yet to try to dislodge the rebels who have reportedly seized government buildings in nearly a dozen cities and towns. A CNN team on the outskirts of Kramatorsk saw troop carriers moving toward the city center on Saturday. Amateur video posted online -- the authenticity of which could not be confirmed by CNN -- showed burned buses, plumes of smoke and residents calmly observing it all. In another challenge to Kiev, separatist leader Valeriy Bolotov in Luhansk declared a state of emergency and announced the formation of a ""South-East"" army for the entire region. In a video statement aired on local stations, Bolotov also introduced a curfew, a ban on political parties, and his expectation that local law enforcement officials will take an oath of allegiance to the people of Luhansk. In Donetsk, separatists say they are preparing their own referendum on May 11 to ask residents whether they want sovereignty from Ukraine -- an echo of events that led to Moscow wresting Crimea from Kiev. Denis Pushilin, the self-declared chairman of the Donetsk People's Republic, told CNN the question on the ballot paper would read: ""Do you support the act of state sovereignty of the Donetsk Republic?""  to which voters can respond with ""Yes"" or ""No.""  He said enough ballot papers had already been printed to hold the vote. Separatists, many of them of Russian descent, believe the government in Kiev is illegitimate because it formed after what they call the illegal ousting of pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych in February. Officials in Kiev accuse Moscow of meddling with by supporting the separatists. NATO has estimated up to 40,000 Russian troops are now near the border with Ukraine, which has made not just Kiev's government but also other neighboring nations wary of invasion. Russia and the West squared off diplomatically over the fate of Ukraine after Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in March after a hastily called referendum and Yanukovych's ouster. He was pushed from office after months of protests by people upset that he had turned away from Europe in favor of Moscow. Russia has condemned Kiev's military action in the volatile east. In a phone call Saturday with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: ""(The) punitive operation in the southeastern Ukraine plunges the country into fratricidal conflict."" Dmitry Peskov, Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, said Russia's government had received thousands of calls since Friday from people in southeastern Ukraine. The callers described the situation as ""horrendous"" and pleaded for Russia's involvement. ""Most of the people literally demand active help from Russia,"" he said.

"Horsemeat has been discovered in products labeled as 100% beef and sold in Sweden, the United Kingdom and France. Food authorities in those countries have launched investigations but the supply chain being studied includes still more countries. We look at the implications. How did the presence of horsemeat come to light? In January, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA, while 23 of them tested positive for pig DNA. In one sample from Tesco -- Britain's largest grocery chain -- the horsemeat accounted for about 29% of the burger. Read more: Horsemeat found in hamburgers in Britain and Ireland . On Monday February 4, Swedish food producer Findus withdrew its frozen lasagna -- labeled with the British spelling, ""lasagne"" -- from British stores as a precaution after its French supplier, Comigel, raised concerns about the type of meat used. On Wednesday February 6, tests confirmed that horsemeat was present in a number of samples. The next day, Britain's Food Standards Agency (FSA) confirmed that ""meat content of beef lasagne products recalled by Findus has tested positive for more than 60% horse meat."" Findus said a letter from Comigel dated February 2 suggested the contamination might date back to August 2012. Then on Friday February 8, retailer Aldi withdrew two products -- Today's Special Frozen Beef Lasagne and Today's Special Frozen Spaghetti Bolognese -- after they were found to contain between 30% and 100% horse meat. The products implicated were also from French supplier, Comigel. On Monday February 11, Tesco announced that it had found horsemeat in some Everyday Value Spaghetti Bolognese - which it had withdrawn from sale a week earlier as a precaution. It said no evidence of the veterinary drug phenylbutazone - or bute - had been found. Which other countries are affected? Agence France-Presse (AFP) has reported that Comigel supplies products to customers in 16 countries. Findus France has temporarily withdrawn three ready-prepared dishes -- lasagna Bolognese, shepherd's pie and moussaka -- because of the discovery of horsemeat in products that should be 100% beef. Six big French retailers -- Auchan, Casino, Carrefour, Cora, Picard and Monoprix -- have also said they are recalling lasagne and other products. Some companies in Sweden supplied by Comigel -- including Axfood, Coop, and ICA -- have also pulled certain meat products from the shelves due to the possibility they contain horsemeat. The Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority confirmed on Tuesday February 12 that Dutch supermarket chains including PLUS and Boni had withdrawn Primafrost brand lasagne from their shelves, while its authenticity was investigated. A spokeswoman said it was a preemptive measure. Will eating horsemeat make me sick? Britain's FSA says horsemeat ""is not a risk in itself"" but that it has ordered Findus to test its lasagne for the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or ""bute."" Bute is not allowed in the food chain because in humans it can cause rare cases of a serious blood disorder, aplastic anaemia. The anti-inflammatory was banned from use in humans after it was found that about 1 person in 30,000 recipients suffered a serious side effect. The FSA said the levels of bute reported in previous testing of contaminated meat would have to be multiplied a thousand-fold to be at the same level as that which used to be given to humans. In a statement, Britain's chief medical officer said: ""It's understandable that people will be concerned, but it is important to emphasize that, even if bute is found to be present at low levels, there is a very low risk indeed that it would cause any harm to health."" How did horsemeat enter the food chain? Britain's FSA said the evidence it had ""points to either gross negligence or deliberate contamination in the food chain."" It said it was working closely with police, who would be involved if evidence suggested a level of criminality within the UK. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the frozen burgers from Tesco and the lasagne from Findus were believed to be linked to suppliers in Ireland and France respectively. Paterson said the French authorities viewed the issue ""as a case of fraud rather than food safety."" In an oral statement to parliament on Monday February 11, Paterson said the ""ultimate source of these incidents is still being investigated."" He said he had been in contact with ministers in Ireland, France and Romania and that the issue appeared to be one of ""fraud and mislabeling."" AFP reported that Comigel had blamed French meat-processing company Spanghero, which blamed Romanian abattoirs where it said the meat was bought via traders in Cyprus and the Netherlands. But Romania's prime minister said the two Romanian slaughterhouses initially suspected to have links to the horse meat scandal never had direct contact with Comigel and had not done anything illegal. Minister of Agriculture Daniel Constantin said there was no evidence false horse meat labeling occurred in Romania. Read more: Battle over blame after horse meat found . What action are food authorities taking? Britain's FSA has ordered food businesses to use independent laboratories to test all beef products for authenticity -- to see whether the content of the meat matches the label. The deadline for the first round of testing is Friday February 15. The FSA has also ordered Findus to test for bute, with results due ""in the next few days"" and to be published on the authority's website. It has advised any retailers or producers that had sourced beef products from Comigel to conduct a precautionary withdrawal of product. In France, consumer affairs minister, Benoit Hamon, has also ordered an immediate investigation and said results will be available by midweek. In a statement, Hamon said a provider in Luxembourg and traders in Cyprus and the Netherlands were part of the chain being probed. The Swedish National Food Agency has announced it is reporting Findus to police, which is the standard course of action when products have been sold with the wrong labels. European Union officials plan to meet in Brussels to discuss the issue on Wednesday February 13. Read more: EU officials to meet about horsemeat scandal . How has the public reacted? The revelations have revolted many meat eaters in the United Kingdom, where horse meat is generally considered taboo, although it is commonly eaten in neighboring France, as well as countries including China, Russia, Kazakhstan and Italy. January's discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horse meat. Read more: Horse: Coming to a meat case near you?","Horsemeat has been found in ""beef"" products sold in Sweden, the UK and France .

"(CNN) -- A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked same-sex marriages in Wisconsin, pending appeals. The same judge last week struck down the state's same-sex marriage ban. She did not stay her ruling then, allowing a number of same-sex marriages to proceed. ""After seeing the expressions of joy on the faces of so many newly wedded couples featured in media reports, I find it difficult to impose a stay on the event that is responsible for eliciting that emotion, even if the stay is only temporary. Same-sex couples have waited many years to receive equal treatment under the law, so it is understandable that they do not want to wait any longer,"" U.S. District Judge Barbara Crabb wrote in her decision Friday. However, she added: ""A federal district court is required to follow the guidance provided by the Supreme Court. Because I see no way to distinguish this case from Herbert, I conclude that I must stay any injunctive relief pending appeal."" Crabb was referring to a Supreme Court case in which same-sex marriages in Utah were put on hold. Speaking about the judge's ruling Friday, Carl Tobias, a constitutional law professor at the University of Richmond, said that Crabb clearly felt constrained by the higher court.

"iReporter Kenny Zhu visited North Korea in April and was able to take video footage and photos with his Google Glass during the trip (the complete iReport is here). Zhu, wearing Google Glass, said he encountered curiosity from officials and was inspected before he was allowed to take pictures with his wearable camera/computer device. ""At the first sight they were able to tell it is a photography device. But without Internet -- no Internet service available for temporary foreign visitors in North Korea, the glasses are just a wearable video camera,"" says Zhu. ""They were suspicious of the Google Glass at first though, asking me some questions about it -- how it work, what does it do, etc.. I let them played around with it and they seemed flattered and inquired no more,"" says Zhu. Got Google Glass? Send an iReport . A DPRK official actually accidentally recorded himself while toying with the Glass but Zhu didn't upload the photos in case there might be consequences, for them or himself. Here are the things that stood out to him the most during the trip, in his words: . 1. North Korea was using Samsung (a South Korean multinational electronics company) Air Conditioner at the DMZ (Korean Demilitarized Zone). But 99% of the air conditioners and fridges I saw are Chinese-branded. 2. The highway was extremely bumpy and I saw a decent amount of North Koreans digging -- apparently -- wild vegetables for food on both sides of the highway. 3. I met more foreigners than I expected in North Korea. Actually there were quite a few foreign (non-Asian) tour groups. I also met some Egyptians walking freely in Pyongyang.

A tour guide asked me sincerely, ""Is South Korea better than North or not?"" but he refused to look at the photos I took while I was in South Korea. 5. Here are some recaps of the conversation between me and the tour guide: The guide couldn't believe Seoul has more than 12 subway lines, has never heard of Kim Jong-un's ""study abroad in Switzerland"" experience and was surprised when hearing that the daughter of Xi Jinping was studying in the States. He knew way too [little] about Kim's wife, had heard about China's corruption but not the Sewol ferry accident. He visited China once and found out China had serious pollution issues. 6. Apple or Sony? Another guide asked us. READ: Touring North Korea: What's real, what's fake? 7. The visitors/tourists from the Chinese government dropped significantly after the Chinese government called for its officials to curb public consumption and avoid extravagance, according to the tour guide. 8. There was no button for 5/F at the Yanggakdo Hotel. 9. Automobiles I saw in North Korea are mostly Chinese (approximately 60%) -- Chery, JAC Motors, Dongfeng and King Long. About 20% are Japanese cars like Nissan and Toyota, 5% DPRK brand Pyeonghwa, 5% South Korea's Hyundai and 10% other cars like Benz etc.. MORE: How to travel to North Korea . 10.

"Concerns about westerners joining the fight in Syria dominated the annual Aspen National Security Forum with top U.S. government officials equating the threat from the stalemated Syrian civil war to that posed by al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate. Michael Vickers, the Pentagon's undersecretary for intelligence, said there are now believed to be thousands of western passport holders, many with easy visa access to enter the United States, who are among foreign fighters in Syria. California man arrested, said he wanted to join ISIS . John Carlin, the Justice Department's national security chief, called the threat ""unprecedented"" and said the department is putting resources to prosecute Americans who try to travel to the region to join terror groups involved in the war. Vickers called the number of Westerners flocking to Syria to join the jihad ""unprecedented"" and the number of Syrian fighters with Western passports ""is in the four digits."" Director of the National Counterterrorism Center Matt Olsen said about 100 of them are American, ""we think."" Texas man pleads guilty to attempting to join ISIS' jihad in Syria . In addition to the western fighters, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the seizure of territory in Syria and Iraq by the group calling itself the Islamic State posed concern. The temptation for the group, also called ISIS, would be to try to strike the United States to establish its bonafides as other terror groups have, Johnson said. ""So we're concerned about this type of organization which is very dangerous and probably wants to try and prove itself one way or another, could go further along in its efforts to attack our homeland,"" Johnson said. Colorado woman accused of trying to help ISIS . Despite the fact that al Qaeda has renounced ISIS, Johnson suspects there are links between the groups. ""I suspect it's a more complicated picture than that,"" Johnson said. TSA weighs in on bombs . John Pistole, administrator of the Transportation Security Administration, said the United States believes al Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim al-Asiri has trained others who could try to build a device that may be difficult to detect by current screening procedures. He said his agency works to quickly recalibrate its procedures based on new intelligence on changes in tactics by terrorists. He cited the example of a new iteration of the underwear bomb that prompted TSA to change screening equipment settings and retrain explosives detection dogs. That's because the equipment and dogs couldn't detect explosives used in the latter version of the bomb. One reason the initial underwear bomb used by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab failed to detonate aboard a U.S.-bound airliner in 2009, Pistole said, was because he wore the explosive underwear contraption for 17 days. Soiling the underwear apparently caused the explosive to fail. The ISIS threat . Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the Islamic Statae of Iraq and Syria is a regional problem that is evolving as a threat to American interests and the U.S. military was working on a strategy to disrupt and ultimately defeat it. But while the effort to achieve that can be enabled and assisted by the United States, ultimately moderate Sunni Arabs are needed to reject it's extremist ideology, he said. Dempsey dismissed the of working with Iran against ISIS, saying there is a ""lot of American blood on Iran's hands. He also said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should not be viewed as the ""lesser of two evils"" and he still needed to leave office. Russia in Ukraine . On Ukraine, Dempsey said Russia's movement into sovereign country in Europe was an event not seen since Adolf Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939. Dempsey said NATO was discussing ways to help boost the Ukrainian military's capability as well as force and basing options to protect neighboring NATO member states. However, he that feared Russian President Vladimir Putin might have lit a fire he may lose control of in Ukraine, one that may not be contained to Eastern Europe. Fueling radicalism . Former FBI director Robert Mueller said Friday, ""what's happening in Gaza today will feed and fuel the desire for many more to join radical groups."" Mueller was participating in a panel at the Aspen Security Forum discussing the growing flow of foreign fighter, particularly those with western passports, to countries like Syria with the intention of joining the global jihad. Mueller added that those inspired to join radical groups will not necessarily go to the Gaza strip, but could feel prompted to look join the larger extremist movement elsewhere (for example, in Iraq and Syria).

"Nearly a dozen fake applicants were able to obtain coverage subsidies under Obamacare during undercover testing of enrollment controls, a government watchdog said. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, created 18 fictitious applicants to test the Affordable Care Act's ""front-end"" controls for verifying an applicant's identity or citizenship status. In 12 cases, the ""applicants"" applied online or by telephone. Eleven obtained subsidized coverage. One was denied because the ""applicant"" did not provide a Social Security number-- omitted purposely as part of the test. Six other fake applicants used, or tried to use, in-person assistance. Five were unable to obtain such help, and the sixth was correctly told that the applicant's stated income would not qualify for a subsidy. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee's subcommittee on oversight, which commissioned the GAO study, presided over a hearing Wednesday on the test's results. ""Sadly, this should not be terribly surprising,"" said Rep. Charles Boustany, a Louisiana Republican. ""The question is whether the (Obama) administration is being a good steward of taxpayer dollars and is putting in place adequate controls to protect those dollars from fraud, waste, and abuse. The history of the health care law's implementation suggests the answer is no,"" Boustany said. As of Wednesday, coverage remains in effect for all 11 approved applications, according to the GAO's investigations director Seto Bagdoyan. The ACA provides subsidies through the marketplace to eligible applicants, at significant cost to taxpayers. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the estimated net cost of coverage provisions to the federal government is $36 billion for fiscal year 2014, and $1.4 trillion for fiscal years 2015 through 2024-- with subsidies accounting for most of the cost. Knowingly providing false information is a violation of federal law, subject to a $25,000 fine. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services oversees online marketplaces, which are in turn required to take several steps to verify application information. In a statement, CMS spokesman Aaron Albright said ""the steps we take to ensure that individuals and families get the premium support and coverage they deserve, and that no one receives a benefit they shouldn't, are ongoing and have not concluded."" Albright said the health exchange marketplace has ""several layers of safeguards"" to verify applicant information, including a requirement that consumers submit accurate information when applying for health coverage. But he said that CMS is nonetheless ""examining this report carefully and will work with GAO to identify additional strategies to strengthen our verification processes.""

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- The Thai military on Friday tightened its grip on the politically unstable Southeast Asian nation, banning more than 150 prominent figures from leaving the country and threatening to arrest politicians who disobey its orders. Former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra was among those who reported to the military junta, which seized power in a coup Thursday after months of turmoil that paralyzed much of the government and caused deadly clashes in the streets of Bangkok. The United States and other countries have criticized the military's intervention, the latest in a long list of coups in Thailand, and called for the swift restoration of democracy. Yingluck, whose government was in power when the unrest began in November, was removed from office this month by the country's Constitutional Court over the appointments of top security officials. Prominent people summoned . Yingluck arrived around noon Friday at a military compound in Bangkok with one of her sisters and was still there hours later, a source close to the former leader told CNN. The military on Thursday summoned Yingluck and three other members of her politically powerful family to report to authorities. It has also called on more than 100 others, including prominent figures on both sides of Thailand's political divide, to come to military facilities. Those who don't report, it has warned, will be arrested. Military officials haven't provided much explanation about the reasons for the summonses, saying it's necessary ""to ensure smooth operation of restoration of peace and order."" They have also placed travel bans on Yingluck and scores of others. Yingluck was being detained at a military barracks outside Bangkok, the Thai government's national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Paradon Patthanathabut, said late Friday. Paradon said Yingluck was detained for her own safety along with and former ministers and one-time members of her Cabinet. The junta on Thursday detained some of the leaders of the country's deeply polarized political factions. Some of those held, including opposition leader Abhisit Vejjajiva and members of Yingluck's Pheu Thai Party, were later released. Constitution ditched, curfew imposed . Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the head of the military, has assumed the powers to act as Prime Minister until a new one takes office, the military said Thursday. How the government will operate remains unclear, given that the military also has thrown out the constitution it drew up in 2007 after a previous coup, except for Section 2, which acknowledges that the King is the head of state. The last six months have been marked by large-scale protests, both by those backing Yingluck's government and those opposed to it. There have been periodic outbursts of deadly violence in the streets. Protest camps of both sides in Bangkok have been cleared away since the coup. Under the new order, schools will be closed nationwide between Friday and Sunday, the military said. A curfew is in place between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. And all state-run, satellite and cable TV providers have been ordered to carry only the signal of the army's television channel; CNN is among those networks that have been taken off the air. The military warned against posting misleading or critical comments on social media platforms. In a speech Thursday, Prayuth explained that these actions were necessary to restore order and push through reforms. In Bangkok, calm and a cleanup . The day after the coup, a peculiar calm had settled on the streets of much of the Thai capital, which has been the focal point of political unrest. A few hundred anti-coup protesters gathered in central Bangkok, some cheering and whistling and others holding banners saying ""no to coup,"" but members of the military kept a distance. A few demonstrators from rival camps argued among themselves, but police tried to calm both sides down. The crowds were thinning out by early Friday evening. Life in most of the city's center appeared normal during the day, with shops open and people going to work. In the area by the Democracy Monument, where anti-government protesters had camped out for months, work had begun to clear up the detritus that had been left behind. Dozens of people were dismantling large tents, cleaning and sweeping. Trucks and cranes were pulling down the infrastructure the protesters had put up at the camp. The military presence around the city remained subtle, with few soldiers in view, except outside the Defense Ministry and military sites. ""The situation in Bangkok is quite calm at the moment, but obviously we're all watching very, very closely to see what happens next,"" Kristie Kenney, U.S. ambassador to Thailand, told CNN. Kenney said she would not be attending a briefing Friday that the Thai military was holding for diplomats but would send someone from the U.S. Embassy. Her comments came after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday that there was ""no justification"" for the military coup. The U.S. Embassy in Bangkok has updated its guidance for Americans traveling to Thailand. It ""recommends that U.S. citizens reconsider any nonessential travel to Thailand, particularly Bangkok, due to ongoing political and social unrest and restrictions on internal movements, including an indefinite nighttime curfew."" The question many analysts are asking is how the popular ""Red Shirt"" movement, which supports Yingluck and her exiled brother Thaksin Shinawatra, will respond to the coup. The Red Shirts, whose support base is in the rural north and northwest of Thailand, were already angered by Yingluck's ouster this month, a move they viewed as a judicial coup by Bangkok elites. Senior Red Shirt leaders, as well as prominent figures from the anti-Yingluck protesters, were still being held Friday by the military, according to Paradon, the national security adviser to the government. Thaksin, a business tycoon who built a highly successful political movement through populist policies benefiting the rural masses, was deposed as Prime Minister in a military coup in 2006. In 2010, when the pro-Thaksin party was out of power, the Red Shirts mounted large protests in the heart of Bangkok. An ensuing crackdown by security forces resulted in clashes that killed around 90 people. Thailand martial law: A cheat sheet to get you up to speed . Soldiers, selfies and a military coup .

"Washington (CNN) -- Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan is clinging to a narrow lead over Republican challenger Thom Tillis in North Carolina, a new CNN/ORC International poll shows. Hagan led with 48% support to 46% for Tillis, the state House speaker, in the survey of 559 likely voters, conducted Oct. 27-30 and with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. Libertarian Sean Haugh polled at 4%. Hampering Tillis is an underwater favorability rating. Just 43% of those surveyed said they have a favorable view of him, compared to 50% who view him unfavorably. That's a dramatic shift since a September CNN/ORC International poll that put his favorability rating at 47%, with just a 40% viewing him unfavorably. ""Hagan seems to have done a good job of defining her lesser-known challenger in an unflattering light,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""The jump in Tillis' unfavorables is highest among women (a 12-point increase), lower-income voters (12 points), and particularly in the suburbs (16 points),"" Holland said. Hagan, meanwhile, is viewed favorably by 49%, while 48% say they view her unfavorably. She could be dragged down, though, by President Barack Obama's unpopularity. Just 42% said they approve of Obama's job performance. Tillis leads among suburban and rural voters, earning 49% support in each category compared to 43% support for Hagan among suburban voters and 44% with rural voters. Hagan, though, holds a massive lead in urban areas, where she has 59% support to Tillis' 37%. Hagan leads by 16 percentage points among women and Tillis is up 12 points with men. North Carolina is one of several states that President Barack Obama won at least once -- Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire are the others -- where Republicans are hoping to grab Senate seats previously held by Democrats. Their success in those states could determine whether the GOP captures the six seats it needs to become the Senate's majority party for Obama's last two years in office. The CNN/ORC International results come after several other polls have put Hagan ahead. An Elon University survey conducted Oct. 21-25 put the freshman senator up 45% to 41%, while a Rasmussen Reports poll showed her up 47% to 46%. The race has been the most expensive of the 2014 midterm cycle, with spending by the campaigns, national committees and outside groups topping $100 million.","Democratic Sen.

"""No matter where you are from, your dreams are valid."" Dignified, inspiring words spoken by young woman who looked like a fairy princess on Hollywood's most spectacular night. Lupita Nyong'o won the Academy Award for best supporting actress -- and black, brown and ""other"" women and girls all around the world exhaled with relief and cheered with delight. The Cinderella story endures because deep down, people want to believe in improbable beauty and equal access to happily ever after. You know how it goes: A kind young girl alone and far from home is placed in a hostile environment, ignored and abused. Against all odds, she finds the power of her imagination, transforms into a graceful beauty and becomes the belle of the ball. Nyong'o's ascent into media stardom mirrors this legendary narrative. This is from Facebook: ""I admit it. I can't go more than three days without looking at a picture of her. #LupitaNyongo."" That's one of the scores of daily posts on every social media platform about the breakout actress, mostly from women and girls of color.  The image of Nyong'o is feeding an old hunger familiar to the hearts of women of African decent and quenching a newfound thirst for everyone else. She is refreshing. She added, as they say in the fashion world, a ""pop of color"" to the neutral landscape of types in the 2014 awards season. The beginning of Nyong'o's fairy-tale rise to Hollywood's new It Girl began with her brilliant portrayal of Patsey, a filthy, psychologically abused and violently beaten slave  in the best picture winner, ""12 Years a Slave."" And yet in a matter of months, the prevailing image of her is an exquisite beauty queen conquering every red carpet and glossy fashion page she's graced. And there have been many. The Golden Globe Awards were Nyong'o's first major glamorous arrival. She didn't take home the best supporting actress award for which she was nominated, but from Vogue to tumblr, she reigned on all the best-dressed lists. It was a Cinderella moment.  It wasn't the stunning fire-engine-red winged column dress by Ralph Lauren Couture that made her splash so significant. It was her unlikely beauty, her exquisite ""otherness"" that made the style media explode with excitement. And she has been slaying every other appearance ever since. Hollywood can be a hostile and stubborn place for diversity: Only 31 black people have won an Oscar in the 85-year history of the Academy Awards. It can be especially treacherous and narrow when it comes to images of women. And the women  on the silver screen set the gold bar for the standard of beauty for much of the world's media. Analyze any parade of actresses on any major awards show red carpet, and the message is clear: The criteria for a position in the elite clique of beauties are to be white and thin, with hair that blows in the wind. Though Nyong'o certainly has a near-fatless body, her deep, rich skin tone and the length and texture of her hair are a sharp detour away from the standard.  Unfortunately, it's not rare that just one  woman of color was nominated for major acting awards this year. Out of her many nominations, in addition to her Oscar win, she's also won the Screen Actors Guild Award for best supporting actress, the NAACP Image Award for outstanding supporting actress and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for best supporting actress. Other black women who have won the Academy Award in the best supporting actress category are Hattie McDaniel, Whoopi Goldberg, Jennifer Hudson, Mo'nique and Octavia Spencer. What stands out about Nyong'o is that she is top-model gorgeous, classically trained and impossibly elegant and has an indisputable African name. She's the first black African to ever win. Nyong'o can wear practically any gown that has ever been on a couture runway.  She fits the high-fashion role while simultaneously expanding it. She is old-Hollywood elegant and new-school African. At the Oscars, it was her dark, luminous skin and short, tightly coiled hair that made the billowy cornflower princess gown by Prada look so dreamy.  Like art and life, beauty without contrasts isn't interesting. Nyong'o is a ravishing contrast against the pale landscape of beauty possibilities most women and girls are given from Hollywood and high-fashion media. She represents a possibility of another kind of dream girl. Young women of color from Nairobi to New Orleans can see a bright star that reflects them.","Lupita Nyong'o won best supporting actress Oscar in a fairy-tale rise in Hollywood .

"(CNN) -- On Wednesday, July 23, the State of Arizona executed Joseph Rudolph Wood in the fourth visibly bungled execution this year. The execution began at 1:52 p.m. According to eyewitness Michael Kiefer, ""Wood was unconscious by 1:57 p.m. At about 2:05, he started gasping."" He continued to gasp for over 90 minutes. Afterward, eyewitness Troy Hayden reported, ""Joe Wood is dead, but it took him two hours to die. To watch a man lay there for an hour and 40 minutes gulping air, I can liken it to, if you catch a fish and throw it on the shore, the way the fish opens and closes its mouth."" Kiefer counted more than 640 gasps. Arizona engaged in a failed experiment. Its new execution protocol called for administration of two drugs, midazolam and hydromorphone. The only other time this drug combination had been used was the prolonged and similarly disturbing Ohio execution of Dennis McGuire, who took 24 minutes to die and struggled for air for 10 to 13 minutes. Eyewitness Alan Johnson reported that McGuire ""gasped deeply. It was kind of a rattling, guttural sound. There was kind of a snorting through his nose. A couple of times, he definitely appeared to be choking."" Faced with these well-documented problems, Arizona adopted Ohio's procedure but increased the amount of each drug (from 10 milligrams to 50 milligrams for midazolam and from 40mg to 50mg for hydromorphone). The state refused to reveal, however, its process for selecting the new doses or whether it conducted due diligence to determine that its protocol would be more effective. Notwithstanding the changes Arizona made to the drug formula, Wood's execution went even worse than McGuire's. Despite requests from Wood's lawyers, Arizona also refused to reveal the source of its drugs -- including the manufacturer, lot number and expiration date -- and the qualifications of its execution team members. Nothing about this information would compromise the identity of those participating in executions, but it would allow the courts and the public to analyze whether the execution procedures will work as intended and bring about death in a way that meets the requirements of the Eighth Amendment. Callan: Are death penalty delays 'cruel and unusual'? Four men -- Michael Wilson, McGuire, Clayton Lockett and Wood -- have been subjected to bungled executions this year. Although the drugs, doses and other details of the procedures differed in each execution, the commonality between them is that the departments of corrections used experimental drug combinations and shielded crucial aspects of their practices in secrecy. Even in the aftermath of the executions, the lack of transparency continues. While governors in both Oklahoma and Arizona have called for reviews of the problematic executions, no outside authorities have been brought in to conduct the investigations. Internal investigations are insufficient to the task. Departments of corrections cannot be allowed to provide pat explanations that leave central questions unanswered, minimize errors and hide relevant information about what went wrong. Instead, there must be independent investigations of each execution that goes awry and thorough, public reporting of the results. Without truly independent investigations, it will be impossible to make meaningful conclusions about what went wrong or to determine if changes can be made to ensure that the same errors do not happen again. Chemical mix and human error lead to controversial executions . The botched executions in Arizona, Ohio and Oklahoma show us that when states are allowed to devise novel, untested execution protocols without judicial scrutiny or public oversight, the resulting procedures are unreliable. And when the unreliable procedures are implemented, the consequences are gruesome and horrific. States cannot be allowed to continue carrying out death sentences without judicial review of their execution procedures. The courts must require departments of corrections to disclose key aspects of these procedures, particularly with respect to the provenance of the drugs used and the qualifications of the execution personnel. Without this oversight, botched executions will become the new norm. No additional executions should proceed until the states act with transparency, and the courts scrutinize execution procedures to ensure that they comport with the U.S. Constitution.

"Venezuela's interim leader has upped the ante in his accusations about U.S. plots to destabilize his country, calling on President Barack Obama to investigate. ""Factors in the Pentagon and the CIA"" are conspiring as elections approach in the South American country, interim President Nicolas Maduro said this week. ""We want to say to President Barack Obama, stop this madness,"" Maduro said during a campaign planning meeting broadcast Monday on state-run VTV. The United States has been denying a steady stream of accusations from the acting leader ever since the day he announced President Hugo Chavez's death. Monday was no exception. ""Let me say it here extremely clearly, looking right at you,"" State Department spokeswoman Victorial Nuland told reporters. ""The United States categorically rejects allegations of any U.S. government involvement in any plots to destabilize the Venezuelan government or to harm anyone in Venezuela."" Hours before he announced that Chavez had died on March 5, Maduro said that a U.S. Air Force attache had been expelled from Venezuela and accused him of seeking military support for a plot against Chavez. Chavez's criticisms of U.S. imperialism were a hallmark of his presidency and played well with his supporters. And some analysts say it's no surprise that the accusations have escalated with Maduro on the ticket to replace Chavez in presidential elections April 14. Maduro, meanwhile, has remained firm in his claims. ""I am saying the absolute truth,"" Maduro said, ""because we have the testimonies and direct, first-hand information."" Last week Maduro announced that planning was in the works for a commission of ""the world's best scientists"" to investigate whether Chavez, who died after battling cancer, had been poisoned. Maduro stressed that he wasn't accusing the United States, but he implied that the United States could have been behind such an attack on Chavez. In the 1940s and 1950s, the United States and other countries had ""scientific laboratories testing how to cause cancer,"" Maduro said. ""Seventy years have passed. These kinds of laboratories of evil and death have not advanced?"" Also last week, he accused Otto Reich and Roger Noriega -- two fierce critics of Chavez's government who once worked for the U.S. State Department -- of plotting to assassinate Henrique Capriles Radonski, the opposition candidate for Venezuela's presidency. Reich and Noriega both denied the accusations and warned that it could be a sign that Venezuela's government was involved in a plot of its own against the opposition candidate. ""These charges are so removed from reality that they may well be a smoke screen behind which the Venezuelan government is planning to eliminate Capriles,"" Reich said in a Twitter post Sunday. Noriega said Monday that Cuban officials could be behind the accusations, which he described as ""no laughing matter."" ""Of course, this is a baseless, malicious lie, but it should not be dismissed as a cynical campaign tactic,"" Noriega wrote in an online post. Maduro has said his government was offering security for Capriles. ""This candidate knows that he has all the guarantees to conduct his campaign in liberty,"" Maduro said, ""and we are going to avoid any craziness against him.""","Nicolas Maduro says ""factors in the Pentagon and the CIA"" are conspiring .

"Mark Cuban is known for making pointed statements. Usually they are directed at the NBA brass or referees. Or contestants on the TV show ""Shark Tank."" On Wednesday, he made a few remarks about bigotry that in light of the Donald Sterling scandal caused a bit of an uproar. In an interview with Inc. magazine at a business conference in Nashville, Tennessee, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire entrepreneur talked about his own bigotry. ""If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street,"" he said. ""And if on that side of the street, there's a guy that has tattoos all over his face -- white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere -- I'm walking back to the other side of the street."" Cuban said everyone has prejudices ""in one way or the other."" The Mavericks owner issued a five-part tweet Thursday afternoon in which he apologized to Trayvon Martin's parents for the hoodie reference, but stood by the context of his answers and called for more tolerance. Martin, a Florida teenager, was wearing a hoodie when he was killed by neighborhood watch captain George Zimmerman in 2012. The case sparked a heated nationwide discussion about race as well as a debate over Florida's ""stand your ground"" law. Cuban wrote: ""I think that helping people improve their lives, helping people engage with people they may fear or may not understand, and helping people realize that while we all may have our prejudices and bigotries, we have to learn that it's an issue that we have to control, that it's part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve it."" CNN commentator and ESPN senior writer LZ Granderson said he thought Cuban was trying to have a nuanced conversation but didn't do it very well. Granderson said he was disturbed that Cuban equated the hoodie stereotype -- something he said has led to unjust treatment of African-Americans and even killings -- to the stereotype of the tattooed white man. ""One has history and the other doesn't or the same sort of emotional response,"" Granderson said. Cuban is one of 30 NBA owners who'll decide whether racist remarks made by Sterling are damaging enough to terminate his ownership rights to the Los Angeles Clippers. Cuban told business owners during a Q&A session that he knows how he will vote but wasn't ready to announce his decision. Granderson still expects Cuban to vote against Sterling on June 3 when the NBA Board of Governors meets to decide the fate of the Clippers franchise. ""If you listen to the entire interview, he certainly made it sound as if he's going to vote Sterling out, but not without some regret,"" Granderson said. ""And he voiced that regret, which is we all have bigotry."" In his interview Cuban said when he runs into bigotry in his organizations, he tries to find solutions. It does society no good to respond to someone's racism or bigotry by telling them to ""go take their attitude somewhere else,"" he said. It's better to work with them and teach them why their views are wrong. When Cuban was asked how you keep bigotry out of the NBA, where he has been an owner since 2000,  he told the conference audience: ""You can't keep that ugliness out of the league. There's no law against stupid. I learned that a long time ago.""","Mark Cuban: Everyone has some form of prejudice .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama weighed in on the Scottish independence referendum Wednesday night when he tweeted in favor of a united UK. But for the most part, faced with the prospective divorce of its closest friend, the United States is following the advice column carefully: don't take sides, keep your opinions to yourself, and avoid getting dragged into the fray. The complicating factor in this potential split? One side has a nuclear arsenal. Who gets custody of that? Thursday's independence referendum in Scotland, and with it the possible split of the 300-year-old United Kingdom, could have consequences big and small, including in the United States. The ""special relationship"" heralded by presidents and prime ministers for decades would be fundamentally altered, though American officials refuse to speculate in which ways. As British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Tuesday, a ""yes"" result on independence would amount to a ""painful divorce"" between Scotland and the rest of Great Britain, not a ""trial separation."" That prospect has elicited only a few sentences of official U.S. reaction. President Barack Obama said in June the U.K. had been an ""extraordinary partner"" to the United States and had done well for itself as a combined entity. ""We obviously have a deep interest in making sure that one of the closest allies that we will ever have remains strong, robust, united, and an effective partner,"" Obama said then. ""But ultimately these are decisions that are to be made by the folks there."" Opinion: Scotland, you want out? We'll take your place . Those few words -- with the emphasis on ""united"" -- have been repeated by officials in Washington as the formal U.S. stance without any further explanation. But there's little doubt the U.S. government, from Obama on down, wants to see Scotland remain where it is. ""It would just be rude to comment on the internal deliberations of a democratic country,"" explained Jeremy Shapiro, a former State Department official who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""Of course the United States has an opinion. I think they recognize, however, that stating that opinion is not always even very helpful to promoting it."" Rules of diplomacy aside, U.S. officials are eyeing the referendum vote carefully two days before Scots head to the polls. Here are a few ways the United States could be affected by a ""yes"" vote. Photo blog: Scottish teens face historic vote . National security . It's only been two weeks since Obama and Cameron hailed a reinvigorated NATO alliance from a golf course in Wales. Should Scotland vote to go it alone, expect fresh questions about NATO's ability to counter Russia in Eastern Europe. All of Britain's nuclear weapons -- its only contribution to a Western nuclear deterrent -- are housed at the Royal Navy's base on Scotland's West Coast. A ""yes"" vote would throw into question the future of the Trident nuclear program, which consists of four Vanguard-class submarines armed with ballistic missiles on lease from the United States . The main pro-independence party says it opposes nuclear weapons, vowing to remove and ban them in a future Scottish state. Where the weapons would go remains an open question. Opinion: Why UK would miss Scotland . Also in dispute: an independent Scotland's ability -- and willingness -- to contribute to Western military coalitions, which have become ever-more visible as the U.S. rallies support behind its efforts against Russia and ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria. NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said this week that Scotland would have to reapply to join the group like any other country and gain approval from each of the 28 member states -- a tough-to-imagine prospect in a period when the appetite for expansion within NATO remains low. UK party leaders promise Scotland new powers ahead of independence vote . In rejoining the alliance Scotland would need to commit to spending 2% of its gross domestic product on defense spending, which given the uncertain economic outcome of an independence vote appears unachievable. ""This is less about the nuclear deterrent than about demonstrating weakness and disunity at a critical point in NATO's history in the face of a sort of newly resurgent threat from Russia,"" Shapiro said. ""The whole idea of one of its key members breaking up...doesn't really appeal to the United States at this critical moment in dealing with Russia."" Economy . The uncertainty surrounding the economy of an independent Scotland could wind up costing Americans, who enjoy a close-knit trade relationship with Britain and the larger European Union. A main sticking point in the referendum campaign remains which currency a Scottish state could use -- be it the pound, Euro, or something new. Banks based in Scotland have said they'll decamp to London if the ""yes"" votes prevail, and an already-shaky European financial recovery could be quickly halted. ""If Scotland votes for independence, expect significant turmoil not just in the City, but on Wall Street as well,"" Niles Gardiner, a former aide to the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wrote in the Telegraph last week. ""Fears over the economic fallout from Scotland breaking off from the UK will spook US markets, frighten investors, and add to an air of uncertainty exacerbated in recent months by Russia's invasion of Ukraine."" Would go-alone Scotland be richer outside UK? Perhaps the greatest fear for the United States is that a successful independence movement in Scotland could spark further movements in the rest of Europe. Potential breakaway regions in Spain and Belgium are already eyeing the Scottish vote carefully. Those regions, like Scotland, would face questions about what currency they'd use and how their economies would be structured, driving the EU -- a major U.S. trade partner -- into further uncertainty and economic turmoil.

"(CNN)I had to see the movie ""American Sniper.""  Not because of the Oscar buzz but because of the vicious anti-Muslim and anti-Arab comments posted by some on social media after seeing the film. As Samer Khalaf, the president of the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, noted, there have been hundreds of violent messages on Facebook and Twitter directed against Arabs and Muslims made by people who had seen ""American Sniper."" For example, tweets such as, ""Great f*@##@* movie and now I really want to kill some f*@##@* ragheads,"" ""Nice to see a movie where the Arabs are portrayed for who they really are-vermin scum intent on destroying us"" and  ""American Sniper made me...hate Muslims 1000000X more."" Being of Arab heritage and Muslim, I had to know: Did the film really portray Arabs and Muslims in way that would naturally draw these types of hateful comments?  Was the film a jingoistic jubilee, like a ""Top Gun"" for a new generation, but where the Muslims/Arabs are now the ""evil empire"" instead of the Soviet Union? What did I find? The film was not any of those things. ""American Sniper"" is the most powerful anti-war film I have ever seen. True, the film is based on the autobiography of Chris Kyle, the decorated Navy Seal sniper who recorded the most ""kills"" in U.S. military history. That fact is likely the reason some on the right have championed the film as a pro-war anthem. But ""American Sniper"" is becoming as misunderstood as Bruce Springsteen's classic song, ""Born in the U.S.A."" Republicans from Ronald Reagan on have played that song at their campaign events believing it to be a pro-America celebratory anthem. It's anything but that. The lyrics of ""Born in the U.S.A"" poignantly criticize the Vietnam War and the way our country treated its veterans after their return to the states. Many didn't listen to the words and so missed Springsteen's point.  It's like this with ""American Sniper."" The film does more than portray the horrors of war.  That we have seen before. Instead, it focuses on the horrors that come after: the post-war suffering when those who have served come home. Director Clint Eastwood gives us a parade of veterans who have been wounded in some fashion: Lost legs, lost arms, lost hands, lost souls.  Even veterans who appear intact at first glance, turn out to be far from it.  For example, one scene features a veteran in an auto repair garage back in the United States. He recognizes Kyle and after speaking to him for a minute, raises his pant leg to show he is missing a leg. It's not surprising Eastwood would make an anti-war movie. The usually tight-lipped Eastwood recently commented, ""contrary to public opinion, I abhor violence."" And Eastwood has not only publicly opposed to the Iraq war, he even questioned waging the war in Afghanistan. As to my original reason for seeing the film, to learn whether it incites hatred of Muslims and Arabs? Well, I don't think you are going to like our communities more after seeing the film. But I'm fairly confident that those who made hateful comments about Arabs and Muslim hated us before they stepped into the movie theater. The film just gave them an excuse to voice their bigotry. It's important to note: Kyle was not killed by an Iraqi, but according to police, by a U.S. veteran who allegedly had PTSD. It happened long after he'd returned from the battlefield. He was back home. If people are angry with that or about the fate of the other Americans who suffered in the war, they should focus should not on American Muslims but on those who led our country into a war based on questionable reasons. That doesn't mean I don't wish Eastwood made a more balanced film that would let audiences see the brutality and suffering of both sides in the conflict. There isn't any reference, for example, to the horrors of Abu Ghraib prison where U.S. soldiers infamously tortured Iraqis. Nor was there any reference to the 2006 massacre in Haditha, Iraq, which happened during the period Kyle was in Iraq. That's when U.S. Marines went on a killing spree and slaughtered 24 unarmed Iraqis including women, children and an elderly man in a wheel chair. And Eastwood's depiction of the Iraqis was almost comically without nuance. Forget character development; the Iraqi version of Kyle, for example -- a sniper known as ""Mustafa"" -- barely registered as one-dimensional. He didn't even speak; he was simply depicted as a silent killing machine. Was Eastwood's use of an almost video game-like violence when it came to killing Iraqis calculated to dehumanize the Iraqi people?  I don't think so. His focus was not on whom we were fighting, but the unbearably high price Americans pay for waging war regardless of its target. The film is a cautionary tale for Americans about why we must avoid war.  It is not a celebration of waging it. While ""American Sniper"" did garner an Oscar nomination for best picture, Eastwood was not nominated for best director.  But Eastwood deserves a special award -- for making a powerful anti-war film that the right would cheer.","Dean Obeidallah: ""American Sniper,"" touted by right as pro-war movie, has inflamed some anti-Muslim rhetoric .
He says it's really a powerful anti-war film. Director Eastwood shows the damage wrought by senseless war ."
"(CNN) -- A quote often attributed to Leon Trotsky reads, ""You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you."" Although Washington would like very much to ignore North Korea, Pyongyang has just brought Trotsky's axiom into the 21st century with a seminal cyberattack that will have an immediate economic and cultural impact. On Wednesday, the U.S. government reportedly concluded that North Korea was ""centrally involved"" in the hacking of Sony Pictures. The attack is believed to have involved stealing and publicizing emails between high-level Sony executives and talent, as well as at least two government officials. When combined with a threat of violence against would-be viewers of a comedy mocking the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, Pyongyang's hackers effected the cancellation of the movie's release. More than just costing Sony as much as $100 million by some estimates, the cancellation and other fallout from the hack attack will likely end careers in Hollywood and Tokyo and put a chill on creative satires or other media aimed at dictatorships. A Hollywood that already increasingly toadied repressive governments like China's may now be completely defanged. What happens in film also affects music, publishing and the news media. Using modest cybercapabilities and an American-Japanese target wholly lacking in moral courage, North Korea has aided itself and every other dictatorship on Earth mightily. Washington has developed a de facto policy of ignoring North Korea, especially after talks to disarm that nation failed during the Bush administration. In 2010, after North Korea sank a South Korean Navy ship, President Barack Obama said Pyongyang must be ""held to account."" In 2013, after North Korea's third nuclear test, President Obama vowed ""swift and credible"" action. But aside from the umpteenth condemnation by the U.N. Security Council -- to which North Korea is indifferent -- the world mostly goes back to ignoring Pyongyang after headlines change. But in this case, ignorance isn't bliss. This year alone, North Korea has fired shells toward South Korea, apparently engaged in illicit arms transfers with Cuba, and is suspected by America's top general in South Korea of potentially having developed the skill to weaponize the nuclear devices it has been working on. Then, of course, came Pyongyang's cyberattack on Sony, a remarkable feat in a country where Internet access is tightly controlled and there is no commercial software market to create a private supply of programmers. The state reportedly makes up for this by employing its own small army of hackers, who according to defectors train in Russia and China, and even operate from abroad. The free world should react. Responding to cyberattacks is a new area for statecraft, but ought to be seen in the same light as dealing with any other nonlethal attack on a nation's economic or security interests. First, the United States and its allies should retaliate against their attackers in order to deter future attacks. The response should be similar to, but of a greater magnitude than the initial attack -- a common feature of deterrence. Second, the United States should maintain escalatory dominance, making clear that it is always willing and able to ascend to the next higher level of conflict if so forced. A direct cyber-retaliation against North Korea may pose challenges; the nation is less networked and less reliant on intellectual property than free nations. But any modern communications system has vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Furthermore, North Korea's two alleged primary cyberenablers, Russia and China, could be covertly targeted with electronic means for aiding an attack on the United States. For example, the United States could disrupt communications or even the electricity grid in Pyongyang and temporarily disrupt a small number of Chinese or Russian firms that depend on Web commerce. Taking steps like these may require transforming the young U.S. Cyber Command from an extra tool for U.S. military commanders in a regular war into an agency that fights more in peacetime. Sometimes the best defense is a good offense. In this way, cyberwar and deterrence could come to resemble espionage-related contests during the Cold War. One side responds to provocations with counterprovocations. An understanding and an unwritten code of conduct develops among adversaries. Short-term stability is generally achieved, pending further resolution that is hopefully peaceful and conducted at our initiative -- like the end of the Cold War. But with North Korea we should go further still, ceasing ever again to ignore the regime. Ultimately, improved cybersecurity will only come with the regime's replacement. Freedom and accountable government work for Koreans, a fact that is obvious from the shining example of South Korea. Helping North Koreans replicate this by peacefully replacing the Kim dynasty ought to be the free world's primary goal on the Korean Peninsula. Ironically, one of the best ways to achieve this change is with the type of cultural and electronic warfare North Korea has just waged against us. Supporting the free flow of information back into North Korea -- especially by defectors who can encourage and explain the truth to the repressed Koreans they left behind -- is a proven way of eroding tyrannical regimes. It will also put Pyongyang on the defensive at home -- fully aware that it is no longer being ignored.","Christian Whiton: Direct cyber-retaliation against North Korea poses challenges .

"The dark claim on the day Hugo Chavez died took many by surprise. Someone, Venezuelan government officials said, may have deliberately infected him with cancer. Critics dismissed the accusation -- first floated by then-Vice President Nicolas Maduro on March 5 -- as an eleventh-hour attempt to distract Venezuelans and drum up popular support as leaders prepared to announce Chavez's death. But Maduro revived the issue this week, announcing that planning was in the works for a commission of ""the world's best scientists"" to investigate whether Chavez had been poisoned. Chavez gone, but far from forgotten as Venezuelan presidential campaigns start . In an interview with the Telesur network hours after he registered to run for president Monday, Maduro implied that the United States could have been behind such an attack on Chavez -- an accusation that the State Department has denied. ""We have this intuition that our commander Chavez was poisoned by dark forces that wanted to be rid of him,"" said Maduro, who was sworn in as Venezuela's interim president on Friday. In the 1940s and 1950s, the United States and other countries had ""scientific laboratories testing how to cause cancer,"" Maduro said. ""Seventy years have passed. These kinds of laboratories of evil and death have not advanced?"" Maduro stressed that he was not accusing the United States. ""I am just saying something that is a truth, that is known,"" he said. But his recent comments have drawn sharp responses from the U.S. government. Venezuela: Will 'Chavismo' survive? ""An assertion that the United States was somehow involved in causing President Chavez's illness is absurd, and we definitively reject it,""  State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said last week. It isn't the first time that a Venezuelan government official has implied that a plot could be behind Chavez's cancer. Chavez made the assertion himself in 2011, saying at a military event in Caracas that he wondered whether the United States could be infecting Latin American leaders with the illness. Chavez cited the revelation that between 1946 and 1948, the United States had carried out human experiments in Guatemala where subjects were exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. The U.S. government apologized for those experiments in 2010. ""Would it be strange if (the United States) had developed a technology to induce cancer,"" he asked, ""and for no one to know it?"" Maduro announced on March 5 that Chavez had died. The news came nearly two years after Chavez had revealed his cancer diagnosis in June 2011. While government announcements of Chavez's trips to Cuba for treatment were common, officials never revealed details about his prognosis or specified what kind of cancer he had. Maduro has remained tight-lipped, even while telling Telesur that details about Chavez's illness make officials ""almost certain"" that there was foul play. ""We are almost certain based on the data we have,"" Maduro said. ""He had an illness, a cancer that will be known in time, that broke with all the typical characteristics of this illness."" Dr. Elmer Huerta, an oncologist and past president of the American Cancer Society, told CNN en Español Tuesday that assertions that injections or poisons could have caused Chavez's cancer have ""absolutely no scientific substance."" ""Science cannot sustain this hypothesis,"" Huerta said. Any scientific investigation into Chavez's death, Huerta said, could be complicated by the fact that Chavez's body has already been embalmed so that it can be placed on display in a Caracas museum. ""If they want to investigate ... they should have already taken all the tissue samples,"" he said. It's unlikely the scientific commission Maduro spoke of this week will ever be formed, according to Fernando Gerbasi, a Venezuelan analyst and former diplomat. ""This is political speculation,"" he told CNN en Español. ""They have wanted to use to the maximum Chavez's death for political purposes."" Making the poor count -- a Hugo Chavez legacy .","Doctor: There is ""no scientific substance"" to claims that Chavez was deliberately infected .

"(CNN)Players from Tunisia and the Democratic Republic of Congo embraced each other in celebration as both sides played out a 1-1 draw to book their passage into the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations. In a tense finale to Group B, all four teams still had the chance to qualify for the last eight until the final whistle went in a goalless draw between Cape Verde and Zambia in torrid conditions. It sparked contrasting celebrations, the coaches and players in Bata celebrating in unison while there were tears in Ebebiyin as 2012 champions Zambia bowed out in the group stages for a second successive tournament. Tunisia coach Georges Leekens had called on his side, the 2004 AFCON champions, to go all out for the win despite only needing to draw the match to qualify. And the north African side in reality should have achieved that feat by half-time such was their ascendancy. It was Ahmed Akaichi who broke the deadlock just after the half-hour mark, the striker for Esperance becoming only the second player to score two goals in this tournament after Congo's Thievy Bifouma as he headed home a flick on by Yassine Chikhaoui. Chikhaoui thought he had enjoyed his own moment of glory with a superb volley only for it to be ruled offside, one of two disallowed goals for the Tunisians. For a time, DR Congo, tournament winners in 1968 and 1974, looked devoid of a response until drawing level against the run of play in the 65th minute through substitute Jeremy Bokila. It was Bokila's two goals that had helped seal his side's route to the tournament against Ivory Coast and, just five minutes after coming on, he once again provided a telling difference. A long ball was headed into the box by Dieumerci Mbokani, Bokila controlled it with aplomb and guided the ball into the net with his left foot. It was all the more befitting as moments earlier Wahbi Khazri should have already put the game out of DR Congo's reach. But DR Congo held firm for a record sixth straight draw in the tournament, the game ending slightly farcically in the final minute with neither side really playing as news of the result from Ebebiyin came in. That match was never going to be a classic, the two teams having scored just three times in 40 combined attempts in this tournament, and it was a cause not helped by a downpour that threatened to see the game abandoned altogether. If Zambia had hoped the players would be inspired to shine in the wake of a pre-match call from President Edgar Lungu, who won the election at the weekend, then they were to be sorely disappointed. Zambia's Evans Kangwa had the chance to grab the win his side needed to qualify late on but made a hash of his effort while Cape Verde, level on three points with DR Congo, only missed out on the quarter-finals by virtue of goal difference.","Tunisia and DR Congo draw 1-1 to both reach the last eight of the Africa Cup of Nations .

"A former top Justice Department official in Arizona leaked an internal memo from a federal agent who had criticized the politically charged ""Fast and Furious"" gun trafficking operation, a government report found. Dennis Burke, who was U.S. Attorney for the state, admitted to senior Justice Department officials in 2011 that he had leaked to the media the memo written by John Dodson, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to the Justice Department inspector general's finding on Monday. The IG report said the leak was an apparent attempt to undermine Dodson's credibility. Burke resigned after making the disclosure. What was 'Fast and Furious,' and what went wrong? The report said the memo was among documents gathered for review by congressional committees investigating the botched ATF operation dubbed ""Fast and Furious."" The controversial program allowed 2,000 guns to cross Arizona's border with Mexico beginning in 2009 with the intention of tracking them to criminal gangs. Authorities lost track of hundreds of weapons that wound up in the hands of drug cartels and two guns wound up at the scene of a border agent's slaying the next year although it was not clear whether they factored in the death. A report last September by the Justice Department's inspector general found that the operation was marked by ""a series of misguided strategies, tactics, errors in judgment and management failures.""` According to the report, the ""Fast and Furious"" memo should not have been released to the media without approval by the Justice Department's public affairs office. Excerpts from the 'Fast and Furious' report . The report said Burke told a senior Justice Department official that he didn't know the memo was only to be given to congressional investigators and thought the member of the media who received it had already seen it. Burke reportedly also said he didn't think he'd done anything inappropriate. Burke later told congressional investigators that he provided the memo to a friend who gave it to a FOX News producer,  according to the report. Dodson's attorney complained to the DOJ Office of Inspector General in July 2011 that someone had leaked the memo after the agent received an e-mail from a FOX news producer asking for comment on excerpts. According to the inspector general's report, the memo suggested an operation using tactics similar to the ones Dodson had later criticized in congressional testimony. The IG report said ""although Burke denied to congressional investigators that he had any retaliatory motive for his actions, we found substantial evidence to the contrary."" Chuck Rosenberg, a lawyer representing Burke, had no comment on the report. The inspector general's office said it would refer the matter to the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility to determine whether he had violated rule of professional conduct for any state bars of which he is a member.

"The nurse who tended to Boston Marathon bombing victim Krystle Campbell near the finish line during her final moments of life would like to meet her parents in the hopes he could give them some solace in their grief. Stephen Segatore would like to tell Campbell's parents that she didn't die alone, and she didn't suffer for long. When EMTs carried a woman into the medical tent where Segatore was volunteering, he was struck by her beauty, her youth and her bright blue eye shadow. The freckles on her face and the shape of her eyes reminded him of his oldest daughter, who is not much younger than the woman who lay on the stretcher before him with multiple wounds, not breathing and unconscious. Even though he knew she probably wouldn't understand a word he said, Segatore told the woman he was a nurse and would take good care of her. For the next 10 minutes, Segatore, who works in the intensive care unit at Tufts Medical Center in Boston, an EMT and a physician gave her CPR. But a cardiac monitor showed her heart wasn't pumping blood. ""The physician called (her death),"" Segatore said. ""The three of us who were working on her let out an expletive, a scream."" The next day he saw a picture of Campbell and realized she was the woman he had tried to save. He knew immediately from the bright blue eye shadow in the photo. It was his only death Monday afternoon, and it has haunted him. Now Segatore would like to speak with the Campbells to tell them about their daughter's final moments. ""I want them to know she was not alone when she died,"" he said. ""We did everything we could to save her, but her wounds were too great."" While he was giving Campbell CPR, he noticed black marks on her face, which he thinks might have been gunpowder, indicating she was very close to the blast. ""I don't think she lingered. I don't think she suffered,"" he said. ""If it were my daughter, I would want to know that.""","Nurse Stephen Segatore gave bombing victim CPR, but ""wounds were too great""

"Pakistani police say they have arrested up to 40 people in connection with the killing of a Christian couple in Punjab province who were beaten, then pushed into a burning kiln after being accused of desecrating the Quran. Local police officials said a mob from neighboring villages formed Tuesday after a local mullah declared the couple were guilty of blasphemy. The mob allegedly marched to the couple's home, broke down their door, dragged them outside, beat them and threw them into the brick kiln where they both worked. The attack happened in the town of Kot Radha Kishan, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) southwest of Lahore, the capital of Punjab. Police officials identified the woman as Shyman Bibi Urf Shamar, and her husband as Sajjad Nasir Zurjah Nazir Nasir. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), which dispatched a team to the scene, said in a statement that the couple had three young children -- two sons and a daughter, and indicated the slain woman was pregnant. ""HRCP is shocked and saddened beyond words by the callous murder of the couple and their unborn child,"" the group said. According to the statement, the HRCP team ""did not come across any evidence of desecration of the Holy Quran."" Desecration of the Quran is punishable by death or life imprisonment under Pakistan's anti-blasphemy law. Human rights groups have long urged the country to repeal the law, arguing that it has led to discrimination, persecution and murder. Woman takes blasphemy law to Pakistan's highest court . It is often used to settle personal vendettas, rights groups say, and people accused of the committing the crime are frequently targeted by mob violence.

An accusation that the couple had desecrated the Quran ""was spread to nearby villages and announcements [were] made through mosque loudspeakers,"" the HRCP said. The mob that went to the kiln was estimated at around 500 people, the rights group said, citing local police. The HRCP said its team learned that four policemen went to the kiln to demand that the couple be handed over for protection from the mob, but that the owners ""instructed their employees not to hand the couple over and the policemen were also beaten up."" The kiln's owners were among those arrested, the rights group said, quoting police.

"This week the Supreme Court heard two historic cases on marriage. Even though I was a lawyer in the litigation and in the courthouse both days, I can't predict which way the court will come down. But the outcomes range from nothing at all to fundamentally restructuring the foundational unit of western civilization. Hollingsworth v. Perry is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. United States v. Windsor asks whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman, is unconstitutional. DOMA passed in 1996 with 78% of the U.S. House and 85% of the Senate and was signed by President Bill Clinton. The whole nation is focused on the litigation. Ironically, it's possible that neither case will be decided on the merits. In Hollingsworth, California's governor and attorney general abdicated their duties by refusing to defend their state constitution. So pursuant to California law, the sponsors of Prop 8 — officially registered with the state — stepped in to defend the law, represented by Charles Cooper at Cooper Kirk and the Alliance Defending Freedom. In Windsor, the defendant was the federal government. But President Barack Obama declared that he believes DOMA is unconstitutional and ordered his Justice Department not to defend it. So per its rules, the U.S. House voted to authorize Paul Clement  — probably the greatest Supreme Court lawyer practicing today — to defend DOMA. Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts. One requirement is that there must be adversity between the parties. Since the defendants in both cases refused to defend their own laws, the court will consider whether the Constitution allows these third-party legal teams to become a proper party to the lawsuits. There's a second issue in Windsor. Edith Windsor entered into a gay marriage in Canada in 2007 and lived in New York. When her partner died in 2009, Windsor sued to contest the federal estate tax she paid, claiming a spousal exemption. But New York did not create gay marriage until 2011, so Windsor was not harmed by DOMA not allowing the federal government to recognize her marriage, since if the IRS used state definitions Windsor would still be regarded an a single woman. Thus it's possible she lacks standing to sue over the issue. It also raises the issue of whether courts must recognize polygamous marriages, which are legal in dozens of nations worldwide. The swing vote regarding the Article III issues in both cases is probably Chief Justice John Roberts. He openly expressed skepticism in Hollingsworth and led the Court in an hour-long debate in Windsor solely focused on whether the court has jurisdiction. Assuming the court does decide the merits, the implications are historic. Windsor would alter America's system of federalism. Only the states determine who can get married. But the federal government is free to decide whom to confer federal benefits on — largely economic entitlements and federal issues such as immigration. Federalism is a two-way street. But if DOMA Section 3 is invalidated, the states will be able to dictate whom the recipients of federal benefits are. If Windsor is historic, Hollingsworth is earth-shattering. If the Supreme Court declares a constitutional right to marriage other than one-man, one-woman, then all traditional marriage laws in all 50 states will be invalid, and there will be a serious debate (already in a lower federal court) of whether polygamists also have a constitutional right to national recognition. On the merits, the court seems unlikely to declare an unwritten constitutional right to gay marriage, though arguments did not go as well for DOMA. Justice Anthony Kennedy is likely the swing vote in both. As Justice Samuel Alito said this week, the Internet and cell phones have been around on this planet longer than gay marriage. It is an energetic debate in all 50 states, and this summer we will learn whether the Supreme Court will shut down this debate by making it a constitutional issue on which the American people are not allowed to vote.","Ken Klukowski: Cases heard by Supreme Court could result in momentous change .

"A Missouri judge has overturned the state's ban on same-sex marriages and ordered registrars to start issuing licenses to gay and lesbian couples. In a ruling Wednesday, Judge Rex Burlison struck down the ban, declaring it unconstitutional and saying officials should give licenses to same-sex couples seeking to get married. ""Any same-sex couple that satisfies all the requirements for marriage under Missouri law, other than being of different sexes, is legally  entitled to a marriage license,"" wrote Burlison, a St. Louis circuit judge. Shortly after the ruling, couples marched to St. Louis City Hall to apply for licenses, CNN affiliate KSDK reported. The ruling follows an incident in June, when St. Louis issued marriage licenses to four same-sex couples. The state attorney general sued to stop it, arguing it defies Missouri's 2004 constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay said times have changed, and the ban was long overdue. ""When you have two people who love each other and want to commit to each other through marriage, I can't think of anything more beautiful,"" he said. ""Whether you are heterosexual, it shouldn't matter. We are all people under the law, and we should all be treated equally."" Slay said his brother, who is gay, just married his partner in New York. ""They could not get married in St. Louis,"" he told the affiliate. ""Based on what is happening here, he may move back to St. Louis."" But the state's top prosecutor said he has appealed the ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court. ""The constitutional challenge to Missouri's historically recognized right to define marriage must be presented to and resolved by the state's highest court,"" state Attorney General Chris Koster said in a statement. Koster has said that while a lot of state residents have changed their minds and support marriage equality, the constitution has not changed. More than 30 states and the District of Columbia allow marriage for same-sex couples.","St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay applauds the ruling .

"Hong Kong (CNN)The official Malaysia Airlines website has been hacked by a group claiming to support Islamist terror group, ISIS. On logging into www.malaysiaairlines.com on Monday morning, users were presented with an image of a Malaysia Airlines Airbus and messages that read ""404 -- Plane Not Found"" and ""Hacked by Lizard Squad -- Official Cyber Caliphate."" The browser tab also read ""ISIS will prevail."" The Malaysia Airlines homepage later changed to a black background featuring a mocked-up image of a lizard in a top hat complete with monocle.  Users were directed to a Twitter page called ""@lizardmafia,"" which featured a series of largely asinine posts. The airline, which is currently restructuring itself in the wake of the loss of two of its airliners last year, could not be contacted by telephone. In a post on its Facebook account, the airline denied its internal servers, which contain passenger information, had been compromised. It said its Domain Name System (DNS) had instead been hijacked, with users redirected to the hackers' website. The airline added the issue has now been resolved with its service provider and the system is expected to be fully recovered within 22 hours. The matter has also been reported to Malaysian authorities, it said. But the hackers, identifying themselves as the Lizard Squad, took to Twitter claiming they had penetrated Malaysia Airlines' email account and posted a screenshot. Meanwhile, tweets from the airline's official account directed users to a separate URL for its online booking service.  This link worked as normal.

"(CNN)""Did Patriots Tamper with AFC Championship Ball?"" — Monday's top headline on the Indianapolis Star's website . ""Don't both teams have to play with the football?"" a Facebook friend of mine promptly inquired in a post, mystified as to how the New England Patriots could come under investigation by the National Football League for ""deflating"" any of the balls used in Sunday's conference championship game versus the Indianapolis Colts. A fair question about an unfair tactic, to be sure. OK, under further review, let us take a look at this weird, wild, farcical, you-gotta-be-kidding-me ""controversy"" that has, uh, blown up unexpectedly. It became the talk of talk radio Monday. and you could picture every staff writer employed by Letterman, Fallon, Kimmel and others tapping furiously on their laptops, coming up with joke after joke. It was confirmed by an NFL official that the league was looking into the pretty preposterous possibility that balls used in New England's easy 45-7 victory at Gillette Stadium were not adequately inflated. Yep, people actually now wonder whether you can get an extra edge from Gillette. Patriots superstar quarterback Tom Brady had the question put to him Monday on a radio interview and called it ridiculous, saying, ""I think I've heard it all."" The idea, cockeyed as it is, would be that a football would be considerably easier to catch and grip if it were filled with slightly less air than usual. Particularly in wet, chilly weather like that found on a January evening in Massachusetts. Five things to know for the Super Bowl . To the aforementioned question as to the teams using exactly the same ball -- i.e., so where's the advantage? -- each NFL team, according to Rule 2, Section 2 of league bylaws, will ""make 12 primary balls available for testing by the referee 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the starting time of the game."" The home team ""will also make 12 backup balls available for testing."" Eight other balls, sealed in a box by the manufacturer, are marked by the referee and ""used exclusively for the kicking game."" I don't know if an actual scale is used, like a jockey or a boxer making weight, but a football is supposed to weigh between 14 and 15 ounces. If there are weight-loss programs for overweight footballs, this would be the first I have heard of it. ""The Biggest Loser"" show on NBC could get a whole season out of something like this. Naturally, conspiracy theorists could speculate that the Patriots somehow finagled a way into using a deflated ball themselves, giving Mr. Brady a little help, while making sure that the visiting team's quarterback, Andrew Luck of the Colts, had to pass a football that was more tightly inflated than a Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade balloon. I have never heard of this accusation being made in all the years I have been following professional football. I mean, come on: ""Honey, You Didn't Blow Up the Balls?"" How devious could a team be? However, I did indeed have awareness of a similar situation occurring in college football, as recently as 2012. It involved the University of Southern California, a splendid school, my own daughter's alma mater. USC was fined $25,000 by its conference for being caught doing exactly that -- messing with the air in the football. A student manager was responsible. The university said he did it on his own, apparently without the knowledge of a single other human being in then-Coach Lane Kiffin's football program, deflating no fewer than five footballs to be used in a USC game against Oregon.  Three bad balls were discovered by officials before the game, two more at halftime. The kid was later fired, the university was fined and reprimanded by the Pac-12 Conference and, much the way Tom Brady put it Monday, a lot of us ended up saying: ""I've heard it all now."" Turned out (it was news to me at the time) that in college football, schools provide their own footballs, whereas in pro football, the exact same 18 balls are used by both teams. Who knew? It is difficult not to laugh at the thought of Bill Belichick, the generally humorless head coach of the Patriots, masterminding some kind of sinister Dr. Evil plot to deflate a certain number of those footballs, then having a co-conspirator somehow sneak the soft balls into the game when New England it was on offense, then the harder balls into the game when Indy had it. ""Ha ha ha!"" the villainous Belichick would laugh to himself. ""I outsmarted them again!"" Except what are the odds of something like this actually happening? I appreciate that the Patriots have been so successful over the years that they have been accused of everything short of spying on their opponents from the Hubble Telescope. I personally believe the Patriots win most of their games because they score more points than the other team does. They will be going to another Super Bowl this year, the one coming up February 1 in Glendale, Arizona, because the Pats know how to play football, not how to blow one up. Even so, their opponents, the Seattle Seahawks, had better come prepared. I suggest they bring a scale.

"The fatal shooting of a 13-month-old boy in his stroller marked the second time mother Sherry West lost a son to violence, she said Saturday. Her 18-year-old son was stabbed to death in 2008 in New Jersey, she told CNN. ""This is the second child that people have taken from me in a tragic way,"" West said. ""I'm so afraid to have any more babies now. I tried to raise really good kids in a wicked world."" The day after two teenage boys were arrested and charged in the fatal shooting of her baby, West said she was planning to leave Brunswick and return to New Jersey. The boy's father has also been emotionally distraught, West said. Asked about the person who shot her son, Antonio, West stated: ""I hate you and I don't forgive you. ""You killed an innocent human life,"" she said. ""I hope you die for it."" A private memorial service was held Friday morning for young Antonio Santiago, who was cremated, according to West. She said the family is working with the Catholic relief organization Society of St. Vincent de Paul to help with unforeseen expenses. West put  Antonio in a stroller Thursday because it was good exercise for her heart, said West, who added she was disabled from a past car accident. ""I just took a walk with my baby,"" West said. ""I can't believe that this would happen, and I left early in the morning. I thought you know that there would be less people on the road and I wouldn't be in anybody's way walking down that road. ""Apparently, either he targeted me or I was just unfortunate,"" she said of her encounter with the gunman. West said the incident occurred at 9 a.m. Thursday as she was walking home from the post office. She said she saw two boys, and one asked for money. When she told them she didn't have any, one of the boys shot her in the leg and then her son in the face. Police Chief Tobe Green identified the older suspect as De'Marquise Elkins, 17, and said he will be treated as an adult in criminal proceedings. The 14-year-old was not identified because of his age. Both have been charged with first-degree murder, police said, though no arraignment date has been set. As of Saturday, authorities still had not found the murder weapon, police spokesman Todd Rhodes said. But they were able to track down the two suspects aided by a description from West and others, as well as a check of school attendance records to determine who was not in class Thursday. Officers then searched for the two teens and took them into custody, police said. 911 calls reveal witnesses' horror . Earlier Saturday, police in the coastal city released to CNN three recordings of 911 calls about Thursday's shooting. ""A baby has been shot!"" one woman said in a 911 call. The exchange with the emergency operator was emotionally charged. ""Listen to me, ma'am! Is the baby breathing?"" the operator replied. ""I don't know,"" the woman said. The woman began to cry. In the background is public wailing on the corner of London and Ellis Streets, in a stately cluster of Victorian-style houses with wrap-around porches. Baby shot dead in stroller; 2 Georgia teens charged . ""Listen to me!"" the operator said to the weeping woman. ""We have people en route. Did you hear shots in the area?"" Yes, she heard shots, she said. ""Be calm,"" the operator said. ""How many shots did you hear?"" ""I heard like three shots. And the baby has been shot in the head,"" the woman said. The woman was so distraught that she passed her cell phone to a man walking his dog. ""No, the baby is not breathing,"" the man told the operator. ""The baby was shot in the head?"" the operator continued. ""Yes, right between the eyes,"" the man said, who added he earlier heard a ""small caliber clap."" As he spoke, police sirens arrived on the scene, and the man broke off the phone call.","Victim is cremated and remembered in a private service, his mother says .

"Two days after nuclear talks with world leaders yielded little progress, Iran announced it has opened a new uranium-processing site to mark ""National Nuclear Day."" The country opened a uranium-processing facility as well as a uranium mine in the central province of Yazd, state-run TV reported Tuesday. Iran's enrichment of uranium has been one of the most contentious issues in nuclear talks between Iran and the so-called P5+1 countries -- the United States, France, Britain, China, Russia and Germany. State TV: Three dead after quake hits Iran, near nuclear site . The P5+1 countries are demanding Iran come clean about its nuclear program, which they suspect includes covert development of nuclear weapons. But Iran has consistently denied those charges, saying it is enriching uranium and building nuclear reactors only for peaceful civilian energy needs. ""Enrichment is part of the rights of the Iranian people, whether we're talking about 5% or 20%,"" said Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Saeed Jalili said earlier. Nuclear power plants use uranium that is enriched to 5%, while making a nuclear bomb requires uranium to be enriched 20% or more, Arnie Gundersen, chief energy adviser with the nuclear consulting group Fairewindes Associates, said last year. Enriched uranium is the fuel for nuclear power plants that generate electricity. The technique of enriching uranium relies on yellowcake -- a powdery, often yellow substance that comes from processed, mined uranium ore. Nuclear talks continue to stall . Despite two days of intense negotiations last week, Iran and six world powers ""remain far apart"" on Tehran's controversial nuclear program, European Union Foreign Policy Chief Catherine Ashton said Saturday. Though Jalili described the talks as ""substantive, expansive and comprehensive,"" he said ""hostile behaviors"" directed toward Iran have been detrimental. The comment presumably was a reference to the draconian sanctions imposed by Western governments against Tehran, which are crippling the Iranian economy. Oil exports have plummeted over the past several years, as has the value of Iran's currency. But Ashton defended the use of sanctions. ""The purpose of any sanctions is to put pressure in order to get this process to work,"" she said. ""And I believe we should continue to work as hard as we possibly can to make sure we are successful and we reach a satisfactory resolution.""

"Hannah Warren was born without a trachea but now has one made from plastic fibers and a stew of her own stem cells. The 2-year-old Korean Canadian has spent every day of her life in intensive care, kept alive by a tube that substituted for the windpipe that was supposed to connect her mouth to her lungs. But nearly a month after her transplant, the toddler is mostly breathing on her own and is responding to doctors and nurses. The surgery, pioneered by Dr. Paolo Macchiarini, director of the Advanced Center for Translational Regenerative Medicine at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, was only the sixth performed in the world, and Hannah was the youngest patient and first to receive the transplant in the United States. The procedure was approved by the FDA as an experimental operation for patients with very little hope of survival; being born without a trachea is fatal in 99% of cases. TIME.com: Stem cell therapies may cure chronic conditions . Macchiarini performed the nine-hour operation on April 9 at the Children's Hospital of Illinois after carefully creating the windpipe using stem cells from Hannah's bone marrow that were saturated over a matrix of plastic fibers shaped into a tube. Exactly what happens to the windpipe after it is transplanted isn't clear, but researchers believe that placing stem cells, which are capable of developing into different types of body cells, can pick up signals from their environment and integrate with existing tissues. Macchiarini told the New York Times that the body's regenerative capabilities may help such bioengineered organs to integrate with existing tissues. Children may make the ideal patients for these procedures since they have natural and active abilities to heal and grow. ""Hannah's transplant has completely changed my thinking about regenerative medicine,"" he told the Times, adding that he wants to conduct a clinical trial in the United States. For children born with a windpipe defect or without one, and for others with defective or diseased organs, manipulating stem cells to generate healthy tissues or organs could be their only chance at survival. TIME.com: Cancer patient receives a man-made windpipe . Macchiarini performed all five of the previous transplants of the bioengineered windpipes; four of the patients have done well, while one, Christopher Lyles, who received his trachea in Stockholm, died. Last year, in describing Lyles' operation, TIME's Alice Park wrote: . ""Macchiarini has been perfecting the process of using stem cells to seed bioengineered scaffolds for organs like the trachea since 2008; in his first such procedure, he used a donor trachea to replace that of a Spanish woman, stripping the organ of its cells and coating it with the woman's own stem cells. But using a completely synthetic, bioengineered matrix such as the one transplanted in Lyles, he says, makes the transplant safer for the patient, potentially sparing him the complications that can arise if he can't accept the new organ. ""Researchers have used similar stem-cell-seeding techniques to create other organs. Dr. Anthony Atala at Wake Forest University generated bladders and a urethra using scaffolds and patients' stem cells."" Because of the small number of patients he has treated, his critics say it's hard to determine how valid Macchiarini's bioengineering technique is in treating patients like Hannah. But he plans to conduct a clinical trial to properly assess the risks and benefits of the procedure, and document how bodies react to the transplanted devices. Hopefully those trials will show that it's possible to regenerate not just organs but hope as well.

"Venezuelan prosecutors dropped the most serious charges against opposition politician Leopoldo Lopez, whom the country's government blames for inciting clashes that have left at least five people dead. Lopez, one of the leading opposition figures in Venezuela, was formally charged with arson and conspiracy, but murder and terrorism charges were dropped, said his attorney, Juan Carlos Gutierrez. If convicted, Lopez could face up to 10 years in prison. Lopez's legal team welcomed the reduced charges, though it criticized the way the judicial process was being carried out. Wednesday night's hearing, to charge Lopez and determine whether he would be released or remain behind bars, took place in an unusual spot: a bus parked outside the prison where he is being held. ""It seems very unorthodox,"" Gutierrez told CNN en Español. The initial court appearance was to take place in a courtroom, but because of security concerns, officials wanted to move it to the prison. Gutierrez argued that inside a prison was not a proper venue for a hearing, so the strange solution was reached: the bus-turned-courtroom parked just outside the facility. The prison, outside the capital, Caracas, is a military facility, and Lopez's defense has raised questions about why a civilian is being held there. The response was that it was a place where the government could guarantee his safety, Gutierrez said. Lopez turned himself in to authorities this week in a dramatic scene before tens of thousands of supporters he had called to the streets. Anti-government protests in recent weeks are the largest demonstrations that President Nicolas Maduro has faced in his 11 months in power. The unrest . During the demonstrations, supporters of the country's socialist government and anti-government protesters have flooded social media with reports of violence, making drastically different claims about who's behind it. Since February 13, more than 2,000 stories from Venezuela have been uploaded to iReport, CNN's user-generated platform. Many of the videos and photos depict violent scenes between demonstrators and government forces. Alejandro Camacho Beomont told iReport that students Wednesday blocked streets and burned debris in San Cristobal, from where he sent photos -- and he said he didn't blame them. ""Even though I am always looking for peace to make a better place to live, I think people have the right to express themselves in the ways they can, and it is not easy to express yourself in this country now,"" he said. ""I support the protesters. There have been more than 15 years that the majority of the Venezuelan citizens are going through tough times. There are so many problems we have to face every day, and there seems to be not a sincere attitude from the high government officials to rectify (them)."" In a nationally televised broadcast Wednesday night, Maduro described bullet wounds sustained by government forces during protests and showed videos that he said depicted opposition protesters throwing stones and setting buses ablaze. ""You think this is a novel? This is the reality that you with your hatred have created,"" he said. ""If you don't like Venezuela, leave."" Reports of violence drew condemnation from Henrique Capriles, a leading opposition politician who lost a bid for the presidency last year. He called for the government to open a dialogue with demonstrators, rather than cracking down on dissent. ""In this hour of turbulence, to the students, to those who are in the streets, again we call for you not to step into the trap of violence,"" he said. Human rights concerns . Human rights groups warned about the danger of turning the protests into a persecution of political opponents. The charges against Lopez, who has organized protests demanding better security, an end to shortages and protected freedom of speech, ""smack of a politically motivated attempt to silence dissent in the country,"" Amnesty International said in a prepared statement. Human Rights Watch warned that Venezuela must avoid ""scapegoating"" political opponents. Justice Minister Miguel Rodriguez Torres said Thursday that out of about 200 people who were detained during clashes in the past week, only 13 remain in jail for offenses that include illegal gun possession and vandalism. Rodriguez Torres ridiculed reports that the Venezuelan state is illegally detaining students in an effort to put an end to the protests. Obama decries 'false accusations' Major social and economic problems in Venezuela have fueled the protests. But as the demonstrations gained steam, officials have pointed fingers at other factors, accusing the United States of plotting to destabilize the government. Venezuela expelled three U.S. diplomats this week, accusing them of conspiring to bring down the government. At a rally Tuesday, Maduro shouted, ""Yankee, go home"" from the stage, drawing cheers from the crowd. U.S. President Barack Obama fired back at a news conference in Mexico on Wednesday. ""Venezuela, rather than trying to distract from its own failings by making up false accusations against diplomats from the United States, the government ought to focus on addressing the legitimate grievances of the Venezuelan people,"" he told reporters. In a television broadcast Wednesday, Maduro accused Colombian paramilitary forces and the United States of fueling the violence, and he vowed to stand firm against any attempts to overthrow his government. ""And what is the Venezuelan opposition going to do?"" he said. ""Believe that with the support of (U.S. Secretary of State) John Kerry or Obama, you are going to be able to take political power by violent means?"" This isn't the first time that bitter protests and counterprotests by supporters and opponents of the government have threatened political stability in Venezuela over the past decade. Many of Maduro's claims -- of U.S. intervention, of assassination plots -- were also lobbed by the late President Hugo Chavez. Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup in 2002, but otherwise outlasted the protests and repeatedly won reelection. He ruled for 14 years, until his death last year after a long battle with cancer.

"A federal appeals court allowed four states to prohibit same-sex unions -- a decision that could force the U.S. Supreme Court to take up the issue. In a 2-1 ruling Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed lower court rulings in Ohio, Michigan, Tennessee and Kentucky that struck down same-sex marriage bans. ""When the courts do not let the people resolve new social issues like this one, they perpetuate the idea that the heroes in these change events are judges and lawyers,"" Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote in the ruling. ""Better in this instance, we think, to allow change through the customary political processes, in which the people, gay and straight alike, become the heroes of their own stories by meeting each other not as adversaries in a court system but as fellow citizens seeking to resolve a new social issue in a fair-minded way,"" Sutton wrote. The ruling . Sutton, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, said that it's not the responsibility of the judicial branch of government to make ""such a fundamental change to such a fundamental social institution."" ""Process and structure matter greatly in American government,"" Sutton wrote. ""Our judicial commissions did not come with such a sweeping grant of authority, one that would allow just three of us—just two of us in truth—to make such a vital policy call for the thirty-two million citizens."" Judge Deborah L. Cook joined Sutton's decision, while Senior Circuit Judge Martha Craig Daughtrey dissented. ""This is a very important decision from the federal court of appeals in Cincinnati, which disagreed with every other circuit court that has decided this case so far,"" said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. ""[The court said] there is not a constitutional right to same-sex marriage."" Daughtrey said that Cook and Sutton's decision read more like a piece of political philosophy than a court decision that grappled with a constitutional question. ""Instead of recognizing the plaintiffs as persons, suffering actual harm as a result of being denied the right to marry where they reside or the right to have their valid marriages recognized there,"" Daughtrey said, ""my colleagues view the plaintiffs as social activists who have somehow stumbled into federal court."" 'They can't duck it anymore' In October, the Supreme Court announced it would not hear appeals to same-sex marriage cases filed by a handful of states -- effectively paving the way for same-sex unions to become legal in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin. A handful of states later followed suit. The high court's decision left the door open for future challenges -- such as one that could result from Thursday's decision. Missouri judge overturns state's ban on same-sex marriage . Many observers of the high court said they believed it did not take up same-sex marriage cases because there seemed to be a consensus on the issue on the circuit court level since the Supreme Court struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman -- the Defense of Marriage Act. ""[The ruling] sets up an almost-certain fight before the Supreme Court,"" Toobin said. ""They can't duck it anymore."" The American Civil Liberties Union said it will appeal the appeals court's decision to the high court. ""We believe it's wholly unconstitutional to deny same sex couples and their families access to the rights and respect that all other families receive,"" Chase Strangio, staff attorney in the ACLU LGBT Project, said in a statement. ""We will be filing for Supreme Court review right away and hope that through this deeply disappointing ruling we will be able to bring a uniform rule of equality to the entire country."" This ruling is the first by a federal appeals court to uphold a state's same-sex marriage ban since DOMA. The Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative organization, praised the decision. ""The people of every state should remain free to affirm marriage as the union of a man and a woman in their laws,"" ADF senior counsel Byron Babione said in a statement.

"Wrigley's new caffeinated gum has caught the attention of the Food and Drug Administration, which says it will investigate the effects of added caffeine on children and teens. Alert Energy Caffeine Gum was introduced this week by Mars Inc.'s Wrigley division.  One piece contains 40 milligrams of caffeine, the same amount you'd get in a half a cup of coffee. The gum comes in two flavors: mint and fruit. When it's chewed, the caffeine is released into your saliva. Some some gets swallowed as if you were drinking coffee or a soda; some is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the cheeks and under the tongue. The only time the FDA has approved added caffeine in a food was in the 1950s for cola drinks, says Michael Taylor, the agency's deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine, in a statement Monday. The caffeinated gum is the latest to add caffeine, he says. ""Today, the environment has changed. Children and adolescents may be exposed to caffeine beyond those foods in which caffeine is naturally found and beyond anything FDA envisioned when it made the determination regarding caffeine in cola,"" Taylor says. ""For that reason, FDA is taking a fresh look at the potential impact that the totality of new and easy sources of caffeine may have on the health of children and adolescents, and if necessary, will take appropriate action."" 8 healthy ways to boost energy . Wrigley is only the latest company to introduce caffeinated chewing gum; a number are already on the market. According to the Alert Energy website, the gum is ""an energy product for adults who consume caffeine for energy"" and is not recommended for children or people sensitive to caffeine. ""Millions of Americans consume caffeine responsibly and in moderation as part of their daily routines,"" Wrigley says in a statement. ""Alert Energy Caffeine Gum is for adults who are looking for foods with caffeine for energy. ... We are exceeding current regulatory requirements on labeling and disclosure because we believe consumers should be informed on the amount of caffeine they are consuming in their food and beverage products so they can make smart choices. ""Alert competes in the well-established energy category. It is developed for adults and will be marketed to consumers 25 and older,"" the company says. ""As the FDA refines its approach to caffeine, we welcome the opportunity to work with them on this important topic."" Coffee good for you, but it's OK to hold back . In recent years, controversy has also swirled around energy drinks, which also contain caffeine. In November, the FDA began investigating 13 deaths preliminarily linked to the dietary supplement 5-Hour Energy. The deaths had been reported to the FDA as ""adverse events,"" which does not mean that the product is responsible for or that it contributed to any health issue. The manufacturer, packer or distributor of a dietary supplement is required to notify the FDA of any adverse events linked to its product, according to agency spokeswoman Tamara Ward. That requirement does not apply to products sold as beverages or food. In March, Monster Energy Corp. decided to begin marketing its products as beverages instead of dietary supplements and said it would include the caffeine content on each can of its energy drinks.

"Afghan President Hamid Karzai says he has received assurances from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency's station chief in Kabul that it will continue delivering cash, as it has for the past decade, to his offices. ""Yes, we received cash from the CIA for the past 10 years. It was very useful, and we are very thankful for this aid,"" the president said during a news conference Saturday in Kabul. ""Yesterday, I thanked the CIA's chief in Kabul and I requested their continued help, and they promised that they will continue. "" Karzai's comments follow last week's report by The New York Times that the CIA has been dropping off shopping bags full of money every month or so for more than a decade to the offices of the Afghan president. ""This is not unusual,"" he told reporters, adding that the money was spent by his office and the national security office for a variety of purposes, including paying salaries, helping the war wounded and providing scholarships. Karzai dismissed questions about why such money, not in state coffers, was needed for what he described as government expenses. ""This is the choice of the American government,"" he said. Karzai's statements on Saturday appeared to be meant to mollify a growing outcry over the revelation of the CIA payments, which has raised questions about whether the money undercut efforts to quell corruption in Afghanistan. The United States has previously criticized what officials have described as rampant corruption within the Afghan government. Nearly three years ago, reports surfaced that the CIA was making payments to a number of Karzai's family members, even as his key adviser and a number of ministers were being investigated for corruption. In the latest allegation of CIA payments in Afghanistan, the New York Times, which cited unnamed U.S., European and Afghan officials, reported that the cash payments ranged from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. It said the payments were used from everything from payoffs for lawmakers and warlord to paying for ""informal negotiations."" The report did not say how much money had been provided to Karzai's office. As a matter of routine, the CIA does not comment on its operations. The agency did not return a call from CNN seeking comment. Karzai also disputed claims that his office received cash from MI6, the British intelligence agency. He acknowledged MI6 gave money to other organizations in Afghanistan, but he did not identify them.","President Hamid Karzai said he met with the CIA station chief in Kabul .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Federal investigators Tuesday blamed the pilot of a Southwest Airlines jet for causing the plane to skid off a runway at Chicago's Midway Airport in 2005, an accident that killed a 6-year-old boy. A Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-700, like the plane here, skidded off a Chicago runway in 2005. ""The probable cause was the pilot's failure to use available reverse thrust in a timely manner to safely slow or stop the aircraft after landing which resulted in a runway overrun,"" the National Transportation Safety Board ruled. Southwest Airlines flight 1248 slid off a 6,500-foot runway at Midway while landing during a heavy snowstorm in December 2005. The Boeing 737-700 was still moving at 46 mph when it crashed through a barrier wall and then slid into an intersection outside the airport grounds, hitting two cars. The NTSB found the pilot and co-pilot were unfamiliar with the jet's automatic brake system, which ""distracted them from thrust reverser usage during the challenging landing."" The agency also found the pilot's failure to divert the flight to another airport amid reports of poor braking on the runway and tailwinds above 5 mph contributed to the accident. The accident killed Joshua Woods, 6, of Leroy, Indiana, and injured 12 others, including his parents and two younger brothers. It was the first fatal accident in the history of the Dallas-based airline. None of the 98 passengers and five crew members aboard the Baltimore-to-Chicago flight were hurt. The NTSB found Southwest failed to provide its pilots with ""clear and consistent guidance and training"" on company policies regarding arrival landing-distance calculations. It also said the programming and design of the aircraft's onboard computers and the airline's plan to implement new auto-brake procedures without giving pilots time to learn those procedures contributed to the accident.

"South Korea's President made an emotional apology Monday over the ferry disaster that killed close to 300 people last month and said she would dismantle the country's coast guard. ""As the President who should be responsible for people's life and security, I am sincerely apologizing to the people for having to suffer pain,"" said President Park Geun-hye in a televised speech. ""The final responsibility for not being able to respond properly lies on me."" The Sewol ferry sank en route to the resort island of Jeju on April 16, leaving more than 304 people dead or missing. Most of the passengers were high school students on a field trip. ""As a President, I feel a sense of sorrow for not being able to protect them during their family trip,"" said Park, whose approval ratings have dropped significantly in the weeks since the sinking. The Sewol disaster caused widespread outrage in South Korea over lax safety standards and the failure to rescue more people as the ship foundered. Questions have been raised over the government's oversight of the ferry industry and its handling of the crisis. Coast guard under fire . Park slammed the coast guard for its role in the disaster, saying it ""failed in its duty to carry out the rescue operation."" The coast guard has been criticized amid suggestions it could have saved more passengers as the ferry was sinking into the frigid waters of the Yellow Sea. ""After serious consideration, I've decided to dismantle the coast guard,"" Park said. ""The investigation and information roles will be transferred to the police while the rescue and salvage operation and ocean security roles will be transferred to the department for national safety which will be newly established."" Shedding tears, she proposed building a monument to the victims and setting aside April 16 as a day to focus on safety. ""I, again, pray for those who passed away during the incident and express my deep condolence to the families,"" Park said. She singled out people -- both passengers and crew members -- who perished trying to save the lives of others. ""I believe these people are the real heroes of our generation,"" Park said. Captain, others charged . The captain and crew members who survived have come under particularly heavy criticism. They are accused of telling passengers to stay put as the ferry began to capsize and then being among the first people to leave the stricken vessel. A chief prosecutor announced last week that the captain and three other crew members have been charged with murder. Eleven other crew members have been indicted on charges of abandonment and violating a ship safety act. Investigators have identified problems with the cargo, including overloading and the failure to secure it properly, as being among the likely reasons for the Sewol's sinking. They have said modifications to the ship last year, in which passenger cabins were added to increase its capacity, may have contributed to problems with the ship's balance. The chief executive of the ferry operator is facing charges of causing death by negligence, as well as causing the capsizing of the ship in the line of duty. The investigation into the disaster is ongoing, as is the underwater search for the 18 people who remain missing from the sinking. Captain, 3 crew members face murder charges .

"Jewels worth more than $1 million were stolen from a hotel in Cannes, France, police in the nearby city of Nice said Friday. The theft of the jewels, from the Swiss firm Chopard, came Thursday night, on the second day of the renowned Cannes Film Festival, which opened Wednesday and runs through May 26. The annual Cannes festival brings together the rich and famous from around the world for movie screenings and glittering parties. More chaos at Cannes: Shots fired . Commandant Bernard Mascarelli, of the Nice police, said the jewelry was stolen from a safe in the Suite Novotel hotel on Boulevard Carnot in Cannes. A Chopard employee was staying in the room but left it to go to dinner from 8 p.m. to 3 a.m. local time, he said. She returned to discover the safe containing the jewels was missing. The whole safe had been unscrewed from the inside of the hotel room and carried out, Mascarelli said. Police are now scouring security camera footage from the streets around the hotel and citywide for clues, he said. Drag queens, fake beards and chocolates: Notable diamond heists . No detailed description has yet been given of the stolen jewels.

"SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNN)  -- The ""Mona Lisa"" has long been shrouded in mystery, including one long-standing question about the famous lady: What happened to her eyebrows and eyelashes? A French engineer and inventor examined the famous painting with a camera of his own design. Now, a French engineer and inventor says he's uncovered part of the enigma. Pascal Cotte announced at a press conference Wednesday that he has found definitive proof that when Leonardo da Vinci painted the original portrait he included ""Mona Lisa's"" lashes and brows. Cotte examined the world's most famous painting using a high-definition camera of his own design. The device scanned a 240-million pixel image using 13 light spectrums, including ultra-violet and infrared. The resulting ultra-high resolution photograph of 150,000 dots per inch yielded a reproduction of the ""Mona Lisa's"" face magnified 24 times. And there Cotte found the evidence he sought -- a single brushstroke of a single hair above the left brow.  Watch as expert announces findings on ""Mona Lisa"" » . ""One day I say, if I can find only one hair, only one hair of the eyebrow, I will have definitively the proof that originally Leonardo da Vinci had painted eyelash and eyebrow,"" said Cotte. So, if she once had lashes, where did they go? Possibly faded pigment, Cotte suggested, or possibly a poor attempt to clean the painting. ""And if you look closely at the eye of 'Mona Lisa' you can clearly see that the cracks around the eye have slightly disappeared, and that may be explained that one day a curator or restorer cleaned the eye, and cleaning the eye, removed, probably removed the eyelashes and eyebrow,"" he said. Cotte's high resolution camera led him to numerous additional discoveries about the enigmatic artwork. The infrared layer of the image shows that the fingers of the ""Mona Lisa's"" left hand were originally painted in a slightly different position than in the final portrait. Cotte said the change in position was the result of a lap blanket held by Leonardo's model. In today's faded image the blanket is all but obscured, but the highly detailed camera detected the faded pigment. ""It was really the first time that we have this kind of position of the arm,"" Cotte said, ""and after Leonardo da Vinci, thousands of painters have made a copy of this position but without understanding why we have this position. The real justification of the position of the wrist is to hold the blanket on her stomach. It's really a great, for me, it's really a great discovery."" One of the results of Cotte's work is a ""virtual"" restoration of the painting, an exact replica showing the original colors as they would have looked when the painting was new. The skin tones of Leonardo's model appear as a warm pink and the sky behind her is a glowing blue, far different from the gray-green tint that covers the artwork today. That dark patina is the result of 500 years of aging, according to Cotte. Cotte presented numerous other findings within the infrared layer he photographed. The researcher said the ""Mona Lisa's"" smile was originally slightly wider than it appears today, and, in fact, so was her entire face. Leonardo kept this painting with him for more than a decade, and is said to have worked on it up until his death. The Renaissance artist once said, ""Art is never finished, only abandoned."" The results of Cotte's study are on display at the Metreon in San Francisco, as part of the exhibit ""Da Vinci: An Exhibition of Genius.""

"Past, present and future came together on a thunderstorm-filled Sunday, as President Barack Obama received an honorary doctorate and gave the commencement speech at historically black, all-male Morehouse College, where the Rev. Martin Luther King and many other prominent African-Americans spent their formative years. After opening with several one-liners, and more smiles than we've seen from him in the damage-control-filled recent weeks, Obama delivered a serious message to the class of 2013. During a speech rife with both personal and historical references, the president invoked a past full of challenges, often resulting from racism, but noted that African-Americans need to break free from that past to succeed in a globally competitive economy. ""I understand that there's a common fraternity creed here at Morehouse: 'Excuses are tools of the incompetent, used to build bridges to nowhere and monuments of nothingness,'"" Obama said. ""We've got no time for excuses -- not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they have not. Not because racism and discrimination no longer exist; we know those are still out there. It's just that in today's hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with millions of young people from China and India and Brazil -- many of whom started with a whole lot less than all of you did -- all of them entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything that you have not earned,"" he said. Opinion: What Obama must say to African-American grads . ""Nobody cares how tough your upbringing was. Nobody cares if you suffered some discrimination. And moreover, you have to remember that whatever you've gone through, it pales in comparison to the hardships previous generations endured -- and they overcame them. And if they overcame them, you can overcome them, too,"" he said. Morehouse valedictorian Betsegaw Tadele praised Obama for setting a strong example. ""There is no impossible. There is no unbelievable. There is no unachievable, if you have the audacity to hope,"" Tadele said, paraphrasing the name of the president's 2006 book, ""The Audacity of Hope."" Following Tadele -- whom Obama jokingly called ""a skinny guy with a funny name"" -- Obama reflected on how being an African-American has affected his personal journey. ""Whatever success I have achieved, whatever positions of leadership I've held, have depended less on Ivy League degrees or SAT scores or GPAs, and have instead been due to that sense of connection and empathy, the special obligation I felt, as a black man like you, to help those who need it most; people who didn't have the opportunities that I had -- because there, but for the grace of God, go I. I might have been in their shoes.  I might have been in prison. I might have been unemployed. I might not have been able to support a family. And that motivates me,"" the president said. Big-name college commencement speakers of 2013 . The president's repeated mention of connection to the black community comes after blunt criticism from Morehouse alumnus Kevin Johnson, a pastor from Philadelphia, who criticized Obama in an April 14 editorial in the Philadelphia Tribune, calling him ""a president for everyone, except black people."" Johnson gave a baccalaureate sermon on Saturday as part of Morehouse's graduation weekend. The president's speech on Sunday was well-received, though the crowd had to brave some thunder and lightning and endure pouring rain. One awkward silence came when Obama slightly deviated from his prepared remarks. He was expected to say, ""Be the best husband to your wife, or boyfriend to your partner."" However, instead, he said ""Be the best husband to your wife, or your boyfriend, or your partner,"" eliciting some clearly confused responses from the crowd. Later, he noted that Morehouse men can set examples for other groups that have been subjected to discrimination: Hispanics, gays and lesbians, Muslims, and women. ""It is not just the African-American community that needs you. The country needs you. The world needs you.  As Morehouse men, many of you know what it's like to be an outsider; know what it's like to be marginalized; know what it's like to feel the sting of discrimination.  And that's an experience that a lot of Americans share,"" he said. Obama said his job, as president, is to advocate for policies that generate more opportunity for everyone, and he implored the Morehouse grads -- and all Americans -- to ""advocate for an America where everyone has a fair shot in life."" ""There are some things, as black men, we can only do for ourselves.  There are some things, as Morehouse men, that you are obliged to do for those still left behind.  As graduates -- as Morehouse men -- you now wield something even more powerful than the diploma you are about to collect.  And that's the power of your example,"" he said. Students scarred by war earn college degrees . Obama finished his speech with another message not just to the newly minted Morehouse grads, but to all Americans -- a message based on Martin Luther King's refusal to be afraid. ""That's what being an American is all about. Success may not come quickly or easily. But if you strive to do what's right; if you work harder and dream bigger; if you set an example in your own lives and do your part to help meet the challenges of our times, then I am confident that, together, we will continue the never-ending task of perfecting our union,"" he said. And despite lots of big-picture talk about success and giving back, Obama made it clear that without appropriate focus on those closest to you, big-picture accomplishments mean little. ""Everything else is unfulfilled if we fail at family -- if we fail at that responsibility. I know that when I am on my deathbed someday, I will not be thinking about any particular legislation I passed. I will not be thinking about a policy I promoted. I will not be thinking about the speech I gave. I will not be speaking about the Nobel Prize I received.  I will be thinking about that walk I took with my daughters. I'll be thinking about a lazy afternoon with my wife.  I'll be thinking about sitting around the dinner table, and seeing them happy and healthy and knowing they were loved. And I'll be thinking about whether I did right by all of them.""","President Obama gives the commencement speech at historically black college .

"The number of people potentially embroiled in the Boston Marathon bombings case grew Wednesday to include friends of surviving suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Not much is known yet about the three 19-year-old men -- Azamat Tazhayakov, Dias Kadyrbayev and Robel Phillipos. But here is what CNN has learned so far. All started at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth in 2011, along with Tsarnaev. Each is accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the April 15 attack, which killed three people and wounded more than 260. FBI details how suspect's friends trashed evidence . Azamat Tazhayakov . Tazhayakov was already in federal custody before Wednesday on immigration charges. He is from Kazakhstan and had a student visa. According to the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, Tazhayakov is enrolled, but was suspended pending the outcome of the case. He is charged with obstruction of justice. If found guilty, he could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. Harlan Protass, who represents Tazhayakov, said his client ""has cooperated fully with the authorities and looks forward to the truth coming out."" Dias Kadyrbayev . Kadyrbayev is likewise a Kazakh national and charged with obstruction of justice. Similar to Tazhayakov, he could face up to five years in prison and $250,000 in fines if found guilty. The two men share an apartment in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Kadyrbayev's lawyer, Robert Stahl, said his client ""did not have anything to do"" with the bombing and disputed that he tried to block the investigation. Kadyrbayev was taken into custody along with Tazhayakov last month on suspicion that he had violated the terms of his student visa, according to Stahl. He said Kadyrbayev was accused of a ""technical violation"" for failing to attend classes on a regular basis. Kadyrbayev is not currently enrolled at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. According to an interview his father gave last week, the 19-year-old ""missed a couple, or maybe several classes."" ""I can say about my son that he finished school with excellent grades; he was good at math. He helped others. When he saw that help was needed, he always accommodated,"" Murat Kadyrbayev told Tengi News and STV channel in Kazakhstan. Timeline: Bombing, manhunt and more . Robel Phillipos . Unlike Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev, Phillipos is a U.S. citizen. Like Kadyrbayev, he is not a current student at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth. Phillipos attended high school with Tsarnaev at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they both live. A yearbook photograph shows a smiling Phillipos. Almost directly in front of him, Tsarnaev stares at the camera -- his hand gently resting under his chin. Phillipos is charged with lying to federal agents investigating the bombing. He faces up to eight years in prison if convicted, along with a $250,000 fine. A friend described Phillipos as a ""good kid."" ""He went to school, never got in trouble, took care of his mom,"" James Turney told CNN affiliate WBZ. ""He was not really outgoing, stayed in the house a lot, did homework, got good grades."" Phillipos plays basketball and doesn't have ""any anti-American thing about him,"" Turney said. ""It just doesn't make sense. Robel doesn't have anything to do with this, or what happened, so I don't see why he's being arrested,"" he told WBZ.","The three men are friends of surviving Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev .

"(CNN) -- China's foreign minister pushed Friday for the lifting of sanctions against Zimbabwe, saying no country has a right to dictate the internal affairs of another nation, state-run media reported. Starting in 2002, the European Union and the United States imposed targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe and some senior party members amid rampant reports of stifling his political opposition, human rights violations and his controversial land reform policy that has targeted white commercial farmers. Mugabe blames the sanctions for his country's woes, which late last year included an unemployment rate of more than 90% and an inflation rate of 231,000,000%. Speaking Friday during a two-day visit to Harare, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said that ""China believes that Africans have the right to choose their own way of development, as they are masters of the African continent. All others are just guests."" ""We think that (lifting sanctions) is the voice of the Zimbabwean people, and that is also the view of all the parties concerned here in Zimbabwe,"" Yang said, according to the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency. As part of his trip, China extended an additional 50 million yuan ($7.5 million) in aid to the economically ravaged African nation, Xinhua reported. In addition, Yang and Zimbabwe Foreign Minister Simbarashe Mumbengegwi signed an agreement on behalf of the two countries. According to Xinhua, Mugabe on Friday said sanctions flew in the face of a 1979 agreement with Great Britain that land would be redistributed to compensate farmers. ""The Western countries have imposed sanctions on us for taking our land, although we had discussed this in 1979,"" he said. ""That is what started the problem."" Last December, Mugabe threatened to seize all Western-owned investments in the country unless their governments remove targeted sanctions imposed on him and his senior ZANU-PF party members. The 86-year-old former guerrilla leader said at the time that ""the time has come for ... revenge"" and suggested that Zimbabwe's Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act -- which gives foreign companies five years to submit plans for transferring 51% of their investments to black Zimbabweans -- did not go far enough. Mugabe has held power since Zimbabwe became independent in 1980. A 2008 election resulted in a runoff between Mugabe and Tsvangirai. Movement for Democratic Change, charging fraud in the election, eventually pulled out, and Mugabe was declared the winner. In 2009, with ZANU-PF no longer a majority in the parliament, Mugabe formed a coalition government with Tsvangirai, who was named prime minister. Mugabe said last December that he was tired of working with the opposition party, which he said ""lacked ideology and policies."" He termed the unity government a ""creature."" At the time, he warned Western diplomats not to interfere in Zimbabwe's elections, which he said would be held next year. He said the West had contributed to his party's defeat in 2008. Despite isolation from the West, Mugabe's supporters include his Iranian counterpart Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.","Report: China's foreign minister: ""Africans have the right to choose their own way""

"(CNN) -- Opposition groups in Cameroon are planning ""Egypt-like"" protests Wednesday to call for the president's ouster after almost three decades in power. President Paul Biya is running for re-election later this year. ""People yearn to see a change in government. He's been in place for 28 years,"" said Kah Walla, 45, an opposition member who is also running for president. Walla, one of the main organizers, said protests are planned in Douala and the capital, Yaounde. ""Our main reason is to ask for free and fair elections,"" she said. ""We also have other demands ... Cameroon has a lot of resources yet our people are living in poverty."" A spokesman for the prime minister was not available for comment and a man who answered the phone at the president's office declined to comment. Walla said the nation has been inspired by the recent uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt that led to the ouster of their longtime rulers. The protests have ignited a chain reaction that has spread to other countries, including Libya and Yemen. ""We want to take charge of our destiny like the people in Egypt and Tunisia did,"" Walla said. The U.S. Embassy in the Cameroon capital urged its citizens to be careful. ""As always, U.S. citizens should avoid all demonstrations, as even peaceful ones can quickly become unruly and a foreign national could stand out and become a target of harassment or worse,"" the embassy said in a statement Wednesday. In 2008, protesters took to the streets on the same day to protest food prices.

"(CNN)Fans of Belgian football side Standard Liege have been widely condemned after unfurling a banner depicting the decapitation of a former player during a match against league bitter rivals Anderlecht on Sunday. The giant image of former Standard captain Steven Defour, who joined Anderlecht from Portuguese club Porto last year, was unveiled in a stand behind the goal before kick off in a Belgian Pro-League match. The banner appeared to depict Jason Voorhees from the horror movie series ""Friday The 13th"" holding a sword in one hand and Defour's severed head in the other, with the caption reading, ""Red or Dead."" The incident was widely condemned with Belgian football officials quick to register their disgust on social media. Thibault De Gendt, competitions director at the Belgian Football Association tweeted: ""It was disgusting and took place in front of children. We hope never to see this again!"" while Bob Madou, Executive Director of Business at the Belgian FA called the banner ""distasteful and unacceptable."" This view was echoed by Belgian foreign affairs minister, Didier Reynders who called it ""stupid, nasty and irresponsible."" Defour, who played for the Standard Liege from 2006 to 2011, had a game to forget on the pitch for his new club. The 26-year-old was sent off in the second half after picking up a second yellow card for kicking the ball into the home crowd. Following his dismissal, the home side netted twice to seal a 2-0 win.","Fans unfurl ""Red or Dead"" banner depicting Steven Defour's severed head .

"The promise of $60 billion can do a lot to calm outrage. That point was underscored Wednesday, when House leaders met with irate representatives from New York and New Jersey who felt they had been ignored by House Speaker John Boehner when he scrapped a planned vote late Tuesday on a massive aid package for Superstorm Sandy victims. ""We're getting what New York and New Jersey need, and that's all that counts,"" Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told reporters after emerging from a 20-minute meeting with Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. ""We're all big boys; we understand that all that counts is the bottom line."" A vote on $9 billion for immediate aid is now set for Friday, with the balance of $51 billion due for consideration January 15. Opinion: Chris Christie drops bomb on GOP leaders . For its part, the Senate plans to vote by unanimous consent on Friday on the $9 billion but is waiting to see what is in the larger package before announcing a plan for that, a Senate Democratic leadership aide said. ""On the second tranche, we will need to see more details before we decide how to proceed,"" the aide said. ""As the Senate has shown by passing our bipartisan bill, we consider getting aid to the victims of Sandy a superlative priority, but we need to know more about the contents of the bill before deciding on a path forward."" Democrats were less mollified. ""While it would have been far better had they passed the Senate's bill today, at least this provides a path to produce the needed $60 billion for New York and New Jersey by the end of the month,"" said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, in a statement. ""It's really unbelievable how Speaker Boehner and his party could just walk away,"" said Christine Quinn, speaker of the New York City Council. ""To promise us a vote weeks from now? Why should we believe him at all? It's just shocking."" In a statement, Boehner and Cantor said ""critical aid"" to storm victims should be the first priority of the new Congress, which convenes Thursday. The comity contrasted sharply with the outrage that had exploded earlier in the day over Congress' inaction on the package, pitting even fellow Republicans against Boehner. It was ""disappointing and disgusting to watch,"" said New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, blaming ""the toxic internal politics of the House majority."" ""New Jersey deserves better than the duplicity we saw on display,"" he said, adding, ""shame on Congress."" Christie, a Republican, said he had tried to reach Boehner on Tuesday night after the latter canceled a vote on the aid bill, which had already been approved by the Senate. ""He did not take my calls,"" said Christie. In a news conference, Christie said he joined people of his state in feeling ""betrayed"" and added that the move summarizes ""why the American people hate Congress."" In a statement, Christie and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote: ""This failure to come to the aid of Americans following a severe and devastating natural disaster is unprecedented. The fact that days continue to go by while people suffer, families are out of their homes, and men and women remain jobless and struggling during these harsh winter months is a dereliction of duty. "" Republicans reverse earlier outrage, pledge to back Boehner . Boehner did not make public remarks and did not post about the issue on social media. GOP leadership sources said Boehner was worried it would be a bad political move for him to allow a vote on the new federal spending after a long day of getting pummeled by his own House Republicans for not demanding enough spending cuts in the fiscal cliff bill. Civility was restored late in the afternoon. ""As far as I'm concerned, that was a lifetime ago,"" King said. ""I know it was last night, but the bottom line is we're going forward getting what we believe is necessary."" Earlier, King had slammed his own party. ""The Republican Party has said it's the party of 'family values.' Last night, it turned its back on the most essential value of all, and that's to provide food, shelter, clothing and relief for people who have been hit by a natural disaster,"" King told CNN. King said he chased Boehner ""all over the House last night"" and that Boehner had said everything would be taken care of after the vote on the fiscal cliff. But Boehner left. King called the House leadership's move a ""knife in the back."" ""Anyone from New York or New Jersey who contributes one penny to the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee should have their head examined,"" King said. It's very rare for a lawmaker to call on anyone not to support his own party. New Congress tackles old leftovers . But on Wednesday afternoon, King said he would vote for Boehner in leadership elections scheduled for Thursday. A senior GOP leadership aide said Boehner will make a Sandy aid package ""his first priority in the new Congress,"" which begins its term Thursday. When a new Congress begins, both chambers have to begin from scratch with legislation, so the Senate's passage of a previous bill will be moot. Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman, said the speaker is ""committed to getting this bill passed this month."" Before the House adjourned Wednesday, President Barack Obama urged a vote. ""It has only been two months since Hurricane Sandy devastated communities across New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut as well as other Eastern states. Our citizens are still trying to put their lives back together,"" Obama said in a statement. ""When tragedy strikes, Americans come together to support those in need. I urge Republicans in the House of Representatives to do the same, bring this important request to a vote today, and pass it without delay for our fellow Americans,"" Obama said. Some of the harshest comments came from King. Scott Mandel, vice president of New York's Long Beach City Council, told CNN, ""The money was needed yesterday, and the fact that there's an obstacle in the way for whatever reason and a vote wasn't allowed to go forward was inexcusable."" The money would improve the city's ability to withstand damage from winter storms, Mandel said. Fiscal cliff battle held up the measure . The tumultuous process of getting the fiscal cliff deal passed in the House had held up the relief measure, and many House Republicans opposed the size of the Senate bill. ""Leadership was all-consumed with the cliff procedure,"" Rogers told reporters off the House floor late Tuesday. ""And they really have not had the time to devote to this because of that."" Senate passes Superstorm Sandy aid bill . Sandy killed at least 113 people in the United States and left millions of people without power after running up the East Coast in late October. The storm hit hardest in New York and New Jersey. Cuomo has put storm-related costs at $41.9 billion, while Christie has estimated a price tag of $36.8 billion. The bill includes grant funding for owners of homes and businesses, as well as funding for public improvement projects on the electrical grid, hospitals and transit systems to prevent damage from future storms. John Stone, a resident of New York's Staten Island, owned two homes before the storm.  One was destroyed; the other was so severely flooded that it remains unlivable. But he expressed no anger over the House's decision. ""They'll just have to do it all over again, I suppose.  What can you say?"" ""It's a lot of money,"" he said, adding ""there's a lot of other things they've got to do."" He tends to vote Republican and doesn't plan to turn away from the party, he said, although, he added, ""I don't give them much money anyway."" He's been living with relatives in New Jersey. Christie goes to Washington .","""Why should we believe (Boehner) at all?"" asks New York City Council speaker .
Vote on the relief bill is a priority, Speaker Boehner and Majority Leader Cantor say .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- Google doesn't have a booth at the Consumer Electronics Show, but the company's Android software is practically everywhere. As expected, smartphones maintain a major presence at CES. Despite Microsoft and Research in Motion showcasing their wares, the announcements and excitement is all around Google's Android. Every new 4G smartphone and tablet announced by the four major cellular carriers at or during CES runs on Android. Verizon Wireless showcased four smartphones at a news event on Thursday -- LG's Revolution, HTC's Thunderbolt, Motorola's Droid Bionic and a yet-to-be-named offering from Samsung. Touch-screen tablets were also on display with Samsung's Galaxy Tab and Motorola's Xoom. All six mobile devices, which are slated for release in the first half of the year starting as early as March, run on Android. ""At the same time that we were building out the [4G]area LTE network, the Android operating system really became a reality,"" Verizon Wireless CEO Dan Mead said in an interview on Thursday. AT&T announced three smartphones on Wednesday, which take advantage of the carriers' latest network protocol. All three, from Motorola's Atrix 4G, HTC's Inspire 4G and Samsung's Infuse 4G, were Androids. T-Mobile unveiled two new tablets -- LG G-Slate and Dell Streak 7 -- but no new smartphones at its event. Both tablets were running Android. During the week of CES, Sprint Nextel announced one new phone, the Evo Shift 4G from HTC, which runs on  -- take a guess. At Research in Motion's booth, the company showcases mainly the PlayBook, alongside BlackBerry phones that are already on the market. When questioned on phones, RIM co-CEO Mike Lazaridis reiterated that the company is hard at work on the next iteration of BlackBerry. It's based on the operating system that runs the PlayBook, and these ""super phones,"" as he reportedly called them, will have fast dual-core processors inside. But Motorola Mobility leapt past RIM with an Android phone that packs a dual-core chip. Thanks to the added processing power, the Atrix 4G can dock to a monitor or laptop shell to become a desktop computer running a modified version of Android. For Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's CES keynote, he focused the Windows Phone 7 presentation on applications -- now totally more than 5,500 -- instead of new hardware. Perhaps that's because carrier partners had nothing new to show. Ballmer concluded the phone portion of his keynote by announcing a new feature coming soon: copy-and-paste, something every major competitor already offers. Needless to say, the crowd was not impressed. On display at its booth, Microsoft had many of the nine Windows Phone 7 devices that are already available in stores. Though the company didn't announce new phones, a Microsoft mobile director told the Seattle Times that Windows Phone 7 products would be available on Verizon and Sprint by June 30. ""We're going to be a multiple operating-system company,"" Verizon's Mead said. ""We have a strong business relationship with Microsoft. We are interested in that."" iReport: Share your stories from CES . The variety of phone types that carriers offer is one area of competition. ""Not only do we have every major operating system,"" said AT&T Marketing Chief David Christopher at his company's Wednesday conference, ""but we have the best smartphones for those operating systems."" Despite these statements of breadth, Android was practically the only act in town this week. Last year, Google had a table at one of the three main nightly events associated with CES. This year, the company just held a small party and rented a private meeting room. Google is leaving it to the manufacturers to evangelize its platform. Expecting to make money from ads, Google provides Android for free to gadget makers to install, tinker with and sell on phones. Microsoft charges partners to use Windows Phone 7 and places limits on how they can alter the software. RIM doesn't license its software. Nor does Nokia, which didn't announce any new products or host a booth, though the company is here in Las Vegas for various small events. Apple, another major smartphone maker and a longtime holdout from CES, also doesn't license software to vendors. Palm, like the aforementioned three, develops software only for its own hardware. At CES two years ago, the company made a huge splash with the Pre. This year, however, Palm has a tiny footprint at displays for its new parent company, Hewlett-Packard. No new phones were shown. (HP is holding an event focused on Palm software scheduled for next month.) With tablets, Android is clearly rising as a top choice for manufacturers, but it's not alone. RIM has its own, and many companies are announcing tablets with Windows 7. The version of Android made for tablets isn't ready to be demonstrated live, and only two companies say they have products to support it. Others are showcasing Android tablets, but they are based on older Google software that was made for phones, which obviously have smaller screens. In smartphones, competitors will likely take the stage later this year to shine the spotlight on themselves. But at CES, Android is the star.","Google doesn't have a booth at CES, but its mobile products are practically everywhere .

"Hong Kong (CNN)During an exhibition in Hong Kong, Lee Ching proudly poses with her top prize winning creation -- a bright green clutch stitched together using an old nylon rice bag and a bottle top. The 31-year-old Lee happily shows off her winning display, telling visitors how much fun she had making the bag with her partner, a local design college student. ""The hardest part was sewing the bottle cap on,"" she said. ""I researched different types of bags. Sometimes you need a bigger bag if you want to put more things inside."" Walk around the room and the exhibition is full of discarded items -- wine boxes, CD covers and straws -- now reborn as pen holders, notepads and lamps. In a sense, Lee and the 15 or so people involved with the project have been ""neglected"" in one way or another by Hong Kong society, all of these people have struggled to get by because they all have intellectual disabilities. Despite the pride she has for her daughter, Lee's mother worries about her. ""Her character is too simple and warm. I'm worried she will get hurt and sometimes she has to be careful about what she says."" People living with Down Syndrome are often stuck with menial jobs. But this exhibition -- run by the local Salvation Army -- gave Lee and others the chance to learn a new skill, partner with a local student to reinvent ""trash"" into treasure -- all in an effort to raise disability awareness. In Chinese superstition, people with disabilities have been associated with bad luck -- that the disability was a punishment for the wrongdoings of an ancestor. Many lived in hiding, encountering discrimination and slurs, advocates say. But increasingly, people are finding ways to counter misconceptions and bring people with disabilities into the mainstream. It's an experience that Heidi Hui, a social work professor at the University of Hong Kong and mother of a daughter with Down Syndrome, knows well. Hui explains that traditionally disabled people are seen as ""an outcast, something [that is] no good."" ""There is a Chinese saying that it must be the family who is doing something wrong... in the older days they were saying that it's a kind of punishment."" Hui recalled that when she and other parents of children opened their first center for the Down Syndrome Association more than 20 years ago, the windows were broken and they couldn't use the elevator because neighbors didn't want them there. The group responded by holding workshops with residents to explain and dispel myths about Down Syndrome. A few years later, the group was finally allowed to use the elevator and the workshops no longer became necessary. Although information about disability is now widely available, some of that stigma exists today. Catrin Anderson is a 15 year-old with cerebral palsy who requires round-the-clock care. She can't move but she can see and hear. She often has to deal with strangers talking about her in front of her. Her mother Kim Anderson, originally from Britain, said: ""The difficult thing with Catrin is that if she is in company and people are talking about her, she's understanding everything they're saying."" To combat this problem, she made a sign in English and Chinese telling people she can see and hear. For Anderson, the key to change in attitudes is integration. ""That's maybe what we're still not doing enough of in Hong Kong, maybe in schools and getting people like Catrin... out and about in society, because until they're in society, society is not going to fully understand or appreciate them."" The Census Department estimates that about 10% of the city's population has physical or intellectual disabilities, based on on figures from 2014. At another photo exhibition featuring people with disabilities, Calib Lee, a 19-year-old with Down Syndrome, strikes a Taekwondo pose in his green belt. His father, Peter Lee said he believes attitudes are changing. ""More and more people with disabled child or children, [the parents] will take them outside to encounter the whole world, let them learn, let them go to school and not just hide the disabled child or children in Hong Kong. Nowadays, more and more parents love or like to do that."" Frank Freeman photographed Lee and other young people with Down Syndrome as models for his exhibition entitled ""The Purest People."" He photographed young people showing off their hobbies such as acting, dancing and swimming. There have been efforts around the globe to be more inclusive of people with Down Syndrome, including Target ads in the United States featuring child models and a TV ad by British department store, Marks & Spencer's. Two years ago, Freeman started volunteering with the Down Syndrome Association and realized part of the problem was that people didn't know how to talk to those with the condition and that they were often treated as patients, instead of people. He said that the aim of the exhibition was to show a more playful side of people with Down Syndrome. ""They just want to love and be involved in making people happy,"" he said.","Hong Kong exhibits attempt to bring awareness of people with disabilities .

"Riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds when thousands of people took to the streets of Sao Paulo on Thursday night to protest an increase in bus and metro fares. At least 100 people were injured and more than 120 were arrested in the violent clashes, occurring exactly one year before the World Cup kicks off in Brazil's financial capital. It was the latest in a string of protests staged in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and other cities over the last week aimed at getting officials to revoke recent increases in public transportation costs. Between 5,000 and 10,000 protesters gathered in front of the Municipal Theater in downtown Sao Paulo at 5 p.m. and then started marching through the streets, where a huge police presence waited. For the first time in this series of protests, Sao Paulo deployed riot police. When police began to fire tear gas and rubber bullets, protesters shouted ""fascist police"" and ran in different directions. Protesters said no warning was given before the tear gas and bullets were used. A CNN team also did not hear any warnings or demands to stop before the measures were taken. In previous marches, the government has accused protesters of initiating violence, and protesters have said police used excessive violence to try to stop marchers. On Tuesday night, protesters set a bus on fire and smashed the windows of at least nine banks. On Thursday night, CNN witnessed protesters spraying walls with graffiti and throwing rocks. The daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo reported that seven of its reporters were shot with rubber bullets. A witness saw police shoot Giuiliana Vallone and told the paper: ""When she told me to get out of the way because of the chaos, a policeman looked and cowardly shot her."" Another TV reporter told CNN that she and her crew were deliberately sprayed with pepper spray by police when they filmed them arresting protesters. The marchers were protesting an increase in bus and metro fares to 3.20 reais ($1.55) from 3 reais. ""For a lot of us, it's just the final straw,"" said a metro operator who was participating in the march. ""We just pay more and more for something that isn't worth it.""","Riot police fire tear gas and rubber bullets into crowds of thousands in Sao Paulo .

"As an argument between Gina and her boyfriend escalated in their New Jersey home more than 20 years ago, he started to become violent. Gina's friend Shawna, who'd come over to check on her, picked up the phone to call the police. Soon, Gina's boyfriend redirected his fury. It wasn't until he turned his attention from Gina and began beating Shawna with the phone that it clicked. ""It was such an eye opener to what he had been doing to me,"" Gina said. Shawna's reaction was not to cower, as Gina had done in the past when her boyfriend flew off the handle. She fended off the violent man, and Gina helped her. ""I saw then that he wasn't this superhuman. Two pretty slight girls were able to subdue him,"" Gina said. (CNN is using only first names to protect the women's privacy.) Shawna had told Gina time and again that her partner was abusive. ""I made all sorts of excuses for him: He was stressed, having a bad day, etc. Mostly I blamed myself for it,"" Gina said. Inspired by Shawna's actions, Gina obtained a restraining order, and the police removed him from the home. Their nearly two-year relationship was over. ""I surrounded myself with friends, kept busy, but I didn't get a healthy mindset until years later,"" Gina said. To an outsider's eye, the issue of domestic violence can be black and white: Just leave. For those left physically and emotionally black and blue, that zero-tolerance perspective isn't as clear, creating a disconnect between the abused and those who care for them. When pop stars Chris Brown and Rihanna affectionately attended a Lakers game together on Christmas Day, many were left scratching -- or shaking -- their heads over the potentially rekindled romance. Brown had been sentenced in August 2009 for felony assault on Rihanna, his then-girlfriend. He was required to serve probation, do 1,400 hours of community service and complete a 52-week domestic violence program. Opinion: Rihanna making a bad decision? After their outing became public, CNN reader Daverelentless commented on the Marquee blog, ""When he beats her up again (it's only a matter of time), I will not feel sorry for her. Only an idiot sticks their head in the Lion's mouth TWICE just to see if the Lion bites."" He wasn't alone in expressing anger and bewilderment over Rihanna's decision to welcome Brown back into her life. Witnesses to abusive relationships often ask: Why go back? Katie Ray-Jones, president of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and the National Dating Abuse Helpline, says there are countless reasons a victim returns to or stays in an abusive relationship: low self-worth, financial worries, fear of what the abuser would do if the abused left, even love. Friends and family are often an integral part of the victim's way out. According to Ray-Jones, loved ones of the abused are the second most frequent callers to her organization's help line, behind the abused themselves. ""What can we do, because she doesn't want to leave?"" they ask. (Ray-Jones uses ""she"" and ""her"" because only 3% of the hot line's callers are male. But domestic violence affects men too: A 2010 CDC survey found that more than one in three women and more than one in four men had experienced violence by an intimate partner.) Ray-Jones said an abused woman will leave a relationship approximately seven times before she leaves for good. The back and forth can frustrate friends and family. If victims feel supported, they may grow stronger and more confident. ""It's really important for her to make the decision to leave. He's controlling decision-making, so if you seem to control her decision as well, it's not good,"" Ray-Jones said. Being supportive doesn't mean telling the abused over and over that they should leave. Instead, offer a listening ear for when they're ready to open up. "" 'I really care about you; I'm your friend; I want to make sure you're OK; and I want to let you know I'm here for you,' "" Ray-Jones suggested. Ray-Jones also notes that if you think an abused person's life is at risk, you should be ""very careful"" about calling 911. ""If the police show up and they don't arrest him for whatever reason, that could be a really bad situation for her,"" Ray-Jones said. An alternative is to offer the victim a safe place to stay or a referral to a shelter. Even if the victim doesn't listen the first or second or eighth time, it's important not to give up, Ray-Jones said. The mantra: ""I respect your decision. Here are some tips to keep you safe."" If an abuse victim feels judged by a friend or family member, he or she could lose trust, withdraw and become skeptical of talking about the abuse to anyone else. When Krystal's sister, Renee, left her second abusive relationship, she turned to her family, who had stuck by her and helped her move away from her first abuser. During that year-long relationship, Renee often refused help but wouldn't get angry when the family offered, Krystal said. ""I have no doubt that she could have survived on her own; she's a strong woman. I think the most important thing was that we validated her feeling that things weren't right,"" Krystal said. Renee managed to extricate herself from her first abusive relationship, and according to Krystal, her new boyfriend was ""so nice and welcoming when I visited. He seemed really sweet to her most of the time."" Then, Renee's boyfriend kicked her out of the house with no money. She needed a place to stay, so she picked up the phone and called their father again for help. ""She didn't give many details, just that she was kicked out of the house. Slowly, other details started coming through, but I think it took her a while to really accept that she was in an abusive situation,"" Krystal said. It wasn't until much later that she mentioned to Krystal that he had even, at one point, threatened her with a gun. Renee never pressed charges or called the police. She still has to keep in contact with her abuser because they share custody of their children. Her family is still behind her, even with the knowledge that they can't fix everything. ""I felt absolutely helpless,"" Krystal said. ""The survivor has to be the one to take action and make decisions. It's not easy to admit that you can't just come to the rescue for your little sister.""

"It's getting harder to remember life before September 11, 2001, but as soon as you walk through the door, the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum aims to take you back there. Bush was first elected on November 7, 2000, and sworn in on January 20, 2001, so the months before the 9/11 terrorist attack were but a brief moment in the Bush presidency. Those moments are represented by the first museum exhibits, part of the 43rd president's library to be dedicated Thursday in Dallas. Bush 43: 'History will ultimately judge' All five living U.S. presidents are expected to attend the ceremonies. Displays of the legacy he intended for himself -- the so-called Bush-era tax cuts, his signature ""No Child Left Behind"" education reform, his faith-based community initiatives -- quickly give way to the moment that unexpectedly defined his presidency. By the Numbers: Presidential libraries . The bright red dress first lady Laura Bush wore to her husband's first state dinner, just six days before 9/11, stands in contrast to the next, most talked about artifact in the museum - the twisted hulk of two beams from the World Trade Center. Employees giving the media a tour said it is believed to be the point where the second aircraft hit the South Tower, the first tower to collapse. ""The whole presidency was changed on 9/11 and it could not be otherwise,"" Bush's former chief of staff Josh Bolten told CNN. ""It was a very different presidency from then on. That's dramatically portrayed in this museum."" 5 presidents on hand for Bush center dedication . In most museums, touching the exhibits is not allowed. Here though, visitors are encouraged to reach out and touch the dark steel and tangibly connect to that day that changed America. ""George walked a family through recently and realized that the children who were on the tour with him weren't alive on September 11,"" the former first lady told reporters at the museum on Wednesday. ""They had no direct memory of it like all of us do and it's important, I think, to remind people of it."" History's jury is still out on George W. Bush . What comes after the wreckage from the World Trade Center is the hallmark of Bush's time in office: the war on terror. Above the bullhorn Bush used on Sept. 14, 2001, to address workers at ""Ground Zero"" is the key quote from his remarks at the National Cathedral on the same day: ""This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing."" Flash points of terrorism are pinpointed on a large map of the world. Critics of Bush's decision to invade Iraq on the basis of weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist or his policies on interrogation techniques of terrorist detainees will find no apologies here. But there is some introspection. In the Decision Points Theater, an interactive exhibit based on the president's book by the same name, visitors can try their hand at making the decisions Bush considered his toughest: invading Iraq, implementing the so-called ""surge"" of troops there in 2007, the federal response to Hurricane Katrina and the unprecedented government intervention during the financial crisis. Brazile: Bush came through on Katrina . Just this month Bush said he is ""comfortable"" with his legacy on the Iraq war and those close to him shrug off the effect sustained criticism has had on him. But this exhibit aims to challenge visitors with an implicit question: could you have done any better? Museum-goers can request advice from top aides and military commanders before voting on how they would respond. ""They get pestered by press to make a decision, to give an answer. Then at the end, they get to decide, 'what would you do?' After the audience votes, the president comes on and tells what he decided and why he decided,"" Bolten explains. ""But it's all intended to give people a sense of what it's like to be president, and to give them a sense that a lot of the issues that people have made up their minds on are a lot tougher than they might have imagined."" There's also a lighter side to the experience. A replica of the Oval Office leaves you feeling like you are in the White House rather than on the Dallas campus of Southern Methodist University, where the museum is located. The Air Force One jackets worn by President and Mrs. Bush aboard the presidential aircraft are prominently featured. Hillary, Jeb in spotlight before Bush library dedication . There is a significant amount of square footage dedicated to the presidential pets. Air Force One dog bowls used by Barney and Miss Beazley, the Bush family's Scottish Terriers, are displayed next to a deflated volleyball that Barney loved to play with on the South Lawn of the White House. For those close to the former president, the dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum is a time to reflect on his legacy and also the public perception of a controversial commander-in-chief. Bush's approval rating has improved since he left the White House but it's still a markedly low 47 percent, according to the latest ABC/Washington Post poll. A new CNN/ORC poll shows that a growing number of Americans -- 42% -- say Bush's presidency was a success, up 11% since he left office in 2009, but 55% say it was a failure. ""Over time when the emotions fade you can take a more objective look and I think that will benefit President Bush,"" Bolten told CNN. ""One of the really cool things about [him] is he doesn't care very much. I mean, he's not fixated on his own personal popularity. What he cares about is he did the best he could, he applied principle, very strong principle, to some tough problems, and he will be comfortable with history's judgment.""","The George W.

"(CNN)This time there was no escape for Rafael Nadal at the Australian Open. The 14-time grand slam winner rallied to beat unheralded qualifier Tim Smyczek in five sets in the second round but he couldn't come back against a better opponent, Tomas Berdych, in the quarterfinals Tuesday. Berdych crushed Nadal 6-2 6-0 7-6 (5) thanks to a fine display of power tennis to end a 17-match losing streak against the Spaniard. One of those losses came in the 2010 Wimbledon final. Earlier Tuesday, Maria Sharapova set up a semifinal duel with fellow Russian Ekaterina Makarova when she eased past Eugenie Bouchard 6-3 6-2 and 10th-seed Makarova upset third-seed Simona Halep 6-4 6-0. While Berdych barely missed on Rod Laver Arena, Nadal called his own display ""very bad"" and said he helped Berdych by lacking in his trademark intensity. ""The third was the right set, the right game that I have to play,"" Nadal told reporters. ""But is obvious that before I didn't play with the right confidence, with the right intensity, losing court, playing very short. I make him play very easy. ""So you cannot expect to win matches in quarterfinals of a grand slam helping the opponent to play well."" Contributing to his fluctuating performances in Melbourne were a lack of match practice, added Nadal. Entering the Australian Open, he'd only played eight tour-level matches since the middle of July because of a wrist injury, then appendicitis, in another long layoff. Besides stuttering against Smyczek -- when Nadal was ill -- the third seed struggled at times in the third round against Dudi Sela. He turned it around against Kevin Anderson in the fourth round. ""When you are coming back from injuries you lose more easier the feeling than you do when you are on rhythm, when you are with no injuries, when you are confident in yourself that you played a lot of matches,"" Nadal said. ""And that's the thing that happened, no? ""When I was playing well, I played well. But at the same time, against Sela I played well two sets, played bad the third. Against Anderson, was probably the only match I played regular. Played the right level during almost all the time. ""The rest of the matches have been lot of up and down."" Berdych, however, did what he had to, hitting 46 winners and making only 21 unforced errors. The tennis tour has seen a handful of retired grand slam winners return as coaches and Berdych attempted to lure eight-time grand slam champion Ivan Lendl -- Murray's former coach -- last year. But Lendl turned down the chance to work with his countryman because he was, according to Berdych, too busy. Berdych instead opted for the 28-year-old Dani Vallverdu, Murray's former co-coach. Lendl and Vallverdu were by Murray's side when he opened his grand slam account at the 2012 U.S. Open before the Scot became the first British man in almost 80 years to win Wimbledon in 2013. Berdych indeed admitted that Vallverdu helped him with his tactics against Nadal, and the effects were immediate. ""He changed a lot of things,"" said Berdych, who next faces Murray. ""He changed a lot of positive things. And the best is I'm really able to execute them really, really quickly. That's how it should be. ""But ... it's not only about sitting on the table and talking about the tactics, it's also about you have to know what to do with that. If you have a plan it's a nice thing, but if you never tried it before or never practiced before, I mean, that's useless."" The 29-year-old blasted past Nadal in an hour in the first two sets. When Nadal elevated his game in the third set, Berdych didn't buckle even after he missed two match points on the Nadal serve at 6-5. He stormed to a 5-1 lead in the tiebreak, a deficit that Nadal wasn't able to overcome. Berdych saved all four break points he faced and pummeled Nadal's second serve, winning 71% of those points. ""Today I have the only time I can to enjoy the victory,"" said Berdych. ""When I wake up tomorrow morning just all the focus goes for the next opponent and my next match."" Murray ended the run of 19-year-old Aussie Nick Kyrgios, dampening the spirits of most of those on Rod Laver Arena who showed up for the night match. Murray won 6-3 7-6 (5) 6-3, the turning point coming in the second-set tiebreak. Kyrgios -- the first teenager on the men's tour to make multiple grand slam quarterfinals since Roger Federer -- led 4-3 with a mini-break but paid the price for two short approach shots, both punished by perfect Murray lobs. ""He was way too good for me,"" Kyrgios said. The other semifinal pairing will be determined Wednesday. Novak Djokovic, trying for a fifth Australian Open crown, meets big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic, and defending champion Stan Wawrinka confronts U.S. Open finalist Kei Nishikori. No problem for Maria . Sharapova needed three sets to battle past Bouchard at last year's French Open, but Tuesday was easier for the five-time grand slam winner. She was steady. Bouchard, meanwhile, drowned in unforced errors, making 30 and chipping in only 13 winners. ""If I don't have enough time I probably go for riskier shots and that's why I would miss a few more,"" Bouchard told reporters. ""That's why I think I made a few too many unforced errors. Just feeling under pressure, feeling I had to go for something."" Sharapova has turned around her tournament since saving two match points in the second round against qualifier Alexandra Panova. Her dad Yuri -- who no longer travels with Sharapova -- hasn't been shy to give her advice. ""When you're down and out like I was in the second match, it's like, I don't want to face that phone call with my father too many times during a tournament,"" said Sharapova, who last won a major outside Roland Garros seven years ago. ""It's like, 'I better get my stuff together.' ""He told me that I was working much harder than I had to. If I was maybe a little bit smarter, did a few things maybe a little bit differently, maybe it could have been easier."" Makarova may not be a household name but the left-hander has now reached consecutive grand slam semifinals. She handled the occasion better than Halep, who lost last year's French Open final to Sharapova in three dramatic sets. ""I practiced very well in the morning, but maybe I was a little bit too stressed before I started the match,"" Halep told reporters. ""Wasn't my good day. I had a bad day.""

"(CNN)Rozalia Wolf was only 15 years old when the horror began. While most young girls worry about boys and homework, Rozalia Wolf spent her teenage days fearing she would not live to see the sun rise again. She spent a lifetime trying forget the horrors she had to endure at Auschwitz. This year she is turning 91 and for the first time she shares her story and tries to make sense of why she survived when so many others did not. Rozalia was living with her family in Krakow when Adolf Hitler's troops marched into Poland in the fall of 1939. ""Krakow was such a beautiful city before the Nazis came. One of the most beautiful places I have ever known"", she remembers. Over seven decades later, Rozalia's memory is beginning to fade and she struggles to remember when exactly she was brought to Auschwitz, but she cannot forget the day she arrived at the death camp. ""There were thousands of us, squeezed into wagons. Auschwitz was very close to Krakow, but they drove us around for hours, so we wouldn't know where we were'"" she says. ""I remember it was dark, but it looked like the sky was on fire. It was so bright. It was the gas chambers, they made it look like the sky was burning,"" Rozalia remembers. The newly arrived prisoners had to take their clothes off and lie naked on the ground. Then the selection process started. Pregnant women, children, elderly people and anyone who was deemed unfit for intense physical labor were sent directly to the gas chambers. ""They told us to go left or right. One direction meant life, the other one meant death. I never knew which one I was going,"" the 90-year old says. Suddenly a colleague of her brother's was standing in front her. He was working at the camp. ""He recognized me and brought me some food. All of a sudden I realized I was naked. I was so ashamed I dropped the food. Later, he asked one of the SS officers to give me a pair of underwear. You cannot imagine how cold it was. We were happy for every piece of clothing we were given."" The prisoners at Auschwitz were forced into excruciating physical labor, beaten, tortured and subjected to horrific medical experiments spearheaded by the SS Captain Dr. Joseph Mengele. Many of those who were not sent to the gas chambers died of starvation and illness. An estimated 1.3 million people were deported to the concentration camp and over 1.1 million were killed, out of which about 960,000 were Jews. ""We knew about the gas chambers. Every few minutes they sent people to die. I always wondered when it was going to be my turn, but I never gave up hope. Giving up meant you were going to die, but I wanted to live so badly,"" she recounts her days at Auschwitz. She says it was her incredibly strong instinct to live that helped her get through every day. ""Even when they beat me I never cried. If they were going to kill me I did not want to give them the satisfaction of seeing me cry,"" she explains. Looking back, Rozalia says it is hard to put the feelings into words. Prior to Auschwitz she was in a Krakow ghetto and the Plaszow concentration camp nearby, infamous for its sadistic treatment of prisoners. However, nothing compared to the horrors of Auschwitz, she recalls. ""One can talk about it and talk about it, but it is almost impossible to comprehend what a human being can endure and survive and what people can do to other people,"" she explains shaking her head in disbelief. ""What kind of people are capable of doing this to other human beings? They must have had families and children themselves'"" Rozalia still wonders today. ""I think they forgot how to be human,"" she adds. As allied forces started closing in on concentration camps in Easter Europe in 1944 and 1945, many prisoners were either killed or moved to concentration camps further West. In 1944, Rozalia was transported to Bergen-Belsen, a concentration camp near Hanover, Germany. Between 1944 and 1945 the number of prisoners at Bergen-Belsen tripled from around 7,300 to 22,000 according to the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Many detainees were women, one of them was Rozalia, and another one was Anne Frank. Bergen-Belsen became scene of sheer horror as the camp became increasingly overcrowded. Prisoners were starved for days, clean water was barely available and diseases started to spread killing tens of thousands in the beginning of 1945 alone. Yet Rozalia's story of survival continued. On April 15th, 1945, Rozalia's ordeal ultimately came to an end when British forces liberated the camp. After the liberation, Rozalia first went back to Poland, then to Israel. In 1948 she moved to Germany. ""My husband fell ill and the best treatment was there,"" she says to explain her move to the place that caused her so much pain in the past. Rozalia lost her family and her youth in the Holocaust, but she never lost her will to live. ""Maybe that is why I survived, I don't know. I was also very, very lucky. It was a miracle,"" she says. After the War she has tried not to think about what she had to go through. ""Life goes on, you know"", she says.  Asked whether she would go back to see Auschwitz today, she said: ""My grandchildren have visited the museum at Auschwitz. I wouldn't go back, I have already been there.""","Rozalia Wolf, 90, was only 15 years old when she was brought to Auschwitz .

"(CNN)It's been over six decades since the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) was established, creating a buffer zone between North and South Korea that's often referred to as the world's most tense border. But remaining relatively untouched for all those years has had an unintended effect on this 250-kilometer long, four kilometer wide no-man's land. Home to five rivers and several mountains, it's become a thriving natural habitat for thousands of plant and animal species. And if South Korea has its way, the DMZ will eventually be transformed into an ecology peace park. The proposal is high on Seoul's agenda at this week's Ramsar Convention, an international meeting on wetlands taking place in Switzerland. ""A Korean delegation to the standing committee meeting of the Ramsar Convention will brief international organization officials about the DMZ peace park plan to seek cooperation,"" said an official of the Ministry of Unification, the government office responsible for inter-Korean relations, in a Korea Times report. ""It aims to broaden international support for the project,"" added the official. North Korea not on board . Apart from the thousands of soldiers stationed at the DMZ, the heavily fortified border is home to more than 1,200 varieties of plants and thousands of animal species -- including endangered wildlife like the Asiatic Black Bear and Amur leopard. It's not the first time the idea to turn the DMZ into an ecology park has been raised. The South Korean government first introduced the plan in 2013. It brought it up again in an official statement in 2014, saying the park could become a symbol of peace between the two Koreas. The South's Ministry of Unification even listed it as one of its new year plans for 2014. So why enlist the international community's assistance? ""As the southern part of DMZ is under the control of the United Nations Command, it is important for Seoul to gain global support for the DMZ park plan,"" reports the Korea Times. But the biggest challenge will be to persuade North Korea to get on board with the plan. Pyongyang has repeatedly rejected the idea, dismissing it as an attempt to make money off tourists.","South Korea hopes to gain international support for a plan to turn the Korean Demilitarized Zone into an ecology park .

"(CNN)For generations of Americans, the summer job has been a gateway from youth into the adult world of work. But for millions of our young people -- particularly young men and women of color in our cities -- summer employment is primarily a story of opportunity denied. According to 2013 data, young white men were five times more likely to have summer employment than their low-income African American peers. This summer employment gap has far-reaching consequences for our country and must be addressed. There's a reason why many parents want their children to get summer jobs during college or even the last years of high school. Employment helps young people discover the satisfactions and responsibilities of work. The hard and soft skills they gain are important to enduring success down the road. In some cases, summer jobs help them discover career pathways. Even internships have become crucial resume-building tools. According to one analysis, for every year a teenager works, her income during her 20s rises 14 to 16%.  Unfortunately, the United States has seen a precipitous decline in youth employment -- a 40% drop over just the last 12 years, according to one study. Another report found that in 2011 less than one-quarter of American teenagers held paid jobs over the course of the entire year. These trends are hitting low-income communities the hardest. Teens from families that earn less than $20,000 a year were nearly 20% less likely to be employed than teens with a family income of $60,000 or more. The lack of employment opportunity for lower-income young people and minorities is likely to have a profound effect on their adult years. In today's increasingly competitive and globalized economy, employers are demanding workers with specific skills and capabilities. However, our educational and training programs are simply not doing enough to equip job seekers with those skills. Recent estimates suggest that up to 4 million jobs in the United States stand unfilled and employers will continue to struggle to fill many of these positions until we increase the number of workers with the right skills.  The youth unemployment crisis exacerbates this problem. There is no simple fix for this challenge. But we need to start by focusing on what works. First, more must be done to strengthen the infrastructure of summer youth programs. These programs need to be connected to each other and to private sector resources to ensure that they are preparing young people for today's jobs market. A framework for assessing and adhering to quality standards is key. Second, we need more private sector engagement. Companies of all sizes need to recognize that preparing the next generation of employees is both the right thing and smart thing to do. They can and should play a role in providing funding and hands-on support for public and non-profit training summer youth employment programs. Finally, we should develop more skills-based summer learning opportunities. Training programs don't fulfill their potential if they are providing either generalized skills or skills that don't correlate to job demand. Rather, program managers need to make sure these programs are structured to reflect the specific skill needs of the growing economic sectors in that community so young people can see the path that leads to a rewarding, well-paying job. The good news is that there are plenty of examples of successful programs across the country that can be emulated and scaled up. Last summer, Sacramento launched a coalition of hiring agencies to grow job opportunities for youth.  The coalition strengthened individual programs run by leading businesses and nonprofits.   Academic partners provided resume, interview and financial management training to further empower students. The program is now set to grow with new partners and a rapidly growing network of hiring companies. Similarly, last year JPMorgan Chase worked with local governments and nonprofit partners to support programs in 14 cities across the country from Jersey City to Seattle to create jobs for 50,000 teens and learning opportunities for another 50,000 young people. Strategic and well-resourced partnerships can turn the summer months into a period of growth and opportunity. We owe it to our young people and our entire country to make sure more summer youth employment programs are available that are integrated into our existing school year investments in education and training. It is time for government, business and nonprofits to turn summer from months where skills and learning atrophy to a time when our young people are put on the springboard to successful lives.","The U.S. has seen a precipitous decline in youth employment -- a 40% drop over the last 12 years .

"(CNN)A video file posted online Tuesday purports to relay a new message from Japanese ISIS hostage Kenji Goto: He and a captive Jordanian military pilot will be killed in the next 24 hours if Jordan doesn't release a convicted would-be suicide bomber. It is the second purported message from Goto in four days. If authentic, it is the first time ISIS is publicly linking the fates of Goto and the captive Jordanian pilot, Moaz al-Kassasbeh, whom ISIS captured after his jet crashed last month in Syria. The latest file, posted to YouTube and distributed on social media by known ISIS supporters, appears to show a static image of Goto, alone, in handcuffs and wearing orange, holding a picture of who appears to be al-Kassasbeh. Over the image, a voice purporting to be Goto's restates Saturday's apparent ISIS proposal: Goto would go free if Jordan releases longtime prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi. This time, it's still a one-for-one swap, but now both the lives of Goto and the Jordanian pilot are threatened if it doesn't go through. CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of Tuesday's message. ""I've been told this is my last message, and I've also been told that the barrier obstructing my freedom is now just the Jordanian government delaying the handover of Sajida,"" the voice says in English in Tuesday's post. ""Tell the Japanese government to put all the political pressure on Jordan."" ""Her for me -- a straight exchange,"" the voice says. ""Any more delays by the Jordanian government will mean they are responsible for the death of their pilot, which will then be followed by mine. ""I only have 24 hours left to live, and the pilot has even less."" The nearly two-minute video, posted Tuesday morning ET, makes no mention of releasing pilot al-Kassasbeh, even if al-Rishawi is released. The video is similar to a post from Saturday, which alleged that ISIS had killed a different Japanese hostage, Haruna Yukawa. Saturday's post shows a static image of Goto, holding what appears to be a photo of beheaded compatriot Yukaka. A voice, purporting to be Goto's, says that Yukawa was killed because Japan hadn't answered a previous ISIS demand of $200 million for the Japanese captives' freedom. Saturday's voice also said that the captors no longer demanded money, but rather a Goto-for-al-Rishawi swap. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Sunday that experts were analyzing Saturday's video, but that it seemed ""highly credible."" U.S. authorities said they had no reason to doubt its authenticity. Abe on Wednesday morning told reporters in Tokyo that he was angry about the ongoing situation. ""Under very severe circumstances, I instructed yet again that the government work together as one towards the immediate release of Mr. Goto,"" he said. Al-Rishawi is an Iraqi woman facing the death penalty in Jordan for her role in a series of bombings that killed dozens of people at hotels in the Arab kingdom in 2005. Authorities said she tried to take part in the massacre, but her explosives failed. Militants say they captured al-Kassasbeh, the Jordanian pilot, after he ejected from his crashing F-16 last month, having taken part in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near ISIS' de-facto capital, Raqqa, Syria. Jordan is participating in an American-led mission against ISIS, an organization seeking to establish a caliphate, or Islamic State, and has wrested territory spanning from central Syria to about 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Baghdad. Goto, 47, and Yukawa, 42, had gone to the Middle East for different reasons, the former is an experienced freelance journalist covering the conflict in Iraq and Syria, and the latter an aspiring security contractor who felt at home in the war-torn region. They ended up in the hands of ISIS in recent months. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq, Junko Ogura and Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.","Images appears to show hostage Kenji Goto holding a photo of captive Jordanian .

"The U.S. Department of Justice says it's concerned about actions taken by the Ferguson, Missouri, Police Department in recent days. Two letters to Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson this week from Justice Department chastised Ferguson police over what officers were wearing -- and in some cases, not wearing. Specifically, the department took issue with some officers wearing bracelets that say ""I am Darren Wilson,"" and other officers who were not wearing their name tags. ""Officers wearing name plates while in uniform is a basic component of transparency and accountability,"" Christy E. Lopez, deputy chief of the Special Litigation Section of the Department's Civil Rights Division, said in a September 23 letter obtained by CNN. ""The failure to wear name plates conveys a message to the community that, through anonymity, officers may seek to act with impunity."" The department requires officers to wear a ""name tag"" with their first initial and last name on both their shirt uniform and jacket, according to the letter. The ""I am Darren Wilson"" bracelets are ""exacerbating an already tense atmosphere between law enforcement and residents in Ferguson,"" Lopez said in a separate letter dated Friday. ""These bracelets reinforce the very 'us versus them' mentality that many residents of Ferguson believe exist."" Lopez did acknowledge the ""importance of individual expression"" of officers in the letter. Ferguson has been marred by discord and distrust of authorities -- especially among those in its large African-American community -- since the August 9 shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black teenager killed by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson, who is white. Despite demands by protesters, Wilson has not been charged in this case, though a grand jury is hearing evidence that could lead to an indictment. Tensions in the St. Louis suburb rekindled this week after one of three memorials for Brown was burned. While many peaceful protesters took to the street Tuesday night, elements within the demonstration stoked chaos, attacking police with guns, rocks and bottles and vandalizing and looting businesses, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson said. One person threw a Molotov cocktail at a parking structure, and there was an attempt to set a gasoline fire at a custard shop, he said. Two officers were injured, one of whom was struck by a rock below the eye, Johnson said. Police chief tries to apologize . Emotions spiked following an appearance by Chief Jackson late Thursday night to address the crowd and take questions from protesters. Earlier in the day, he apologized for his department's actions after Michael Brown's shooting but pledged not to resign. Dramatically wading into the crowd, Jackson apologized again. ""I'm sorry, and I said that from my heart,"" he said. ""I had to get that off my chest. It's been sitting there for two months."" But not everyone was anxious to hear from him. ""If you are not resigning tonight, go home,"" one man said on a bullhorn. ""What do you want me to do?"" Jackson asked a protester. ""Talk to me."" It was shortly after Jackson agreed to walk and talk with the demonstrators that a scuffle broke out a short distance behind the chief, and officers moved in to make arrests. There was no indication that Jackson was directly threatened, but he was quickly escorted inside the police department building. ""Trust -- it takes time,"" Johnson told CNN on Friday. ""I talked to the chief this morning. I think he regrets going out there last night, . Chief says he's sorry Brown's body wasn't moved sooner . In a CNN interview, Jackson addressed his rationale for staying on the job and not resigning. ""This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it,"" he told CNN. Jackson's interview with CNN came Thursday afternoon, shortly after the release of his video apology to Brown's parents and the peaceful demonstrators who took to Ferguson's streets to protest Brown's death. In that video, the chief expressed regret that it took investigating officers four hours to remove Brown's body from the street after he was shot dead. ""I'm truly sorry for the loss of your son. I'm also sorry that it took so long to remove Michael from the street,"" he said in his video statement. Investigators were doing ""important work"" trying to uncover the truth and collect evidence in those four hours, Jackson said, but ""it was just too long, and I'm truly sorry for that."" ""Please know that the investigating officers meant no disrespect to the Brown family, to the African-American community or the people (in the neighborhood where Brown was shot). They were simply trying to do their jobs,"" Jackson said. Asked Thursday afternoon why the apology took so long, Jackson told CNN, ""There's been so much going on, and every day there's a different challenge."" He said he's been wanting to apologize for ""the time it took to remove Michael from the scene,"" and he feels better now that he's done it. ""This is something that's just been weighing on me. It's something that needed to be said. It should've been said a long time ago,"" he told CNN.","Department of Justice asks that officers not wear ""I am Darren Wilson"" bracelets .

"(CNN) -- Just like a Rolling Stone ... It's football's answer to rock and roll's arena tours. Thirteen cities from Baku to Bilbao in a month-long roadshow, culminating in a London finale at the famous Wembley Stadium. With a schedule that would leave even Mick Jagger breathless, the Euro 2020 tournament will be soccer as you've never seen it before. Every four years, Europe's finest football nations battle to be crowned kings of the continent. In six years' time, to celebrate the competition's 60th anniversary, matches will be played in 13 different countries from Ireland to Azerbaijan. Ordinarily, the tournament is hosted or co-hosted by one or two countries. This time the final and semifinals will be held in England, which hosted the tournament back in 1996. ""It will be a great honor to be part of what will surely be a superb celebration of 60 years of the UEFA European Championship,"" English Football Association chairman Greg Dyke said in a statement. ""Having seen the impact that a home Olympic Games had on young sportsmen and women in our country, I hope that UEFA Euro 2020 serves as a similar incentive for our most promising players to realize their full potential over the next six years."" The England team has some work to do if it is to live up to Dyke's lofty aims after its miserable group stage exit at this year's World Cup in Brazil. Turkey had at one stage been tipped as the sole host of the tournament, but it withdrew to focus on bidding for the 2020 Olympics -- which was subsequently awarded to Tokyo last year. Hosting the event across a number of countries -- which UEFA confirmed it would do in late 2012 -- lightens the financial burden of putting on a large-scale sporting event. However, concerns have been raised over the financial and logistical difficulties fans could encounter traveling across a continent to support their team. Euro 2020 host cities in full: .

"(CNN)More than 200 years after Samuel Adams and Paul Revere first buried it in Boston, it took an hour to remove all the objects crammed inside a tiny time capsule. Onlookers anxiously watched the unveiling Tuesday, worrying the items might not have weathered the years very well. ""Could we actually go through the whole box, or would things prove too fragile to take out?"" said Malcolm Rogers, director of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. ""It was like brain surgery, with history looking down on us."" Piece by piece, Pam Hatchfield, head of objects conservation for the museum, removed each item, whispering ""wow"" as she first caught a glimpse of some of them. Among the stash Hatchfield removed from the 1795 time capsule: Five folded newspapers, a Massachusetts commonwealth seal, a title page from Massachusetts colony records and at least 24 coins. And at the bottom, an inscribed rectangular silver plate, ""probably made by Paul Revere and engraved by him,"" Rogers said. ""That was the treasure at the end,"" he said. But getting to it was a painstaking process. It took seven hours to remove the time capsule from the Massachusetts State House in December, and more than four hours before Tuesday evening's ceremony for officials to loosen the screws that were holding it shut. Porcupine quill, dental tool used to remove contents . At the broadcast event, which took place at the museum in front of a painting of George Washington, Hatchfield used a porcupine quill and her grandfather's dental tool to help her safely remove the contents of the 10-pound box, which was uncovered during repairs for a water leak at the State House last month. The box-shaped capsule was placed in the State House cornerstone in 1795 by Revere, the metalsmith, engraver and Revolutionary War hero; Adams, the brewer and governor of Massachusetts; and William Scollay, a local developer, when construction began. Revere was responsible for overlaying the State House dome with copper. The time capsule measured 5.5 x 7.5 x 1.5 inches, officials said. It's not the first time the box has been uncovered. In 1855, during some other repairs, the time capsule was removed and its contents cleaned, only to be put back in the cornerstone for almost 160 years -- with a few objects added. The box's materials were noted in reports of the time. But this time, historians have had the opportunity to go through the contents with modern tools. After its removal December 11, the box was taken to the Museum of Fine Arts, X-rayed and given a thorough once-over. Having an idea about what might be inside was nothing compared to actually seeing it, Rogers told CNN. ""Though we knew a little bit about what was in the box, it was a moment of extraordinary excitement as this brass container just the size of a cigar box was slowly opened with surgical precision, and you suddenly found yourself in the presence of history,"" he said. Newspapers inside the box were in ""amazingly good condition,"" Hatchfield said. The large number of copper coins inside might have helped protect the artifacts, she said, since copper helps block the growth of fungus. The collection of coins recovered from the time capsule included half-cent, one-cent, half-dime, 10-cent and 25-cent coins. Another set of coins included a pine tree shilling from 1652 and a copper medal showing George Washington. Appraiser: Items worth hundreds of thousands of dollars . ""This is the most exciting project I've ever worked on,"" a beaming Hatchfield told the crowd after she finished pulling out all of the box's contents, describing how thrilling it was to be part of building a bridge between the past and the present. ""This is what we, as conservators, live for,"" she said, sharing a fist bump with Michael Comeau, executive director of the Massachusetts Archives and Commonwealth Museum. Going forward, conservators will work on preserving items removed from the time capsule. They might not unfold the newspapers, Hatchfield said, in order to protect them. If they were to go up for sale, the objects inside the box would fetch a pretty penny -- not because they're rare, but because of the history behind them, said Sebastian Clarke, an appraiser for the PBS program ""Antiques Roadshow."" ""The story's fantastic. George Washington was still the president of this country until 1797. ... The 17th century coin is maybe a 5 or 6,000-dollar coin, but with this story, the value increases tenfold,"" he said. Experts say they haven't been able to confirm whether Paul Revere made the silver plate, which commemorates the placement of the legislature's cornerstone by Adams and Revere on July 4, 1795. If Revere did make it, Clarke said, ""the value has to be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. It's magnificent."" But don't expect to see these objects showing up at any auction. After the conservation process is finished, they'll go on display at the museum. And eventually, the time capsule and its contents will be placed again in the cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House, said William F. Galvin, secretary of the commonwealth. One question still remains, Galvin said: Will officials add anything new to the time capsule before they put it back? ""The governor has wisely suggested that we might,"" he said, ""so we'll think about it."" CNN's Todd Leopold, Kevin Conlon, Anderson Cooper and Erin Burnett contributed to this report.","Appraiser: Items could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars .

According to new statistics released this week by air industry data cruncher Routehappy, flying without Wi-Fi access is becoming increasingly rare as more airlines connect their customers. This is good news for anyone who needs to Instagram their inflight meal or fabricate Twitter spats with imaginary passengers. Bad news for those who need to unjack themselves from the Matrix for long enough to watch a weepy movie and re-balance their blood-Smirnoff levels. According to Routehappy, there's now a 24% chance your international flight will have Wi-Fi access. On domestic U.S. flights the odds rise to 66% -- a figure nearly triple what it was 18 months ago. Connection quality and speed are also improving, it reports. ""Wi-Fi is one of the most sought-after new amenities fliers want to access on their flights, and there has been significant investment by airlines since our last report,"" says Routehappy CEO Robert Albert. ""Coverage is starting to be meaningful on flights worldwide, along with a wide variety of speeds, coverage availability and pricing models, including free of charge."" Internationally, Nordic airlines are leading the connectivity charge, with Icelandair and Norwegian both offering Wi-Fi on more than 80% of their flights. (The number of flights this represents isn't specified.) The next four -- Etihad Airways, Singapore Airlines, Lufthansa and Iberia -- currently only supply it to between 40-60% of flights. Aeroflot, Emirates and Japan Airlines are in the 20-30% range, while Qatar Airways, Thai Airways and Turkish Airlines score between 15 and 20%. For U.S. airlines, Delta leads the game, offering Wi-Fi across more than 3,500 of its daily flights.

"(CNN)In the final hours of a visit meant to demonstrate the deep societal ties between the United States and India, President Barack Obama briefly broke from his gushing praise for the new Prime Minister to make a soft but undisguised push toward gender equality and religious freedom. Speaking to an audience of students and activists in New Delhi, Obama declared the U.S. was India's best-suited partner as it makes rapid economic advances and appears poised to overtake China to become the world's most populous nation. But he didn't veil his take on recent attacks against women here, urging the country away from violence against women and religious minorities. Recent rapes in India have put harsh focus on India's gender politics. ""Every girl's life matters,"" Obama said in New Delhi. ""Every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons. And every woman should be able to go about her day—to walk the street, or ride the bus—and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves."" Sexual assaults became a high-profile problem in India after a young woman was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. The victim later died. Subsequent incidents of sexual violence — including at the hands of an Uber driver — placed global scrutiny on India's laws and culture. Obama traveled to India in the hopes of capitalizing on the deep personal warmth he's quickly developed with the new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose effervescent welcome for the American president was covered enthusiastically and exhaustively by Indian media. That's a distant cry from Modi's arrival in the United States in September, which was marred by awkward questions over his visa status. Modi, a member of the right wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, had previously been denied entry to the U.S. for an alleged role in a massacre of Muslims. Obama said on Tuesday it was the responsibility of every citizen to uphold the freedom of religious that's enshrined in India's constitution. ""Every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free from persecution and fear,"" Obama said. Obama's parting speech Tuesday was one of his few moments apart from Modi during his stay in India. The pair hugged upon Obama's arrival, sipped tea and meandered through a formal garden, and sat for hours behind rain-splattered bulletproof glass reviewing the annual Republic Day parade. White House officials say the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already-high expectations, and claim the relationship greased the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow U.S. firms to construct power plants in India. Both sides also moved toward more defense cooperation and trade pacts. But despite their talk of cooperation, obvious differences persist between the U.S. and India that could preclude cooperation on areas like combating climate change. During his remarks Tuesday, Obama said India must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change, even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive India to new economic heights. ""Here's the truth: even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if growing countries like India—with soaring energy needs—don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change,"" Obama said.","Obama: U.S. is India's best-suited partner in economic advances .

"CALISTOGA, California (CNN) -- Bill and Sharon Kastrinos practice the ultimate in minimalism. They've squeezed into a 154-square-foot home that looks more like a kid's playhouse than their previous 1,800-square-foot home. The Kastrinos moved into this tiny home from an 1,800-square-foot place. With the economy crashing, the Kastrinos traded in their spacious kitchen for one that stretches barely an arm's length. It hasn't been without its challenges, but Sharon Kastrinos says it's exhilarating to no longer feel compelled to keep up with the Joneses. ""There's a tremendous burden that's off your shoulders,"" she says. ""Small is OK, and it might even be better."" Her husband adds that most Americans ""want to be seen in their big house with a big car."" But not them, not anymore. ""I don't think bigger is better,"" he says. Bill Kastrinos had been in the construction business in Southern California. But when the real estate market went bust, it forced the couple to reconsider their lifestyle.  Watch what life is like in a home the size of a shed » . Now, they live in a place so small, he and his wife use a ladder to climb into their bed every night. The downstairs has a sitting area, tiny kitchen and bathroom in a space that's 98 square feet. The upstairs loft has a bed in 56 square feet of space. They keep extra clothes in their car. ""It's a very simple lifestyle,"" he says. ""The downside of it is it takes a readjustment. You can't have 100 pairs of shoes in the closet or 50 outfits."" The upside? The house cost them $15,000, and the utilities are a mere $15 a month. The couple now live on property owned by their daughter in California wine country, where the average home in 2007 cost $725,000. If they want to leave, the home has wheels and can be pulled behind their vehicle and plugged into any RV park in the nation. The family still has their 1,800-square-foot home, but they will probably sell it. The house is too expensive, they say, costing them about $1,500 a month in mortgage payments, plus another $160 in utilities. The change to their shed-like home has been so dramatic that Bill Kastrinos is now building the tiny homes to sell. He's sold 11 in six months, most of them in the range of $15,000 to $20,000. Clients range from people on welfare to retirees on fixed income, he says. Inquiries about the homes are on the rise, he adds. The Kastrinoses might be extreme in their shedding the traditional American dream, but others are trying it too. iReport: Do you live in a small space? Show us how you make it work . In nearby Sebastopol, California, Jay Shafer designs tiny homes and has even started a blog about living on less. His homes have a designer feel -- interior wood paneling, stainless steel kitchens, built-in bookcases -- packed into a space about the size of walk-in closets of upscale homes. His smallest home has 65 square feet; his biggest (a three-bedroom place) has 774 square feet. ""I look around and I do see a lot of people who seem they're slaves to their homes,"" he says. ""I didn't want to pay rent or a mortgage forever. So my plan was to escape the rat race."" Is he trying to make a political statement, or is his new way of life about being practical? ""It's both,"" he says, his head touching the vaulted ceiling from his bed. ""It's a very practical thing for me. If I didn't have a 100-square-foot house, I probably wouldn't be able to afford to live in this county. Aside from that, politically speaking, I like the idea of showing people how little a person could need."" By sizing down, he says he's living on a total of $15,000 a year. He doesn't have to worry about not making a mortgage payment and gets to work a job that he enjoys. ""Living in a small house has allowed me to do what I love doing, which is designing more small houses,"" he says. He, too, has purged junk and other items, donating most of it to the Salvation Army and to friends. ""It does feel good,"" he says. ""I don't miss the extra books, the extra clothes I never wore."" He's married, but there's not enough space for his spouse in his place. He's designing her a nearby place that's about triple the size of his: 280 square feet. He admits a tiny house isn't for everybody. But with the economy in a tailspin, he says, he doesn't worry one bit about it, thanks to his newfound lifestyle. It's peace of mind you can't put a price on. ""I don't think I have anything to worry about,"" he says. ""I've made more money, and I can save all of it and still go out to eat.""","Californians have begun building 100-square-foot homes for minimalists .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Chuck Hagel, a leading Republican voice on international affairs and an outspoken critic of the war in Iraq, won't endorse either major-party presidential candidate in 2008, a spokesman said Tuesday. Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska is leaving office after his current term. The announcement came just hours after a former GOP congressman suggested Hagel as a possible running mate for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, one of Hagel's Senate colleagues. ""Sen. Hagel has no intention of getting involved in any of the campaigns, and is not planning to endorse either candidate,"" Hagel spokesman Jordan Stark said. The two-term senator from Nebraska is leaving office after his current term and will be overseas on official business during this year's party conventions, Stark said. Hagel is a longtime friend of Sen. John McCain, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, and briefly mulled a 2008 presidential bid of his own. But he has butted heads with McCain and other leading Republicans over the war in Iraq and sharply criticized McCain's campaign in July for its attacks on Obama. Tuesday, after endorsing Obama, former Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, a Republican, said he hoped the Illinois senator would consider Hagel as his running mate or for ""a serious position in an Obama administration."" CNN's Alexander Mooney and Victoria Riess contributed to this report.","Statement comes after ex-congressman suggests Hagel as Obama running mate .

"(CNN)Halfway through a recent first date, my latest Tinder suitor — let's call him Heath — interrupted the conversation, apologizing. ""I should have told you this when you walked in,"" he said. My stomach tightened, anticipating what a man might preamble with those words. ""You look really nice tonight."" ""Oh, that's so nice of you to say,"" I said, smiling. ""Thank you."" ""I was really excited to go out with you,"" he continued. ""You seemed so interesting and smart. I feel like it's so rare for me to think a girl's smart."" I grabbed my drink and nodded stiffly, unsure what to say. ""I guess what I mean is, I just don't find that many girls as intelligent as you,"" he barreled ahead. ""It's really nice to talk to someone as ... well, someone as smart as me."" I shifted in my seat. Is it just me, or was that really sexist? Does he not realize that? What am I supposed to say? I thought to myself. I know I'm smart, so why does him saying that make me uncomfortable? How can I agree or even accept the compliment without insulting the rest of womankind? I didn't know what to say, so I said nothing, and ordered another drink. But Heath's comment got me thinking about what to do when a likely well-intentioned compliment falls flat, leaving me speechless, or maybe even a little insulted. If a compliment lands on me in a truly uncomfortable way, is that my problem or his? How am I supposed to deal with it? ""It doesn't matter whose problem it is, because it's a problem you're now both dealing with, and you have to decide how you're going to react,"" said Lizzie Post, author and etiquette expert for the Emily Post Institute. ""Sometimes it's as easy as letting the person know he's not having the right effect but you're willing to let them try again,"" Post said. ""It's OK to just call them out on it and give them the benefit of the doubt. You're letting them know that they can keep talking, and we'll try again."" What dating app is right for you? Great advice, but perhaps easier said than done, especially for an apologetic, good-natured Midwesterner like me. Besides, it's not that I don't like being complimented. I love compliments! Please compliment me, especially if you are trying to win me over. But, is it possible to avoid saying nice things in a smug, heroic tone that simultaneously insults other women? And, if I'm not asking too much, maybe give a compliment that doesn't belittle me? Granted, the line between a compliment and an insult is different for everyone. For me, I've got to draw it at accidental jabs at my appearance, and insults to other women. So how should confident women deal with backhanded comments and the men who lob them? Feeling defeated . The dilemma came up again a few days later, when Heath texted to ask if I'd like to go out again. Aside from his backhanded compliments, I liked him. I said yes, but it would have to wait. I'd come down with the flu. ""I'll make you feel better,"" he wrote. ""You looked fantastic last week."" Enough! I thought. You saying I'm pretty won't cure the flu! But I didn't say that to Heath. ""Thank you (smiley face),"" I wrote, feeling a little defeated. Dating in the digital age . You might be thinking I'm some demanding millennial with an exaggerated ego. Judging from conversations with friends, it seems that I am not the first woman to struggle with these social quandaries. And, thanks to the Internet and social media, I know we are not alone. Earlier this month, author Roxane Gay tweeted a series of observations from her own experience: . ""Man on the street just told me I have a pretty face and I shouldn't let anyone tell me I'm fat. Ummmm."" ""Thanks for that unsolicited feedback."" The Internet also reveals the potential pitfalls of expressing some of these things aloud. In a recent experiment, several women responded on Tinder and Tumblr to messages from men that ranged from generic to slimy. The women simply agreed with the compliments paid to them, leading to some hostile responses, which completely negated the nice things the men had just said. These, of course, are the extremes: the Internet trolls. But they show how these exchanges can start out benign and escalate into something closer to harassment, which is what most women fear. Call to mind last year's viral video showing street harassment in New York. It's not that all the men are saying inappropriate or offensive things. It's that they've inserted themselves into that woman's day without invitation. Hey baby! Women speak out against street harassment . It's important to note that the women above — who did not respond to CNN's requests for comment — conducted their experiment online. Could and should someone like me ever be emboldened to express these frustrations in a face-to-face interaction with a potential match? If I did, the potential real-life social risk is high. The Internet disinhibits people because the ""perception of anonymity is higher,"" said psychologist Patricia Wallace, author of ""The Psychology of the Internet."" It's easier to depart from social norms online with strangers ""because if they form a bad impression of me, who cares?"" Wallace said. ""You'll never see them again."" But, ""impression formation"" matters in real life, where you have a chance of meeting someone again, whether it's a co-worker or a suitor you don't care for, she said. The benefit of the doubt . Even when it comes to the canned opening lines pervasive in the online dating sphere, some experts advise that unless it's so crude as to offend your sensibilities, try to take it for what it is: a compliment. ""His aim is not to inform you, belittle you, or treat you like you're stupid,"" said Sharon Andrea, dating coach and founder of Modern Dating Mastery. ""He's not sharing news. On the simplest level, he's saying, 'I want to connect.' "" How should men approach women? Which brings me back to Heath. Our second date was unremarkable. He filled the time with nervous chatter, and I left relieved that I didn't have to field more bizarrely insulting praise. We didn't go out again. But Heath was not the first and he won't be the last to give me a compliment that went wayward, leaving me wondering how I could have handled other situations differently. To the man who told me he was relieved I wasn't ""a fatty,"" perhaps I'd say that while I appreciate that he finds me attractive, that's a nasty word I'd rather he didn't use to describe anyone. To the acquaintance who told me he'd ask me out if I just gained the oddly specific figure of ""12 pounds,"" I'd want to clarify: Was that supposed to make me feel good? Because it didn't make me feel good, and it might be better to avoid criticizing a woman's appearance, no matter where she stands on the spectrum. And to the next well-meaning Heath, I think I'd take Post's advice and say: That didn't land quite right with me, but I appreciate that you find me engaging. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt, and we can try that again.","Ann Colwell found an online date went south when her suitor lobbed a compliment that landed flat .

"New Delhi (CNN)Every year, India's Republic Day parade showcases the country's military might and the diversity of its states. This year it went a step further, turning into an occasion that emphasized the warmer relationship between the world's two biggest democracies, India and the United States. U.S. President Barack Obama became the first American chief guest at the parade. Not only did he have to endure two hours of a cold Delhi morning drizzle -- albeit in a glass box -- he also may have noticed how much of India's military hardware was of Russian -- and not American -- vintage. But most Indians will focus on the fact that Obama is the first sitting American president to visit India twice. They will remember the many images of Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi shaking hands and exchanging a warm embrace on the airport tarmac and at their first joint press conference in the world's glare. The Indian media has dubbed it a ""bromance,"" evidence of the chemistry that aides on both sides have been at pains to point out for months. It seems like an eternity since the former leader of the Indian state of Gujarat was persona non grata in the U.S. And so the biggest takeaway from Obama's three days in India was the symbolism of the leaders of the world's two biggest democracies cozying up. But others would have seen greater geopolitical implications. As Obama watched the Republic Day parade, Beijing welcomed Pakistan's army chief General Raheel Sharif for talks. Unlike Obama's previous India visit in 2010, Pakistan was not a focus -- at least in public statements. Instead, India seems to be positioning itself for a more global role, playing a part in issues that go beyond its borders. There were some other tangible takeaways from the summit too -- though the exact details were a little fuzzy. Modi announced progress had been made on negotiations over a civil nuclear deal -- a new 10-year defense cooperation agreement between the two countries was announced -- which may have far-reaching consequences for both sides on sharing intelligence and military education, and there was much talk about boosting bilateral trade from its current level of around $100 billion a year to $500 billion by 2025. As with most summits between world leaders, what goes on behind the scenes before and after is probably more important -- at least in terms of detail. But let's give symbolism its moment and its due. For millions of Indians who watched the events of the last three days -- and given the intense media coverage in India it would have been impossible to miss -- they will now slowly reassess their sense of India's place in the world. As Obama departs India, a push for reform . Maybe that will help broaden India's historically insular foreign policy thinking. Maybe it will make India a more prominent player in global issues, over time. And maybe, just maybe, India and the U.S. may move a little closer to forming the ""defining partnership"" that Obama first promised in 2010.","Obama's three-day trip showed warm relations between the U.S. and India .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sen. Ted Stevens declared his innocence Tuesday after his indictment on charges that he concealed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts and services from a company in his home state. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, says he is innocent of the charges a grand jury handed up on Tuesday. ""My public service began when I served in World War II. It saddens me to learn that these charges have been brought against me. ... I am innocent of these charges and intend to prove that,"" Stevens said in a statement released by his office. In the indictment, Stevens is charged with lying about receiving gifts worth more than $250,000 from Veco, an Alaska-based energy company on whose behalf he intervened in Washington. The indictment, returned Tuesday by a federal grand jury in Washington, says the veteran lawmaker ""schemed to conceal"" the fact that Veco paid for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of work on his home. The indictment follows a wide-ranging investigation into ties between the company and lawmakers in Alaska. The indictment does not accuse Stevens of accepting bribes, Matt Friedrich, the acting assistant attorney general, emphasized in a news conference announcing the charges. ""Bribery is not charged in this case,"" he said, adding that such a charge ""requires proof of a specific quid pro quo. This indictment does not allege that.""  Watch Friedrich announce and explain the indictment » . But it does accuse Stevens and his staff of receiving requests from Veco for help in Washington and acting on some of them. In the 28-page indictment, Stevens was charged with seven counts of making false statements on his Senate financial disclosure forms. Stevens denied those charges, saying in the statement ""I have never knowingly submitted a false disclosure form required by law as a U.S. senator."" Stevens was caught by surprise Tuesday by his indictment, Sen. Daniel Inouye told CNN. ""Apparently, the media knew about it before he did,"" Inouye said, adding he had just spoken to Stevens, a Republican from Alaska. Stevens was meeting with Republican colleagues when the indictment was returned, and he was pulled out of the meeting, his colleague said. ""As far as he's concerned, he's not guilty. And I believe him,"" said Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat who is one of Stevens' closest friends in the Senate. The indictment says the home improvements provided by Veco and its chief executive officer, Bill Allen, a ""personal friend of Stevens,"" included a new first floor, a new garage, a new first- and second-story wraparound deck, new plumbing and new wiring. Allen gave Stevens a new 1999 Land Rover worth $44,000 in exchange for $5,000 and Stevens' 1964 Ford Mustang, which was worth less than $20,000 at the time, the indictment charged. In exchange, Stevens ""could and did use his official position and his office on behalf of Veco,"" one of the state's largest employers, the indictment charges. Allen pleaded guilty in May 2007, paying out more than $400,000 ""in corrupt payments"" to Alaska officials, the Department of Justice said in announcing the Stevens indictment. Allen is cooperating with the Department of Justice as part of his plea agreement, Friedrich said. Veco was acquired by another company, CH2M Hill, in September 2007. The indictment does not restrict Stevens' ability to vote in the Senate, speak on the Senate floor or participate in committee work. Stevens, however, did say he would relinquish his co-chairmanships and ranking member positions, in accordance with Senate Republican rules. Reacting to the indictment, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said it was up to Senate Republicans to decide if any punishment was warranted. ""I, of course, have served with Sen. Stevens my entire congressional career,"" Reid said. ""It's a sad day for him, us. But I believe in the American system of justice that he is presumed innocent. ""As far as what's going to happen in the Republican caucus, that's up to them. ... How they handle Stevens is certainly up to them. It is not our responsibility. I'll cooperate in any way that I can."" Sen. John Warner, a Virginia Republican, recalled that he and Stevens were veterans of World War II and that ""he was a hero and a fighter, and he's been a fighter for this country since then -- a fighter for his state ever since and a strong leader in the Senate. ""So all I can say is I hope this can turn out fairly consistent with the law and good decision,"" Warner said. Another Republican, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, said, ""I have known Ted Stevens for 28 years, and I have always found him to be impeccably honest. Sen. Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat who chairs the Senate ethics subcommittee, said she would release a statement later Tuesday. FBI and Internal Revenue Service agents searched Stevens' Alaska home in July 2007 in connection with the investigation, which has snared two oil company executives and a state lobbyist, among others. At the time, he urged constituents ""not to form conclusions based upon incomplete and sometimes incorrect reports in the media."" The 84-year-old senator is a former chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and is renowned for his prowess in steering federal funds to his vast, sparsely populated state. Stevens is the oldest Republican senator and second in age only to Sen. Robert Byrd, the 90-year-old Democrat from West Virginia. He has represented Alaska in Washington since 1968 and is up for re-election in November. He is the longest-serving Republican senator in history.

"(CNN)When you think of the ""Fantastic Four,"" you likely don't think of grim, dark imagery. But if a trailer unleashed Tuesday is any indication, Marvel's first family of superheroes are being rebooted into exactly that. 20th Century Fox's new take on the foursome -- last seen in 2007's ""Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"" -- looks quite different from what we're used to. For starters, some of the lead cast members look to be younger than their predecessors, and Michael B. Jordan, an African American actor, is playing the Human Torch. And the trailer is decidedly darker than the two previous breezy, joke-filled movies -- and many of the Marvel Comics as well.

"Editor's note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents and producers share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events. Here, State Department producer Elise Labott offers insights into Condoleezza Rice's trip. Turkish protesters throw darts at an image of U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's visit to Turkey has a dual purpose: convince the Turkish leadership to hold off on a military intervention into northern Iraq and bolster Turkey's confidence in the United States. Both are a tall order. Warm feelings toward the United States on the streets of Turkey are in short supply, and the welcome mat is not out for Rice. This week, protesters in Ankara threw darts at a photograph of Rice and held signs that read, ""Terrorist Rice, take your bloody hands from Turkey"" and ""Go home Rice."" The slogans reflect a growing disgust in Turkey with the United States for what it sees as a lack of U.S. support concerning the Kurdistan Worker's Party, or PKK, separatist rebels in northern Iraq launching attacks across the border into Turkey. In the last month alone, 47 Turks have been killed, 35 of them soldiers. Many Turks we've talked to in Istanbul say they don't understand why the United States, which has aggressively fought the war against terror, has not been more helpful in dealing the PKK. The PKK, they say, is the Turkish version of al Qaeda. Turkey feels it has stood by the United States through thick and thin. In Afghanistan, Turkish troops are helping keep the peace. In eastern Turkey, Incirlik Air Base is used to send 70 percent of air cargo bound for the U.S. military, as well as about one-third of their fuel. Turkey is trying to help Israelis and Palestinians end the decades-long conflict and, throughout the Middle East, it has shared valuable intelligence with the United States. Turkey feels betrayed that Washington isn't standing by its close friend in its time of need. Officials tell us they have lost trust in the United States and lost confidence in the U.S.-Turkish alliance. The relationship between Turkey and the United States has been deteriorating since the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. The Iraq war was so unpopular in Turkey that parliament denied U.S. troops access to Iraq through Turkish soil. In fact, only 9 percent of Turks have a favorable opinion of the United States, according to a recent poll by the Pew Research Center. U.S. power of persuasion in Turkey sank even further last month when a House committee voted to recognize the deaths of close to 1 million Armenians by Ottoman Turks in 1915 as genocide. Even though the full House didn't vote on the resolution, the incident left a sour taste among Turks at a time the United States can least afford such tensions. The Turkish public is strongly urging the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan to send Turkish forces across the border into Iraq to get the PKK, even if it means further harming the relationship with Washington. The United States is caught in the middle between Turkey, an important NATO ally, . the Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and the Iraqi Kurds, which have provided relative stability in northern Iraq in an otherwise volatile country. Washington also wants to avoid Iran using the crisis to further leverage in the region. Iran's foreign minister made a surprise visit to Turkey this week, signaling that it wants to capitalize on the rift between the United States and Turkey. Washington has kept a close and skeptical eye on the growing ties between the two countries, especially a deal Turkey signed last month to buy natural gas from Iran. This weekend at a conference of Iraq's neighbors and other key Arab states, Rice will bring Turkish and Iraqi leaders together in an attempt to forge a plan for dealing with the PKK. The conference was originally planned to address issues about the future of Iraq and push Arab states to support the U.S. efforts there. Those issues will be overshadowed by the need avoid a new front in the Iraq war. E-mail to a friend .","Protesters to Rice: ""Go home""

"PHILADELPHIA, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama in a speech Tuesday addressed the controversy surrounding his former minister, using it as an opportunity to challenge Americans to take a closer look at race relations. Speaking at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center, the Democratic presidential candidate said he rejected racially charged comments made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, but he tried to explain the root of those remarks. Wright recently retired as pastor of Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, where the senator from Illinois worships. Some of Wright's old sermons came under fire after a news report last week turned some of his most controversial comments into a YouTube phenomenon. In one, the minister said America had brought the September 11 attacks upon itself. In another, he said Sen. Hillary Clinton had an advantage over Obama because she is white. Speaking before a relatively small, diverse crowd, Obama emphasized his upbringing as ""the son of a black man from Kenya and a white woman from Kansas.""  CNN's political team weighs in on Obama's speech » . Unlike many of Obama's campaign events -- where he generally appears onstage backed by an overflow crowd of supporters -- this time Obama took the stage alone, backed by a row of U.S. flags. ""I will never forget that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible,"" he said. ""It's a story that hasn't made me the most conventional candidate. But it is a story that has seared into my genetic makeup the idea that this nation is more than the sum of its parts -- that out of many, we are truly one.""  Watch Obama address the racial divide » . Obama's speech was greeted with a handful of responses. Some shouted, ""You're so right,"" and ""That's the truth."" But his relatively subdued demeanor seemed to be mostly reflected in the crowd as well, with most of the reaction limited to polite applause. The senator mostly has avoided focusing on race during his campaign. His speech comes after spending the weekend on the defensive over his former minister's statements. His biggest challenge Tuesday was similar to that faced by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney when he gave a speech during his GOP presidential run to reach voters unfamiliar with his Mormon faith: Obama was looking to explain his church and its worldview to voters aware only of Wright's headline-grabbing comments. Obama admitted he had sat in church and heard his former minister make controversial remarks. ""Did I strongly disagree with many of his political views? Absolutely -- just as I'm sure many of you have heard remarks from your pastors, priests or rabbis with which you strongly disagreed."" The remarks that caused the most recent firestorm ""were not only wrong but divisive, divisive at a time when we need unity,"" Obama said.  Watch African-Americans react to Obama speech » . Obama said that if he knew Wright only through clips played on television and YouTube, he also would see a reason to distance himself from the minister. ""But the truth is that isn't all that I know of the man,"" he said. ""As imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me,"" Obama said after describing his experience at Trinity United. Obama insisted he was not trying to justify Wright's comments, but drew a parallel between the minister's remarks and those made by Clinton supporters such as Geraldine Ferraro. ""The fact is that the comments that have been made and the issues that have surfaced over the last few weeks reflect the complexities of race in this country that we've never really worked through -- a part of our union that we have yet to perfect,"" he said, describing the resentment felt by many African-Americans of Wright's generation, who experienced segregation and systemic discrimination. ""That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems,"" he said. ""But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races."" Clinton and her campaign have publicly steered clear of any criticism of Obama over the issue, saying it's one for him to address. At an event at Philadelphia City Hall a short time after Obama's speech, the senator from New York said that she hadn't had a chance to see or read his remarks, but that she was ""glad that he gave it. It's an important topic."" ""Issues of race and gender have been complicated through our history and have been complicated in this campaign,"" she said, adding that there had been ""detours and pitfalls"" throughout the primary season. Obama wrote most of the speech himself, according to his campaign. Obama was not, as some reports placed him, in attendance the day Wright delivered the well-publicized comments, according to his campaign. But it has been difficult for the senator to distance himself completely from the retired minister of the church where he has worshipped for two decades. The title of Obama's 2006 book, ""The Audacity of Hope,"" came from a sermon delivered by Wright, who officiated the senator's wedding, baptized both of his children and was a spiritual adviser to his presidential campaign until Friday. Obama's recent move to distance himself from Wright has been lauded by some of his supporters -- and criticized by others, including black ministers who felt he had abandoned Wright. Tuesday's speech was a balancing act for the senator, who needed to take into consideration the views of these backers along with those of many white, working-class voters he has struggled to woo. The latter may be decisive in next month's Pennsylvania primary, and their support would be vital if Obama were to become the Democratic nominee. He made a direct appeal to that demographic Tuesday amid some polls that suggest the controversy may be hurting his effort in Pennsylvania. He told his audience that ""to wish away the resentments of white Americans, to label them as misguided or even racist, without recognizing they are grounded in legitimate concerns -- this too widens the racial divide and blocks the path to understanding.""

"(CNN) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama left a White House meeting, described as at times ""contentious,"" with no apparent financial bailout deal worked out. Obama, appearing on CNN's ""The Situation Room"" after the meeting, said there ""has to be a sense of urgency on the part of everybody. ... We've got to move rapidly."" Obama said that there will be a deal eventually but that there is still work to do, including reaching a consensus among Bush, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and House Republicans. McCain told ABC News on Thursday night that Republicans ""have legit concerns. Some of those have already been satisfied, such as accountability and oversight board and CEO executive pay. Members are aware of the crisis situation that we are in."" But, McCain said, ""They do have concerns, which I think when you're talking about 700 billion to a trillion dollars, that need to be addressed."" Obama, who will spend Thursday night in Washington, once again railed against infusing presidential politics into the negotiations over the $700 billion economic bailout. McCain's campaign said he will also stay in the Washington area for the night. ""One of the concerns I've had over the last several days is that when you start injecting presidential politics into delicate negotiations,"" Obama said, ""then you can actually create more problems rather than less."" Watch more of Obama's comments » . Democratic sources said that House Minority Leader John Boehner threw a wrench into the meeting when he brought up issues from conservative Republicans that negotiators thought had been settled. But a House leadership aide said that there had been no bipartisan negotiations with House Republicans. The aide said Rep. Spencer Bachus, who had been meeting with Sen. Chris Dodd and Rep. Barney Frank, heads of the Senate and House banking committees, had no authority to speak for them. In a statement before the meeting, Bachus said that he had made it clear in the meeting that ""I was not authorized by my colleagues to make any agreement on behalf of House Republicans."" Boehner said that he needed more time to get agreement from House Republicans, a senior administration official said. Obama asked whether the House Republicans' proposals fit in with the four principles that the leadership had agreed on, but Boehner couldn't answer that, a Democratic source said. Multiple sources said McCain didn't say much. Two Democratic leadership aides said he didn't speak until 43 minutes into the meeting. When asked whether Friday's debate will go on if McCain doesn't show up, Obama said: ""I hope he does."" McCain also told ABC News that he was ""very hopeful that we can [attend the debate.] I believe that it's very possible that we'll get an agreement so that I have time to fly to Mississippi."" CNN has learned that the University of Mississippi -- site of the first presidential debate -- has been told by the Presidential Debate Commission to continue preparing for the event. Both McCain and Obama advance teams were seen on stage going through sound and video checks from their candidates' respective podiums. In Washington, White House press secretary Dana Perino released a statement saying, ""The president appreciates the bipartisan members of the congressional leadership and the two presidential candidates coming to the White House today to discuss how to finalize the financial rescue package. There is a clear sense of urgency and agreement on the need to stabilize the financial markets, and prevent a massive financial crisis from affecting everybody in America."" The statement went on to say that the group will continue to work on a deal. But according to Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Alabama, who attended the meeting, ""we will not have a deal.""  Watch iReporters react to the bailout negotiations » . The meeting included many key players: Bush flanked at the table by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Obama and McCain on opposite ends of the table, Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also between the two presidential candidates and Vice President Dick Cheney across from Bush. According to several Republican aides, there is still major opposition to the ""agreement on fundamental principles."" The fact that House Republicans are still not coming on board poses a major obstacle for any kind of deal. Pelosi and other House Democratic leaders have repeatedly said that this is Bush's bill and that he and other GOP leaders need to get Republicans to support it. McCain, who announced Wednesday that he was suspending his presidential campaign until a bailout plan was worked out, met with some Republican House members to try to bring more of them on board to back the agreement, according to a source in the room and one who was briefed on the meeting. The gist of the meeting, according to sources, was that these members ""aren't there yet"" on the plan the Senate Banking Committee worked out and say there needs to be greater protection for taxpayers. One Republican aide said that ""not much has changed in the last 24 to 48 hours. I think it has to be pretty radically altered for House Republicans to support it."" This aide stressed, ""at the end of the day, these members represent the people who sent them here, and the people who sent them here are so overwhelmingly opposed to this."" This aide said the calls coming into GOP offices are 90 to 1 against the plan. Boehner, R-Ohio, has tapped a group of House Republicans to develop alternative ideas. Earlier, Boehner released a statement that said, ""I am encouraged by the bipartisan progress being made toward an economic package that protects the interests of families, seniors, small businesses, and all taxpayers."" It's unclear whether McCain agreed with this approach, but one aide said he put the principles ""in his satchel to take over to the White House."" Republicans recognize that there is pressure building to get something done before the end of the week. ""There sort of a tacit understanding among everyone that it has to happen before Monday,"" a third GOP aide said. Obama turned down McCain's suggestion that they both suspend their campaigns to focus on securing a deal on a bailout plan. He also passed on McCain's suggestion that they postpone Friday night's first presidential debate in Oxford, Mississippi. Democrats fear that McCain will take credit for bringing reluctant Republicans around to agreeing with a bailout plan in order to bolster his argument that he would be a better leader in crises than Obama. ""The Democrats, of course, are very afraid that McCain is going to swoop into these delicate negotiations on Capitol Hill at the last minute and when they reach an agreement, he's going to claim credit for having brought those negotiations to a successful conclusion,"" CNN senior political researcher Alan Silverleib said. A McCain source insists that the Arizona senator is aware of the politics involved and recognizes that Democrats -- and even some Republicans -- are wary of having it appear that McCain is brokering a deal.

"(CNN)Twice-convicted murderer Warren Lee Hill was executed Tuesday, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections. Despite pleas by human rights groups and legal representatives who have argued that Hill's intellectual disability should have made him ineligible for the death penalty, Hill died by injection at the prison in Jackson, Georgia. His time of death was 7:55 p.m. ET, said spokeswoman Gwendolyn Hogan. Hill declined to make a final statement, but requested a final prayer, Hogan said. Hill's attorney slammed the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to step in and grant a stay of execution. ""Today, the court has unconscionably allowed a grotesque miscarriage of justice to occur in Georgia,"" said Brian Kammer, Hill's lawyer. ""The intellectual disability community, which has strongly supported Mr. Hill's case for many years, joined his legal team in the belief that the Supreme Court would step in and prevent Georgia's flagrant disregard of the Constitution on behalf of the rights of people with disabilities,"" said Kammer. He described the execution as ""an abomination."" The Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles similarly voted to deny clemency. The board said in a release that its members ""thoroughly reviewed the parole case file on the inmate, which includes the circumstances of the death penalty case, the inmate's criminal history, and a comprehensive history of the inmate's life"" to reach their decision. In a joint statement released Tuesday, the NAACP, the Georgia Council on Developmental Disabilities, and Georgians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty called the board's decision to deny clemency, ""an embarrassment to our state."" They condemned the legal system for ""failing to protect those who are most vulnerable."" The groups invited ""those concerned about Georgia's criminal justice practices,"" to join them at vigils in several cities around the state before Hill's scheduled execution. Federal law -- stemming from a 2002 Virginia case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court -- says executing intellectually disabled individuals violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment. But the ruling also allows states to define intellectual disability. In Georgia, that means attorneys for death row inmates have to prove mental impairment ""beyond a reasonable doubt."" ""This is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation,"" Kammer said. Hill's execution comes two weeks after the state executed Andrew Brannan, a Vietnam War veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who killed Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller in 1998. Kammer also was Brannan's counsel. Kammer, who has represented Hill for 20 years, said in any other state, Hill would have served a life sentence. Hill was sentenced to death in 1990 for killing fellow prison inmate Joseph Handspike, beating him to death with a nail-studded board. At the time, Hill had been serving a life sentence for the 1985 shooting death of his girlfriend Myra Wright. ""We acknowledge that Mr. Hill should be held accountable for his actions and behavior,"" Torin Togut, president of the Arc of Georgia, said in a letter written on Hill's behalf. ""However, it is our contention that Mr. Hill, who has an intellectual disability, should not be subject to capital punishment."" The Arc is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Hill had the support of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, the Georgia NAACP, and former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter. The victim's family and former jurors had also expressed support for mercy in Hill's case, saying they weren't given the option of life without parole when sentencing him to death. Kammer had said seven doctors agreed that his client was intellectually disabled -- including three doctors for the state who initially evaluated Hill and said he didn't meet Georgia's standard. Kammer said those doctors have since signed an affidavit admitting they felt rushed during Hill's examination and now believe he does meet the standard for ""intellectually disabled."" In previous clemency hearings, attorneys for the state have argued that Hill served in the Navy, held a job and managed his money before killing his girlfriend -- signs that he didn't necessarily meet the legal standard to be considered intellectually disabled, even though he has a low IQ. But Kammer said examples of Hill achieving ""self-sufficiency"" don't make a strong case for his execution. Hill has an IQ of approximately 70, and ""the emotional and cognitive ability of a young boy,"" according to his attorney. Several of the letters supporting Hill's clemency cited last year's Supreme Court decision that struck down a Florida law that used ""unscientific standards for determining intellectual disability"" for death row inmates. Attorneys tried to use the Hall v. Florida decision as grounds to spare the life of Georgia inmate Robert Wayne Holsey, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a local sheriff's deputy. Holsey, who also had an IQ of 70, was executed in December. Hill declined to request a special last meal, the Department of Corrections said. He was offered the institutional meal tray, consisting of shepherd's pie, mashed potatoes, red beans, cabbage relish salad, cornbread, sugar cookies and fruit punch.

"Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and his wife were the second-biggest charitable donors in the United States last year, appearing behind only billionaire Warren Buffett on a list of the nation's most generous philanthropists. Zuckerberg, along with wife Priscilla Chan, gave roughly half a billion dollars ($498.8 million) to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy. The group released its annual Philanthropy 50 over the weekend. The Facebook founder and CEO was one of three tech-industry titans in the list's top five. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen was fourth, with $309 million in contributions, mostly to the Allen Institute for Brain Science. And Google co-founder Sergey Brin and wife Anne Wojcicki, co-founder of genetic-testing company 23andME, were fifth, putting $223 million into their Brin Wojcicki Foundation. Zuckerberg, whose net worth is probably somewhere around $12 billion despite a rocky start for Facebook's stock, made his first big splash in the philanthropy space in 2010, when he pledged $100 million to public schools in Newark, New Jersey. The Silicon Valley Community Foundation issues grants for a host of causes in the San Francisco area. In 2012, its charitable causes ranged from programs to teach immigrants English, to groups providing food and shelter to the needy, to funds for victims of the California wildfires. Zuckerberg donated 18 million Facebook shares to the foundation in December. ""Together, we will look for areas in education and health to focus on next. I'm hopeful we'll be able to have as positive an impact in our next set of projects,"" Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page at the time. Allen's institute is devoted to research on how the human brain works, particularly in regard to health and disease. It is a nonprofit medical research organization launched in 2003 and which Allen compares, in scope, to the Large Hadron Collider and the Human Genome Project. Brin and Wojcicki's foundation donates to a number of causes which, in 2012, included women's and environmental issues and a foundation devoted to curbing poverty. The couple also donated nearly $33 million last year to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research. Zuckerberg, 27, and Brin, 39, contributed to a trend noted by the chronicle -- and likely spurred by the emergence of the youth-oriented tech field. Three of the year's top five donors were under 40. The other, No. 3 on the list, was hedge-fund creator John Arnold, who is 38, and his wife, Laura.","Zuckerberg and wife, Priscilla Chan, gave about $500 million to a charitable foundation last year .

"(CNN)California has reported more measles cases. The number of cases has increased to 73, with 50 of those cases linked to an outbreak at Disneyland, the California Department of Public Health reported Monday. Last week, public health officials reported 59 cases since December; 42 with a Disney connection. In addition, 13 cases linked to the outbreak have been reported in six other U.S. states: five in Arizona, three in Utah, two in Washington, and one each in Nebraska, Oregon and Colorado. Also, one case linked to it has been reported in Mexico. The disease outbreak apparently surfaced when visitors reported coming down with measles after visiting the park from December 15 to December 20. At least five Disney employees have been diagnosed with measles, Disney said. Measles is a highly communicable respiratory disease caused by a virus and spread through the air, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Measles starts with a fever, runny nose, cough, red eyes and sore throat, the CDC said. Dr. Gil Chavez, deputy director of the state's Center for Infectious Diseases, recommended  that children under 12 months and people who've never had a measles vaccination stay away from the park while the disease event continues. He made the same recommendation for other places where large numbers of people congregate, such as airports and shopping malls. However, Chavez said Disneyland would be ""perfectly safe"" if you've been immunized. Opinion: Heed the lesson from Disneyland measles outbreak . When asked for a comment, Suzi Brown of Disney media relations said, ""We agree with Dr. Chavez's comments that it is safe to visit Disneyland if you have been vaccinated."" For the most part, measles spreads among those who have not been vaccinated against the virus. The California Department of Public Health said Orange County had the most measles cases, with 23, followed by San Diego County, with 13. 5 things to know about measles .","The number of measles cases in California has grown to 73, Health Department says .

"Paris (CNN)Five men were arrested in southern France Tuesday on suspicion of belonging to a jihadist cell which was recruiting young French people, authorities said. Speaking at a news conference in Paris, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said ""a new blow has been dealt to terrorism"" with the arrests in the Herault region. Police units carried out an early morning raid in in the small town of Lunel overseen by the anti-terror branch of the Paris prosecutor's office. Five men aged between 26 and 44 were arrested and remain in police custody.  Law enforcement agenst also conducted several searches. According to Cazeneuve, the five men ""are suspected of active participation in a jihadist thread whose members were recruited and indoctrinated, and then themselves recruited and indoctrinated several French young people from Lunel as well."" Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, a spokeswoman for the Paris prosecutor, told CNN that ""two men out of the five are suspected to have traveled to Syria, two others were allegedly planning on traveling there."" It's too early to give out any further information, she said. Cazeneuve emphasized the seriousness of the men's alleged jihadist ties. ""If the involvement of the suspects is confirmed by the courts, a seriously dangerous and organized cell will have been dismantled this morning,"" he said. ""Yet another one.""

Since then, authorities in France and elsewhere have cracked down on suspected radical Islamists with links to the Paris attackers or to terror networks overseas. Cazeneuve on Tuesday reiterated the ""full mobilization and determination"" of French authorities to fight against terrorism ""both inside and outside the country."" Over the past year, he said, more than 10 young men have left their hometown of Lunel for Syria, where they joined the ranks of ISIS. Several of them have died in fighting in Syria or Iraq.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN)The Indonesian military said Tuesday that it was stopping its efforts to recover the remains of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 almost a month after the commercial jet crashed into the sea. Indonesia's search and rescue agency, Basarnas, will continue its work to try to retrieve bodies from the wreckage site in the Java Sea, the head of the agency, Bambang Soelistyo, said Wednesday. The military provided the majority of personnel and hardware involved in the recovery operation, which was hindered by bad weather and technical problems. ""We are really disappointed,"" Imam Sampurno, whose four family members who were on the plane still haven't been found, said of the military's announcement. ""We really hope the evacuation process is still going."" Basarnas said it would have 60 divers, eight salvage experts, seven boats, two helicopters and a fixed-wing plane taking part in the continued search efforts, which will resume Saturday after the teams take a rest. Flight QZ8501 went down on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board. So far, searchers have managed to recover 70 bodies from the sea, leaving 92 still unaccounted for. Over the weekend, navy divers tried to lift part of the fuselage of the plane using wire ropes and giant balloons. But the attempts failed after lines attached to the wreckage broke. An effort to lift a smaller piece of wreckage was also unsuccessful, the military said. ""Our main priority is to find the bodies. We are not going to focus on lifting the fuselage,"" Soelistyo said Wednesday about the future search plans. The chief of the Indonesian armed forces, Gen. Moeldoko, on Tuesday ordered the military teams involved in the operation to pull out, said military spokesman Manahan Simorangkir. Officials said that 19 of the 81 navy divers working on the recovery efforts had fallen ill with decompression sickness and would be taken for treatment at a hospital in Jakarta, the capital. ""I told them safety first. But as we know, soldiers, they are always working hard to find the bodies,"" said Rear Adm. Widodo, commander of the Indonesian Navy's western fleet. ""They are not thinking about safety but about doing their duty."" The divers haven't been able to see any more bodies inside the wreckage of the fuselage, Widodo said. Officials had previously suggested that many of the missing human remains might be found inside the fuselage. But Widodo said some bodies could be trapped or hidden under wreckage on the seafloor. Searchers have recovered at least 14 bodies from the fuselage site, including some that floated free during attempts to lift the wreckage, according to officials. Indonesian aviation investigators are still trying to establish why Flight QZ8501 went down in an area of heavy thunderstorms last month while other planes nearby completed their journeys safely. Investigators are looking at whether the aircraft's flight augmentation computers (FACs) played a role in what went wrong, the news agency Reuters reported Tuesday, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. The FAC helps pilots with the stability and control of the aircraft, keeping it on course at the proper altitude and making sure adjustments to the rudder are smooth. It also warns pilots if they try to manually push the plane beyond its capabilities. Flight QZ8501, an Airbus A320-200, had two FACs, one serving as a backup. Indonesian officials have said the aircraft climbed rapidly before it fell into the water. The reason for the sharp ascent is unclear, but aviation analysts say the FAC could have recognized trouble and, at a critical moment, automatically shifted full control back to the pilots who may not have realized it amid the crisis. Investigators have submitted their preliminary report into the crash, officials said Tuesday. But authorities have said they don't plan to release it to the public. Indonesian Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan told CNN on Monday that the final report into the disaster should be published in less than a year. ""It won't be a year, that's my promise,"" he said. CNN's Pamela Boykoff reported from Jakarta, and Jethro Mullen wrote from Hong Kong.

"Washington (CNN)Just when you thought it was safe to go back on the Republican campaign trail, Sarah Palin and Donald Trump are back. All it took to set Twitter abuzz at the first big GOP campaign bash at the weekend was for The Donald and the 2008 vice presidential nominee to clear their throats and muse, yet again, about presidential campaigns. But the idea that they're both seriously searching their souls and considering a run for the White House doesn't pass the smell test. Trump and Palin are now more at the reality show end of the political spectrum than serious contenders -- but they sure know how to get a headline. They snatched more than their fair share of attention at Congressman Steve King's cattle call in Iowa on Saturday -- even as an impressive line-up of bona fide potential candidates tried to road test early 2016 messaging. There are serious candidates out there who are almost certainly running for president -- including Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee, all of whom were at the Iowa event. And there are those who just want some people to believe they might, just, might, run. Given all the available evidence, Palin and Trump belong in the latter category. Both are past masters at self publicity and appeared to view the massive media spotlight of the first big campaign event in Iowa as a great opportunity at the start of another campaign cycle. Palin launched a bizarre, stream of consciousness rant against Hollywood the left, President Barack Obama and the strange social media palaver whipped up by pictures of her son Trig standing on his labrador. Her performance was all the more odd since she had deliberately raised expectations that she might be mulling a return to top-level politics ahead of the speech. She told ABC News that anyone like her with a ""servant's heart"" had no choice but to think about it. Then, after bumping into reporters at a Des Moines hotel, Palin said ""who wouldn't be interested?"", according to The Washington Post. So is Palin really considering a run for president? SEE ALSO: Jeb's invisible man strategy . Her largely inconsequential speech offered easy ammunition for her political enemies, making for an ineffective start. And there's no evidence that Palin is taking the serious moves needed of a candidate in an age when the price of entry for the presidential sweep stakes is millions of dollars. There's also no buzz that Palin has sounded out top party donors or wants to snap up big name consultants. Though some of her attack lines hit their mark with the audience of conservative activists, Palin was a pale imitation of the rock star who burst onto the scene in 2008 showing raw and rare political talent. And the notion of a Palin presidential campaign seems a lot more remote than when she teased a run, but ultimately decided against it, in the last presidential cycle. Her performance on Saturday dismayed key figures in conservative media, including some who thought she was unfairly put to the sword by the press in 2008. Conservative columnist Byron York wrote in his Washington Examiner column that the Republican Party has a Palin problem. ""If there is indeed nothing behind her 'seriously interested' talk — and it appears there is not — should she be included in events leading up to the 2016 caucuses?"" York wrote. Conservative blogger Erick Erickson meanwhile said Palin's speech was best ""left uncommented on."" Democrats are jubilant. Democratic National Committee communications director Mo Elleithee put out a simple statement reading ""Thank you."" The pro-Clinton super PAC Ready for Hillary fired out a fundraising email on the back of Palin's comments. SEE ALSO: Pro-Clinton group raises money off Palin speech . Trump meanwhile used the Freedom Summit to relaunch his own political sideshow, in mothballs since his 2012 presidential musings and his campaign to get Obama to publish his birth certificate. But he touched raw nerves in the GOP, launching a fierce attack on potential establishment frontrunners Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney who skipped the event. His broadsides seemed to fly in the face of efforts by party bosses to remove the circus atmosphere which marred the 2012 GOP presidential debates. 'Mitt had his chance,"" he said. ""He should have won and he choked. You don't want to give a choker a second chance."" ""We've had enough of the Bushes,"" Trump blasted. There is a long tradition of long-shot candidates launching presidential runs without any expectation of victory. While many hope lightning will strike -- comparative unknowns like Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama built campaigns in Iowa that ended at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue -- most know it won't. But running for president in Iowa, even if you don't make it to the caucuses themselves can be a good career move. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack for instance parlayed a campaign that never got off the ground into a job as secretary of the Agriculture Department. Other candidates -- like Democratic gadfly Dennis Kucinich and libertarian Ron Paul -- have used presidential campaigns to build personal political brands. Joe Biden got less than 1% of the votes in the Iowa caucuses in 2008 -- but ended up as a two-term vice president. In each of those cases, the candidates offered more steak than sizzle; more policy than pizzazz. And then there are those like Trump, who thrives on attention, and Palin, who needs to maintain a brand on the fringes of conservative media, for whom the oxygen of publicity as a new campaign grinds into gear seems too enticing to ignore.","Sarah Palin and Donald Trump flirt with media with 2016 talk .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN)A message reported to be from retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro late Monday endorsed the fledgling talks to restore diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States, but added Castro still ""didn't trust"" U.S. officials. In a letter, published on the website of the communist party newspaper Granma, Castro said that although he didn't ""trust U.S. policies and have not exchanged a word with them, this does not mean however that I would oppose a peaceful solution to conflicts or threats of war."" Last month Cuba and the United States exchanged prisoners and agreed to discuss normalizing relations that had been trapped in over five decades of Cold War animosity. While the U.S. economic trade embargo remains in place, President Barack Obama announced he would lift some sanctions and ease travel restrictions for U.S. citizens wishing to visit the island. Despite the major shift in policy, for over a month Castro made no public comment on the deal, reigniting rumors that the 88-year-old former Cuban leader was in failing health. Last week, Cuban and U.S. diplomats met to discuss re-establishing embassies in Washington and Havana. While both sides hailed the first round of talks in Havana as productive, the negotiators sparred over issues like human rights and the discussions ended without signs of any breakthrough. Talks are expected to resume in Washington, although no date has been set for the second round of discussions. The U.S. broke relations with Cuba in 1961, amid fears that Castro and his bearded revolutionaries harbored communist sympathies. Despite scores of CIA assassination attempts against him and a failed U.S.-backed invasion of Cuba, Castro stayed in power until 2006, when a still-undisclosed intestinal ailment forced him to step down. Since then Castro rarely appears in public, instead opining on current events in occasional newspaper columns. Raul Castro replaced him as president and demonstrated a less confrontational style of leadership than his older brother, who often led massive protests against U.S. policies. The younger Castro has allowed more economic reforms to take place but resisted any challenges to the country's single-party communist style of government. During the talks, Cuban officials said they hoped the United States and Cuba could learn to coexist despite the deep differences in the two countries political systems. ""We shall always defend the cooperation and friendship between all people, among them our political adversaries,"" Fidel Castro wrote in the message published Monday. ""With this spirit, I have fought,"" Castro concluded his letter, ""and will continue fighting until my last breath.""","In communist newspaper, Fidel Castro endorses diplomatic talks, but he also expresses misgiving about U.S.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Waves of severe thunderstorms streaked through downtown Atlanta on Saturday, hours after a tornado left a trail of destruction through the heart of the city. An Atlanta sidewalk is heaved up by an oak tree toppled in Friday night's storm. A swath of uprooted and broken trees, downed utility lines, peeled-off roofs and collapsed brick walls marked the path of the tornado that struck around 9:40 p.m. Friday. ""This was clearly a tornado,"" Lans Rothfusz of the National Weather Service's Peachtree City, Georgia, office said. He rated the storm an EF-2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, meaning it packed top winds of 130 miles per hour. Utility and cleanup crews worked Saturday to restore traffic lights, clear streets and remove tons of debris in the city's business district after Friday night's unusual urban storm. Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin and Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue declared states of emergency. Police in Atlanta were urging people to stay away from downtown, fearing shattered glass and hanging metal would continue to fall from buildings as new storms rolled through.  See a map of the downtown damage » . A heavy thunderstorm prompted another tornado warning as it plowed across Atlanta just south of downtown Saturday afternoon. More storms were seen forming in Alabama and heading toward Atlanta. At least two people were killed Saturday afternoon as the same line of storms destroyed structures elsewhere in northern Georgia. Trees blown down in Friday night's storm crushed a row of houses in the city's historic Cabbagetown district just east of downtown. Initial estimates from the mayor's office said at least 20 of the historic homes were damaged or destroyed by the tornado. Atlanta police Maj. Renee Propes urged people to stay away from Cabbagetown.  See photos of the destruction » . ""We appreciate the fact that people may want to help,"" Propes said. ""But, in most instances, they are hindering our efforts and possibly putting people and property at risk."" The top floor collapsed at one building in the Fulton Cotton Mill Lofts, a 104-year-old industrial complex redeveloped into residences. Police officials said everyone was out of the structure and surrounding buildings and all residents in the lofts had been accounted for.  Watch firefighters search building » . Across the street, headstones were toppled in the historic Oakland Cemetery. About 10,000 customers were without power Saturday morning, according to Georgia Power, but by about 5:35 p.m. Saturday that number had mushroomed to 41,000 customers statewide. Crews were working to restore power but were pulled back when waves of bad weather threatened. Earlier, Georgia Power spokesman John Sell said more than 40 power poles were broken by Friday night's tornado. Some customers will not have power restored until Sunday, Sell said -- and it could be even longer if weather hinders crews' efforts.  Watch a report on problems amid the cleanup » . Part of Atlanta's MARTA mass-transit rail system was shut down because of damage east of downtown. The twister is the first to strike downtown Atlanta since record-keeping began in the late 1800s, said Laura Griffith, a National Weather Service forecaster. On March 24, 1975, a tornado hit the city's Buckhead area, including the governor's mansion, she said. Three people died and more than 150 were injured. The weather service said Friday's tornado plowed a path about 6 miles long and 200 yards wide. The twister appears to have first struck several houses and churches in the Vine City neighborhood west of the business district, then moved on to the Georgia Dome, CNN Center, Centennial Olympic Park and Cabbagetown. A brick apartment building in Vine City was roofless Saturday morning. Curtains waved through broken windows high up the cylindrical 73-story Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel downtown. Gaping holes were torn in the roof of the Georgia World Congress Center, and an auto parts warehouse just east of downtown partially collapsed.  Watch a stairway become a waterfall » . Although tens of thousands of people were in the path of the storm -- many in town for a major college basketball tournament -- there were no known deaths and just one life-threatening injury, police said. About 30 people -- one of them a firefighter -- were treated at hospitals, mostly for minor cuts, scrapes and bruises, police said. The American Red Cross reported about 70 people were using one shelter it established, and a second was added later in the morning. The storm struck the 71,000-seat Georgia Dome at 9:45 p.m. during a Southeastern Conference tournament basketball game. It shattered windows and tore roofs from buildings -- including CNN Center -- before continuing into several residential neighborhoods. Mahsud Olufani, an Atlanta painter and sculptor with a studio in Cabbagetown, said, ""It looks like a bomb went off, it looks like World War III."" A large hole could be seen in the 14th floor of a high-rise dorm at Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta. Students were evacuated from the area on buses. The storm interrupted a Southeastern Conference game between Alabama and Mississippi State. ""It was actually in overtime, and the game was getting exciting, and I thought people from the Alabama side were hitting the bleachers trying to get some noise going,"" said basketball fan Lucas Shields. ""All of a sudden the TV went out, the overhead clock stopped working, and you hear that distinctive noise of a train."" Amanda Reimann, an iReporter and University of Georgia cheerleader, said she and her teammates heard a loud noise. ""It sounded like the fans were banging on the seats or stomping their feet, but it kept up and got a lot louder,"" she said. ""Then the ceiling of the Dome started waving, the giant TV screens were waving, and light fixures and dust started falling. ""My teammates and I thought it was a bomb but our coach came running for us and a security guy and said it was a tornado. We all ran for the locker room.""  Watch what happened inside the dome » . The game resumed about an hour later, but a later game between Kentucky and Georgia was postponed. A professional basketball game at Philips Arena next door was not disrupted, but the thousands attending that game also had to make their way home through the storm debris. Police closed several streets in the vicinity of CNN Center because of glass and other debris. Two of Centennial Olympic Park's towering Olympic torches were toppled and a performance pavilion was destroyed.  Watch a man pick through the debris » . Inside CNN Center, water poured through the damaged roof into the building's atrium. Glass shattered, and parts of the building filled with dust. Virtually all of the windows facing Centennial Olympic Park on the Omni Hotel, which is adjacent to CNN Center, were shattered. Visitors to the hotel were moved to the facility's exhibition hall at street level.  Watch scenes of the destruction » . CNN moved its national desk operation to another location Saturday after parts of the ceiling fell in, and CNN International aired domestic programming. Windows also shattered in the CNN.com newsroom, and CNN's library was damaged. Slabs of metal and insulation material were strewn on the streets outside. Heaps of bricks and drywall were pushed up against cars. Street signs were bent in half. The city's St. Patrick's Day celebration and the SEC parade set for Saturday morning were canceled.

"(CNN)Forget the bread and milk. Some snowbound New Yorkers are seeking a more, er, intimate kind of nourishment. With a massive storm expected to drop up to 3 feet of snow on the Northeast U.S. before it ends Tuesday, a flurry of New Yorkers are placing online ads seeking ""blizzard buddies"" for companionship, snuggling and, in so many words, sex. A search of Craiglist's recent personal ads for ""snow"" or ""blizzard"" turns up scores of New York-area listings -- many not safe for work -- from city dwellers looking for someone to hook up with while the storm rages outside. ""Seeking snuggle buddy for upcoming blizzard. Will make u pancakes and coffee and hot chocolate all day. You'll also get my Netflix password. I have lots of thick blankets and interesting books to read if we get snowed in,"" read one of the tamer listings, from a 26-year-old man in Ridgewood, New Jersey. ""As we all know Snow Sandy is coming our way, and there is nothing worse than being trapped along in your apartment with nothing to do. As such why not ride out the blizzard with me?"" asked a New York man who gave his name as Alex. ""I'm tall and athletic 6' 2"" 185, and generally considered to be good looking, smart, and funny. I'm a great snuggler, and excellent cook, and should it get that far ..."" added the would-be Lothario, who then went on to describe his other, um, physical attributes. A 26-year-old resident of New York's West Village tried to entice women with an offer of ""endless movies, cookies, whiskey and red wine, occasional work on a strictly as-needed basis, potential igloo-making in a private garden and making out."" Then there was the guy in New York's Chelsea neighborhood who posted a shirtless photo of himself, flexing his biceps, along with this greeting: ""What's up ladies, Snowing outside. I can make it snow inside too."" We're not even sure what that means. Many of the ads contained euphemistic references to ""cuddling"" or ""snuggling,"" although some blizzard booty calls were much more explicit. A few included photos of ... body parts. Most of the listings were from men seeking women or other men, but some women placed snow-buddy ads as well. ""Looking for someone interesting to platonically chat with during the snow and see where it goes,"" posted a 47-year-old woman seeking a ""snow friend."" Of course, the ""casual encounters"" section of Craigslist has long been a hotbed of sexual solicitations and even alleged prostitution, but the ""blizzard buddy"" wrinkle appears to be new.

"GARDINER, Montana (CNN)  -- More than half of Yellowstone National Park's bison herd has died since last fall, forcing the government to suspend its annual slaughter program. Between harsh weather, hunting and an annual cull, fully half of Yellowstone National Park's bison have died. More than 700 of the iconic animals starved or otherwise died on the mountainsides during an unusually harsh winter, and more than 1,600 were shot by hunters or sent to slaughterhouses in a disease-control effort, according to National Park Service figures. As a result, the park estimates its bison herd has dropped from 4,700 in November to about 2,300 today, prompting the government to halt the culling program early. ""There has never been a slaughter like this of the bison since the 1800s in this country, and it's disgusting,"" said Mike Mease of the Buffalo Field Campaign, a group seeking to stop the slaughter program for good. Government officials say the slaughter prevents the spread of the disease brucellosis from the Yellowstone bison to cattle on land near the park. Brucellosis can cause miscarriages, infertility and reduced milk production in domestic cattle.  Watch Yellowstone bison search for pasture » . The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that half of Yellowstone's bison herd is infected with the bacterium. Previously, under the Interagency Bison Management Plan, wandering bison were sent to slaughter without being tested for brucellosis. (The meat -- which experts say is safe to eat if cooked -- and hides were distributed to Native American groups.) Late this winter the slaughter was limited to animals that tested positive for the disease. Now the program has been further curtailed; no bison have been killed in the past week. ""The plan requires all of us to do two things: protect a viable wild bison population and reduce the risk of transmission of brucellosis from bison to cattle. We're required to keep bison and cattle separate,"" National Park Service spokesman Al Nash said. The USDA acknowledges that bison-to-cattle transmission is difficult to document, but it says investigations indicate that bison were the likely source of infections in cattle herds in Wyoming and North Dakota. But critics call the culling an overreaction. There is no documented case of the disease passing from bison to cattle, they said. ""I mean, it's hype, it's a hysteria,"" Mease said. ""And it's not a fatal disease."" Last month, two women chained themselves to a railing inside the park's visitor center to protest the policy. ""The Park Service is meant to protect and preserve wildlife in national parks, not indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of [bison],"" one of the protesters, 20-year-old Miriam Wasser, wrote in a leaflet she distributed. Yellowstone is the only place in the lower 48 states where a bison population has persisted since prehistoric times, according to the Park Service. Herds once numbered in the tens of millions across the continent but were hunted nearly to extinction by the late 1800s. Protected since the early 20th century, the species has recovered. Bison graze high on Yellowstone's grassy plateaus during the summer. When the weather becomes too harsh and food becomes scarce, they often roam outside the park. That's the problem. Nash explained the situation in its simplest terms: . ""Bison are bison. Bison are nomadic animals. Bison are looking for food. Food is difficult and scarce to come by at the end of the winter. They're leaving the interior of the park [and going] to lower places, in part, to look for food. There's limited tolerance for bison outside the boundaries of Yellowstone National Park."" That's because just two cases of brucellosis would trigger stringent limits on export of cattle from Montana. ""Montana has spent millions of dollars over the years to get brucellosis eradicated from our livestock,"" said Martin Davis, who has a cattle ranch within roaming distance north of the park. ""And to put that in jeopardy -- no one wants that to happen."" Control of the bison population is essential, Davis said. ""Bottom line is, there's too many of them. They've got to be managed. They ran out of pasture. ... They're eating themselves out of house and home."" Under the management plan, rangers and cowboys hired by various government agencies try to harass stray animals back onto park property. Officials shoot animals that can't be persuaded. (Ranchers are not permitted to kill wild bison). Meanwhile, hundreds of bison are rounded up inside the park every winter and slaughtered to reduce competition for food and therefore the need for animals to wander onto private land. ""It becomes a private property issue,"" said Davis, who has never had a bison encroach on his ranch. ""They walked down onto private property. And if you don't want a buffalo on your private property, you shouldn't have to have them there."" Mease, the activist, portrays the conflict as a simple turf war. ""The Montana cattle ranchers don't want the competition for grass,"" he said. ""They want the national forests and public lands to be all their public-lands grazing allotments, and in that process, they don't want bison."" Federal and state officials said last week they will lease private land bordering the park where up to 100 bison eventually will be allowed to graze during the winter. But the problem is not likely to go away. ""The reality of the situation is that whether you have 4,000 bison or whether you have 200 bison, bison are a nomadic species and they will always be looking out to the horizon and expanding their boundaries,"" said Tim Reid, chief deputy ranger at Yellowstone. So the culling program is expected to return next winter. ""It is our job to protect the viability of this population,"" the Park Service's Nash said. ""We take that seriously. We are not taking any actions that will have a serious ongoing negative impact on this population. ""The Yellowstone bison population is healthy, it's strong, it's vibrant. We continue to take actions to protect that herd."" But to activists like Mease, it's just not right to kill healthy bison. ""There's less than 5,000 wild, genetically pure buffalo left in America,"" he said, ""and this is how we treat them?"" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Dan Simon, Chuck Afflerbach and Saeed Ahmed contributed to this report.","Harsh winter, hunting, annual cull cut Yellowstone bison population in half .

"GULFPORT, Illinois (CNN) -- All roads in the town of Gulfport, Illinois, lead to nowhere. They all hit a dead end into Mississippi River floodwaters. Most businesses and homes in Gulfport, Illinois, are underwater. Only 28 residents had flood insurance. The small town in western Illinois was devastated Wednesday when two levees failed about 45 miles south. Tuesday, all that was visible were a few signs and rooftops. ""It almost looked like a tidal wave coming across the land,"" recalls Rick Gerstel, a resident of Gulfport. ""Almost like the end of the world is what it looks like."" The water barreled through with such force, it knocked Gulfport's town hall off of its foundation, and the walls of some brick and mortar buildings collapsed. Most businesses and homes are underwater. But none of this was supposed to happen -- at least that is what residents believed. Gulfport was protected by a levee rated to withstand a 100-year flood. Although it wasn't designed to protect the town from a flood on the scale of last week's, it was enough protection that the Federal Emergency Management Agency did not require business or homeowners to purchase flood insurance. Only 28 of the town's 200 residents had federal flood insurance. The rest trusted that the levees would hold. Residents Rick and Gina Gerstel, who lost everything, say no one from their bank to the municipal or federal governments ever told them they were at risk and ought to buy flood insurance. Some residents said they felt misled about the risks of not having flood insurance. They said they thought the chances of a catastrophic flood were miscalculated.  Watch: Flooded residents gambled and lost » . Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Connecticut, agrees. He supports legislation that would require anyone living in an area protected by a levee to have flood insurance. ""I don't know how you define 'protected' or call that protected when you're telling people 'you don't have to have this; you don't need it' ... and you're watching families being devastated,"" Dodd said. ""But the opportunity to get on their feet again is going to be very difficult for many families. And that's one of the major shortcomings in the flood insurance program."" FEMA says its risk assessment of Gulfport was accurate, and the agency is spending $1 billion to upgrade outdated maps and re-evaluate flood dangers. ""We do our best to advertise the availability of flood insurance and encourage people to purchase it,"" said Terry Reuss Fell, regional chief of FEMA's floodplain management. ""We implement the laws that are given to us and the laws right now deal with the floodplains management within that 100-year floodplain and the insurance purchase requirements in that area also."" The flooding could have been worse, according to officials, if the federal government had not purchased low-lying land after the historic floods in 1993, which caused $12 billion in damage. Since then, the government bought out more than 9,000 homeowners, turning much of the land into parks and undeveloped areas that can be allowed to flood with less risk. FEMA has moved or flood-proofed about 30,000 properties. But those changes are little consolation for the Gerstels and other uninsured residents who have lost everything and can't afford to rebuild. ""Will you ever go back to that house?"" CNN asked the Gerstels. ""No, sir. I would not go back to the town,"" Rick Gerstel said. ""I would never live there again.""","Nearly all homes, businesses in Gulfport, Illinois, were destroyed by floodwaters .

"BALAD, Iraq (CNN) -- Mullah Nadhim preached open war on U.S. troops for years. In Iraq, voters' fingers are dipped in ink so they can't vote multiple times. He and many other Sunni Muslims in Iraq shunned elections and fought instead with roadside bombs and rocket-propelled grenades. With provincial elections scheduled for autumn, however, Nadhim and other Sunnis say, they made a mistake by sitting out the elections in January 2005. Their absence at the polls, they say, resulted in less political power for Sunnis and more for Shiite Muslims and Kurds. Some Sunnis say they plan to put down their weapons and instead join ""the battle of the fingers,"" a phrase for elections that draws its name from the practice of dipping voters' fingers in ink so they can't vote a second time. ""At least 80 percent of the Sunnis believe that the battle of the finger is more important, more powerful than the battle of weapons and RPGs,"" Nadhim said. More than 370 former Sunni insurgents near Balad, 42 miles (68 kilometers) north of Baghdad, recently signed a pledge to stop attacking U.S. and Iraqi security forces. ""You don't shoot us anymore,"" one U.S. soldier said. ""OK?"" American soldiers fingerprinted them and took retinal scans, saying they would detain ""most-wanted"" militants but releasing most others. Men who are facing charges in the Iraqi legal system were given dates to appear in court. No one suggests that the elections will end violence in Balad, but it's a step in the right direction in the eyes of the U.S. military and Iraqi government. Provincial elections are seen as key in empowering Iraqis at the grass-roots level and creating a political system that includes those who have been alienated from power. The Bush administration has set provincial elections as one of its benchmarks to foster political reconciliation in Iraq. ""On the political front, Iraq has seen bottom-up progress as tribes and other groups in the provinces who fought terror are now turning to rebuilding local political structures and taking charge of their own affairs,"" President Bush said recently. Iraqi authorities originally hoped to hold the elections by October 1. Yet details of the vote, including when it is to be held, are still being debated between Iraq's main political blocs. Gen. David Petraeus, the outgoing top U.S. military commander in Iraq, told Congress two weeks ago that provincial elections probably will happen in November. Whatever the date, one former member of the Ansar al Sunna militant group probably will be among those casting ballots. He said that spurning the last elections in favor of violence left Sunnis in Balad largely powerless. ""Right now, everything is being run by the Shiites,"" he said. ""God willing, this time it will be better than before.""","Sunnis say they made mistake by sitting out 2005 election .
They look forward to ""the battle of the fingers"" at this year's elections .

"Vermont's governor on Thursday signed a bill into law that will require the labeling of genetically modified foods -- hailing it as the first such law in the nation. Under the new law, food offered for retail sale that is entirely or partially produced with genetic engineering must be labeled as such by July 2016. ""Vermonters take our food and how it is produced seriously, and we believe we have a right to know what's in the food we buy,"" said Gov. Peter Shumlin. ""More than 60 countries have already restricted or labeled these foods, and now one state -- Vermont -- will also ensure that we know what's in the food we buy and serve our families."" In the absence of federal action, other states have introduced similar legislation or ballot initiatives, according to the non-profit Center for Food Safety. Maine and Connecticut passed laws requiring labeling, but they won't go into effect until other states pass GMO-labeling laws. Vermont is the first to pass a ""no strings attached"" bill, the watchdog group said. Supporters of the law expect it will be challenged in court. ""I can make no predictions or promises about how the courts will ultimately rule but I can promise that my office will mount a vigorous and zealous defense of the law that has so much support from Vermont consumers,"" said Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell. The governor tweeted: ""Those opposed will put up a fight. Help us fight back."" Cathleen Enright, executive vice president for food and agriculture for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, warned that mandated labeling could make food costs for the average household could go up as much as $400 a year. She stressed foods made from genetically modified crops are as safe as any other. ""And these same GM crops have enabled farmers to produce more on less land with fewer pesticide applications, less water and reduced on-farm fuel use,"" Enright said in a statement. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service approved a non-GMO label for meat and liquid egg products in June, the first time the department has approved such a label from a third party. GMO foods were approved for human consumption in 1995, but the Food and Drug Administration never required any labels pointing them out as such.","Food entirely or partially produced with genetic engineering must be labeled .

"Every day in his cell in one of the most notorious prisons in Latin America, an American father wrote a letter to his little boy. Jason Puracal would tuck the papers away, trying to fight the fear that his son might grow up never knowing his dad. ""Jabu was my sunshine. My ray of hope. When I was in there -- it was dark ... it was so ... hard ... I just imagined I could see him,"" Puracal told CNN on Monday night via phone from New York. Puracal seemed to choke up a little. After all, he was speaking less than two days after gaining the freedom he thought he'd never have again -- the result of a Nicaraguan court system ruling last week that his conviction could not stand. Puracal took a breath and laughed. He lovingly shushed the loud giggles of his 5-year-old. ""Come on, play!"" the boy said as he tugged at his father. Puracal, from Washington state, had been behind bars since November 2010, when Nicaraguan authorities raided his real estate office in the coastal tourist city of San Juan del Sur and accused him of money laundering, drug trafficking and involvement in organized crime. He was sentenced to 22 years in August 2011. Puracal survived ""day by day, minute by minute,"" he told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview Monday night. ""It's a fight for your life every second of the day,"" he said. For nearly two years, a chorus of supporters -- including a former FBI agent, a U.S. congressman and several noted human rights attorneys -- fought to clear Puracal's name. They said that there was no evidence to support the charges and that the American's prosecution was rife with legal mistakes and misconduct. Read the details of Puracal's case . Earlier this summer, Puracal's defense team presented their arguments before an appeals court in Nicaragua, which decided last week to vacate all charges against him. One of Puracal's attorneys picked him up from the notorious La Modelo prison near Managua late last week and drove him out of the gates. Puracal immediately took a hot shower, and then another and another. The prison is notorious for its harsh treatment of inmates and for housing some of the region's most violent criminals. Puracal said he had been beaten and been refused water and food for days at a time and had developed a painful inflammation in his bowels and lost a lot of weight. Puracal talked about the experience with Cooper on Monday night. ""It is a notorious prison -- just the conditions and overcrowding of it and the danger of it. What is that first moment like when the gate slams behind you and you realize the reality of where you are?"" Cooper asked. ""I was with rapists, murderers and actual drug dealers,"" Puracal said. ""It's a very violent place. There's a lot of tension between different groups in there; not only the conditions, but the other people around you."" There were times, in the beginning, when Puracal just couldn't believe what was happening to him. ""I didn't believe that I was there, and I kept thinking to myself, 'Oh this is just a big mistake' and that they will let me go any day now,"" he said. ""And the whole time, 'Oh yeah, any day now I should be going,' and it just kept dragging on and dragging on."" What is it like being a free man? ""It's wonderful ... it's very overwhelming,"" Puracal said. ""But I'm happy to be back with my family my wife and my son. ... It's still very, very surreal. The whole experience has been very unbelievable."" He said that his sister Janis Puracal, a Seattle lawyer who was his biggest advocate, sometimes was able to visit him in prison. She brought stacks of supportive e-mails. They were from friends and family but also from strangers who heard about his case through the awareness group FreeJasonP.com, which publicized his case. The e-mails were a huge help, but ""there were days where I started losing hope,"" he said. ""It's a very negative environment, that prison."" Puracal meditated on his son. He thought about his Nicaraguan wife Scarlett. They met not long after he moved from Washington state to the country, first to work as a Peace Corps volunteer and then as a real estate agent. The couple settled in San Juan del Sur, a popular beach town in southwest Nicaragua. On November 11, 2010, Nicaraguan police raided Puracal's ReMax office and his home. Police also took custody of Puracal's truck and the clothes he was wearing; yet 48 hours after he was detained, police asked him to put his clothes back on and get into his truck so authorities could take pictures, according to former FBI Agent Steve Moore, who has reviewed the case documents. He said police then claimed they found a substance that could be cocaine. ""Basic chain of command was not followed,"" Moore, part of a group of vocal supporters, told CNN in February. ""You can imagine you feel greatly violated that you are being accused of these horrific crimes with absolutely no evidence,"" Puracal told Cooper. ""But I just didn't believe that those things can happen. You don't think that it can happen to you."" By late Monday night, Puracal was exhausted. He kept playing with Jabu, though. He still has all those papers, the life lessons he wrote for his son. ""I want to turn them into a book for him,"" he told CNN. ""I want him to be able to keep it."" He still loves Nicaragua, he said. He doesn't blame a country for the acts of a few people. He plans to go to graduate school to get a degree in sustainable urban development to do what he began in the Peace Corps years ago. ""I still do love Nicaragua. I still believe in its potential. I still love the people there,"" he said. ""There's wrongful convictions in every country around the world, including the United States, so I can't isolate it just to Nicaragua. And I hope that one day that I'll be able to finish some of the social projects that I was working on.""","Nicaragua overturned American Jason Puracal's conviction .

"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The U.S. State Department's renewal of Blackwater's contract to provide security in Iraq ""is bad news,"" an adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said. A woman passes a burned car in Baghdad where Blackwater guards killed 17 in September. Blackwater guards shot and killed 17 people, including women and children, last September, prompting an outcry and protest from Iraqi officials. ""This is bad news,"" al-Maliki adviser Sami al-Askari said. ""I personally am not happy with this, especially because they have committed acts of aggression, killed Iraqis, and this has not been resolved yet positively for families of victims."" About 25,000 private contractors from three companies protect diplomats, reconstruction workers and government officials in Iraq. Under a provision put into place in the early days of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq, security contractors have immunity from Iraqi prosecution.  Watch Iraqis express anger over the announcement » . Al-Askari said he would push for the Iraqi government to contest the contract renewal. ""The U.S. government has the right to choose what contractors it chooses, but Iraq should also have the right to allow or ban certain contractors from operating on its territory,"" he said. Al-Askari said there is a general mood of displeasure within the Iraqi government because of the contract renewal. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said a joint Iraqi-U.S. commission was set up after the shootings, and Iraqis told U.S. officials that the rules of engagement and use of force must be changed. As a result, a State Department security officer accompanies every convoy manned by contractors, Al-Dabbagh said, and every vehicle is outfitted with a security camera. Recordings from the camera are sent to a command center. Al-Dabbagh said the Iraqi government still wants Blackwater to come under the jurisdiction of Iraqi law and its courts. ""Most importantly, the Iraqi investigation concluded that Blackwater committed a crime at Nusour Square,"" he said. ""The U.S. informed us that the FBI investigation is still not done, and if Blackwater [personnel are] ... convicted, then the contract will be reviewed."" Another al-Maliki adviser, Sadeq al-Rikabi, said the contract would be temporary since the U.N. mandate under which the United States operates in Iraq will expire at the end of the year, to be replaced by a bilateral agreement under negotiation. ""No doubt, the role of the U.S. military and contractors will be agreed on"" in the new arrangement, al-Rikabi said. Blackwater is one of three contractors working under a ""task order"" to provide security services in Iraq. The other two are Triple Canopy and DynCorp. The State Department contract must be renewed every year and is up for renewal next month. In effect, Blackwater's contract will roll over for another year, said Greg Starr, who heads the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service. Starr said new rules and an agreement between the State Department and U.S. military have improved coordination and the supervision of contractors. Blackwater must work under the rules of the Iraqi government, he said. The FBI is in charge of the U.S. investigation of the September incident, in which survivors and victims' family members contend Blackwater guards started shooting without provocation. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation called the killings ""premeditated murder."" Starr said the U.S. government, in particular U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker, will take a close look at the FBI's investigation report, ""and then we decide whether it is consistent with U.S. goals and policies to continue the contract."" It will be important to see whether the FBI finds Blackwater itself criminally responsible, or merely a few of its employees, Starr said. ""We can terminate contracts for the convenience of the government if we have to,"" he said. ""I am not going to prejudge what the FBI is going find in its investigation. It's complex. I think the U.S. government needs protective services."" ""I am up to this point very satisfied with the changes we have seen,"" Starr said. ""Essentially, I think they do a very good job. The September 16 incident was a tragedy; it needs to be investigated carefully. The results of that will come out eventually and we will decide how we will proceed."" Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell declined to comment, referring all questions to the State Department. E-mail to a friend .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN) -- Criminal charges were filed against the co-owner of a Florida clinic where a teenager claims she sought an abortion, but instead gave birth to a baby that the woman allegedly threw in the trash. Belkis Gonzalez has a prior conviction of unlicensed practice of medicine for incidents in 2004. Belkis Gonzalez, 43, was co-owner of the now-defunct A Gyn Diagnostic Center in Hialeah, Florida. She faces a second-degree felony count of unlicensed practice of a health care profession resulting in serious bodily injury and a third-degree felony count of tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, authorities said Tuesday. She was arrested and taken into custody, prosecutors said. If convicted, she faces a minimum sentence of a year in jail. Authorities were unable to file more serious charges against Gonzalez because they could not prove the baby's exact cause of death. Nor could they prove that her actions brought about the death, according to Ed Griffith, a spokesman for the state attorney's office in Miami. The baby's mother, Sycloria Williams, sued the clinic, its staffers and Pierre Jean-Jacques Renelique, its doctor, last month. The Florida Medical Board also revoked Renelique's license last month. Although Renelique was not present when the baby was born, the medical board upheld Department of Health allegations that he falsified medical records, inappropriately delegated tasks to unlicensed personnel and committed malpractice. Williams claims she sought an abortion at the clinic on July 20, 2006, when she believed herself to be about 23 weeks pregnant. She was 18 at the time. She was told to wait for Renelique to arrive and given medication. When she complained of feeling ill, she said clinic staffers told her to lie down in a patient room. She waited for hours, Williams claims in her suit, and eventually ""felt a large pain"" and delivered a baby girl. Williams ""observed the infant moving and making noises for approximately five minutes,"" according to an affidavit in support of Gonzalez's arrest warrant. Williams alleges that Gonzalez entered the room, used a pair of shears to cut the baby's umbilical cord, then ""scooped up the baby and placed the live baby, placenta and afterbirth in a red plastic biohazard bag, which she sealed, and then threw bag and the baby in a trash can."" The doctor later arrived and gave Williams a shot to put her to sleep, she alleges in her suit. In the affidavit, police said they found out about the incident when they received a tip the following day. They searched the clinic for the baby's remains but were unable to find them. Gonzalez gave police a statement, meanwhile, and ""asserted under oath"" that Williams' termination was done by Dr. Renelique while she stood at his side, according to the affidavit. She denied that the infant came out alive, police said, but statements from two other clinic employees contradicted her account. Six days after the first search, police received another tip that the infant's remains were placed back inside the clinic. They executed a search warrant and found the remains. They were linked to Williams through DNA testing, according to the affidavit. Documents from the state Department of Health say the baby's cause of death was determined to be ""extreme prematurity."" However, according to the police affidavit, the medical examiner could not definitively say that the baby had been born alive. A birth certificate was issued, because nothing in the autopsy findings disproved Williams' claim the baby was alive and moving. Experts told police the baby would not have suffocated in the bag because it would have had a limited ability to breathe on its own. And an expert reported there was no way to prove for sure that the baby filled its lungs with air because of its underdeveloped lungs, as well as its decomposed state when the remains were found. Another expert certified in neonatal and perinatal medicine told police he estimated Williams' fetus, based on data from her medical records, to have a gestational age of about 21 and a half weeks -- meaning it had not reached viability, the state where it could survive outside the womb. ""This expert ... explained that the standard of care for a premature infant delivered at less than 23 weeks is not to attempt resuscitation,"" so even if the baby had been born at a hospital, no measures would have been undertaken to save it, according to the affidavit. In December 2007, Gonzalez was convicted of unlicensed practice of medicine for actions between August and December of 2004, and is serving five years' probation, according to the affidavit. However, because the 2006 incident preceded her probation term, she is not accused of violating her probation.","Belkis Gonzalez faces felony counts stemming from abortion in Florida clinic .

"TITUSVILLE, Florida (CNN) -- It's shortly after 5 a.m. when the phone rings, and on the line is a clearly anxious and worried parent. Sierra Journey Factor, 8, has a muscular disease that her mom, Shaylene Akery, hopes can be treated in China. ""Sierra is having a lot of problems tonight,"" Shaylene Akery tells a CNN producer. ""We have to take her to the hospital, but we still want to talk to you about her trip to China."" Her daughter, Sierra Journey Factor, is 8 years old and has a terminal disease called Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic disorder that affects parts of the nervous system that control voluntary muscle movement. In addition, she has a restrictive lung disease and a kidney disorder. She has used a wheelchair since infancy. Sierra's mother, her stepfather and her biological father, A.J. Factor, all know that Sierra is seriously ill. On the morning we met them, Sierra was treated at two hospitals before she was stabilized. But the family is convinced of their next step -- taking Sierra on an arduous trip to southern China, where they believe the little girl will be injected six times with stem cells during a 34-day stay. It's the kind of treatment not yet approved in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. Sierra's treatment will cost $26,500, which does not include the cost of travel and living for the extended family. Those costs would mean an additional $25,000, according to Akery.  Watch more on the quest for a stem-cell cure » . ""We are really walking into this blindfolded,"" Akery said. ""It's scary, but everybody says it's so nice over there."" The family says it got most of its information from a Web site called China Stem Cell News, at stemcellschina.com, which boasts of dozens of anecdotal testimonials from loved ones who say their children or family members showed improvement after the stem cell treatments. The site offers no scientific evidence and no means of making contact except through a Web form. CNN used the form, but as of yet has received no reply. Stem cell therapy is routinely performed at clinics in China. When CNN correspondent John Vause reported on one stem cell therapy clinic near Beijing in December, the clinic refused to release its records or put its cases forward for peer review. The International Society of Stem Cell Researchers and the FDA discourage Americans from traveling overseas for stem cell therapy. But clinics are operating worldwide -- many in China, and several in Russia, Latin America and Mexico. ""We do not encourage patients to seek therapies overseas that are not FDA-approved in the U.S.,"" an agency spokesman said in an e-mail to CNN, ""as the products or therapies have not undergone the agency's rigorous review."" The ALS Association is one group especially concerned. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a terminal illness also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, named after the baseball legend who most famously suffered from it. There are no accurate numbers, but ALS Association officials say dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ALS patients have traveled to China and other locations seeking relief. CNN asked Dr. Lucie Bruijn, the senior vice president for research and development for the ALS Association, whether stem cells offer meaningful treatment for ALS. ""No, it's definitely not true,"" she said. ""Certainly you hope that the answer from an ALS clinician who is knowledgeable ... [will be], 'There are things that are promising but we don't have anything to offer you now.' "" That statement is at odds with promises posted on a relatively new Web site run by an 80-year-old Florida doctor named Burton Feinerman, who says he's been conducting stem cell therapy for three years. His site, Stem Cell Regen Med, at stemcellregenmed.com, says it can offer treatment for a long list of life-threatening diseases, including ALS, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer, brain damage and lung illnesses. It is not the program to which Akery intends to take her daughter. Feinerman says he and a partner work out of a clinic in Lima, Peru, where they offer stem cell therapy injections at a cost of $8,000 to $25,000. ""Isn't what you're doing experimenting on people?"" CNN asked Feinerman. ""Yes,"" he said, ""and people are fully aware."" ""And charging them large amounts of money to do these experiments?"" asked CNN. ""The amount of money is large,"" Feinerman replied. ""But it basically is pretty close to my cost."" Feinerman, who said he was a cosmetic dermatologist in Hawaii before moving to Florida, also said he is no expert on stem cells. ""I have trained at the Mayo Clinic and have been practicing medicine for over 50 years,"" he said. ""But you never trained in stem cell research?"" asked CNN. ""No,"" Feinerman replied. ""But you've gone to some conferences, self-taught, right?"" CNN asked. ""Right. That's true."" ""And now you're basically taking people from the United States to other countries because the procedures can't legally be done here?"" ""That is right,"" Feinerman said. ""But I am the organizer, so to speak. I am the person who does an enormous amount of reading and visiting. Putting protocols together that appear to work in other countries."" Feinerman said his expertise comes from extensive reading on the subject, and attending international conferences on stem cell research, sometimes as many as six a year. He spoke to CNN just hours before, he said, he was heading to Peru to treat three more Americans with life-threatening illnesses. In a statement issued after the interview, Feinerman said, ""We are not selling snake oil, but our scientific approach to diseases that are not available in the USA."" Meanwhile, at the Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in Orlando, Florida, the family of 8-year-old Sierra Journey Factor were more convinced than ever to take their child across the world to China for a treatment they conceded is not a guarantee of a cure. The science director of the Fight SMA organization, Chris Lorson, told CNN there is no proven stem-cell treatment for the disease. ""If you go there and nothing happens, will you still think it was worth it?"" CNN asked Akery. ""Yes,"" Akery said. ""Because we can still say we tried.""","Stem cell injections are offered at various clinics worldwide .

"(CNN)In at least one big and bruising culture-war battle, the Mormon church wants to call a partial truce. Convening a rare press conference on Tuesday at church headquarters in Salt Lake City, Mormon leaders pledged to support anti-discrimination laws for gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people, as long the laws also protect the rights of religious groups. In exchange, the Mormon church wants gay rights advocates -- and the government -- to back off. ""When religious people are publicly intimidated, retaliated against, forced from employment or made to suffer personal loss because they have raised their voice in the public square, donated to a cause or participated in an election, our democracy is the loser,"" said Elder Dallin Oaks, a member of the church's Quorum of Twelve Apostles. ""Such tactics are every bit as wrong as denying access to employment, housing or public services because of race or gender."" The Mormon church is one of several faiths to complain about religious freedom coming under attack in recent years. Catholic bishops and Southern Baptists have sounded the alarm as well. Oaks cited several examples on Tuesday, including: . ""It is one of today's great ironies that some people who have fought so hard for LGBT rights now try to deny the rights of others to disagree with their public policy proposals,"" said Oaks. Tuesday's announcement doesn't change church doctrine -- including its opposition to gay marriage, Mormon leaders said. ""But we are suggesting a way forward in which those with different views on these complex issues can together seek solutions that will be fair to everyone,"" said Elder D. Todd Christofferson, a member of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles, one of the church's top tiers of leadership. Christofferson said Tuesday's announcement came after years of dialogue with LGBT groups in Utah and elsewhere, and was timed to the convening of a new Congress and new legislative sessions nationwide. ""It seemed like the right time to speak, before positions get any more hardened on either side,"" he said. Shortly after the church's press conference, U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican and a Mormon, said he will work to ""ensure that legislation designed to promote greater equality includes robust religious exemptions and nonretaliation provisions."" Utah state Sen. Jim Dabakis, who is openly gay, said ""Amen,"" to the church's ""historic announcement."" ""I am proud that the LDS Church has seen fit to lead the way in non-discrimination,"" he said. ""Now, let's roll up our sleeves, get to work and pass a statewide nondiscrimination bill."" Oaks, however, said it's ""unfair"" to characterize the church's announcement as a national nondiscrimination campaign. Mormon leaders are merely seeking to square competing claims of gay rights and religious liberty, he said in a brief interview on Tuesday. The Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBT advocacy group, said some Mormons may consider their church's announcement symbolically significant. ""But, as a matter of public policy, it appears deeply flawed,"" said HRC Legal Director Sarah Warbelow. Doctors, landlords and business owners would still be allowed to discriminate against gays and lesbians, as long as they cited a religious reason, she said. On the other end of the spectrum, Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore called the Mormons' new policy ""well-intentioned, but naive."" Proposals to balance gay rights and religious freedom inevitably lead to attacks on the latter, Moore said. Officially known as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormon church, like other religious groups, has tried to strike a delicate balance on gay rights. Mormons have fought the legalization of same-sex marriage, for example, while trying to avoid the ""anti-gay"" label sometimes affixed to conservative faiths. Many church members were particularly stung by the fierce backlash to Prop 8. The Mormon-backed referendum was later struck down in court. Nearly two-thirds of Mormons say homosexuality should be discouraged by society, according to a 2012 survey conducted by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. The church's official position is that same-sex attraction is not a sin, but acting on it is. At the same time, Mormon leaders have taken an increasingly civil tone towards gays and lesbians in recent years, and gay rights groups cheered the church for endorsing the Boy Scouts' decision to allow gay scouts in 2013. Notably, however, Mormon leaders said Tuesday that they would not -- and could not -- alter their opposition to gay marriage, calling such unions, ""contrary to the laws of God."" ""This commandment and doctrine comes from sacred scripture and we are not at liberty to change it,""  said Sister Neill Marriott, a leader in the church's women's organization. ""But, God is loving and merciful,"" Marriott continued. Jesus ministered to marginalized outcasts, she said by way of example, while also obeying religious commandments. ""It's for this reason that the church has publicly favored laws and ordinances that protect LGBT people from discrimination in housing and employment."" In 2009, the Mormon church backed nondiscrimination regulations for gays and lesbians in Salt Lake City. On Tuesday, Mormon leaders said they are now willing to support similar measures elsewhere, including laws protecting LGBT persons from unfair bias in housing, unemployment and public transportation. With nearly 6.5 million members in the United States, the Mormon church is one of the largest in this country to offer support of LGBT anti-discrimination laws, second only to the United Methodist Church. The country's two largest Christian denominations, the Catholic church and Southern Baptist Convention, have opposed the Employee Non-Discrimination Act, or ENDA.  None of those groups condone gay marriage. In this country, less than a third of states have laws protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination, according to GLAD, a gay rights group. Even fewer state laws protect gender identity or expression. It is unlikely that Mormons' support of those measures could increase that number significantly, except perhaps in church strongholds like Utah, Idaho and Wyoming. There are 16 Mormons in Congress, where  LGBT civil rights legislation, including ENDA, has repeatedly failed. Gay marriage has proved far more successful than anti-discrimination laws, despite opposition from conservative groups, including the Mormon church. Thirty-five states now allow same-sex couples to wed. Earlier this month, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether states have the constitutional right to ban same-sex marriage. Perhaps with an eye on the high court, Mormon leaders said Tuesday the rights of gays and lesbians must not trump the religious freedom of faith communities. ""What kinds of religious rights are we talking about?"" said Elder Jeffrey Holland, a member of the church's Quorum of Twelve Apostles. It begins with the rights of faith communities to preach their beliefs from the pulpit, teach them in church classrooms and freely select their own leaders and ministers, Holland said. But religious freedom should also extend to Mormon physicians who refuse to perform abortions or artificial insemination for a lesbian couple, or a Catholic pharmacist who declines to carry the ""morning after"" pill, he added. As Mormon leaders acknowledged Tuesday, such situations have perplexed politicians, appeared on court dockets across the country and set conservative and liberals at fierce odds. ""These are serious issues,"" Holland said, ""and they require serious minds engaged in thoughtful, courteous discourse.""","Mormon leaders call rare press conference in Salt Lake City .

"(CNN)  -- The number of people with dementia globally is estimated to nearly double every 20 years, according to a report released Monday for World Alzheimer's Day. It's common for people with Alzheimer's or other types of dementia to wander from their homes. Much of the growth will be fueled by longer life spans and population growth, especially in developing nations. ""Over the next 20 years, the numbers of people with dementia are anticipated to increase by 40 percent in Europe, 63 percent in North America, 77 percent in the southern Latin America ... and 89 percent in the developed Asia Pacific countries,"" the report said. ""In comparison, the percentage increase is expected to be 117 percent in East Asia, 107 percent in South Asia, 134-146 percent in the rest of Latin America, and 125 percent in North Africa and the Middle East."" By 2010, an estimated 35.6 million people around the world will be living with dementia. The number is expected to hit 65.7 million in 2030 and 115.4 million in 2050. One in seven Americans age 71 and older, or about 3.4 million, have dementia, according to the National Institutes of Health. In this age group, 2.4 million people have Alzheimer's disease, NIH research has shown. Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic. Some of the causes of the disease are believed to be genetic, while others are thought to be preventable. Studies have shown that physical exercise, the kind that keeps the heart healthy, also keeps the brain healthy, according to the National Institutes of Health's Cognitive and Emotional Health Project. Mental stimulation can help too. ""Our brains can be made stronger through exercise,"" Andrew Carle, assistant professor in the department of health administration and policy at George Mason University, told CNN late last year. ""In the same way physical exercise can delay many of the effects of aging on the body, there's some evidence cognitive exercise can at least delay the onset of Alzheimer's."" A combination of antioxidants, supplements and curry may also help. Vitamins A, C, and E are antioxidants, which prevent cell damage and are believed to slow down diseases of aging, said Edythe London, a professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""There are studies that suggest antioxidants might prevent dementia,"" she said. Fish oil and phosphatidylserine supplements may also help. Aging brains show signs of inflammation, and fish oil has anti-inflammatory properties, said Gary Small, director of the UCLA Center on Aging. Phosphatidylserine is a lipid found naturally in the body and is a major component of cell membranes. Small said he's not 100 percent convinced these supplements will help stave off dementia, but they're worth a try. There's also curry. Small said that as he gets older, he might try eating more foods with curry in them. ""Some studies in Singapore show that those who ate curry once a week had better memory scores,"" he said.","Number of people with Alzheimer's estimated to nearly double every 20 years .

"New Delhi (CNN)In the final hours of a visit meant to demonstrate the deep societal ties between the U.S. and India, President Barack Obama briefly broke from his gushing praise for the new Prime Minister to make a soft but undisguised push toward gender equality and religious freedom. Speaking to an audience of students and activists in New Delhi on Tuesday, Obama declared the U.S. was India's best-suited partner as it makes rapid economic advances and appears poised to overtake China to become the world's most populous nation. But he didn't veil his take on recent attacks against women here, urging the country away from violence against women and religious minorities. Recent rapes in India have put a harsh focus on India's gender politics. ""Every girl's life matters,"" Obama said in New Delhi. ""Every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons. And every woman should be able to go about her day -- to walk the street or ride the bus -- and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves."" Sexual assaults became a high-profile problem in India after a young woman was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. The victim later died. Subsequent incidents of sexual violence -- including at the hands of an Uber driver -- placed global scrutiny on India's laws and culture. Obama traveled to India in the hopes of capitalizing on the deep personal warmth he's quickly developed with new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose effervescent welcome for the American President was covered enthusiastically and exhaustively by Indian media. That's a distant cry from Modi's arrival in the United States in September, which was marred by awkward questions over his visa status. Modi, a member of the right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, had previously been denied entry to the U.S. for an alleged role in a massacre of Muslims. Obama said Tuesday that it was the responsibility of every citizen to uphold the freedom of religion that's enshrined in India's constitution. ""Every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free from persecution and fear,"" Obama said. Obama's parting speech Tuesday was one of his few moments apart from Modi during his stay in India. The pair hugged upon Obama's arrival, sipped tea and meandered through a formal garden, and sat for hours behind rain-splattered bulletproof glass reviewing the annual Republic Day parade. White House officials say that the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already high expectations, and that the relationship greased the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow U.S. firms to construct power plants in India. Both sides also moved toward more defense cooperation and trade pacts. But despite their talk of cooperation, obvious differences persist between the U.S. and India that could preclude cooperation on areas like combating climate change. During his remarks Tuesday, Obama said India must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change, even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive India to new economic heights. ""Here's the truth: Even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if growing countries like India -- with soaring energy needs -- don't also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don't stand a chance against climate change,"" Obama said.","""Every girl's life matters,"" Obama says in New Delhi .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Even though African-Americans make up only about 13 percent of the United States' population, they account for almost half of the people who contract HIV and are diagnosed with AIDS. Marvelyn Brown, 24, is the author of ""The Naked Truth: Young, Beautiful and (HIV) Positive."" Around this year's Black AIDS Day on February 7, activists are out trying to educate the public about the disease. Among those speaking out is Marvelyn Brown, 24, the author of ""The Naked Truth: Young, Beautiful, and (HIV) Positive."" Brown spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about living with disease, defying stereotypes and inspiring others. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Nicole Lapin: After 30 years [since HIV was identified] I'm curious that the disease really gained a lot of awareness. Do you think people's perceptions have changed? Do you think the stereotypes still exist?  Watch Nicole Lapin's interview with Marvelyn Brown » . Marvelyn Brown: See, the thing about HIV is that I think people are aware of it. They've heard of it, they know of it. They're just not educated about it. I've had the opportunity to look at some of the comments that people were making. Just looking at the comments you could see, you could tell that people had a misconception of HIV as a whole. Lapin: What is that? What's the misconception? Brown: That it's a certain group of people. I know [February 7] is Black AIDS Day, which is perfectly fine because it does affect the black community. But this is a human disease, one that affects us all. When I tell you I was shocked because I contracted a virus that I thought I was immune from, I immediately put it on gay men, IV drug users, prostitutes. I never thought someone like myself, whoever that was, could contract HIV. When I go and I speak, that's the main thing that I hear. People are constantly telling me I make HIV real to them. Lapin: It speaks to [a viewer's] question, ""What do you think is the most effective way to teach young women about HIV and AIDS?"" Because it seems like they relate to you. They get you. You're their peer. Brown: That's the thing. Just simply be open and honest with them. I've found that more effective, just me telling my story and not holding back. Especially with my autobiography, ""The Naked Truth,"" I just opened up. I was so vulnerable and people could relate to that.","Marvelyn Brown, 24, wrote ""The Naked Truth: Young, Beautiful and (HIV) Positive""

"(CNN) -- Long before company celebrators bench-pressed fax machines, partygoers performed competitive face-plants into ice water, or family members gathered around an aluminum pole to wield complaints at one another, the common people of ancient Rome began to act up. They were the unruly lot during official religious holidays, the ones who were ""raising hell on the streets"" while the ""elite were putting on their robes,"" said journalist Allen Salkin. The adverb to describe their behavior, he said: Festivus, the Latin world for ""festive."" A few thousand years later, and thanks to a ""Seinfeld"" writer whose father had made Festivus a quirky household tradition, a 1997 episode of the famed sitcom popularized the peculiar day. To hear it from Frank Costanza, the character played by Jerry Stiller, the December 23 observance calls for little more than the erection of an aluminum pole, the airing of grievances and the demonstration of feats of strength -- which preferably culminate in wrestling down to the ground and pinning the head of the household. ""People want something that's nothing,"" said Salkin, author of ""Festivus: The Holiday for the Rest of Us,"" a book that chronicles the birth and flourishing of this oddly sacred day. ""All the traditional holidays exclude somebody,"" but with this one, ""everyone's in on the joke."" Show us how you celebrate Festivus . The Festivus faithful have gathered across the globe and have come together in places as various as seedy bars, campus squares and corporate boardrooms. Citizens, with varied degrees of success, have petitioned to raise Festivus poles beside public nativity scenes. Social networking sites and holiday-specific venues -- like festivusbook.com and festivusweb.com -- are go-to places for those who want to share the cheer, or jeers. For at least eight years, Julianne Donovan, 35, has been hosting Festivus parties in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. The graphic designer and illustrator said she was drawn to the holiday when her then-company department, which included people of various faiths, decided to trade in the traditional Christmas party for something more inclusive. ""It went over well except for one person who thought it was blasphemous and tried to knock over our Festivus pole,"" she said. ""He refused to come to the potluck, was forced to, came, ate all the food and left without saying thank you. Grievances were aired about him."" At her parties, which happen when she feels like throwing them -- perfectly fine, according to Salkin, because ""There's no pope of Festivus; you make up whatever rules you want"" -- people jot down their grievances and stuff them in the pole. They complain about parking tickets, the economy and their spouses, she said. One of her favorites in recent years read like this: ""What's up with the dude in the white shoes? It's way after Labor Day."" People exchange gifts they've received and don't want. Dickies, random hair extensions and shoe-shining kits from the '70s are always appropriate, she said. And feats of strength generally involve thumb-wrestling (costumes for thumbs included) and timed competitions to see who can submerge their face in ice water the longest or hold 3-pound weights to the side for the greatest stretch of time. ""As the hostess,"" Donovan made clear, ""I cheat."" Getting in on the fun in recent years is a stairway railing company called Wagner, based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Tony Leto, who heads sales and marketing, saw an article about Festivus that Salkin wrote in The New York Times in 2004, a precursor to his book, and thought cutting up pipes to make aluminum holiday poles would be an easy -- and fun -- side business. Thus was born festivuspoles.com, an outfit that's answered thousands of requests for the nonsectarian celebratory metal. Leto said he's received orders from troops in Afghanistan and people living in Australia, though he's advised across-the-globe customers who can to simply stroll into their local hardware stores and ask for pieces of pipe. When the company sent Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle a Festivus pole in 2005, he put it up in the executive residence. Today it appears in the state's historical museum. Festivus isn't the only wintertime holiday to be introduced to the masses by television. Fox's ""The O.C."" brought us ""Chrismukkah"" in 2003 and continued the holiday throughout the teen drama series' run. Chrismukkah was an answer to the winter holiday dilemma for interfaith families.","Festivus, popularized by ""Seinfeld"" episode, described unruly ancient Romans .

"Washington (CNN)Drones are fighting the war on terror, smuggling drugs on the border and crashing near the White House. They're everywhere. It is ironic that a drone could strike down near the White House -- as one did Monday morning -- since the issue of drone strikes is one that will follow President Barack Obama and mark his legacy. After the crash near his temporary home, Obama called during an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria for more drone regulation. ""The drone that landed in the White House you buy in Radio Shack,"" Obama said. But when historians talk in the future about drones and the Obama White House, they won't  be referring to be the two-foot long quad copter that was discovered on the Southeast corner of the White House grounds  and sent Washington into a security-related lather early Monday morning, but rather to the unmanned aerial vehicles -- the Pentagon calls them UAVs -- like the one that was confirmed on Monday by the U.S. Government to have delivered its payload in Yemen. The strike acknowledged Monday is one of more than 500 that have been launched by the United States since 2011, according to data compiled by The New America Foundation. Three officials told CNN's Barbara Starr about the drone strike in Marib, Yemen, which was conducted by the CIA. The agency declined to comment, although Starr reported that it is not believed any major AQAP leaders were targeted. This is the first U.S. drone strike of the year in Yemen and the first since a popular uprising in Yemen has destabilized the government that has so far cooperated with the U.S. In its anti-terror campaign. The New America Foundation has sought to keep a tally of U.S.-led drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. The use of drones peaked in Pakistan in 2010 and in Yemen in 2012, according to their data. It was in 2010 that the Department of Justice lawyers wrote a secret memo for the Obama administration that argued extra-judcial killings of people suspected of being terrorists was justified under U.S. Law, even in the case of U.S. citizens thought to be plotting abroad. That memo -- or two thirds of it that were not redacted -- were  released by a federal court last June in the face of a lawsuit by the ACLU. Clearly there's a huge difference between the type of drone used by the military to target and kill suspected terrorists and the type of drone used to take video with a GoPro. Somewhere in between is the type of drone, also in the news, drug smugglers are now using to carrying drugs across the Southern border. Tijuana police said last week they intercpted a drone carrying six pounds of synthetic drug crystal meth that crashed into a super market parking lot because six pounds, worth about $48,000 according to the DEA, was too much weight for the drone to handle. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said U.S. authorities have not yet encountered a drone as part of the war on drugs. But they do use drones of their own to monitor traffic on the Southern border for undocumented crossings. In addition to drug smugglers, legitimate businesses want to use drones too. Farmers are using them. Jeff Bezos wants Amazon to use them, although it's a little unclear how that'll work out. Related: Amazon's drone delivery: How would it work? Colin Guinn, who is CEO for 3D robotics, testified about research into the commercial use of drones Jan. 21 on Captiol Hill. He did so with a small drone, about the same size as the one that crashed near the White House, hovering next to him. There were snickers when the drone briefly crashed in the hearing room. All of this is in the way of saying drones are taking on an increased importance in the U.S. economy and becoming more visible in the nation's airways. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued some guidelines restricting where and how users can fly drones, but the industry is largely unregulated as more companies look to buy and integrate the relatively new technology into their business. The FAA had set a September 2015 deadline to roll out a list of drone regulations. Obama noted the need for more regulation during his interview with CNN's Zakaria. ""You know that there are companies like Amazon that are talking about using small drones to deliver packages... There are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play in terms of farmers who are managing crops and conservationists who want to take stock of wildlife."" Obama said. ""But we don't really have any kind of regulatory structure at all for it.""","A drone crashed near the White House at 3 a.m. Monday morning .

"(CNN) -- Robbie Tolan sits in a Houston, Texas, hospital bed with a bullet from a police officer's gun lodged in his liver. The son of a famed baseball player was shot in his own driveway. Robbie Tolan was shot December 31 by a police officer in his driveway. He was unarmed. But how this unarmed 23-year-old and his cousin ended up in the cross-hairs of an officer's gun, suspected of stealing a car, is a question sparking allegations of racial profiling. ""There's no doubt in my mind that if these had been white kids this does not happen,"" said David Berg, Tolan's attorney. It was 2 a.m. on December 31 when Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper, were confronted in the driveway of their home by Bellaire, Texas, police officers. Police officials say the officers suspected the two young men were driving a stolen car. Bellaire is a prominent, mostly white suburb in southwest Houston.  . Watch outrage over shooting of an unarmed man » . Robbie Tolan is the son of a once-prominent professional baseball player. His father, Bobby Tolan, had a 15-year career for the St. Louis Cardinals and Cincinnati Reds, spanning 1965 to 1979. He played on one of the most-heralded Cardinal teams ever: the 1967 World Series champs. The younger Tolan is just starting to develop his own baseball career. He's played in the Washington Nationals minor league system and spent part of last season playing for the Bay Area Toros of the Continental Baseball League. Tolan's relatives say the two young men had just arrived from a late-night run to a Jack-in-the-Box fast food restaurant. As they walked up the driveway to their home, Anthony Cooper said an unidentified man emerged from the darkness with a flashlight and a gun pointed at them. ""We did not know it was a police officer,"" said Cooper. ""He said, 'Stop. Stop.' And we were like, 'Why? Who are you?'"" The officers ordered both men to lie down on the ground. Tolan's parents heard the commotion and came outside. Police will only say an ""altercation"" took place. Tolan's family say it involved his mother. ""The cop pushed her against the wall,"" said Tolan's uncle, Mike Morris. Relatives say Tolan started to lean up from the ground to ask the officer what he was doing to his mother. That's when the family says Tolan was shot in the chest, the bullet piercing his lung and then lodging in his liver. But Tolan's SUV wasn't stolen. Both men were unarmed and relatives say they were hardly a threat to the police officer. Anger over the shooting has been building over the last week. ""He was the victim of the worst case and worst kind of racial profiling,"" said community activist Quannel X. The Bellaire Police Department has called the shooting ""tragic"" and put the officer involved in the incident on administrative leave. ""Anytime someone is injured we take it very seriously,"" said Byron Holloway, Assistant Chief of the Bellaire Police Department. ""But any allegation of racial profiling, I don't think that's going to float."" The police department is investigating and the district attorney's office in Houston is also looking into whether charges will be filed against the police officer. The policeman is a white, 10-year veteran of the force whom police say has an excellent record. Bellaire Police officials are no longer talking publicly about the case. The department's assistant chief says they're investigating how the officers on the scene mistakenly determined that the SUV Tolan and his cousin were driving had been stolen. Robbie Tolan remains in a Houston hospital. Relatives say he is in severe pain but is expected to recover. But his attorney says that Tolan's baseball career might be over. Tolan's father isn't worried about that. ""I'm not concerned about his career as a baseball player. I'm concerned about his health,"" said Bobby Tolan.","23-year-old son of former baseball star shot in his driveway by police officer .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- President Obama told Republican House leaders Tuesday he plans to stand firm on the part of his $825 billion economic recovery plan that calls for tax rebates for nearly all working Americans -- including those who make too little to owe income taxes. President Obama has pledged to work with Republicans on his economic stimulus package. According to two Republican aides familiar with Obama's Capitol Hill meeting, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Michigan, the ranking member on the Ways and Means committee, asked Obama if there was room for negotiation on the structure of the biggest tax cut in the bill. ""Feel free to whack me over the head because I probably will not compromise on that part,"" the president replied, according to one of the aides, who requested anonymity because the member of Congress relaying information to the aide from inside the meeting wished to remain anonymous. Obama supports the tax rebates for those who don't pay income taxes because they do pay payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. ""The president said again that people that pay payroll tax are taxpayers,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said later. "" ... And he just mentioned that the notion that refundability of tax credits for those that don't make a lot of money was a principle that not only he holds, but one that Ronald Reagan held with the Earned Income Tax Credit in the '80s."" Obama came to the Capitol for meetings with GOP senators and representatives hoping to bridge Washington's gaping partisan divide and find common ground in the face of a slumping economy. While the unusual personal interaction between a president of one party and rank-and-file members of the other was warmly received on both sides of the aisle, the meetings ended with little promise of serious compromise or change on the core issue of how best to spark new economic growth. The president first met with House Republicans and then with the Senate GOP caucus. ""We had a wonderful exchange of ideas, and I continue to be optimistic about our ability to get this recovery package done to put people back to work,"" Obama said after leaving the meeting with GOP House members. ""There are some legitimate philosophical differences"" between Democrats and Republicans on how to stimulate the economy, Obama noted, ""and I respect that."" ""I don't expect 100 percent agreement,"" he said. ""But I hope we can put politics aside."" House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he believes some members enjoyed the conversation. ""Clearly, there are some differences, [but] I look forward to [working with Obama] to improve this package in the coming days so that it is a package that will work for American families, small businesses and our overall economy."" Obama's plan -- the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act -- has been placed on the congressional fast-track. Democratic leaders have said they aim to get the package to Obama's desk for enactment by Presidents Day, which falls on February 16. Gibbs said the meetings Tuesday did not ""start at zero."" ""I don't think today was the beginning or the end, but just part of that process,"" he said. ""I do think there is a genuine sense of -- of cooperation that was involved in the meetings. I think we will have Republican support for this bill. I think you'll have some when the House passes this bill, hopefully on Wednesday."" The Republican aides, however, said the vast majority of House Republicans are expected to oppose the package Wednesday but are optimistic they will secure some of the changes they want after the vote -- either through changes the Senate makes or in conference committee after the Senate votes on the stimulus. The talks are being held against the backdrop of what appears to be a steadily deteriorating economic situation, highlighted by thousands of new private sector job cuts and record low consumer confidence. The Conference Board, a New York-based business research group, reported Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index fell to 37.7 in January, an all-time low going back to the index's inception in 1967. How much influence the minority GOP will have on the final drafting of the stimulus plan is an open question. ""What we're watching now as the stimulus package takes shape is the legislative equivalent of the first date: Republicans meeting with the new president, sizing him up; Obama deciding whether the GOP is serious about working with him,"" said Gloria Borger, CNN senior political analyst. Read what Borger says of the 'first date' ""He [Obama] came to a conclusion early on in his political career that partisan polarization is a large part of the problem,"" said a senior Obama adviser. ""Both in reality and in the minds of the American people."" One key Republican criticism of the stimulus plan is that many of its provisions would not jolt the economy back to life quickly enough. The Congressional Budget Office late Monday evening released its first analysis of the total stimulus package as proposed by House Democrats. The CBO estimates that roughly 64 percent of the $825 billion package would be put to use in 2009 and 2010, assuming a stimulus bill is signed into law in mid-February. By contrast, Peter Orszag, Obama's budget director, vowed to congressional leaders last week that 75 percent of the money would be spent within 18 months. The question of just how fast states and other agencies can spend money to do things like fix roads and retrofit buildings to make them more energy efficient will remain central to the congressional debate in coming days. Appearing before reporters Tuesday morning, Boehner applauded Obama's planned meeting with congressional Republicans, but reiterated his belief that the bill, as currently drafted, would significantly add to the debt while failing to spark sufficient job creation. The current version of the bill ""won't stimulate anything except more government and more debt,"" said Indiana Rep. Mike Pence, another member of the House GOP leadership. Obama was accompanied on the Hill on Tuesday by Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, a former moderate GOP House member from the president's home state of Illinois. The administration is hoping that LaHood, who once was the host of bipartisan congressional dinners with White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, will be able to help Obama win at least some Republicans in Congress. Emanuel also planned to meet with several House Republicans Tuesday night, senior administration officials said. Obama also extended an olive branch to Republicans by reportedly helping to remove from the stimulus plan a widely criticized $200 million provision to provide contraceptives to low-income families. The provision, which Republican leaders said would do little to help boost the economy, had been strongly defended by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. CNN's Brianna Keillar, Ed Henry, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh and CNNMoney's Catherine Clifford contributed to this report.","NEW: President tells leaders he will not compromise on tax rebate part of stimulus .

"(CNN)The names of some Nazi concentration camps live in infamy: Bergen-Belsen, where Anne Frank died. Dachau, the first camp. Auschwitz, where more than 1 million Jews, Roma (Gypsies), Poles, Soviet prisoners of war and others were killed. But as horrific as they were, they were only three camp complexes in a system of more than 850 ghettos, concentration camps, forced-labor camps and extermination camps that the Nazis established during the 12 years Adolf Hitler was in power. By the end of World War II in 1945, the death camp system stretched from France and the Netherlands in the west to Estonia, Lithuania and Poland in the east. There were 20 main concentration camps, many of which had many subcamps, according to Geoffrey Megargee, the editor of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos. Many of them combined the most dehumanizing and degrading characteristics of prison and slave labor camps. In some, Nazi doctors carried out depraved experiments, while others were primarily transit camps -- places to hold Jews and other ""undesirables"" until they were sent to other camps. There were also four main extermination camps -- Belzec, Chelmno, Sobibor and Treblinka -- devoted solely to killing everyone who passed through their gates. Treblinka nearly rivaled Auschwitz in the sheer number of people who were murdered there. Between 870,000 and 925,000 people were killed at Treblinka in Poland, 170,000 died at Sobibor, at least 152,000 were murdered at Chelmno, and about 434,500 Jews were killed at Belzec. In all, about 6 million Jews and millions of others died in the Holocaust. But the exact numbers of dead will probably never be known, nor will the total number of people held prisoner in Nazi camps. The Nazis were famously good record keepers, but they managed to destroy the records of some camps before the Allies liberated them. The infamous Lublin-Majdanek camp, which -- like Auschwitz -- had elements of both concentration camp and extermination camp, was one where records were destroyed. About 80,000 to 110,000 people died in the main camp, but it's impossible to know how many prisoners it held in its time. Bergen-Belsen was another camp whose overlords erased as much history as they could. Historians may never determine how many prisoners the camp held in its time, but it's clear that about 50,000 people perished there, including Anne Frank, who died of disease mere weeks before the camp was liberated.","Auschwitz, the most infamous Nazi camp, was just one of more than 850 camps .

"(CNN) -- Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal's swipe at federal spending to monitor volcanoes has the mayor of one city in the shadow of Mount St. Helens fuming. Gov. Bobby Jindal says spending for the U.S. Geological Survey is questionable. ""Does the governor have a volcano in his backyard?"" Royce Pollard, the mayor of Vancouver, Washington, said on Wednesday. ""We have one that's very active, and it still rumbles and spits and coughs very frequently."" Jindal singled out a $140 million appropriation for the U.S. Geological Survey as an example of questionable government spending during the GOP response to President Obama's address to Congress Tuesday night. The governor, a rising Republican star, questioned why ""something called 'volcano monitoring' "" was included in the nearly $800 billion economic stimulus bill Obama signed earlier this month.  Watch ""Is Jindal prime-time ready?"" » . ""Instead of monitoring volcanoes, what Congress should be monitoring is the eruption of spending in Washington,"" Jindal said. But Marianne Guffanti, a volcano researcher at the U.S. Geological Survey, said, ""We don't throw the money down the crater of the volcano and watch it burn up."" The USGS, which received the money Jindal criticized, is monitoring several active volcanoes across the Pacific Northwest, Alaska and Hawaii. One of those is Mount St. Helens, about 70 miles north of Vancouver, Washington, and neighboring Portland, Oregon. The volcano killed 57 people when it erupted in 1980 and sputters back into action periodically, most recently in late 2004 and early 2005, when it sent plumes of steam and ash thousands of feet into the air. USGS researchers are also keeping a close eye on Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano, about 100 miles from Anchorage, which is predicted to go off again within a few months. Its last eruption, in 1989, disrupted air traffic and forced down a commercial jet that sucked ash into its engines. ""If we can give good information about what's happening, that system of diversions and cancellations all works much more efficiently,"" Guffanti said. ""And fewer people are delayed and standard business is resumed quickly."" Louisiana is no stranger to natural disasters itself, having been devastated by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. But Timmy Teepell, Jindal's chief of staff, said the governor stands by his statement. ""That was just one example of wasteful spending in the largest government spending bill in history,"" Teepell said. ""The governor made it clear that we need to grow jobs, not government."" iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Obama, Jindal speeches . The $140 million line-item for the USGS includes not only monitoring, but also replacement of aging equipment ""and other critical deferred maintenance and improvement projects."" The spending could provide new jobs ""no different than the amount of money you would spend on building a street or building a bridge or something,"" said Danny Boston, an economist at Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. Pollard, a former Army officer who has served as Vancouver's mayor for 14 years, said USGS equipment used to keep tabs on volcanoes is frequently damaged or destroyed. He said he wasn't sure how many jobs the money could produce, but, ""For us and the people who live closer to it than Vancouver, it's important."" iReport.com: Jindal's tone 'insulting' ""We lost lives the last time, and we could lose them again,"" he said. CNN's Brian Todd and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Jindal stands by statement that volcano appropriation is questionable .
