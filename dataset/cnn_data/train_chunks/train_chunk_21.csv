"(Tribune Media Services) -- Frank Santa Maria buys two tickets to Italy on Expedia. But when an agent misspells his wife's name, he must embark on an odyssey to ensure she'll be allowed to use her tickets. Will he be successful? Q: I recently bought tickets to Italy by calling Expedia. I spelled my wife's first name to the agent. That afternoon we left town for a trip. When we returned the tickets were at the front door and a confirmation e-mail was waiting. My wife's first name was spelled Crista instead of Christa. I immediately called Expedia, and was told I should have contacted them the day the e-mail was sent to me and that there would be a $150 re-ticketing fee. After several more calls and being put on ""hold"" for more than half an hour, a supervisor told me that there was nothing they could do. They couldn't even change the name on the ticket. I contacted the airline directly and they told me they would make a note on my wife's passenger record. My wife's tickets are still wrong and I'm afraid we may have a problem with our connecting airline or with customs. What can I do? -- Frank Santa Maria, New Braunfels, Texas . A: Expedia should have spelled your wife's name correctly. When it was clear that the company had made an error, it should have done everything in its power to fix it instead of giving you the runaround and forcing you to deal directly with your airline. Then again, it should have never come to this. First, why are you phoning an online travel agency to buy tickets? It may be more convenient, but online agencies are built to handle your purchases online. It's more efficient and reduces the chance of an error being introduced -- like misspelling a passenger's name. Second, you should always check your verification e-mail immediately. Expedia could have made a change to your ticket if you had caught the mistake earlier. It's essential that you review your itinerary as soon as possible. Believe me, I know. I just made this mistake and had to spend an extra day at my destination because I put the wrong date in my reservation. (See? It can happen to anyone.) I've dealt with too many wrong-name cases to count, and here are a few things I've learned. Passengers aren't turned away at the gate because of a typographical error on their tickets. Reservations systems have limitations that sometimes truncate last names or render non-English names in funny characters. Last names and first names are frequently flip-flopped. Ticket agents, gate agents and security screeners know that, and will let you through. I haven't heard of anyone being denied boarding because of a one-character difference in a name. I'm reasonably sure your wife would have been allowed to travel using her ticket, even if this had happened after the May 15 implementation of the first phase of the Transportation Security Administration's ""Secure Flight"" initiative, which requires that you provide your full name as it appears on your government-issued identification. Incidentally, the ""notation"" in her reservation would have almost certainly been visible to any connecting airline. And a customs agent wouldn't even pay attention to your ticket under normal circumstances. It's your customs form and passport that matter to them. Next time you buy tickets by phone -- and I hope there's no next time -- do yourself a big favor: When you offer your name to the agent, ask to have it spelled back. That way, you'll catch any errors before the transaction goes through. Once you have a reservation, it becomes much more difficult (or even impossible) to make a change. It shouldn't be that way. In an ideal world, you'd be able to change a name on a ticket. Airlines say they can't allow name changes for ""security reasons"" but I'm inclined to believe it has more to do with the fact that they would lose lots of money if passengers could give their tickets to friends and family. Or resell them. I contacted Expedia on your behalf, and it issued a new ticket with your wife's name spelled correctly. Christopher Elliott is the ombudsman for National Geographic Traveler magazine.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Internet-based rip-offs jumped 33 percent last year over the previous year, according to a report from a complaint center set up to monitor such crimes. The report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of Internet fraud were men. The total dollar loss from those crimes was $265 million. That's $26 million more than the price tag in 2007, the National Internet Crime Center said. For individual victims, the average amount lost was $931. ""This report illustrates that sophisticated computer fraud schemes continue to flourish as financial data migrates to the Internet,"" said Shawn Henry, the FBI's assistant director of the Cyber Division. Americans filed 275,284 reports claiming to be ripped off on the Internet, the highest number reported since the center began keeping statistics in 2000. The dollar loss has been on a steady increase since 2004, while the number of cases referred to law enforcement has decreased steadily since that same year. Complaints to the center have resulted in several arrests, the center said, although information comes only from agencies that voluntarily provide the results of investigations. Henry said the figures show the need for computer users, in businesses and in homes, to be wary and use sound security practices while using the Internet. The center said the top three most frequent complaints were about merchandise that wasn't delivered or payment that wasn't received, Internet auction fraud and credit/debit card fraud. Other scams include confidence frauds such as Ponzi schemes, check fraud, the Nigerian letter fraud and identity fraud. One popular identity fraud scam used during 2008 involved sending e-mails crafted to appear as if they'd been sent by the FBI. Sometimes the scammers went so far as to say the mailings were from FBI Director Robert Mueller himself, according to the center. The e-mails would ask the recipient for personal information, such as a bank account numbers, claiming the FBI wanted the information to look into an impending financial transaction. One variation of the scheme, according to the center, was to send an e-mail saying the recipient is entitled to lottery money or an inheritance and the funds can be moved as soon as bank account information is supplied. The FBI has issued warnings about such scams in the past, and Monday's report included a new one: ""The FBI does not contact U.S. citizens regarding personal financial matters through unsolicited e-mails."" The report said that about 77.4 percent of perpetrators of Internet fraud were men, and about half lived in either California, New York, Florida, Washington, Texas or the District of Columbia. More than 55 percent of those who filed complaints were men. But the report noted that anyone who uses the Internet can be a victim, and that the ages of victims have ranged from 10 to 100. Internet crime offers unique challenges to investigators. The report said the offender and victim often live in different states and sometimes different countries, requiring multiple law enforcement agencies to cooperate and conquer any issues of jurisdiction. Another big problem is the anonymity of using the Internet. In most instances, a victim never meets the criminal. The Internet Crime Complaint Center is a partnership of the FBI and the National White Collar Crime Center.","Internet users said they were scammed out of a total of $265 million last year .

"MARIANNA, Florida (CNN) -- Leaning against his cane, Bryant Middleton shuffled toward the makeshift cemetery. Tears welled in his eyes as he leaned down to touch one of the crosses. Bryant Middleton kneels by a row of white crosses on the grounds of a former reform school he attended. ""This shouldn't be,"" he said. ""This shouldn't be."" Thirty-one crosses made of tubular steel and painted white line up unevenly in the grass and weeds of what used to be the grounds of a reform school in Marianna, Florida. The anonymous crosses are rusting away but their secrets may soon be exposed. When boys disappeared from the school, administrators explained it away, said former student Roger Kiser. They'd say, ""Well, he ran away and the swamp got him,"" Kiser recalled. Or, ""The gators got him."" Or, 'Water moccasins got him."" Kiser and other former students believe authorities will soon find the remains of children and teens sent to the Florida School for Boys half a century ago.  Watch Middleton kneel by the crosses Â» . On the orders of Gov. Charlie Crist, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement last week opened an investigation to determine if anyone is buried here, whether crimes were committed, and if so, who was responsible. A group of men in their 60s, who once attended the school, have told investigators they believe the bodies are classmates who disappeared after being savagely beaten by administrators and workers. The FDLE is just beginning its investigation, so there is no way to know if there is any truth to the allegations. The investigation will be challenging. Finding records and witnesses from nearly half a century ago will be difficult if not impossible. Many of the administrators and employees of the reform school are dead. Read more about the investigation . Middleton is 64 now, a former Army Ranger. He was 14 then, a wayward boy. He was sent to the Florida School for Boys for breaking and entering. He recently accompanied CNN to the school grounds. ""This is a travesty against mankind and the state of Florida should be ashamed of themselves,"" he said, choking back tears. ""It's as if they were tossed out here like they were nothing but garbage. And it's just downright criminal. Somebody needs to be accountable for this."" A single-story, nondescript building anchors the other side of the property. The white cinder block structure looks so simple, so bland, that it is difficult to imagine the pain, terror and torture it conjures up in the men who say their childhoods were ravaged within its four walls. The building was known as ""the white house.""  Watch a former student return to the building Â» . Middleton said he was brought there six times. He recalled that his tormentors, including one known as ""the whipper,"" would turn on a large industrial fan to muffle the screams of the boys who were beaten with long leather straps, reinforced with metal.  See photos from Middleton's reform school days Â» . Dick Colon said he went to the white house 11 times during his 30 months at the school. He's one of four men known as ""the White House Boys."" Colon, Kiser, Robert Straley and Michael O'McCarthy, the original four White House Boys, spoke out about the 31 crosses and their boyhood abuse and pushed for an investigation. Colon recalls his visits to the white house as if they were yesterday: . He said he was forced to lie face down in a blood-soaked pillow -- a pillow with small pieces of lips, tongue and skin on it from the previous boy. He'd clench the metal bar of the bed. The ceilings were low. He would hear the strap hit the ceiling and make a ""tick"" sound before it swung down on him. ""After that tick, you'd go 'Aaaahh,' and then you'd grab that bar, and go 'Ooooohhhhhhh,' and the spindles of the bed would bounce, and sometimes the bed would come off the ground,"" Colon told CNN.  Watch Colon's face contort as he relives the beatings Â» . Kiser, a fellow White House Boy, said the beatings provided entertainment for the guards and administrators. ""There were bets, and money changed hands on who could draw blood on the first blow,"" he said. He recalled his reaction when he went into a bathroom to clean up after enduring another beating. ""I looked up into that mirror and I just screamed,"" he said. ""I just saw this monster. I couldn't even tell who I was."" Colon said his reaction was to bury the pain inside. He told a story about how another boy's terror left him wrestling with his own best and worst instincts even to this day. He walked into the school's laundry room one day and saw a black teenager inside a large tumble dryer that was running. He wanted to save the boy, and tried to talk himself into being brave. ""I said, 'Do it! Do it! Do it!' "" he recalled, his eyes beginning to tear. ""And then I thought to myself, 'If you do it, they're gonna put you in there. You're gonna be next.' And I walked away."" After a long, tearful pause, Colon continued. ""I've been married to my wife for 42 years, and never told her,"" he said, wiping tears away with a handkerchief. ""I don't know how often in a week I think about that."" ""A chicken s---, I was,"" he sobbed. Still, Colon's is ultimately a success story. At the reform school, he studied to be an electrician and now owns a multimillion-dollar company in Baltimore, Maryland. Colon founded a scholarship fund for high achievers at the very same school that haunts his memories. It is called the Arthur Dozier School for Boys, and Colon returns every year to talk to the students about hope and hard work. ""They need to know they can do things and have a future,"" he said. ""Many just accept that they will be in prison someday.""","Former students talk about brutal days at a Florida reform school .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- A power-sharing deal has been reached between Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, South African President Thabo Mbeki said. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, left, and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai. Mbeki, who mediated the talks in Harare for the Southern African Development Community, said the deal would be signed Monday but did not give details of the agreement. Zimbabwe has had no Cabinet since the March presidential election that started the impasse. Opposition lawmakers booed and heckled Mugabe when he spoke at the opening of the country's parliament August 26. MDC leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the most votes in that election, but not enough to avoid a runoff, according to the government's official count. He withdrew from the June 27 runoff days before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters. The main sticking point in the talks had been how much power Mugabe would retain. Tsvangirai had said he would sign a deal only if Mugabe gave up some power and his presidency became a ceremonial position. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the agreement, according to a statement released by his spokesperson, and ""hopes that this agreement will pave the way for a durable peace and recovery in the country and contribute to rapid improvement in the welfare and human rights of the people of Zimbabwe."" The country is also reeling from hyper-inflation. In August, the country's Central Statistical Office said inflation was at 11.2 million percent, the highest in the world. Analysts have said the Zimbabwean government's official inflation rate figures are conservative. One of Zimbabwe's leading banks, Kingdom Bank, said the country's inflation rate was more than 20 million percent. The economic crisis has destroyed Zimbabwe's currency and made it difficult for Zimbabweans to buy basic commodities, electricity, fuel and medicines.","Zimbabwe leaders agree terms for sharing power, South African president says .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- American fighter jets intercepted two Russian bombers, one of which buzzed a U.S. aircraft carrier in the western Pacific on Saturday, U.S. military officials told CNN Monday. Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that there was no violation of flight regulations during the incident. A ministry official said the flights are standard operating procedure for air force training. One of them twice flew about 2,000 feet over the deck of the USS Nimitz Saturday while another flew about 50 miles away, officials said. Two others were at least 100 miles away, the military reported. U.S. defense officials said four F/A-18A fighter jets from the Nimitz were in the air.

Among the latest, on September 5,  six F-15s from Elmendorf Air Force Base, adjacent to Anchorage, Alaska, intercepted six Russian bombers about 50 miles from the northwest coast of Alaska.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The United States needs a new law requiring that the president consult with Congress before going to war, a blue-ribbon panel led by two former secretaries of state said Tuesday. James Baker, left, and Warren Christopher led a panel that recommended a new War Powers Act. The current War Powers Resolution is ""ineffective, and it should be repealed and it should be replaced,"" James Baker said in a joint appearance with Warren Christopher, announcing the results of the study they led. The recommendation follows failed efforts by Democrats in Congress to put a stop to the war in Iraq or to put conditions on President Bush's conduct of it. Congress passed a joint resolution to authorize armed force against Iraq in 2002, but some Bush opponents say it should not have been interpreted as a blank check for the United States to invade and occupy the Persian Gulf nation. Baker, who served in George H.W. Bush's administration, and Christopher, who served under President Bill Clinton, said their project was not prompted by any specific war, with Christopher adding that the commission had ""tried very hard not to call balls and strikes on past history here."" ""We didn't direct this report at any particular conflict,"" Baker added. The existing law, the War Powers Resolution of 1973, has been regarded as unconstitutional by every president since it was passed as a response to the Vietnam War, Baker and Christopher said. It requires presidents to report regularly to Congress about ongoing conflicts, but the provision has been flouted. ""No president has ever made a submission to Congress pursuant to the War Powers Resolution since 1973,"" former Sen. Slade Gorton, a Republican member of the committee, said Tuesday. The panel, formally called the National War Powers Commission, said a new law should be created requiring the president to consult with key members of Congress before sending troops into combat expected to last more than a week, or within three days of doing so in the case of operations that need to be kept secret. It should also make clear exactly who the president needed to consult. The panel suggests that the president talk to ""a joint Congressional committee made up of the leaders of the House and the Senate as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees."" The new committee would have a permanent professional staff with access to intelligence information, Baker and Christopher said. Congress, in turn, would have to declare war or vote on a ""resolution of approval"" within 30 days, they said. If a resolution of approval failed, any member of Congress could introduce a ""resolution of disapproval,"" but it was not clear that such an act would stop a war in progress. Christopher was unable to say in the news conference what practical effect congressional disapproval would have. Baker said the commission had been in touch with the presidential campaigns of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain, as well as leaders of Congress. He declined to reveal what they thought of the proposal, but said: ""We haven't gotten a negative reaction."" Congress has not officially declared war since 1942, when the United States entered formal hostilities with the Axis powers in World War II. But since then, presidents have sent troops into countries including Korea, Vietnam, Grenada and Iraq. The Constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces, but gives Congress the power to declare war and approve military budgets. Baker and Christopher's group included both Republicans and Democrats and held seven meetings over 14 months.","War Powers Act is ""ineffective"" and should be repealed, blue-ribbon panel says .

The company is accused of knowingly shipping tainted products now linked to nearly 600 illnesses, including eight deaths, in 43 states. The recent outbreak has led to one of the largest food recalls in U.S. history, encompassing more than 1,000 products. The Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations launched a probe of the company on January 30.

"(CNN) -- The Northwest braced for blizzards Friday night while cities from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Boston, Massachusetts, were cleaning up after a major storm delayed air travel and created havoc on the ground. A commuter waits at a Detroit, Michigan, bus stop Friday morning. ""This is essentially the reincarnation of the same storm that brought the heavy snow to parts of California, southern Nevada and northern Arizona,"" Steve Corfidi, lead forecaster with the weather service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, told CNNRadio. Icy roads created from storms this week paralyzed much of the greater Seattle, Washington, area, where schools were closed and bus routes were suspended Friday as roads were too icy to navigate. Two charter buses carrying 80 people that collided and skidded off a road were pulled to safety, CNN affiliate KOMO reported. The buses crashed through a metal railing and hung precariously over Interstate 5 for several hours before tow trucks pulled them back on the road, KOMO reported. ""We hit it and everyone is in shock for a minute, and [the driver] says 'go to the back of the bus.' And people threw each other out the windows,"" passenger Tamera Vasquez told KOMO. Saturday was expected to bring heavy snows in Washington, damaging winds and power outages to a region still recovering from storms earlier in the week. Hurricane-force winds are possible in the eastern foothills of Snohomish, King and Pierce Counties. Further west, several inches of snow are possible in the greater Seattle-Tacoma-Everett metro area Saturday afternoon. Toward the Olympic Mountains, they could be measuring new snowfall in feet. Flights at most airports in the Midwest and Northeast were up and running after experiencing delays as long as three hours throughout the day. But storm warnings and watches remained in effect for most of region. Corfidi said the storm is expected to maintain intensity into Saturday, continuing east and ""spreading a swath of very heavy snow and freezing rain"" into Pennsylvania and New York. ""There could easily be up to a foot of snow over parts of Illinois, northern Indiana, perhaps into parts of Michigan and southern Wisconsin, eastward into parts of New York and Pennsylvania,"" Corfidi said. In Milwaukee, snowfall closed the airport for several hours and cut into local business hours for retail shops during the busiest shopping season of the year. Malls and shopping centers in Milwaukee, Glendale, Wauwatosa and Greendale opened later than usual, dealing another blow to retailers already struggling with a severe economic downturn. To compensate, some stores in the area, including Kohl's, Boston Store, J.C. Penney and Macy's are staying open until midnight on some days, the Journal-Sentinel Online reported. ""The snow has me concerned,"" Southridge Mall manager Mary Wenger told the newspaper. Another four to seven inches of snow is expected over the weekend. In New Hampshire, still reeling from an ice storm last week, crews worked feverishly to restore electricity service to more than 30,000 customers remaining in the dark, CNN affiliate WMUR-TV in Manchester reported. Southern New Hampshire could get 10 new inches of snow before midnight Friday, WMUR said. Elsewhere, police in Buffalo, New York, shut down the city's Skyway highway because of winds and snow, CNN affiliate WGRZ-TV reported. Western New York had several inches of snow on the ground by noon, the station reported. To the north in Ontario, Canada, southbound Highway 400 was shut down outside Toronto after an multivehicle accident in near whiteout conditions, CNN affiliate CTV reported. ""Lots of blowing snow. Visibility is next to nothing,"" CTV senior cameraman Tom Podolec reported from the scene. Ontario Provincial Police reported 70 accidents in less than five hours Friday morning. The system should move quickly, Corfidi said. It was not shaping up as an extraordinary event, he said. ""It is December, and winter storms certainly raise their ugly heads this time of year,"" Corfidi said.","NEW: Tow trucks pull two buses to safety after they skidded off road .

"(CNET.com) -- The HP Pavilion Media Center TV m8120n is proof positive that quad-core processing is ready for mass consumption. This $1,150 entertainment-minded desktop serves up Intel's Core 2 Quad Q6600 CPU, a quad-core chip that up to this point we've seen only in much higher-end systems meant for gaming. While HP's own Pavilion Slimline or Apple's Mac Mini might be better fits for most people looking for a PC to pair with their plasma, the m8120n is a great buy if you need a high-end PC that can do pretty much everything outside of gaming. This fixed-configuration retail PC serves up a host of audio and video connections, plenty of hard drive space, more memory than we were expecting, and integrated Wi-Fi -- all inside a functional and good-looking case. The result is a surprisingly powerful media PC; you won't find a better performer for less. Only its lack of a next-gen optical drive prevents a higher recommendation. We're also not thrilled with the amount of shovelware. Aside from its black exterior, the m8120n is similar in design to the Pavilion Media Center m7780n we reviewed at the start of the year (HP moved to its current Media Center chassis in the spring). We turned on the system and looked over the components, expecting to find a few incremental upgrades from the previous models. Instead, we were shocked to find not only a quad-core processor but also 3GB of fast 1,066MHz memory -- 1GB more than we anticipated. A quick scan of our quad-core reviews confirmed our suspicion: this is by far the cheapest quad-core PC we've reviewed. HP is able to keep the price down in large part by not going after gamers with this system (the preloaded trial offers -- shovelware -- also help subsidize the cost of the PC). Instead of putting money toward a powerful but pricey graphics card, HP uses a low-end Nvidia GeForce 7350LE TurboCache card. It borrows resources from the main system memory when it needs more than its 128MB of dedicated video RAM, but it's more than capable for everything but supplying suitable 3D framerates as our tests show. Beneath the graphics card is a TV tuner card that features an NTSC tuner, an over-the-air ATSC HD tuner, and an FM tuner. It allows you to connect it to your cable box or grab over-the-air channels via an HD antenna (which you'll need to supply yourself). The m8120n uses Vista Home Premium, which includes the Media Center shell. You can use it as your subscription-free DVR front-end to watch, pause, and record TV. It also lets you access other media files--photos, music, videos--via the included Media Center remote. A slick, slim wireless keyboard is also included, but it lacks a mouse control nub or ball, which means living-room use will require mousing on your thigh, the arm of the couch, or coffee table if it's something you can't control with the remote. A pair of 320GB hard drives provides ample storage out of the box, and you can add more via the Personal Media Drive bay on the front panel that can accept HP's external hard drives. The drives come in 160GB, 300GB, and 500GB capacities and require no wires to connect -- just slide them into the slot. They also feature a USB port should you need to connect them to another PC. Aside from that, there isn't much room for expansion. All four memory slots are occupied, as are both PCI slots. You can easily get rid of the modem card if you need a free PCI slot, however, and there is an available x1 PCI Express slot. Beneath the 15-in-1 media card reader conveniently located across the top of the front panel are two 5.25-inch drive bays. We were hoping HP's hybrid Blu-ray/HD DVD drive would occupy one of the two slots, but, alas, we discovered a LightScribe DVD burner that might have excited us two years ago. Then again, it's probably too much to ask for that hybrid drive at this price. The Pavilion Media Center m8120n is a fixed configuration retail model, but you can customize a similar model on HP's site. The hybrid drive adds $760 to the cost of the system plus a necessary yet reasonable $130 graphics upgrade. Alternatively, you can configure the online model with a $200 HD DVD-ROM drive if you want to watch next-gen discs but not write to them. By comparison, the hybrid drive writes to Blu-ray and only reads HD DVD. The lack of a next-gen optical drive is disappointing on this type of PC because it offers so much media-consuming goodness. In addition to the TV tuner, the Pavilion Media Center m8120n serves up useful AV ports on the front panel. Along with the usual FireWire, USB, headphone, and microphone connections, the system gives you composite and S-Video ports along with two RCA audio ports. The front panel ports make it a snap to connect a camcorder or other video device should you have the PC tucked into your home theater setup where getting to the back-panel ports may prove difficult. Back-panel ports of note include digital audio in and out. The integrated Wi-Fi also increases its living-room appeal because it lets you connect to the Internet without running Ethernet all over your house. And for such a powerful PC, the system is remarkably quiet. About its power. The advantages of a quad-core processor are obvious when you compare the results of the Pavilion Media Center m8120n with two dual-core systems, the $1,470 Gateway DX430X and the $1,499 Velocity Micro ProMagix E2035, on our Photoshop and Cinebench tests. The m8120n completed our Photoshop CS2 benchmark 7 percent faster than the Velocity Micro system and 19 percent faster than the Gateway. The difference in performance is far greater on our Cinebench test that taxes multiple CPUs; the m8120m enjoyed a huge 69 percent advantage over the Velocity Micro and a 75 percent lead over the Gateway. Our Multitasking test provides a good glimpse of overall application performance under a typical workload. The Pavilion Media Center m8120n's showing on this test is particularly impressive when you consider that it easily outpaces a Gateway PC that costs a few hundred more. While Dell's original XPS 710 cost nearly five times more than the m8210n when we reviewed it in November 2006, it's used here by comparison to show what the scores of an overclocked, high-end, quad-core gaming PC look like. Also note that the Dell XPS 710 was running Windows XP, which isn't nearly as demanding as Vista. HP backs the Pavilion Media Center m8120n with an industry-standard one-year part-and-labor hardware warranty (software support ends after 90 days). Toll-free phone support and live chat are available 24-7.

"(CNN) -- In tests for teacher Tom Farber's high school class, students can demonstrate their mastery of calculus and find out where to get braces or even a haircut. Calculus teacher Tom Farber is selling ad space on tests to defray printing costs. Squeezed by classroom budget cuts, the Rancho Bernardo High School teacher is selling ads on his exams to cover the costs of printing them. ""It raises money for the teachers and it's amusing for the kids, so it seems like a win-win,"" said Luke Shaw, 18, a student at the suburban San Diego, California, school. Parents and administrators also praise Farber, 47, for his creative classroom funding, but he doesn't want it to become the norm. ""My intention is, [selling ads] is a stopgap measure,"" said Farber. ""I don't want to be doing this year after year."" Instead, he says, government must do more to help educators provide what students need. Farber started letting parents and local businesses sponsor tests this fall after learning budget cuts would limit his in-school printing allowance -- tracked by the school's copy machines -- to $316 for the year. The cost of printing quizzes and tests for his 167 students will easily be more than $500, he said. That meant Farber, whose courses prepare students for the Advanced Placement exam, would have to give fewer or shorter tests, or find money. Farber, who says 90 percent of his students got a 5 -- the top score -- on AP exams last year, said skimping wasn't an option. ""It has to be a certain quality, or they won't be ready,"" he said. So Farber, who says he'd never asked for money from parents in his 18 years of high school teaching, pitched the ad idea to parents at a September back-to-school night. For checks made to the math department -- $10 a quiz, $20 a test or $30 for a final exam -- they could insert an inspirational quote -- their own or someone else's -- or a business advertisement at the bottom of the first page.  Watch how teacher came up with ad idea Â» . Of the seven to run so far -- one per test or quiz -- five were quotes, and two were ads from local businesses connected to the parents or someone close. ""Brace yourself for a great semester! Braces by Henry, Stephen P. Henry D.M.D.,"" read one of the ads in small type at the bottom of a quiz's first page. Farber said orders took off after recent media reports. He's collected more than $300, and he believes he'll top $1,000, with some ad buyers paying more than required. All amounts beyond his shortfall will cover colleagues' printing costs, he said. Farber said students and parents have gotten a kick out of the sponsorships. Student Scott Robison, 18, said: ""I liked it because all the teachers complain about budget cuts, and he did something about it. It hasn't hurt in any way."" Luke Shaw's father, Jay Shaw, said he wants to sponsor a test next semester. And while Jay Shaw praised Farber's idea, ""It's just sad it came to the point where he needs to do that,"" he said. Farber said he doesn't want quiz ads ""to become the standard."" ""What I'm doing now is ... dealing with the economic situation and making sure kids get what they need,"" Farber said. ""Teachers shouldn't have to scrounge for funding. To me, this is what our government is for, to provide necessities, and that's why we pay taxes."" But California's budget crisis has forced Farber's school district, Poway Unified, to cut costs, district Superintendent Don Phillips said. The California Federation of Teachers says the state cut more than $4 billion in education spending this year. Phillips said that when the district sought to chop $11 million from its $265 million annual budget, it wanted to keep teachers but cut other areas. Among the things to go was 30 percent to 40 percent of Poway schools' materials spending -- including copying. Phillips praised Farber's ad idea as creative. But he said district officials are weighing whether to set guidelines, especially for business ads. Farber said he'd prefer to keep ads to local ""mom-and-pop"" operations. He's accepting one from hair salon Fantastic Sam's, noting that although it's part of a chain, the store that's buying the ad is locally owned. Farber and Phillips said they don't know of any Poway teachers wanting to replicate the ad idea, but they said educators there have long spent out-of-pocket for supplies. Susan Carmon of the National Education Association said a 2003 study on the issue found U.S. teachers spent an average of $450 of their own money yearly for school resources. ""You can only imagine -- with tighter school budgets in almost every state this year -- that this number can only get higher,"" said Carmon, the NEA's associate director for teacher quality. Fred Glass, the California Federation of Teachers' communications director, said things could get worse for teachers in the state, with California considering $2.5 billion in mid-year education cuts. Glass said he hopes Farber's ad selling ""will underscore for disinterested observers that this [funding shortfall] can't go on."" Glass said he wouldn't like to see any classroom ads. ""The student needs not to be distracted by anything on the test. This is not instructionally sound,"" he said. But he said he doesn't blame Farber. ""This teacher shouldn't be put in this position,"" Glass said. To those who don't like his idea, Farber suggests asking legislators to better fund education or writing a check to a school. But he said most of the feedback has been positive. ""One person said, 'Too bad you're not a bank, because you might qualify for $700 billion,' "" he said. ""I thought that was pretty clever.""","California calculus teacher had budget for classroom supplies cut .

"(CNN) -- From cyberspace to college campuses, many young conservatives are worried that Sen. John McCain is not appealing to their generation. Sen. John McCain says he knows how important young voters are. At a town hall meeting in Ohio this month, a student told McCain that Republicans were a dying breed on his campus. ""I understand the challenge I have, and I understand that this election is really all about the people of your generation,"" McCain said. Many young Republicans said Sen. Barack Obama, the 46-year-old junior senator from Illinois, is inspiring voters their age, but McCain, the 71-year-old Arizona senator who has been in office since the early '80s, is not. Eric Perlmutter, a Republican and student at the at the University of Southern California, said the roaring enthusiasm that follows Obama is missing among conservatives his age. ""We try to get people out to our college Republican meetings, but ... we can't seem to draw the same kind of vocal support,"" he said. At the July town hall meeting in Portsmouth, Ohio, McCain said he knows that he has ""a lot of work to do"" with the younger voters. The senator said he needs young conservatives to help spread his message for him, because ""there's nothing that convinces young people like other young people."" McCain also acknowledged the importance of using the Internet to reach out to a generation that stays in touch via social networking sites. On MySpace, Obama has more than 427,000 friends, compared with fewer than 60,000 for McCain. Perlmutter said he cringed when McCain admitted he doesn't use e-mail. Obama, however, is frequently seen with Blackberry in hand. Additionally, Perlmutter pointed out that the images used in McCain's campaign -- such as a message about small businesses showing a barber shop with a traditional red and blue pole -- hardly connect to the younger generation. ""Well, when you see the Main Street barber shop image, you think of 1950s America. An entrepreneur, a Silicon Valley guy would definitely make him more attractive,"" he said. Obama also has increased his college-age appeal by holding rallies and giving speeches at hundreds of campuses. McCain has said he recognizes that he needs to get out to those venues ""where young people are engaged and receiving their information and forming their opinions."" ""Sen. McCain should demand that these same colleges and universities host him or else their tax-exempt status could be in jeopardy,"" said Jason Mattera, spokesman for Young America's Foundation, a conservative outreach group. McCain must work to connect young voters to conservative principles, Mattera said. ""So if they are suspicious of Uncle Sam telling them what Internet sites they can view, they should be equally suspicious of the federal government telling them what health care plan they are going to be a part of,"" he said. According to a Pew Research Center study conducted between October and March, McCain has a big numbers gap to close. The study found that the current generation of young voters, those who came of age during the President Bush years, are giving the Democrats a wide edge. Fifty-eight percent of voters under 30 identified or leaned toward the Democratic Party, compared with 33 percent who said they identified or leaned toward the Republican Party. The McCain campaign said it plans to increase the senator's presence on sites such as Facebook and MySpace in addition to the candidate making appearance on shows that appeal to younger viewers, such as ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,"" ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" and the ""Late Show with David Letterman."" In past elections, both parties have tended to put less focus on younger voters because historically, their turnout has been low. With fewer than four months until the November election, McCain said he's confident he can convince young voters that he is the candidate for them. ""I believe that I can convince them that I have the plan of action and the ideals and the goals and the inspiration that, as next president of the United States, I can serve better their interests than my opponent,"" he said.","Young GOP voters say enthusiasm for Sen.

"(CNET) -- Microsoft has applied for a patent on metered, pay-as-you-go computing. Under a Microsoft proposal, consumers would receive heavily discounted PCs, then pay fees for usage. U.S. patent application number 20080319910, published on Christmas Day, details Microsoft's vision of a situation where a ""standard model"" of PC is given away or heavily subsidized by someone in the supply chain. The end user then pays to use the computer, with charges based on both the length of usage time and the performance levels utilized, along with a ""one-time charge."" Microsoft notes in the application that the end user could end up paying more for the computer, compared with the one-off cost entailed in the existing PC business model, but argues the user would benefit by having a PC with an extended ""useful life."" ""A computer with scalable performance level components and selectable software and service options has a user interface that allows individual performance levels to be selected,"" reads the patent application's abstract. The patent application was filed June 21, 2007. ""The scalable performance level components may include a processor, memory, graphics controller, etc. Software and services may include word processing, email, browsing, database access, etc. To support a pay-per-use business model, each selectable item may have a cost associated with it, allowing a user to pay for the services actually selected and that presumably correspond to the task or tasks being performed,"" the abstract continues. Integral to Microsoft's vision is a security module, embedded in the PC, that would effectively lock the PC to a certain supplier. ""The metering agents and specific elements of the security module...allow an underwriter in the supply chain to confidently supply a computer at little or no upfront cost to a user or business, aware that their investment is protected and that the scalable performance capabilities generate revenue commensurate with actual performance level settings and usage,"" the application reads. 'A more granular approach' According to the application, the issue with the existing PC business model is that it ""requires more or less a one chance at the consumer kind of mentality, where elasticity curves are based on the pressure to maximize profits on a one-time-sale, one-shot-at-the-consumer mentality."" Microsoft's proposed model, on the other hand, could ""allow a more granular approach to hardware and software sales,"" the application states, adding that the user ""may be able to select a level of performance related to processor, memory, graphics power, etc that is driven not by a lifetime maximum requirement but rather by the need of the moment."" ""When the need is browsing, a low level of performance may be used and, when network-based interactive gaming is the need of the moment, the highest available performance may be made available to the user,"" the document reads. ""Because the user only pays for the performance level of the moment, the user may see no reason to not acquire a device with a high degree of functionality, in terms of both hardware and software, and experiment with a usage level that suits different performance requirements."" By way of example, the application posits a situation involving three ""bundles"" of applications and performance: office, gaming, and browsing. ""The office bundle may include word-processing and spreadsheet applications, medium graphics performance and two of three processor cores,"" the document reads. ""The gaming bundle may include no productivity applications but may include 3D graphics support and three of three processor cores. The browsing bundle may include no productivity applications, medium graphics performance and high-speed network interface."" ""Charging for the various bundles may be by bundle and by duration. For example, the office bundle may be $1.00 [68 pence] per hour, the gaming bundle may be $1.25 per hour and the browsing bundle may be $0.80 per hour. The usage charges may be abstracted to 'units/hour' to make currency conversions simpler. Alternatively, a bundle may incur a one-time charge that is operable until changed or for a fixed-usage period,"" the document reads. Microsoft's patent application does acknowledge that a per-use model of computing would probably increase the cost of ownership over the PC's lifetime. The company argues in its application, however, that ""the payments can be deferred and the user can extend the useful life of the computer beyond that of the one-time purchase machine."" The document suggests that ""both users and suppliers benefit from this new business model"" because ""the user is able to migrate the performance level of the computer as needs change over time, while the supplier can develop a revenue stream business that may actually have higher value than the one-time purchase model currently practiced."" ""Rather than suffering through less-than-adequate performance for a significant portion of the life of a computer, a user can increase performance level over time, at a slight premium of payments,"" the application reads. ""When the performance level finally reaches its maximum and still better performance is required, then the user may upgrade to a new computer, running at a relatively low performance level, probably with little or no change in the cost of use.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- The man who police say dressed as Santa Claus and killed nine people at a Christmas Eve party lived with guilt from an incident that left his son from a previous relationship a paraplegic, according to an attorney who once represented the woman in that relationship. Bruce Jeffrey Pardo went on a shooting rampage in a Los Angeles suburb on Wednesday, police say. Prime suspect Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, who police said committed suicide hours after he went on a shooting rampage and started a raging house fire in the Los Angeles suburb of Covina, had a son who sustained severe brain damage several years ago in an apparent swimming pool accident while he was in Pardo's care, according to attorney Jeffrey Alvirez. Police have said Pardo targeted his rampage at his former wife, Sylvia Ortega Pardo, and her family at the family's Christmas Eve party. The Los Angeles Times reported that Pardo had kept his son's existence and condition a secret from his wife. When she found out, her anger over the situation and also finding out that Pardo had claimed the child as a tax dependent for several years became a major factor in divorce proceedings, the paper said, quoting an unidentified source close to the investigation. Covina Police Chief Kim Raney said Friday that a divorce between the two was finalized in court December 18 in a ""somewhat contentious proceeding."" On Saturday, Covina police released the names of the nine people unaccounted for since the shooting and fire. Nine bodies were recovered from the rubble of the house, but authorities said they are having to work with dental records to establish identities. ""The bodies were so badly burned they cannot be identified any other way,"" Covina police Lt. Pat Buchanan said. The nine unaccounted for are Sylvia Pardo, her parents, her sister, her two brothers, both brothers' wives and a nephew. Ages of the nine range from 17 to 80, police said. Police said Sunday a car believed to have been rented by Pardo on December 19, a gray Toyota RAV4, was found in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale. Authorities had cautioned the missing car might be booby-trapped or contain explosives, but it was unclear whether any had been found. Another rented car that Pardo used to flee the scene was found booby-trapped after the shooting, police said. That car burned as the Covina bomb squad was trying to disconnect an explosive device in it, police said. In an interview Saturday with CNN, Alvirez -- who represented Pardo's former girlfriend Elena Lucano in a child support case against Pardo -- said that Pardo and Lucano were in an ""off-and-on again relationship"" in 2001 and that Pardo was watching their 13-month-old son, Matthew, one Saturday while Lucano went grocery shopping. When Lucano returned a short time later, she found Pardo frantically holding the unconscious toddler, Alvirez said. ""The child did get away from him for a few minutes and managed to crawl out of a patio door and slip into the pool,"" Alvirez said. The couple rushed the child to a nearby hospital, where paramedics resuscitated him. Later, the gravely traumatized child was airlifted to Children's Hospital in Los Angeles, a world-renowned trauma center that specializes in severe pediatric care, for specialized treatment, Alvirez said. During the first week in the intensive care unit, Pardo never left his son's bedside, Alvirez said. But a few weeks after the child was stabilized, doctors concluded that severe brain damage would confine him to a wheelchair for life, Alvirez said. Less than six months later, Pardo and Lucano ended their relationship, and Pardo stopped visiting his son. Pardo also neglected to contribute to Matthew's medical costs, which surged up to $340,000 within the first year, Alvirez said. ""We had to sue [Pardo] on his $100,000 homeowner's insurance policy, and I recommended that Elena sue Bruce beyond the policy,"" he said. ""She was not a vindictive type, and she knew he was living with overwhelming guilt and wanted to only pursue his policy."" Alvirez said he never had any problems with Pardo and was able to collect the $100,000 policy to pay off medical bills and set up a special needs trust of $240 per month for the rest of Matthew's life. The boy is now 9 years old, Alvirez said. ""Once the settlement was reached in August 2002, Bruce stopped communicating completely and never saw Matthew or Elena again,"" Alvirez said. He said Lucano had maintained occasional contact with Pardo's mother over the years but she was unaware that Pardo had remarried and never anticipated the violent path that ended his life and left nine other people dead. ""She is overwhelmed by all of this, but Elena has managed to provide for Matthew as a single parent with a part-time nurse and a full-time job,"" Alvirez said. Lucano declined to be interviewed by CNN, Alvirez said.","Bruce Pardo's son from previous relationship was brain damaged, attorney says .

"(CNN) -- An internationally renowned paleontologist will plead guilty to stealing dinosaur bones from federal land, his attorneys said in a court filing. Paleontologist Nate Murphy is expected to plead guilty to stealing fossils from federal land. Nate Murphy, whose famous finds include Leonardo, one of the best-preserved dinosaurs in the world, will make that plea in federal court in Billings, Montana. Earlier this month, Murphy pleaded guilty to state charges of stealing a fossil from private land in order to sell it. An expert cited in that case said Murphy's find was worth between $150,000 and $400,000. The self-taught dinosaur expert, who is director of vertebrate paleontology at the Judith River Dinosaur Institute, could face jail time. Murphy and his attorney did not immediately respond to phone messages Friday from CNN. Jessica Fehr, lead prosecutor in the case, said the U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment until after the plea is entered. In court papers, federal prosecutors say Murphy knowingly took fossils from federal property between about August 2006 and August 2007. The ""paleontological resources"" were said to be worth at least $1,000. In the state case, Murphy pleaded guilty to a felony charge of theft. As part of the plea, the state recommended Murphy's sentence be deferred for five years. Douglas Erwin, president of The Paleontological Society and curator of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, said ""theft of fossils from pubic lands has long been a problem."" In a written statement sent to CNN on Friday, he said such thefts ""can often result in the loss of important scientific information and the disappearance of specimens that belong to the public. ""At the same time, however, fossil collecting, particularly of common invertebrate fossils, has been a pastime enjoyed by many for decades, and is an important way of connecting people with their natural heritage."" An omnibus public lands bill, which the U.S. Senate passed Thursday, includes penalties for fossil theft from public land.","Attorney says well-known paleontologist will plead guilty to stealing dinosaur bones .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe published a draft constitutional amendment in the government gazette Saturday, paving the way for the power-sharing agreement reached after violence disrupted this year's presidential election. President Robert Mugabe, left, and opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai signed the deal in July. Constitutional Amendment 19 details the posts and institutions that were created by the power-sharing deal, including the position of prime minister intended for Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change. The publication of the draft is the first step in creating a law in Zimbabwe. For the law to pass, it must be appear before parliament in 30 days, according to the country's constitution. If it is approved, it will be sent to Mugabe for his signature. The deal arose after Tsvangirai withdrew from a June 27 runoff days before the vote, saying Mugabe's supporters had waged a campaign of violence and intimidation against opposition supporters. The two leaders signed the initial agreement, brokered by former South African President Thabo Mbeki, in July but have failed to agree on how to form a cabinet. The MDC, the main opposition party, noted that Mugabe's latest move does not legalize the amendment. ""Gazetting the bill -- which was done by [Mugabe's party] Zanu-PF -- does not automatically translate into passing it into law,"" MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said. ""That can only take place if outstanding issues have been addressed. Otherwise we will not support the bill."" The two parties agreed last month to the draft amendment during talks in South Africa, but Chamisa warned then that problems remained. ""We have differed with Zanu-PF for a long time while the citizens suffer, but fortunately we have agreed on something. I need to hasten to mention that we still have some outstanding issues, such as the cabinet, appointment of diplomats,"" he said in late November. Zanu-PF lost its majority in the parliament in the March elections. As no party has the two-thirds majority to pass the law, its passage relies on MDC support. If parliament does not approve the amendment, Mugabe may call for new elections, Zimbabwe Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa told state-run daily newspaper The Herald. ""I envisage that it will require two weeks for it to be debated and passed through both Houses. If no support is forthcoming, it means that Amendment Number 19 Bill will be dead matter,"" Chinamasa is quoted as saying The Herald. ""In the event that the collaboration that we envisage is not forthcoming, then that will necessitate fresh harmonized elections at some point in time,"" he said, according to The Herald. Tsvangirai won the most votes in the March election, but not enough to avoid a runoff, according to the government's official count. South African President Kgalema Motlanthe, chairman of the Southern African Development Community, welcomed the draft. ""The gazetting of Amendment 19 of the Zimbabwean Constitution is indeed a major step towards the formation of an inclusive government in Zimbabwe,"" he said in a written statement. ""We urge the Zimbabwean political parties to establish an inclusive government."" Meanwhile, the country is battling a cholera outbreak that has killed nearly 800 people since August, according to the World Health Organization. More than 16,000 people have been infected, WHO said. This week, Mugabe declared that ""there is no cholera in the country."" His spokesman later said Mugabe was sarcastically ridiculing what he believes are Western designs to invade the country. Another Zimbabwean official, Information Minister Sikhanyiso Ndlovu, said Friday that the disease was a ""calculated, racist attack on Zimbabwe by the unrepentant former colonial power, which has enlisted support from its American and Western allies so that they can invade the country."" Britain ruled the country as a colony until 1965. Ndlovu's claims triggered quick and pointed reaction from Britain and the United States. In Washington, State Department spokesman Rob McInturff called Ndlovu's accusations ""patently ridiculous.""","Amendment paves way for power-sharing deal after violence disturbed election .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The Screening Room went to the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in the heart of London's West End, where a spectacular musical version of ""The Lord of The Rings"" is enjoying a successful run, to meet Indian composer A. R. Rahman, whose blend of Asian culture with rock and Western classical styles has revolutionized the Indian film industry. And now Rahman is about to make his mark in Hollywood. A. R. Rahman, interviewed by CNN's Screening Room . Virtually unknown in Europe and the U.S., Rahman has sold 200 million albums worldwide -- more than the Beatles -- and is worshipped throughout much of Asia, where he's known as the Mozart of Madras. Now he has added a Hollywood film score to his vast repertoire of movie music. Rahman explained to CNN what he thinks makes great movie music. ""A great soundtrack is like 'Laura""s theme', the 'Love Story' theme, 'Chariots of Fire' and all those sorts of things, where it stood by itself,"" he said. But recently, he's noticed a changing mood. ""Now it is becoming too abstract and more ambient and more... I don't know, soundscape-ish, more than melody. People are afraid of melody: 'Oh, that melody is distracting my scene,' it is becoming like that."" And that brings fresh challenges for the makers of film music. ""Now the challenges of the composer are much more,"" he told CNN. ""One needs to know of recording, production, it is not enough to compose a great theme and [know] how it can intertwine with the movie. And with Indian film it is an even greater challenge, because we need to be like Michael Jackson, John Williams, Hans Zimmer and an Indian folk composer all put together. So they expect finesse and they expect versatility."" Rahman's compositions are versatile enough to be used by both Bollywood and Hollywood, a case in point being his music for the Hindi film ""Dil Se,"" which was used almost a decade later by Spike Lee for ""Inside Man."" But for Rahman, the process to create film music is being challenged by increasingly crammed movie schedules. ""There used to be a time where the director and the composer would work together,"" he explained. ""They would develop themes and the director would shoot a scene, but now the world's so fast that people are finishing the movie even before going to a composer."" As well as writing songs and scores, Rahman has featured in many Bollywood films singing the songs which are mimed by the acting superstars. He recently completed a sell-out tour of the U.S. performing highlights from his songbook to devoted fans. He explained to CNN how playback singing is a normal part of Indian film music. ""Well, until I worked in 'Bombay Dreams' six or seven years back, I never realized that it is not cool to have playback singing. Until then, it was the story of Indian films where somebody else lip synchs and somebody else sings."" And Rahman has been converted to the Western model, where those singing on-screen usually provide the vocals themselves. ""In my future projects I would rather have a star who sings,"" he said. Director Shekhar Kapur recruited Rahman and fellow composer Craig Armstrong to provide the score for Cate Blanchett's sequel to ""Elizabeth,"" ""The Golden Age,"" which premieres at Toronto Film Festival in September this year. Kapur described the thrill of working with two such different -- and complementary -- composers. He told CNN, ""Here are two totally different cultures. Craig Armstrong is strings and heart, the skies, choir, angels and devils, and A. r. is modern, restless music."" ""Just to get them together was very interesting for me. To sit there and see both of them jamming together, that was fascinating. They wouldn't talk, they would jam, and out of the jamming came the music. It was great."" Rahman is still getting used to his new-found status as darling of both East and West -- and it leads to a somewhat chaotic lifestyle, as he explained. ""It is terrifying sometimes. I suddenly wake up in Scotland doing music for 'Golden Age,' and suddenly wake up doing an Indian superstar film, but I think after all these years I am probably getting a balance.""

"(CNN) -- For a little while, it looks like ""Up,"" Pixar's 10th feature-length film, is going to be a downer. In ""Up,"" a curmudgeonly senior citizen, Carl, tries to cope with the enthusiasm of Russell, a young boy. Not that there's anything wrong with an animated film tugging at our tear ducts. But you can sense unease rippling through the younger halves of the family audience when, about five minutes into a spunky prologue, intrepid pre-pubescents Carl and Ellie abruptly morph into newlyweds, and then not-so-newlyweds. They gray and stoop before our eyes, youthful dreams of exploration traded in for the comforts of home and domestic bliss. Ellie wants a baby but can't have one. Their savings for the holiday of a lifetime are eaten up by this rainy day, that domestic disaster, until there's no more lifetime left -- not for Ellie, anyway. That leaves us with Carl, a grumpy homebody voiced by Ed Asner, who makes WALL-E look like a chatterbox. And he's one of the main characters. No, I didn't hear anyone demanding when the dancing penguins were going to show up, but I'll wager someone was thinking it.  Watch a preview of ""Up"" Â» . Such misgivings are ill-founded. As far as razzmatazz goes, ""Up"" delivers the goods. Not penguins, precisely, but more than the airborne house promised by the commercials. There's a mythical multicolored bird, which may or may not be a snipe, but which answers to the name of Kevin and exhibits a sweet taste for candy bars. There are zeppelins and old-time explorers and talking dogs -- a whole pack of dogs, in fact. Dogs that serve wine and play cards and fly biplanes. And there's Russell, a chubby Boy Scout -- or ""Wilderness Explorer"" -- who turns up on Carl's doorstep when he least expects it. After all, Carl wants to be free, and to get there, he launches his house into the sky thanks to thousands of balloons. How was he to know Russell was around? ""Up"" doesn't always fly high. The dogs' canine high jinks are closer to ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" than we'd expect from Pixar, which tends not to play so fast and loose with the laws of nature for the sake of a few cheap laughs. But if the muttering mutts keep the kids happy, well and good. The movie is on surer ground teasing out the relationship between Carl and Russell, floating well above the Earth.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- They've been teasing and tantalizing female readers with images of muscular men oozing sensuality and the pretty women they are destined to save and then fall in love with. The ""beefcakes and bodices"" book covers have helped Harlequin sell their romance novels for more than half a century. Powerful men and demure women were stock in trade in early Harlequin novels. ""It's always great to feel like you're the girl in the book and the handsome guy is coming to rescue you,"" said Liz Lenz, 25, who has been reading Harlequin novels since she was a teen. ""It's always fun for the reader."" Those covers also seduced Winnipeg, Canada, teacher Louann Bergen. ""There's usually good-looking males on the covers or something intriguing to make you want to read more,"" she said. ""I guess they change with the times, but they still have that same allure and that same passion behind them."" As sort of a 60th anniversary gift to its faithful readers, Harlequin is displaying original artwork for its covers in an New York exhibit called ""The Heart of a Woman: Harlequin Cover Art 1949-2009."" And before you sniff disdainfully at romance novel art, be reminded: That artwork sells a lot of books. Romance fiction is responsible for $1.375 billion in book sales every year, according to Romance Writers of America. The organization says more than a quarter of all books sold are romance novels, satisfying 51 million readers every year. The Harlequin exhibit comes from boxes and boxes of old novels that employees discovered at the company's headquarters in Toronto, Canada. ""I pawed through literally thousands of paintings,"" curator Elizabeth Semmelhack said, adding that she saw apparent shifts in women's historical desires began to emerge.  Watch the curator discuss some favorites Â» . ""Rather than being retardataire [outdated], many of these images are extremely cutting edge,"" she said. ""There are images of women doctors before women were really embraced by the workplace. There are women who are adventuring around the world before independence is really part of women's culture."" Many early Harlequin covers, like that of Elizabeth Houghton's ""Island Hospital,"" in which a man, woman and grizzly bear stand poised in confrontation, depict more than one (fully clothed) character in the crux of a suspenseful moment. ""You don't know, is the couple going to get together? Is the hero going to save the heroine? The happy ending is not on the cover,"" Semmelhack explained. The illustrations have changed their tone over the years. Where cover art used to hint at psychological intrigue, it's grown to instead promise a passionate physical conclusion. ""From the earliest covers, there's sort of an implied sexual tension, but there isn't much direct imaging of passion. That doesn't happen until the late '70s and into the '80s,"" she said. ""By the time you hit the sexual revolution and passion becomes of primary importance on these covers, then that lover's embrace in many ways signals the happy ending right there on the front of the book."" And in recent decades, the once revolutionary depictions of the lovers' raw embrace have been reduced further. ""Today, covers might just be the undressed male body. He might even be headless. He's so truncated that all you're doing is looking at the object of desire, his masculinity."" Although Harlequin romances are predominantly written for and read by women, according to Semmelhack, the majority of the publisher's cover illustration artists have been male. ""It is interesting that you have men imaging female desire,"" she said. ""It seems to work; the books certainly sell."" This year, Harlequin books, which publishes 1,200 new titles annually, reported first quarter earnings up more than 13 percent. Debbie Macomber, who has published 153 books since 1983 -- and is most recently author of a May New York Times Harlequin best-seller, ""Summer on Blossom Street."" -- visited the ""Heart of a Woman"" exhibit on opening night. ""There were some that really made me laugh out loud,"" Macomber said. ""It was amazing to see the role and the progression of the women's movement in the cover art itself. I get letters from 13-year-old girls and women who are in their 90s, and that's one of my goals as a writer: to write books that are relevant to my readers.""","Decades of busting bodices, bulging biceps, intrigue and glamour in exhibition .

"CORAL SPRINGS, Florida (CNN) -- Authorities solved a 31-year-old disappearance this year when they found the remains of Jeff Klee, missing since 1977, in a van in a canal. Jeff Klee had been missing since 1977; his remains were found this year. But prosecutors have announced that no charges would be filed against the man who, authorities say, admits that he put Klee's body in the van three decades earlier. ""Today is a sad day for our family,"" Klee's sister, Laurel Steele, told reporters Thursday. ""It tests my family's faith to its very core."" Klee's remains were found in March during a routine police sweep for stolen vehicles in the C-14 canal in Coral Springs, Florida. The van was in neutral when police discovered it. DNA confirmed Klee's identity, but authorities say there was not enough evidence to determine how he died -- and whether he had been killed.  Watch Klee's sister react to the decision Â» . The Broward County State Attorney's Office said the statute of limitations on possible manslaughter charges expired in 1980. As for a more serious charge such as first-degree murder to which a statute of limitations would not apply, prosecutors said they don't have any evidence of premeditation or that the death was caused by a criminal act. Police had long thought Klee's best friend, David Cusanelli, was the last person to see him alive June 21, 1977. According to a memorandum released Thursday by the Broward County State Attorney's Office, Cusanelli told authorities this July 28 that he put Klee's body inside his black Chevy van after he was dead and that his brother, Carl Cusanelli, helped shove the van into the canal. But Cusanelli denied involvement in Klee's death, prosecutors said. Mitch Polay, the defense attorney for the Cusanelli brothers, reiterated that denial. He said the brothers' statements ""were taken out of context, and they were posed as hypotheticals to drum up potential memories of the event."" ""My clients, for 31 years, have denied any involvement,"" Polay told CNN. ""They had no involvement with pushing any van into the water, nor did they have any involvement with the death of Jeff Klee."" According to the prosecution memorandum, Cusanelli told police that he and Klee had an argument over a former girlfriend. Cusanelli said Klee began to chase him out at the canal that night, the document alleges. Cusanelli said that ""all he remembers is, he turned around and saw that Jeff had fallen and was on the ground, and his head was split open, and there was a lot of blood,"" according to the document. ""There was definitely a confrontation that night, which resulted in Jeff Klee's death,"" lead Detective David Weissman said Thursday. Cusanelli told police that he ran away from Klee because he was in fear of his life and that he has no idea how Klee fell. Cusanelli concedes that he may have thrown a rock at Klee, according to the prosecution memo. Cusanelli, according to the memo, said he panicked and put Klee's body inside his van. He then called his brother Carl, who helped push the vehicle into the canal, the memo alleges. In the state attorney's memorandum, Cusanelli said Klee was bleeding from a serious head wound and was not breathing. He told authorities he would never have put Klee's body into the van and rolled it into the canal if Klee wasn't dead, the memo says. Carl Cusanelli told police he helped push the van into the canal, the memo says, but denied any knowledge that Klee may have been in the van at the time. David Cusanelli also told police that he thinks he blocked the whole incident from his memory and that only recently did some details begin to materialize, according to the prosecution memo. ""It's turned their worlds upside down. They are very upset,"" said Polay, the defense attorney. ""Thirty-one years ago, David was best friends with Jeff Klee."" Coral Springs Police Chief Duncan Foster expressed frustration that no charges are being brought. ""Jeff Klee was a loved member of someone's family, and that has no time limits,"" Foster said. ""It's just very, very frustrating for us."" Steele, Klee's sister, said, ""Victimized by the loss of Jeff so many years ago, we are victimized once again."" Klee's mother, Florence Klee, clutched a framed photo of her son but did not speak during Thursday's news conference. Klee's father died about two years ago. Authorities said the case remains open. The family and the police are asking for the public to help them find any possible evidence of what happened that summer night in 1977 at the canal. ""Justice has been denied,"" Steele said.","Prosecutors say they won't pursue charges in death of man from 1977 .

"(CNN) -- Reclusive author J.D. Salinger has emerged, at least in the pages of court documents, to try to stop a novel that presents Holden Caulfield, the disaffected teen hero of his classic ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" as an old man. J.D. Salinger has stayed out of the public eye for most of the past half century. Lawyers for Salinger filed suit in federal court this week to stop the publication, sale and advertisement of ""60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye,"" a novel written by an author calling himself J.D. California and published by a Swedish company that advertises joke books and a ""sexual dictionary"" on its Web site. ""The Sequel infringes Salinger's copyright rights in both his novel and the character Holden Caulfield, who is the narrator and essence of that novel,"" said the suit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court in New York. Published in 1951, ""The Catcher in the Rye"" is an iconic take on teen alienation that is consistently listed among the greatest English-language novels ever written. Salinger, 90, who has famously lived the life of a recluse in New Hampshire for most of the past half-century, last published in 1965. With the exception of a 1949 movie based on one of his early short stories, he has never authorized adaptations of any of his work, even turning down an overture from director Steven Spielberg to make ""Catcher"" into a movie. ""There's no more to Holden Caulfield. Read the book again. It's all there,"" the court filing quotes Salinger as saying in 1980. ""Holden Caulfield is only a frozen moment in time."" The filing refers to the new book's author as ""John Doe,"" saying that the name John David California probably is made up. The first-time novelist's biography on Amazon.com says California is the son of a Swedish mother and American father who was named after the state where he was born. It claims he is a former gravedigger and triathlete who found a copy of Salinger's novel ""in an abandoned cabin in rural Cambodia"" and that it helped him survive ""the most maniacal of tropical fevers and chronic isolation."" The Web site's description of the book is written in the same choppy, first-person stream of consciousness that Salinger employs as Holden wanders the streets of New York. It describes a character, ""Mr. C,"" who flees his nursing home and ""embarks on a curious journey through the streets of New York."" The lawsuit names Swedish publisher Nicotext; its offshoot, Windupbird Publishing Ltd.; and California-based SCB Distributors as defendants. The Web site for Nicotext advertises such books as ""The Macho Man's (Bad) Joke Book"" and ""Give It To Me Baby,"" which it describes as an erotic ""flick book."" Marcia Paul, Salinger's New York-based attorney, declined to speak on the record, citing her client's private nature. E-mail messages to Nicotext were not returned Wednesday. Aaron Silverman, president of SCB Distributors, said the people behind the new book plan to defend it against the lawsuit. ""We believe we have the right to distribute this book and the publishers believe they have the right to publish it,"" he said. Silverman, whose company distributes books by about 150 publishers, called ""60 Years Later"" a work of ""social science fiction,"" saying that California doesn't plagiarize, but sets a well-known character in an alternate place and time -- as literature has done for centuries. ""It's amazing,"" he said of the book. ""If it was something else, or it felt like a knock-off or whatever, I would have told the publisher we wouldn't do it. But it's really just amazing."" Despite his cloistered lifestyle, Salinger nods to the contemporary marketplace in the lawsuit, noting that, as of last week, "" 'The Catcher in the Rye' currently sells more copies on Amazon.com than 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' 'The DaVinci Code,' 'To Kill a Mockingbird' or 'Of Mice and Men.' "" A hearing in the case is expected Monday. Salinger's lawyers will ask a judge to freeze publication of the book until a final ruling is made. The book is already available in Europe and the United Kingdom, and is scheduled to be released in the United States in September. The lawsuit asks that sales be halted and that books already distributed be recalled and destroyed. The argument is reminiscent of the legal tussle over the 2001 novel ""The Wind Done Gone,"" a parody of Margaret Mitchell's ""Gone With the Wind"" told from the perspective of a slave. Mitchell's estate argued that the book, by novelist Alice Randall, infringed upon her copyright. But the 11th District U.S. Court of Appeals ruled in Randall's favor, saying the book was protected as a parody of a well-known work. Salinger's lawyers say ""60 Years Later"" deserves no such protection. ""The sequel is not a parody and it does not comment upon or criticize the original,"" the lawsuit argues. ""It is a rip-off pure and simple.""","Lawsuit seeks halt to ""60 Years Later: Coming Through the Rye""

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- The mysterious disappearance of Flight AF 447 over the Atlantic Ocean has fueled speculation among aviation experts about what caused the state-of-the-art airliner to come down. An airliner is struck by lightning strike at Washington's Dulles airport last year. According to Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon, the Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence about 02:15 a.m. local time Monday (10:15 p.m. ET Sunday), three hours after the jet carrying 228 people left Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, for Paris, France. At that point, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating ""several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down."" The jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said. Its last known contact occurred at 02:33 a.m., the Brazilian air force spokesman added. The assumption is that these electrical problems led to a catastrophic failure of the aircraft's controls.  What brought Flight AF 447 down? Â» . Some experts have said that a lightning strike was a possibility, particularly since the plane disappeared in a storm-prone area along the equator known as the Intertropical Convergence zone (ITCZ). This is where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres converge. The intense sun and warm water of the equator heats the air in the ITCZ, raising its humidity and making it buoyant. Aided by the convergence of the trade winds, the buoyant air rises, releasing the accumulated moisture in an almost constant series of thunderstorms.  The airliner's route Â» . According to CNN's Mari Ramos, these storms can reach altitudes of 52,000 ft -- way beyond the capacity of commercial airliners to fly over.  Watch more about the weather systems Â» . Retired airline pilot John Cox told CNN that modern aircraft receive a constant stream of real time weather data which allows them to plot a course around storms. ""Because safety is the paramount concern, airliners don't fly into storms. They fly around them,"" he said. ""The ITCZ is no different. Planes fly through it every day. ""At 8 miles per minute, modern jets can easily fly around storms. Even if they encounter turbulence, they're designed to absorb it."" When lightning strikes a plane, the bolt typically hits a sharp part of it, such as a wing tip. Huge amounts of energy surge through the aircraft before exiting out of another sharp point, such as the tail. But sometimes high voltages can cause electrical damage if components are not well-grounded. Unlike other aircraft where the pilot's controls are manually attached to the flaps and rudders, Airbus 330 airliners are equipped with a ""fly by wire"" system that sends electronic signals from an onboard computer to move key control surfaces. Experts say that it is possible for this system and its back-up computers to be disabled by lightning. ""If you have a massive electrical problem it's possible that you could cut off all the commands out to the control surfaces,"" said aeronautics expert John Hansman. However, Kieran Daly, from the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence, told CNN that this scenario, while not impossible, is inconceivable. ""It's more likely that lightning would cause a fire or punch a hole through the aircraft structure,"" he said. ""It could be significant that the jet reported a loss of pressure."" He added that the aircraft would be able to continue without the fly-by-wire system. The ""trim tab,"" which enables the pilot to manually manipulate controls such as the rudder, would allow the crew to fly the aircraft safely. ""Pilots are routinely trained for these kinds of events in a simulator,"" he said. Former Airbus pilot John Wiley said on average every airliner is hit by a strike once a year. ""They don't go down,"" he said. According to Air France, the captain of Flight AF 447 had a record of 11,000 flight hours and had already flown 1,700 hours on Airbus A330/A340 aircraft. Of the two first officers, one had flown 3,000 flight hours (800 of which on the Airbus A330/A340) and the other 6,600 (2,600 on the Airbus A330/A340). The aircraft had totaled 18,870 flight hours and went into service on 18 April 2005. Its last maintenance check in the hangar took place on 16 April 2009.","Air France Airbus A330-200 encountered heavy turbulence .

"(CNN) -- Everything you know about the world of Arnold Schwarzenegger's most famous character has changed. Thomas Dekker, Lena Headey and Summer Glau star in ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles."" In the season finale of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,"" John Connor, the boy destined to lead humanity's battle against Armageddon, gets jolted into the future -- the one he was supposed to lead. But here, he has no identity. No one has heard of him. In this new future, he'll be fighting alongside his father, his uncle and a girl who looks just like the robot he came into the future to save. None of them has any idea who he is. Confused? Don't be. It was a daring, surprising, brilliant cliffhanger for a show that's gained a loyal following, particularly among people like me who are in awe of it. It also opens the door to anyone who hasn't discovered this show yet, allowing for a fresh start. Unfortunately, it may be too late. For fans, the big question is whether the ""Chronicles"" will be back, or canceled for inadequate ratings. We find out in a couple of weeks when Fox announces its schedule. The speculation online doesn't look good. Ending on this Season 2 cliffhanger would be a shame. When Fox picked up this ""Terminator,"" it took on one of the most successful sci-fi franchises in modern entertainment history. It courted ""Terminator"" fans, as well as people like me who never gave much thought to the movies but appreciate deep, high-quality TV storytelling. Ending on this ""what happens now"" cliffhanger would leave a gaping hole in the franchise's history. But of bigger concern, of course, is that ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" is just really good TV -- the kind that you want to believe can last. And that's thanks to Josh Friedman, the inspired executive producer. For him, ""Terminator"" isn't about special effects and metal monsters. It's a family drama; a mother and son entrusted with a huge secret and the responsibility to change the future, no matter what the cost. Without clobbering you with messages, Friedman gets you thinking -- about people whose secret struggles you can't know, about living with trauma and moving forward, about the strength and fragility of teenagers, and about the otherwise impossible things parents manage to do to protect their children. Sarah is parental adrenaline personified. It's also a show about cancer. We know Sarah can successfully battle robots, evil people and well-meaning authorities who want her locked up. But will cancer ultimately do her in? Friedman has talked about the show serving as a catharsis for his own real-life battle against cancer. Fans can't wait to find out what happens with Sarah (Lena Headey) in the new reality. Did she follow her son into the future? If not, what happened to her? Friedman might be the best storyteller on TV right now. He packs episodes with twists you don't see coming but make sense in retrospect. He changes up his style, drops lead characters for entire episodes, uses biblical references left and right and delivers dialogue that's simultaneously believable and eloquent. He lets major characters die. And the show's directors coax subtle, nuanced performances from the actors. You wouldn't guess any of this from Fox's promotions, which have focused too heavily on Cameron (Summer Glau), the robot who helps protect John Connor (Thomas Dekker), sending the signal that it's a show just for teenage fanboys. Cameron and John's relationship is actually a very clever exploration of something adults quickly recognize: the teenage boy with the mysterious girl who seems to have his best interest at heart but might be the most dangerous thing in his life. It's in some ways the reverse of ""Buffy."" Speaking of which, Fox may have done better promoting ""Chronicles"" as a family drama and then pairing it with one, rather than ""Dollhouse,"" the latest from ""Buffy"" creator Joss Whedon. (Insider question for fans: Is Josh Friedman the new Joss Whedon? Weigh in here or here.) It's also not clear how, or if, the new movie ""Terminator: Salvation"" affects the show's chances of survival -- though strictly in terms of storylines, there's apparently no overlap and no conflict. The weekly adventures of Sarah and John Connor just aren't done. There's too much unanswered, too much left to explore. So here's my pitch to network heads: You can still change the future. Don't terminate these ""Chronicles"" before their time. What are your thoughts? Think Josh is right -- or misguided? Weigh in at Facebook or Twitter.","Future of ""Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles"" is up in the air .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian star Kaka has agreed to join Real Madrid from Italy's AC Milan in a $92 million deal, the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser reported on Tuesday. Former World Player of the Year Kaka has agreed to join Real Madrid in a $92m move according to reports in Spain. Cadena Ser claimed that Real president Florentino Perez had thrashed out a deal with AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani and Bosco Leite, Kaka's father and agent. Kaka is currently in Brazil with the national team ahead of a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay and earlier in the day had appeared to rule out a move from Italy's Serie A. ""I'll say it for the last time. The last time. I don't want to leave Milan,"" he told Gazzetta dello Sport. ""In this period I prefer to remain silent because I don't want to be misunderstood. Or, worse still, to be used. ""To the millions of Milan supporters, I say that I have made my choice. I have said what I want to stay. Leave me in peace, please."" However, AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi also hinted at Kaka's departure just before Cadena Ser's claim. ""I do not know if we can keep Kaka at Milan because they (Real) have offered him so much money,"" Berlusconi was quoted as saying by Italian press agency Ansa. Spanish reports said Kaka will sign for five years with a salary worth nearly $13 million a year. Former team-mate Paolo Maldini, who retired at the end of the season, admitted he still had doubts about Kaka's future at the San Siro. ""I don't know if he'll still stay at Milan,"" Maldini told Gazzetta dello Sport. ""Ancelotti might have been cryptic about his future but Kaka has been even more so."" Last January, Kaka rejected a move to Premier League Manchester City who were prepared to pay the 2007 world player of the year $750,000 per week.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Italian football manager Carlo Ancelotti has gone from Milan to London in less than a day. Carlo Ancelotti will take over as manager of Chelsea from July 1 this year. Just 24 hours after resigning from his highly-successful eight-year stint at Italy's AC Milan, he has been announced as the new manager of English Premier League club Chelsea -- replacing temporary manager Guus Hiddink. Chelsea, who won the FA Cup at the weekend, were looking for a permanent manager for the start of next season -- and Ancelotti has been signed on a three-year deal to the west-London club. A statement on Chelsea's web site read: ""Carlo was the outstanding candidate for the job. He has proved over a long period his ability to build teams that challenged for, and have been successful in, major domestic and European competitions."" Ancelotti, who turns 50 next week, has been in management since 1995, when he took charge of Italian Serie B club Reggiana. Although he only spent one season at Reggiana, he managed to earn them promotion to the top-flight Serie A league. Since then he has managed Parma and Juventus, before taking on the San Siro-based giants AC Milan. Is Ancelotti's appointment the right move for Chelsea? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. As a manager he has enjoyed plenty of success, particularly in his time at the Rossoneri. He steered Milan to the Coppa Italia in 2003, the Serie A title in 2003--04, the UEFA Champions League in both 2002--03 and 2006--07, the UEFA Super Cup in 2003 and 2007 and the FIFA Club World Cup crown in 2007. Before entering management, Ancelotti had a significant playing career as a midfielder with AS Roma and AC Milan. During his time at both clubs he amassed three Serie A titles, two European Cups, and he also won the Coppa Italia four times with Roma. He is one of only six people to ever win the Champions League as both a player and manager -- a list which includes current Barcelona manager and this year's winner, Josep Guardiola. Ancelotti also represented Italy on 26 occasions, scoring once. He played in the 1986 and 1990 World Cups alongside players such as Roberto Mancini and the recently-retired Paolo Maldini. Despite his management success at AC Milan, it has been widely reported that his relationship with the club's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, has not been strong in 2009. He takes over at Chelsea as the permanent replacement for Luiz Felipe Scolari, although Guus Hiddink has been in charge since Scolari was sacked from Stamford Bridge in February.","London football club Chelsea appoint Carlo Ancelotti as their new manager .

"(CNN) -- Big Ben, arguably the world's most famous clock, celebrates on Sunday 150 years of keeping London on time. The British landmark has lived through war, bad weather and disasters. Big Ben's distinctive bongs have been a part of the London scene for 150 years. Big Ben is the 14-ton bell inside the world's largest four-faced chiming clock, although most people use the name to describe the tower that houses it. The clock is perched on a 96-meter (310-foot) elegant tower at the Westminster Bridge end of the Palace of Westminster. The Victorian masterpiece, which provides distinctive chimes known as bongs, was voted Britain's favorite monument in 2008. It has been featured in films such as ""101 Dalmatians"" and ""Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix."" Big Ben has been disrupted a few times over the years for various reasons, including weather and breakages. Its bongs went silent for about two months in August 2007 to allow a crew to repair its mechanism system. During that time, the rest of the clock was running on an electric system. It was fully restarted again October 1. The clock pays tribute to Britain's royal history: It has a Latin inscription of the phrase: ""O Lord, save our Queen Victoria the First."" The ornate masterpiece has some quirky features. The hour hand, which weighs 300 kilograms (661 pounds), is made of gun metal while the minute hands are made of copper sheet. The minute hands would not work when they were first made of cast iron because they were too heavy. The clock started working on May 31, 1859, after the lighter copper hands were installed. The origins of the landmark's name are obscure. Some say it was named after the 1850s heavyweight boxer Ben Caunt while others suggest it was named after Sir Benjamin Hall, a former member of parliament. Hall, the commissioner of works in 1859, was responsible for ordering the bell. Alan Hughes, the director of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry that made the bell, prefers the latter. ""I suppose I like it chiefly because it was a nickname of a man who was big and loud and pompous, and never used one word if 27 would do,"" he said in a 2008 interview. Hughes' company also made America's Liberty Bell and a number of others for cathedrals and churches around the world.","London's Big Ben turns 150 years old on Sunday .

Fifty-three percent of those questioned say they think Muslim views of the United States matter greatly or moderately, with 47 percent saying that Muslim opinions of the United States don't matter very much or at all. The poll's release comes hours before the president flies to Saudi Arabia for meetings with King Abdullah. Following the stop in Saudi Arabia, Obama will head to Egypt, where he'll deliver a long-awaited speech Thursday on relations between the United States and the Muslim world.  Watch the challenges Obama faces with the speech Â» . At a town hall in Turkey earlier this year, the president declared that ""the United States is not, and will never be, at war with Islam."" Many Americans seem to agree with the president: Sixty-two percent of those surveyed say they don't think the United States is at war with the Muslim world, with 36 percent indicating that the country is at war with Muslim countries. Those numbers have remained stable since CNN's 2002 poll. But the poll suggests that six out of 10 think that the Muslim world considers itself at war with the United States. ""The feeling seems to be mutual. We distrust Muslims. They distrust Americans. Views of Americans have not changed very much over the past seven years. There are some indications that Muslims' views of Americans have improved a bit since Barack Obama took office, but they are still not positive,"" said Bill Schneider, CNN senior political analyst. The CNN/Opinion Research poll was conducted May 14-17, with 1,010 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points.","Poll: One in five Americans has a favorable view of Muslim countries .

"(CNN) -- North Korea has completed preparations for launching what it says is ""an experimental communications satellite,"" the reclusive nation's state news agency reported early Saturday. A satellite image shows a rocket sitting on its launch pad in northeast North Korea. ""The satellite will be launched soon,"" KCNA reported. How ""soon"" was anyone's guess. On Friday, President Obama reiterated that the United States strongly opposes any such launch. ""We have made it very clear to the North Koreans that their missile launch is provocative, it puts enormous strains on the Six-Party Talks and that they should stop the launch,"" Obama said while on a stop in France. Obama warned that the United States will join with its allies to take ""appropriate steps"" to let North Korea know it can't violate United Nations rules and get away with it. Western nations fear that North Korea plans a ballistic missile test rather than a satellite launch, but the administration's special envoy to the Six-Party Talks, Stephen Bosworth, said it didn't matter if the North Koreans were trying to put a satellite in space or testing a ballistic missile that could threaten Japan or the United States. ""Whether it is a satellite launch or a missile launch, in our judgment makes no difference. It is a provocative act,"" Bosworth said. Bosworth said the United States stands ready, in the event of a launch, to participate in U.N. deliberations on new sanctions against North Korea. A commentary carried by KCNA recently blasted critics for opposing its plans. ""This is nothing but a groundless outcry of the political philistines ignorant of any legality of the study of space for peaceful purposes,"" the commentary said. The U.S. Navy is monitoring the expected launch with at least four ships in the region around the Korean Peninsula and northern Japan, according to U.S. military officials. The ships -- three destroyers and one cruiser -- are capable of tracking and shooting down ballistic missiles using powerful Aegis radar systems aboard each vessel. Two ships are in the Sea of Japan, the USS Curtis Wilbur and the USS Stethem, both guided-missile destroyers. Two other ships are on the Pacific Ocean side of Japan to monitor the missile if it flies over that nation. Those ships are the USS Shiloh, a guided-missile cruiser and the USS Fitzgerald, another guided-missile destroyer, the officials said. All four U.S. ships are working with Japanese naval ships in the same region that are also equipped with Aegis radar.  Watch report on launch preparations Â» . U.S. military officials say Pyongyang seems to still be on track to launch the missile as early as Saturday, but one official told CNN that winds strong enough to delay a launch are predicted for Saturday in the area of the launch site, in northeastern North Korea.","N.

"(CNN) -- The Scottish Rugby Union has appointed Andy Robinson, formerly coach of bitter rivals England, as the new national team boss. Andy Robinson will be seeking to revive the fortunes of Scotland's struggling rugby side. The 45-year-old won eight caps as a flanker for England, and was assistant coach in Clive Woodward's 2003 World Cup-winning set-up before taking over for an ill-fated reign himself in 2004, winning just nine of 22 matches. Robinson returned to top-class coaching with Celtic League team Edinburgh in 2007, and has sufficiently impressed Scottish officials in the 20 months since then to win favor as the replacement for Frank Hadden. He had been part of Hadden's backroom staff, and had already been chosen to coach Scotland A this summer. Hadden resigned on April 2 after Scotland again struggled in the Six Nations, finishing second from bottom with just one win from five outings. Robinson was delighted to be given the chance to return to the international stage. ""With the World Cup in New Zealand in 2011, I believe we have a crop of players who can really challenge the world's best, and preparation for that starts now,"" he told the SRU Web site. ""I'm looking forward to leading Scotland A into the IRB Nations Cup in Romania next week and thereafter preparing for our Autumn Tests at Murrayfield against Fiji, Australia and Argentina."" Robinson is believed to have headed off the likes of South Africa's World Cup-winning coach Jake White and former Australia boss Eddie Jones for the job. Former Scotland captain and British and Irish Lion Gordon Bulloch was part of the interview panel that determined the appointment. ""Andy was the outstanding candidate from a quite exceptional shortlist which underlines the allure of coaching the Scotland team,"" he told the SRU's Web site. ""I know from having had the privilege of his coaching and guidance on Lions tours that he is passionate about his rugby, is a skilled communicator and has values and an ethos which are absolutely at one with developing a winning Scotland team."" Scottish Rugby chief executive Gordon McKie said he was confident Robinson would prove to be successful. ""Andy has proved himself at every level of the game and we are thrilled that he will now be leading the Scotland team as we look towards the challenges of the next three years, including the 2011 World Cup,"" McKie said. ""He has been part of the Scottish Rugby family for the past two years and has brought success both to Edinburgh Rugby, with their highest ever Magners League finish in successive seasons, and has also guided the Scotland A team to notable successes.""","Andy Robinson appointed new coach of Scotland's national rugby team .

"PARIS, France (CNN)  -- Friends and relatives of the 216 passengers and 12 crew members on Air France Flight 447 are coming to terms with the news that wreckage from the flight was found in the Atlantic Ocean. Eithne Walls, who danced with Riverdance on Broadway, was aboard Air France flight 447. Among those on board were a member of Brazil's former royal family, a one-time performer with the Riverdance troupe, a Rio city official, executives from major international companies and an 11-year-old British schoolboy. Pedro Luis de Orleans e Braganca, 26, was a descendant of the family that ruled Brazil until 1889, a branch of the former Portuguese royal family. The Orleans and Braganca family considered him to be fourth in line to the throne. Pedro Luis was the oldest son of Prince Antonio and Princess Christine, the family said. He was the only member of the family on the flight, his relatives said. Eithne Walls, who danced with Riverdance on Broadway, was also on the plane, said Julian Erskine, senior executive producer of the troupe. ""I never saw her without a smile on her face,"" Erskine said in a statement. ""It is hard to believe that such a bright light could be quenched so early and while burning so brilliantly."" She joined the Irish dance troupe in 1998 and performed with them for most of a decade, studying medicine at the same time, Erskine said.  Watch CNN's Paula Newton report on families awaiting news of Air France Flight 447 Â» . ""Anyone who traveled with Eithne will remember the medical books always on the go and her constant attention to her studies,"" he said. ""Without doubt she was someone with a rich future stretching out ahead of her."" The wife one passenger said Tuesday she was only beginning to come to grips with the likelihood that he is dead. ""I have to say, maybe today I'm realizing he might not come back,"" Patricia Coakley told a reporter about her husband, Arthur. The structural engineer and designer had completed a business trip to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and was flying to Paris, France, on his way back to their home in Whitby, North Yorkshire, near England's northeast coast. Coakley said her husband hated his cell phones and usually left them switched off. ""But yesterday it was ringing, so maybe they're not at the bottom of the sea. That's my hope. But I think it's maybe fading today."" He had originally planned to return home on May 19, but his boss asked him to stay in Brazil until Sunday, she said. ""He shouldn't have been on that flight,"" she said. ""He should have been on the earlier flight."" In a telephone call he told her he was excited about returning to see their three children and their plans to go on vacation Friday to the Greek island of Corfu, she said. ""All his stuff's ready should he turn up,"" she added. ""We had so many plans, and they've taken it all away, haven't they?"" she asked rhetorically, without identifying ""they."" ""God wouldn't be so cruel."" She described her husband as a religious man. ""It used to drive me mad. He used to read the Bible every night. And if he thought he was going to get pissed [drunk], he used to read it before he left the house."" The two loved to travel, and he would ask her, ""Where should we go next, darling?"" she recalled. But they had been based in England for 25 years to give their children a sense of stability, she said. ""His priority was sea view and mine was trees and we found it,"" she said, pointing to both, her eyes welling. ""It was just going to be repainted next week."" Thinking about the moment when an apparent catastrophic failure caused the jet and its 228 occupants to plunge into the ocean, she said, ""I hope Art was asleep and I hope he wasn't frightened."" ""I know if he was awake, he would have been thinking of us."" The passengers on Flight 447 also included Marcelo Parente, chief of staff in the office of Rio de Janeiro's mayor. Two executives of Michelin, one of the world's leading tire manufacturers, also were aboard the plane, a Michelin spokeswoman said. They were Luiz Roberto Anastacio, president of Michelin Latin America, and Antonio Gueiros, another top regional executive. Michelin employee Christine Pieraerts was also among the passengers, the company said. The spokeswoman said that Michelin was saddened by the tragedy. Alexander Bjoroy, 11, was on his way home to England after a vacation in Brazil, the headmaster of his school said. He was a ""well-liked and respected boarder who will be sorely missed by his fellow pupils and staff,"" said John Milne, the head of Clifton College Preparatory School in Bristol, England. Milne expressed the school's ""deepest sympathies"" to the boy's family. The passengers included 61 people from France, 58 Brazilians, 26 Germans and people from 29 other countries, Air France said. An official list of victims by name was not available early Tuesday, but two Americans -- Michael Harris, 60, and his wife, Anne, 54 -- were identified by the couple's family and his employer. ""Anne and Mike were indeed a beautiful couple inside and out, and I miss them terribly already,"" said Anne Harris' sister, Mary Miley. Michael Harris was a geologist in Rio de Janeiro for Devon Energy, a U.S.-based natural gas and oil producer, according to a company spokesman. The Harrises were traveling to Paris for a training seminar and vacation, Miley said.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- Going to the prom is a highlight in many teenagers' lives. But attending a prom isn't always an option for some young people, including those with special needs. Alex Gonzales passes under the Marines' sword arch Saturday in Washington as he arrives at the prom. That's where Helen McCormick comes in. ""We are dreaming for children who are excluded from their proms, and ... you're going to see people walk through the doors who are going to be just absolutely mesmerized,"" said McCormick, president of a Virginia-based nonprofit called The House, Inc. For the past four years, McCormick has organized a prom specifically for children with special needs. This year's prom, dubbed ""The Cinderella Ball,"" was held Saturday night at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington. More than 150 teens attended the gala, where they were greeted by 41 Marines. Each one of the teens went down a red carpet, under a Marine Corps sword arch, before being seated for dinner.  Watch scenes from the spectacular prom Â» . ""The children that will be coming are various disabled children with kidney (ailments), children that are literally terminally ill, children with cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and autism,"" McCormick said before the event. Norman Gonzales brought his 13-year-old son, Alex. ""Their social life is very limited at school and outside school as well, so something like this is very good because they come to a place where they find themselves with people that they can relate to,"" Gonzales said. This was Alex Gonzales' first prom and he said he had a great time. ""Coming to an event like this -- I think it's a great experience,"" he said. The entertainment for the evening was 2007 ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks. ""I think it's so amazing with all the kids that they get to have their prom. They get to dress up and feel really beautiful and have this night dedicated to them,"" Sparks said. Most of the teens attending the prom were accompanied by a parent or friend. Some of them brought dates. It was a night many of them said they wouldn't forget anytime soon. Victor Padgett attended the festivities with his daughter, Dede. He said events like these prove that the human spirit is alive and well. ""There is hope. There is love, and there is compassion for everyone,"" he said.","""The Cinderella Ball"" is held at the Willard InterContinental Hotel in Washington .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- Debris located early Tuesday in the Atlantic Ocean off the northeast coast of Brazil is wreckage from the Air France jet that disappeared Monday, Brazil's Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said. A French search and rescue crew scans the Atlantic for wreckage Tuesday. No survivors have been found, he said. Jobim made the announcement after meeting with relatives and friends of Brazilians who were among the 228 people aboard Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, France. Two debris fields were found about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands, an archipelago 355 kilometers (220 miles) off the northeast coast of Brazil -- or at latitude 2 north, longitude 30 west, the Ministry of Defense said on its Web site. One of the fields was 5 km (3 miles) long and that both lie near the flight path between Rio de Janeiro and Paris. Among the wreckage was an airplane seat, metal debris, an orange float, a drum and an oil spill, the posting said.  See map of suspected crash zone Â» . Brazilian air force planes spotted the debris field Tuesday morning, but it was not until a French commercial vessel arrived on the scene that the debris' origin was confirmed. The planes searched 10,000 square kilometers (3,861 square miles) of ocean throughout the day and will continue to search for more debris overnight, the Brazilian Air Force Said. Two Netherlands-flagged vessels were expected to arrive in the area later in the day; a Brazilian navy ship was expected to arrive Wednesday, officials said. Brazilian air force jets were continuing to comb the area for other debris, and a U.S. P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft was assisting as well.  Watch how wreckage has been spotted in Atlantic Â» . The searchers also want to find the cockpit voice and data recorders, which might shed light on what caused the jet to disappear before any of the three pilots was able to issue a mayday. ""That really is an ominous sign,"" said former U.S. National Transportation Safety Board Managing Director Peter Goelz. ""It means, whatever happened, it happened so quickly that the pilots were not able to radio out. It probably indicates a catastrophic failure at altitude."" He said that meteorologists have been checking weather data over the area ""to see if there was some phenomenon that was taking place -- so far, we haven't seen it."" The Airbus A330 encountered heavy turbulence early Monday, about three hours into what was supposed to be an 11-hour flight, according to the airline. The plane carried 216 passengers -- 126 men, 82 women, seven children and a baby -- and 12 crew members, Air France said. The majority of the people on the flight came from Brazil, France and Germany. Other victims were from 29 other countries, including three from the United States. Of the crew, 11 were French, and one was Brazilian. A team of approximately 20 Air France staff members, including two doctors and a nurse, arrived Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro to assist families of the victims, the airline said. An inter-religious ceremony is to be held Wednesday afternoon inside Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral for family and friends of the victims. Though it will be closed to news media, a sound recording of the ceremony will be broadcast into the square outside. An official list of victims by name was not available Tuesday afternoon, but two Americans on board -- Michael Harris, 60, and his wife, Anne, 54 -- were identified by the couple's family and his employer. Prince Pedro Luis de Orleans e Braganca, a member of Brazil's non-reigning royal family, was also on the flight, his family said Monday. Pedro Luis was 26. Also on the flight were two executives of the French tire company Michelin: Michelin Latin America President Luiz Roberto Anastacio and Antonio Gueiro, director of informatics. Read more about victims on Air France Flight 447 . The jet was 4 years old and had last undergone routine maintenance April 16. The Air France plane has built-in homing devices, said Greg Feith, a former investigator with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board. Homing devices such as ""pingers,"" which are underwater locator beacons attached to flight data and cockpit voice recorders, can transmit signals from as deep as 14,000 feet, about the maximum depth of the waters in the area. The average depth of the Atlantic Ocean is about 12,000 feet: more than 2 miles. ""They're water-activated, so if they're sitting at the bottom of the ocean, of course, then the military assets will have to go in there with listening devices and try and home in on those particular signals,"" Feith said. Shortly before it disappeared, the plane's automatic system initiated a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating that ""several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down,"" Air France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said Monday. The jet, which was flying at 35,000 feet and at 521 mph, also sent a warning that it had lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said. There was no contact with the crew during or after the time that the automatic messages were sent, Gourgeon said. ""It was probable that it was a little bit after those messages that the impact of the plane took place in the Atlantic,"" he added.

"TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- When Japanese police arrested three sumo wrestlers and their stable master on Thursday over allegations they beat a 17-year-old wrestler to death, the case sent shockwaves across a country that links its national identity to the sport. Sumo stablemaster Junichi Yamamoto following the young wrestler's death in October. In scenes unprecedented in Japan's history, where wrestlers are seen as national heroes, the sumo stars were shown handcuffed and with jackets over their heads surrounded by cameras and reporters. Police arrested sumo wrestlers Masakazu Kimura, 24, Yuichiro Izuka, 25, Masanori Fujii, 22, and their stablemaster, Junichi Yamamoto, 57, who is also known as Tokitsukaze. Aichi prefectural police allege Yamamoto ordered the three wrestlers to beat a 17 year old junior wrestler so brutally that he died. Takashi Saito, 17, collapsed at his sumo stable and was rushed to the hospital. Initially, the boy's death was listed as ""ischemic heart failure"", until his family viewed his body. They say his body was covered in bruises, cuts and burns. They begged police to open an investigation, believing he'd been punished for trying to flee the stable. ""He said he'd be a good boy, I just need to come get him (from the stable),"" his father told reporters last summer, through choked tears. ""I should have listened and trusted him."" Police say on June 25, Yamamoto instructed the wrestlers to beat the boy using sticks and a metal bat. Yamamoto publicly denied striking Saito inappropriately, though he did admit to striking him on the head with a beer bottle during dinner that day. He told reporters shortly after Saito's death, ""This was an ordinary practice. How could you think I would do anything to hurt someone I consider my child?"" The results of an autopsy conducted last year by Niigata University concluded that Saito died of shock caused by multiple injuries. In a separate autopsy, specialists at Nagoya University confirmed earlier this month that shock caused by multiple external injuries contributed to Saito's death. The arrests have shaken Japan's national sport to its core. The Prime Minister, on the floor of the Parliament, urged the nation to carefully examine its sport. The Sumo Association says it will look at how young sumo are hazed, a process that often batters them to toughen them up. ""There will be some change in the short-term, but in the long-run, nothing will change,"" says sumo analyst and Japan Times sumo columnist Mark Buckton. ""These are bad apples who took it too far.""

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Dressed as Santa, Bruce Jeffrey Pardo walked up to his ex-in-laws' home in Covina, California, on Christmas Eve and knocked on the door. Bruce Jeffrey Pardo was sought for a Christmas party shooting before taking his own life, police said. An 8-year-old girl, elated to see Santa, ran toward the door. That's when, police say, Pardo lifted a gun and shot her in the face. Pardo, 45, with a gun in one hand and a wrapped present in the other, began shooting indiscriminately, police said at a news conference Thursday. He sprayed the living room with bullets.  Watch police describe the child getting shot Â» . Nearly 25 friends and family members were at the home for an annual Christmas party. Some ran, some took cover under furniture, some broke windows in an effort to escape -- one woman jumped from the second-story of the home, police said. Neighbors heard gunfire and called 911 shortly before 11:30 p.m. Police said they arrived within three minutes to find the home engulfed in flames. Police said Thursday afternoon that six bodies had been recovered. The Los Angeles County coroner's office later said two more bodies had been recovered. The names of the victims have not yet been released by authorities. Police said they have not accounted for three people: Pardo's ex-mother-in-law, ex-father-in-law and ex-wife -- whom he recently divorced. The 8-year-old, whose injuries indicate the bullet went straight through her face, is recovering at a hospital in Los Angeles, police said. ""She has a very, very severe injury to her face. It's not life-threatening, but she's got a very tough road ahead of her,"" Lt. Pat Buchanan of the Covina Police Department said Thursday. A 16-year-old with a gunshot wound and the woman who jumped out the window were also being treated at the hospital. Police believe that after Pardo stopped shooting he unwrapped his gift -- a home-made device used to spread fire -- and used it to set the house ablaze.  Watch firefighters on the scene of the inferno Â» . Buchanan said the device was ""something we have never seen before."" Covina Police Chief Kim Raney described it as a pressurized tank attached to another tank filled with accelerant. Police believe that after Pardo set fire to the home, he changed into his regular clothing, went to another relative's home in the nearby Sylmar area and committed suicide. Authorities identified Pardo's body, said Buchanan. Police have not released the identities of any of his alleged victims. At the news conference Ed Winter, assistant chief Los Angeles County coroner, said the recovered bodies were ""severely burned and charred,"" making it necessary to use dental and medical records, and X-rays to establish identities. The intense fire caused the top floor of the two-story house to collapse onto the first floor, according to Winter. Raney said Pardo's former in-laws regularly have a party Christmas Eve and that one neighbor always arrives dressed as Santa. This year, that neighbor was away, police said. Police suggested marital problems as a possible motive for the attack and said they believe Pardo and his wife of one year finally settled a contentious divorce last week. Authorities said Pardo's name was given to them by people who were at the party. Police also said they recovered multiple weapons from inside the house.","Pardo shot 8-year-old at ex-in-laws' home as she ran toward him .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Several years ago, in honor of the new millennium, Playboy magazine asked musicians for lists of their top 10 songs of the previous 1,000 years. The Beatles placed six albums in Tom Moon's ""1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die."" Most of them stuck to the era of recorded sound, but guitarist Richard Thompson cheekily took Playboy's request seriously and submitted a list that included such songs as ""Sumer Is Icumen In,"" a hit from the 13th century, and ""Blackleg Miner,"" a folk ballad of the 1800s. Playboy was not amused, and did not print Thompson's list. Such is the fate that awaits many people who compile expansive lists of the greatest or most influential songs, movies, TV shows, romantic getaways or baseball players shorter than 5 feet 9. Everybody's a critic. At best, your list will inspire furious discussion; at worst, it will be ignored by your prospective debaters and sink as forlornly as a pebble in the Atlantic Ocean. Which hasn't stopped a slew of new entries in the list-making business -- and not just simple top 10s, either. A handful of authors and publications have released, or are planning to release, works with up to 1,001 suggestions you should know about right now. Tom Moon, author of ""1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die"" (Workman), knew what a daunting task he had been assigned. ""Could one person be counted on to do all kinds of music?"" says Moon, the former music critic for The Philadelphia Inquirer and a regular contributor to NPR, describing himself as apprehensive about the project. But he found himself warming to the idea. As a music journalist, he prides himself on being a generalist, though he admits he's mostly stayed close to the pop realms. A book such as ""1,000 Recordings,"" he says, can help people see past their particular favorite artists or genres and tap into the whole world of recorded music. ""It's like having a tour guide with a flashlight shining into unknown places,"" he says in a recent interview at CNN Center. ""It's someone saying, 'This is cool. Check this out.' ""  Watch Moon defend the inclusion of Britney Spears' ""Toxic"" Â» . Moon isn't the only one marking time by making lists this season. Movie critic David Thomson put out "" 'Have You Seen ...?': A Personal Introduction to 1,000 Films"" (Knopf) in October. The January issue of Blender magazine blares ""1,001 Greatest Songs to Download Right Now"" on its cover. The minds behind the music Web site Pitchfork have ""The Pitchfork 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present"" (Simon and Schuster). And then there are the other big lists, past and future, including Dave Marsh's 1989 singles compendium ""The Heart of Rock and Soul"" (Marsh chose 1,001 influential singles) and Robert Hofler's forthcoming ""Variety's 'The Movie That Changed My Life' "" (120 notables pick their favorites). So where does one start? Thomson and Moon wanted references that included well-known titles and obscurities, often cheek by jowl. ""I wanted a 'bumper' book for your laps,"" writes Thomson in his introduction. ""I wanted old favorites to be neighbors with films you've never heard of. I wanted you to entertain the unlikely possibility that 'everything' is here. Of course, it is not -- everything remains out in our scattered 'there.' "" So ""Have You Seen ...?"", which is organized in alphabetical order by title, includes some interesting juxtapositions. The laconic Humphrey Bogart film ""The Big Sleep,"" directed by the no-nonsense Howard Hawks, precedes Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds."" The Frank Capra-directed ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" starring an earnest James Stewart, resides next to David Lynch's loopily creepy ""Mulholland Dr."" Thomson picks some films for their artistry, others because ... well, because he wanted to, and it's his book. Moon says he set some ground rules. He wanted to stick with albums, not singles or specific cuts. He knew he'd have to include certain essential recordings, but wanted room to roam. ""There's no way to be definitive about music,"" he says. ""My thought was, let me find some of the best of the best ... then find stuff as thrilling, but perhaps not as accessible."" So ""1,000 Recordings"" includes the Jimi Hendrix Experience's ""Are You Experienced"" and Glenn Gould's two albums of Bach's Goldberg Variations, but also Guided By Voices' ""Bee Thousand"" and Toumani Diabate and Ballake Sissoko's ""New Ancient Strings."" ""Born to Run"" makes the list; so does Henry Mancini's score for ""Breakfast at Tiffany's."" But like Thomson's film book, it has some idiosyncracies. The Beatles get six selections; the Rolling Stones get two, and one is a singles collection. There's a Beau Brummels album, but only a Dion single (yes, Moon breaks his own rules occasionally). And the curmudgeonly listeners at Pitchfork, Down Beat and the classical magazine Gramophone no doubt are wondering where some of their favorites are. For Moon -- as with probably anyone who's ever tried to make a comprehensive list of anything -- that's all part of the fun. Go ahead and argue; passion is better than indifference. ""These are starting points,"" he says.","Critics offering mega-lists of albums, films, other things to know about .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- It is one of the most notorious cold cases in recent memory. A 6-year-old girl, a child of beauty and privilege, was found dead in the basement of her home in Boulder, Colorado, on the day after Christmas 1996. The strangulation of JonBenet Ramsey is also among the coldest of cases. Twelve years have passed, and again it is Christmastime, the season of JonBenet's death. The investigation has taken many heartbreaking twists and turns, including a false confession and baseless suspicions cast for a time on the child's parents. After years of false starts, there are no solid leads. For many, the images of this tragic story are indelible: A doll-like child smiling flirtatiously at the camera in flamboyant costumes, heavy makeup and grown-up hairstyles parading on a beauty pageant stage. A tiny, lifeless body, dressed in long johns, found on the basement floor by her father.   Watch how this case touched nearly everyone Â» . Just this past July, John and Patsy Ramsey were exonerated by police of having any role in their daughter's death. Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in June 2006. FBI lab results confirmed that a man, yet to be identified, touched JonBenet's long underwear. This so-called touch DNA also was found in JonBenet's underpants, mixed with the child's blood. Police believe the DNA belongs to the killer. They just don't know who he is. They are waiting for a match. From the beginning, police focused their attention on Patsy Ramsey, placing the entire family under what authorities later would admit was a cloud of suspicion. The investigators' working theory was that JonBenet's mother may have struck her in anger as punishment for bed-wetting, causing the little girl's death on Christmas night. Investigators theorized that a strangulation was then staged to direct suspicion toward an intruder or sexual predator. Patsy Ramsey told police she awoke early December 26 and found a two-page, handwritten ransom note on a back staircase. It said JonBenet had been kidnapped by a ""small foreign faction"" and that she'd be executed if the Ramseys did not pay a $118,000 ransom. The Ramseys checked JonBenet's room, discovered she was missing and immediately called 911. When police arrived, they suggested that John Ramsey and a family friend, Fleet White, search the house. Shortly afterward, Ramsey and White found JonBenet's body in a wine cellar in the basement. The child's body was wrapped in a blanket, with duct tape across her mouth and white cord wrapped around her neck and wrists. An autopsy showed the child had eaten pineapple shortly before she died. She'd been sexually assaulted, strangled by the cord and struck on the head. Crime scene photos show two small burn-type injuries on JonBenet's head. Private investigators Ollie Gray and John San Augustin, working as consultants on the case, said the burns are consistent with marks made with a ""stun gun."" Investigators also concluded that the paper the ransom note was written on came from a notepad in the Ramsey home, as did the broken paintbrush handle used to form the garrote. However, the sources for the cord and duct tape were not found anywhere in the home. Other nagging clues include an open basement window near where the child's body was found. A suitcase stood directly below the window, and appeared to have been used as a step. There was a scuff mark on the wall beneath the window. A footprint of a Hi-Tec hiking boot was found in the dust in the wine cellar and cannot be connected to anyone in the Ramsey family or their friends. Police say they were initially suspicious of the Ramseys because there were no footprints in the snow outside the house. Lou Smits, a lead police investigator on the case, resigned because, he said, the investigation ""was misdirected and had developed tunnel vision, only focusing on the Ramseys as suspects and not following alternative leads."" The contradictory facts have caused problems in the case. Many experts have said they believe Boulder police botched the investigation by failing to preserve the crime scene properly. When, for example, police arrived and directed John Ramsey to search his own home, Ramsey not only found his dead daughter but also picked her up and brought her upstairs, disturbing the crime scene. Police investigators, friends and family were allowed to walk in and out of the house freely, again contaminating evidence that could have been gathered. The District Attorney's Office has taken over the investigation, said spokeswoman Caroline French. ""This case is still an open and active investigation,"" French said. Prosecutors seek tips and ask anyone with information that could lead to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for JonBenet Ramsey's death to call 303-441-1636.","False suspicions, unsecured crime scene plague investigation from start .

"(Coastal Living) -- The Little Dipper's seven patio tables overlook a twinkling Caribbean. Tonight, the chef -- who's also waiter and hostess -- prepares Creole fish with vegetables. Although the small restaurant is one of the best in Grenada, it's the vista that stands out. Founded in the late 17th century, the capital city of St. George's sits on the island's southwest coast. Sailboats sway at anchor on Clarkes Court Bay, and lights blink on against dark green hills. The island's hidden treasure is its views -- and not just from quaint seaside cafÃ©s. Take the nearby resort of Laluna, on Portici Bay. With 16 hillside cottages huddled around a private cove beach, it overflows with scenic panoramas. Founded by a former fashion consultant from Italy, Laluna is chic, but not pretentious -- a stylish retreat on one of the Caribbean's quietest islands. Eco-inspired rooms feature fabric-draped four-poster beds from Bali, individual plunge pools, and bamboo-topped verandas. The most distant cottage sits 150 feet from the beach, making the resort a barefoot, lounging kind of place. Ultracasual dress code aside, Laluna takes meals seriously. Dinner comes prepared by an Italian chef who mingles his home country's techniques with Caribbean flavors. You can start with octopus salad with potatoes and chickpeas, then make your way down the menu to pappardelle with a nutmeg cream sauce. It won't be the last time you see nutmeg on a menu here. Grenada provides a third of the world's supply of the spice, which can be sampled as a powder, syrup, or jam. Almost every visitor brings some home, usually in a small basket also packed with cloves, cinnamon, mace, bay leaves, and ginger. The country may not claim flashy casinos or high-rise resorts, but Grenada grows more spices per square mile than any other place on the globe. Coastal Living: The other Caribbean . It takes a lush climate, such as the rain forest at Grenada's center, to produce these flavors. Grand Etang National Park preserves the island's tropical flora and fauna. Visitors can book guides to lead them through terraced banana farms and forests of giant gommier trees, teak, and wild orchids. From a mountain peak, 90 percent of the island is visible, vivid green after a midday rain. As one might expect, the cities here move at a sleepy, island pace. But the township of Gouyave on Grenada's western coast jumps to life on Fish Fridays, which are part street-food festival, part outdoor concert, and part extended-family gathering. Beginning late afternoon, the fishing village's streets and side passages fill with tables of seafood. Vendors sell sample-size servings of everything from lobster to jerked marlin to deep-fried fish cakes. Music lifts the spirit, as do the enthusiastic greetings of friends and relatives. Visitors to Gouyave are a little reluctant to leave. But eventually they'll head back to Laluna, along a cliffside road illuminated by stars on a cloudless night -- yet another unforgettable view. Island Info . Laluna's cliffside cottages start at $390. Rates do not include meals, but all snorkeling and kayaking is included; 866/452-5862 or laluna.com.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- After shooting several people at the home of his former in-laws, police say Bruce Jeffrey Pardo, still dressed as Santa Claus, sprayed gasoline throughout the home intending to set it on fire. Police carry the homemade device they believe Bruce Jeffrey Pardo used to set the home on fire. But his plan went awry. The home exploded, windows were blown out, and part of Pardo's Santa suit melted onto his skin. He suffered third-degree burns. That's why police say he decided to kill himself rather than use the airline ticket to Canada that was in his pocket. Pardo killed nine people, police said. Three others were injured, including an 8-year-old. A 16-year-old girl was wounded by gunfire and was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. A woman who jumped out a second-floor window broke her leg and was hospitalized. None of the victims has been identified. Police said Pardo showed up at the home dressed as Santa and had $17,000 cling-wrapped to his legs and inside a girdle.  Watch police talk about what was found on the gunman's body Â» . He knocked on the door. And when the 8-year-old ran to greet him, he shot her in the face.  Watch police describe the girl's injuries Â» . Terrified people inside the home called 911. ""Stay away from the window!"" a woman can be heard pleading, ""Please come immediately ... he's shooting! He's shooting!""  See photos from the scene Â» . Some fled the house any way they could. Others sought shelter inside, some ducking under the dining room table, one witness said. Pardo was targeting his ex-wife's family, police said, shooting some of them ""execution-style."" Afterward, he prepared to set the home on fire using a homemade device designed to spread fuel.  Watch investigators at the burned-out home Â» . After the home exploded, Pardo removed his Santa suit, put on street clothes and began to knock out lights in the area as he fled the scene, according to a witness on a recording of a 911 call. Pardo fled to his brother's home in nearby Sylmar, California, police said. When Pardo realized his brother wasn't home, he broke in and eventually shot himself to death, police said. Police later found his rental car with the remnants of the Santa suit on the seat. It was rigged to explode if the costume was removed. During a search of Pardo's home in Montrose, California, police found five empty boxes for semiautomatic handguns, two high-powered shotguns and a container of ""racing fuel."" Police said they recovered four handguns at various locations.  Watch how the massacre unfolded Â» . Investigators have yet to identify the charred remains recovered from the burned house. Ed Winter, assistant chief Los Angeles County coroner, said the intense fire caused the top floor of the two-story house to collapse. Winter said the bodies were ""severely burned and charred,"" and dental and medical records and X-rays will be used to establish identities. Police said they have not accounted for Pardo's ex-mother-in-law, ex-father-in-law and ex-wife. Police suggested marital problems as a motive for the attack and said Pardo and his wife of one year settled a contentious divorce last week. Covina Police Chief Kim Raney said Pardo's former in-laws regularly have a party Christmas Eve and that one neighbor always arrives dressed as Santa. This year that neighbor was away, police said.","Police say suspect had flight scheduled from Los Angeles to Canada .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Every holiday season we are cursed with the same challenge: to articulate exactly how fond we are of our friends and family in the language of purchasable objects. Appreciate specific virtues of the people you're buying for and connect those qualities to fabulous presents. This begs a couple of questions, like, ""How do I shop for gifts that please both my brother and his wife without offending my own soul?"" Even if you love your brother dearly, you might spend way too much and give him a French designer tablecloth covered with a really terrific artichoke print, which would prompt his cute but rigidly uptight wife to say something like ""Artichokes? Wow. Ha ha; only you would give us something like that! No, really, it's great!"" And another deep and philosophical question: ""How the hell am I supposed to express fondness for my extremely fancy friends when I have only $40?"" Deciding I needed a psychic obstacle course that would train me to emerge victorious in this upcoming battle, I arrived at a strategy: I would theoretically buy gifts for people who were absolutely impossible to shop for. Oprah.com: Free (or really cheap!) gift ideas . If I could climb these holiday Matterhorns, I could find presents for anyone. I asked myself: ""Who in the world would best represent my worst nightmares in the area of budget holiday shopping?"" And I came up with a holy celebrity trinity: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy (the mind-bogglingly fashionable, ex-supermodel wife of the president of France), Brad Pitt (the half-Brangelinian father of six, at last count), and ultracouple Jay-Z and BeyoncÃ© (who I technically counted as one since I wanted to get something they'd both like). My budget for each: around $40. Obviously, this mission was going to require an insane level of creativity -- especially in a city like New York, where everything is so monstrously expensive. So I called women's clothing designer Gary Graham at his new boutique inside ABC Carpet & Home, a posh yet quirky department store filled with enormous golden Buddhas and strange chandeliers, and asked him to accompany me. ""We should get my friend Charlie to take us to Flatbush,"" he offered. I knew immediately what Gary was getting at. The Flatbush section of Brooklyn is a fertile mix of Caribbean families, art school hipsters, neighborhood discount stores, and specialty shops crammed to the ceiling with exotic imports. Charlie -- writer and artist Charles Beyer -- met us at Phat Albert, a legendary discount store that sells everything from leather baby pants to Lucite shower fixtures. We agreed that when shopping on a budget for people rich enough to buy their own islands, the goal was to find objects that would underline qualities we liked about them, and let them know we understood their particular needs. ""I think Brad Pitt would appreciate something that helps him control his children,"" I suggested. ""I mean, he has so many of them. We need to find him a six-headed lollipop, or something that can keep the kids consolidated in space for a few minutes so he can rest."" Oprah.com: The secrets of thrifty shoppers . We found a gift that, with just a little bit of creative doctoring, might do the trick: an XXX-large T-shirt featuring the late hip-hop artist Tupac Shakur. ""We could cut five more neck holes in it and call it a six-pac,"" said Charlie. It was tempting. This masterpiece of modern babysitting cost only $8.99, which would enable us to buy more child management aids. But I wasn't satisfied that Brad would be as thrilled with it as I wanted him to be. ""Hey, check this out,"" said Charlie, having already moved on to Carla. ""It's a camouflage duffel bag featuring a fake McDonald's logo."" Even more beguiling was a secret pocket outside the bag, the fabric of which was printed with the image of a cheerful, anthropomorphic French fry. The price: only $4. Oprah.com: Gifts that give back . True, Madame Sarkozy might love it. She is, after all, a tastemaker. Still, we wanted to see what they had at a few smaller shops. Hmmm. A bobble-headed decoy owl? Perhaps Carla could use it to keep pigeons off statues of her husband? No... Then we came upon the Goodwill Gospel Store, which promised that we'd be able to ""Give a Gift with Spiritual Importance."" ""Look, hanging in the window!"" I screamed. ""It's the gift that perfectly reconciles Carla Bruni-Sarkozy's rock 'n' roll, freewheeling past, her new diplomatic role as a high-profile political wife, and her much-maligned singing career!"" It was perfect: a tambourine in the shape of a peace dove. It really said it all, and for the low, low price of $21.99. Score! With that, we turned to the grueling task of shopping for Jay-Z and BeyoncÃ©. Since they are quintessential show people and are no doubt on the road a great deal of the time, living out of Louis Vuitton steamer trunks in six-star hotels with SWAT teams of hair and makeup artists, we wanted to find them something that would strike the right balance of sophisticated flair and down-home comfort. We came upon a $14 pair of boxer shorts covered with bags of money hanging on a rack in front of a clothing store (unlike Phat Albert, many of the smaller places have no visible names), which we thought Mr. Z might appreciate. Another nameless discount store had a fantastic 3-D chart for identifying the different hair bun attachments it sold. Perhaps, we agreed, we could buy BeyoncÃ© half a dozen of the various $7 ""donut buns"" and throw them into a Krispy Kreme box for extra whimsy! But neither of these options was really singing to us, maybe because they didn't speak to the couple's celebrated togetherness, which was the original sentiment behind buying them one gift. ""Oh, stop -- these are it,"" Charlie suddenly enthused as we passed a small, anonymous shoe store. ""These bandanna slippers are absolutely Runway Collection 2009!"" ""Actually,"" said Gary, ""they are really nice."" The price: $19.99. We decided to buy red slippers for BeyoncÃ© and blue for Jay-Z. Besides satisfying our criteria (snazzy yet relaxing), since Mr. and Mrs. Z ""tied the knot,"" this matching-scarf footwear could serve as a lasting symbol of a peaceful Hollywood marriage. I was very pleased so far ... but I didn't feel we'd completely succeeded with Brad, so we wandered into a store called Gran Bwa that featured items of a West Indian nature. ""Hey, these could be great for Brad,"" said Gary. The air in the room started shimmering, because he had, indeed, found some divine objects: a stack of six child-size straw porkpie hats. They were utterly hip, as if designed for miniature jazz musicians. We figured if Brad could manage to get all of his adorable children to wear the hats at the same time, like a global version of the Partridge Family, he could sell the photo to a tabloid for more than $4 million and donate the proceeds to the charity of his choice. At $10 each, the hats were a tad beyond our price range. But we decided we'd splash out and spend the extra $20, since eventually they could end up housing, say, 30,000 displaced persons. We'd put Angelina on the gift card, too, and then we wouldn't have to buy her anything at the last minute. We were suffused with the joy of giving. Mission accomplished, we found ourselves considering the plight of the Three Kings. Even with an unlimited royal budget, it still must have been difficult to shop for a newborn Messiah. But they looked around their respective kingdoms and gathered up the swankiest stuff they could find. In the earliest example of holiday gift giving, it was the thought and the effort that counted. All in all, I came away with one really valuable lesson. You can learn a lot by shopping outside your ordinary consumer comfort zone. And during our practice pilgrimage, Gary, Charlie, and I remembered what's important about the whole insane gift hunt: appreciating specific virtues of the people we're buying for, and connecting these qualities, with love, to fabulous presents. And you gotta figure your brother's wife is going to hate everything you give her anyway, so you may as well save a few bucks, right? 'Tis the season!

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- As Zimbabwe battles a cholera epidemic that has already killed hundreds, one company thinks it may have found a potential solution to the world water crisis. A shortage of clean drinking water has unleashed a cholera epidemic in Zimbabwe. Element Four, a small Canadian firm, has applied its water technology to create the WaterMill, a novel electricity-powered machine that draws moisture from the air and purifies it into clean drinkable water. The compact WaterMill, which goes on sale in the spring, is designed for household use. More crucially for countries such as Zimbabwe and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Element Four is also working on another device, the WaterWall, which could potentially supply an entire village in the developing world. The team at Element Four shares an ambitious goal: to quench the world's growing thirst for water. Now the 10-person company is taking on a challenge that global multinationals have struggled to meet. Rick Howard, the CEO of the company, says it was at a U.N. conference on water in New York last summer that he realized just how revolutionary Element Four's technology might be. ""There we were on the same stage as GE, Dow Chemical and Siemens, and it was a complete shock to us when we heard the solutions they were offering. We realized we had something that could effect change,"" Howard tells CNN. The WaterMill draws in air through a filter and then cools it into water droplets. This water then passes through a special filter and is exposed to ultraviolet light, which rids it of bacteria. The product Element Four is designing for the developing world is called the WaterWall and is constructed by taking several of the water-making cells of the consumer appliance and hooking them up in series on a wall. The U.N., which has declared 2005-2015 the International Decade for Water, expects 1.8 billion people to live in regions with absolute water scarcity by 2025. It's no wonder then that Element Four is being closely watched by the tech world. The WaterMill is being displayed at the Wired Store in New York, a temporary store the magazine opens every holiday season that showcases the future of technology. About one in five people in the world lack access to safe drinking water, and shortages pose serious health problems for much of the developing world. Lack of clean water, coupled with poor sanitation practices, can lead to outbreaks of water-borne diseases, such as cholera and dysentery, which in turn, can cause life-threatening forms of diarrhea. More than 500 people have died in Zimbabwe. Diarrheal disease is the third leading cause of death from infectious diseases, and the majority of those deaths are among children under the age of 5, according to the WHO and UNICEF. Most of those deaths could be prevented if improvements to sanitation and drinking water were made. But can an invention like the WaterWall really help ease the world's water shortage and help prevent health disasters like the outbreak in Zimbabwe from occurring in the future? ""There are some brilliant inventions out there, but they are expensive and difficult to get hold of,"" says Paul Jawor, an emergency water and sanitation consultant with international aid organization Doctors Without Borders. The WaterMill retails for about $1,300, but Howard estimates that a pared down version -- without the bells and whistle -- for use in places like Africa would cost about $300. The biggest challenge of a product like the WaterWall, Howard says, is the power consumed by the water-making cells. To counter that, the product is designed to turn on in stages so it doesn't overload fragile power grids. In comparison to solutions like desalination, which can cost billions of dollars to develop, that's cheap. ""For about $300 we can start saving lives. Ours is a very scalable product,"" Howard says. But there are skeptics. Frank Lawson, an engineering adviser at international charity WaterAid, said the solution Element Four is devising wouldn't be appropriate for the charity's projects. For one, the technology doesn't work in very dry climates. The machine only functions at or above about 35 percent relative humidity levels. Furthermore, it requires an energy source. ""Our technologies have to be within the capacity of the benefiting community -- both technically and financially,"" Lawson says. WaterAid uses a number of low-cost and sustainable solutions, such as rainwater harvesting and hand-dug wells, to help communities in more than 17 countries access water. But those solutions depend upon the availability of water in the area, and fresh water supplies worldwide are feeling the squeeze from population growth, pollution and climate change. Howard admits the company needs to focus on growing its business first, so it may be some time before the Element Four's products make their way to the developing world. ""We quickly came to realize that if we didn't first build a business to perfect the product and application, then we weren't going to be able to get to a point where we could have a significant humanitarian impact,"" he says. But Howard and partner Jonathan Ritchey are in various stages of discussions with several humanitarian groups in the field. Howard declined to name the organizations. It's early, but the company's core principle is ""to do good as we do well,"" he says. ""That's part of truly what drives us -- knowing that at some point we will be able to do some significant good.""","Element Four has developed a machine that creates clean water out of air .

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN)  -- What if we offered illegal immigrants a path to citizenship that included a stint in the U.S. military? Ruben Navarrette: Be wary of offering military service as a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The idea has been trumpeted by thoughtful people such as Max Boot, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who thinks this is the time for a ""freedom legion."" He's talking about a unit of the military made up entirely of the foreign-born -- including illegal immigrants -- where the compensation would include U.S. citizenship. About 70,000 foreign-born men and women serve in the U.S. armed forces, or about 5 percent of the total active-duty force, according to the Pentagon. Of those, nearly 30,000 -- or about 43 percent -- are not U.S. citizens. Roping illegal immigrants into military service could accomplish two goals at once: helping alleviate the military's recruitment worries while giving the undocumented a chance to prove that their commitment to this country extends beyond a paycheck. We're already talking about requiring illegal immigrants to learn English, pay fines, and return to their home countries to earn legal status. Why not, some say, raise the stakes and require men and women between 18 and 42 to serve a couple of years in the military to earn something even more precious: U.S. citizenship for themselves and their children? The idea appealed to a reader in upstate New York who called me to gauge my reaction. I told him that I hadn't made up my mind, but that the concept did fit with my view that any conferring of legal status be laden with onerous conditions so that it really is earned. To earn it, illegal immigrants should have to do everything but walk across broken glass. Still, I told him, I'm not sure how those who oppose comprehensive reform but support turning illegal immigrants into cannon fodder go about squaring that circle. Restrictionists and racists have argued that illegal immigrants are invading this country, and that they're a dangerous menace to society that is prone to all sorts of violent and criminal behavior. Of course, many native-born U.S. citizens are just as menacing. But for those who believe that illegal immigrants are inherently violent, do they really want to give these folks military training and a M-16, to help them graduate from menacing to lethal? After all, assuming they survive their stint in the military, they eventually have to return stateside. Then they're our problem. Consider the ghastly events in Newark, New Jersey, where three African-American students were killed execution-style and a fourth was shot in the head but survived. The accused ringleader is Jose Carranza, an illegal immigrant from Peru, who was previously charged with raping a 5-year-old girl and threatening her parents. Twice indicted by grand juries, Carranza slipped through the cracks and was released on bail. Authorities say that the 28-year-old construction worker led at least four other individuals in attacking the youths with a gun and a machete. If convicted, Carranza could get the death penalty. Glad to hear it. If half the things they say about this creep are true, Carranza belongs on death row. But guess what? He sure doesn't belong on an Army recruitment poster, or handling heavy artillery. Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a member of the editorial board of The San Diego Union-Tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.  E-mail to a friend .","Is it time for a military ""freedom legion,"" made up of all foreign-born troops?

"(CNN)  -- Four-time defending champion Rafael Nadal slid to an astonishing 6-2 6-7 6-4 7-6 defeat to Sweden's Robin Soderling at the French Open on Sunday. Soderling savors his unlikely triumph against Nadal in the French Open fourth round. Soderling, the 23rd seed, was a rank outsider against the world number one who had never lost a match on the clay at Roland Garros and was a short-priced favorite to win a record fifth straight title. But Soderling never looked back after breezing through the first set of their fourth round match and closed out victory as Nadal sent a volley wide after bravely saving a matchpoint in the fourth set tiebreak. The Spaniard tried to look on the positives after his shock defeat. ""It's not a tragedy, losing here in Paris,"" he told the official tournament Web site www.rolandgarros.com . ""It had to happen one day, and this is an excellent season for me. ""Of course it's a bit sad, but I have to overcome this as quickly as possible. No one remembers defeats on the long run. People remember victories. So I have to move forward and try and prepare the best I can."" King of clay Nadal had compiled a 31-match winning streak at the French Open and was attempting to win the second grand slam of the year after beating world number two Roger Federer in the final of the Australian Open. Soderling took advantage of a strong serve and big forehands to give Nadal a torrid time in front of a stunned crowd on the Philippe Chatrier court. Defeat for Nadal opens up his side of the draw with world number three Andy Murray a possible beneficiary.

"(CNN) -- U.S. military forces landed at a compound in Pakistan to battle targets linked to recent attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, a senior U.S. official confirmed Wednesday. Security in the South Waziristan area of Pakistan has deteriorated in recent years. The official declined to be identified, citing the extreme sensitivity of U.S. forces operating within Pakistan's borders. The action was an uncommon one for the U.S. military. Generally, NATO forces do not enter Pakistan except when pursuing insurgents in Afghanistan who slipped over the border or, in an extreme case, to pursue a high-value target. The Pentagon has refused to comment officially on the attack, but several defense officials acknowledged that U.S. military activity had taken place inside Pakistan. The senior U.S. official said a small number of U.S. helicopters landed troops in the village near Angoor Adda in South Waziristan, where Taliban and al Qaeda fighters have hunkered down over the years. Local media reports said the troops came out of a chopper and fired on civilians. The U.S. official said there may have been a small number of women and children in the immediate vicinity, but when the mission began ""everybody came out firing"" from the compound. He said the U.S. troops specifically attacked three buildings in the compound. They were believed to contain individuals responsible for training and equipping insurgents who have been crossing the border into Afghanistan in increasing numbers in recent months and staging large-scale, high-profile attacks against U.S. and coalition forces. The official could not say if the troops were going after a specific individual. Officials told CNN there was no indication the target was Osama bin Laden or his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday lodged a protest against U.S.-led coalition and NATO forces for what it said was a ""helicopter-borne ground attack"" from Afghanistan into Pakistan, an uncommon tactic in the coalition's fight against militants along the violent border. The coalition and NATO have been seeking a way to effectively battle militants launching attacks from Pakistan's swath of tribal areas along the border. They have become frustrated with Pakistan over the years, saying it is not being proactive enough against militants, a claim denied by Pakistan -- now in political flux after the resignation of President Pervez Musharraf. Top U.S. and Pakistani military officials last week met on an aircraft carrier regarding American concerns that Pakistan hasn't been cracking down hard enough on the Taliban. Several times this year, U.S.-operated drone aircraft launched attacks inside Pakistan . The Pakistani Foreign Ministry described the strike as ""a helicopter-borne ground attack supported by air assets based in Afghanistan"" and called it a ""gross violation of Pakistan territory."" Pakistani officials were still counting the casualties. One local official said the raid left 20 civilians dead. Pakistan military spokesman Maj. Gen. Athar Abbas said seven civilians died and others were critically injured. ""It is, indeed, most unfortunate that coalition/ISAF in Afghanistan have resorted to cross-border use of force against civilians,"" the Pakistan Foreign Ministry said in a written statement. ISAF is NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Pakistan's Foreign Ministry spokesman said the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan was summoned to provide an explanation of the incident. ""Such actions are counterproductive and certainly do not help our joint efforts to fight terrorism,"" the ministry said. ""On the contrary, they undermine the very basis of cooperation and may fuel the fire of hatred and violence that we are trying to extinguish. Moreover, any attack on Pakistani territory is unacceptable and constitutes a grave provocation."" Owais Ahmed Ghani, the administrative head of Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, called the strike ""a direct assault on the sovereignty of Pakistan. And the people of Pakistan expect that the Armed Forces of Pakistan would rise to defend the sovereignty of the country and give a befitting reply to all such attacks.""","NEW: Assault targeted compound in area linked to Taliban, al Qaeda .

"(CNN) -- Dr. George Tiller, whose Kansas women's clinic frequently took center stage in the U.S. debate over abortion, was shot and killed while serving as an usher at his Wichita church Sunday morning, police said. Dr. George Tiller was one of the few U.S. physicians that performed late-term abortions. Wichita police said a 51-year-old man from the Kansas City, Kansas, area was in custody in connection with the slaying of Tiller, who was one of the few U.S. physicians who still performed late-term abortions. The killing, which came about 16 years after Tiller survived a shooting outside his Wichita clinic, took place shortly after 10 a.m. Sunday at Reformation Lutheran Church. Officers found the 67-year-old dead in the foyer, police said. Witnesses provided a description of the car and a license number of the killer's getaway vehicle, Wichita police spokesman Gordon Bassham said. Police stopped a blue Ford Taurus matching the description about three hours later in Gardner, about 30 miles southwest of Kansas City, and took the driver into custody. No charges had been filed Sunday evening and no motive for the killing was immediately known, but Wichita police Detective Tom Stoltz told reporters: ""We think we have the right person arrested."" ""We will investigate this suspect to the Nth degree -- his history, his family, his associates -- and we are just in the beginning stages of that,"" Stoltz said.  See what people are saying about Dr. Tiller's murder Â» . Tiller's slaying drew condemnation from supporters, from some of those who tried to shut down his practice and from President Obama, who just two weeks ago urged Americans to seek ""common ground"" on the issue of abortion. ""However profound our differences as Americans over difficult issues such as abortion, they cannot be resolved by heinous acts of violence,"" Obama said in a statement issued by the White House. The shooting prompted U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to direct federal marshals to ""offer protection to other appropriate people and facilities around the nation,"" according to a statement from the Department of Justice. Tiller had been practicing medicine for nearly 40 years, said Peter Brownlie, president of the Kansas City-based regional Planned Parenthood office. His patients were ""almost always in circumstances where something had gone horribly wrong with a pregnancy,"" and where a woman's health would be endangered if the pregnancy continued, Brownlie said. He and his staff had been picketed for years, with some activists distributing leaflets around his neighborhood, Brownlie said. His clinic suffered serious damage from a bomb in the mid-1990s, and he was shot through both arms in 1993 by an anti-abortion activist who is currently serving time in federal prison. ""He endured that kind of stuff on a very frequent basis,"" Brownlie said. ""As recently as early this month the clinic sustained serious vandalism that put them out of commission for a week or so.""  Watch Tiller describe the philosophy of his clinic in 1999 Â» . Tiller had armed security at his clinic and a ""pretty rigorous"" security procedure at home, Brownlie said. But he ""made an effort to live his life as normally as possible knowing he could be a target at any time,"" he said. In a statement issued through Tiller's lawyers, his family -- a wife, four children and 10 grandchildren -- said their loss ""is also a loss for the City of Wichita and women across America."" ""George dedicated his life to providing women with high-quality health care despite frequent threats and violence,"" his family said in a written statement. ""We ask that he be remembered as a good husband, father and grandfather and a dedicated servant on behalf of the rights of women everywhere."" In March, Tiller was acquitted of 19 counts of performing procedures unlawfully at his clinic. In 2008, a probe initiated by abortion opponents who petitioned state authorities to convene a grand jury ended without charges. Leading anti-abortion groups condemned Sunday's shooting, emphasizing they wanted to shut down Tiller's practice by legal means. Operation Rescue, which has led numerous demonstrations at Tiller's clinic, called the shooting as a ""cowardly act."" And the National Right to Life Committee, the largest U.S. anti-abortion group, said it ""unequivocally condemns any such acts of violence regardless of motivation."" ""The pro-life movement works to protect the right to life and increase respect for human life,"" it said. ""The unlawful use of violence is directly contrary to that goal."" But Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, who is no longer affiliated with the group, called Tiller ""a mass murderer."" ""We grieve for him that he did not have time to properly prepare his soul to face God,"" Terry said in a written statement. ""I am more concerned that the Obama administration will use Tiller's killing to intimidate pro-lifers into surrendering our most effective rhetoric and actions. Abortion is still murder, and we still must call abortion by its proper name."" The National Organization for Women, which supports abortion rights, called Tiller's killing an act of ""domestic terrorism."" And NARAL Pro-Choice America said Tiller had worked for years under ""intense harassment tinged with persistent threats of violence."" If Tiller was killed because of his work, he would be the fourth U.S. physician killed over abortion since 1993. See all abortion-related attacks since 1993 Â» . In 1998, a sniper killed Dr. Barnett Slepian in his Amherst, New York, home. Anti-abortion activist James Kopp was later arrested in France and is serving life in prison. In 1994, Dr. John Bayard Britton and one of his volunteer escorts were shot and killed outside an abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida. Paul Hill, a former minister, was convicted of the killings and executed in 2003. And in 1993, another doctor, David Gunn, was shot to death outside another Pensacola clinic. His killer, Michael Griffin, is serving a life sentence. In addition, a nurse at a Birmingham, Alabama, clinic was maimed and an off-duty police officer was killed in a 1998 bombing by Eric Rudolph, who included abortion among his list of anti-government grievances. Rudolph admitted to that attack and three other bombings -- including the 1996 attack on the Olympic games in Atlanta, Georgia -- and is currently serving life in prison.

"(CNN) -- Growing up in a small Sri Lankan fishing town, cricket changed Sanath Jayasuriya's life. But his association with the game and humanitarian work has also helped transform the lives of many others. Jayasuriya's stature and shot-making led to comparisons with India's Sachin Tendulkar. ""Without cricket I would have a small job in my home town. My mother is happy to say my name,"" he told CNN in Hong Kong. His mother's pride in his success has an extra poignancy as Jayasuriya's fame in some part helped his mother survive the south Asian tsunami on December 26, 2004. She was swept away by the first wave and only by calling out to get attention, saying she was Jayasuriya's mother, did a rescuer manage to spot her among the debris and destruction and pull her to safety. Thousands of others, including many of Jayasuriya's friends and neighbors, were not so fortunate, and the impact that the disaster had on Jayasuriya's hometown of Matara and many other parts of Sri Lanka is still felt today. ""Even now when many people hear the word (tsunami), they are still scared. When my mother hears it, she still can't run,"" he said. After nearly 20 years of international cricket, the 39-year-old is now just as happy to put bowling attacks to the sword as well as working as a UN Goodwill Ambassador. ""Coming from Sri Lanka you need to do a lot of charity work and help in anyway you can. People love cricket and they look to cricketers, so as a team Sri Lanka also does a lot for charity. It's a personal commitment,"" he told CNN. On the pitch he has always been just as committed to helping his team. Making his international Test match debut in 1991, he captained the Sri Lankan team for four years until 2003 and hit memorable centuries against every other Test side, bar the West Indies and New Zealand. He retired from the five-day version of the game in 2007. However it was in the one day game that the all-rounder has really made his mark. As part of the Sri Lankan team that won the World Cup in 1996, he played an explosive innings of aggressive shot-making that has been credited with revolutionizing the way in which batsman play the game. In 2005 he became only the fourth batsman to reach 10,000 runs in one-day matches and his current stats stand at 12785 runs from 421 one-day internationals. Having made his name in the 50-over version of the game he's still involved in cricket's latest revolution; the even shorter Twenty20 game that is being touted as the future of popularizing the sport. ""Cricket has changed all over the world. For the public to watch this game we need for it to change. You can now enjoy all that in around 3 hours (with Twenty20). The Indian Premier League (IPL) is good for cricket and good for cricketers. The one-day game will be phased down."" Throughout his career he's shown his own resilience adapting to changing circumstances on the cricket pitch as well as off it. Before the 2003 World Cup he took the decision not to sign a contract with the Sri Lankan cricket board, citing the loss of potential earnings it would mean for him and fellow players. Despite not being a confrontational personality, the tension between himself and the Sri Lankan cricket board led to his resignation from the captaincy in 2003. With no Test cricket to play this year, Jayasuriya found himself omitted from the Sri Lanka squad for 2008 series one-day series against the West Indies. However his fine form while playing in the IPL -- he ended its inaugural season as the third highest run scorer with 514 runs and hitting 31 sixes -- convinced the selectors to pick him for the upcoming one-day series between Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. ""Looking back I could never have thought I would have come this far. Buddhism helped me a lot. It says that you should take the middle path and you will never go wrong,"" he said. ""But I've done a lot of hard work and everyone, my family and coaches, have given me support. Without that I wouldn't have got here."" When he does finally retire you can expect Jayasuriya to keep giving all he can to the game and causes he loves so much.","Sri Lankan cricketer recognized as changing the way one-day cricket is played .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- An extended trip to Ecuador by two Americans changed from a dream to a nightmare after a brutal attack last week, according the couple's blog and U.S. officials. State Department spokesman Robert Wood confirmed Tuesday that the U.S. Embassy in Ecuador had been told that two Americans from Bend, Oregon, were attacked in the city of Esmeraldas, on Ecuador's northern coast. But he said he could provide no further information because of privacy laws. Two State Department officials, however, said that the man was stabbed more than 24 times and that his fiancÃ©e was beaten and raped. CNN does not name the victims of sexual assault and has removed publication of the man's name to help protect the identity of the woman. The couple was evacuated to the United States on Tuesday for treatment, the officials said. The couple wrote a blog throughout their trip. In the most recent post on Monday, the woman wrote that her fiance was in intensive care after three surgeries. ""I was informed by the head surgeon there is no certainty he will survive,"" she wrote. The earlier postings were happier reflections on their visit to Ecuador, a year-long trip they planned after getting engaged and selling all their belongings. In the blog, the couple seems unconcerned about safety, posting that they occasionally hitchhiked, visited the homes of strangers and posed for pictures with new friends they made on their travels. One senior official told CNN that the victims' parents complained to U.S. consular officers in Ecuador  that the Embassy did not do enough to warn Americans that many people have been attacked in Esmeraldas. The State Department's  Web site advises caution when traveling to the northern border region of Ecuador, including Esmeraldas. The travel advisory section notes that ""U.S. government personnel are under limitations with respect to traveling alone and over-nighting in these areas due to the spread of organized crime, drug trafficking, small arms trafficking, and incursions by various Colombian terrorist organizations."" The Web site says that since 1998, at least 10 U.S. citizens have been kidnapped and one killed near Ecuador's border with Colombia. Wood on Tuesday expressed the State Department's ""deep sympathy"" for the victims and said the department worked with the victims' families to provide assistance. ""It's a horrible and shocking incident"" he said.","U.S. officials say man was stabbed repeatedly, his fiancÃ©e raped and beaten .

"(CNN) -- The worst cholera outbreak in Africa in 15 years has killed more than 4,000 Zimbabweans, and the crisis threatens to worsen when the rainy season hits, the U.N. Children's Fund said Thursday. A cholera patient sits in his bed  at a hospital in Harare. The rainy season could threaten more lives. The preventable disease has spread through the southern African country in the past 10 months because of faulty sewage systems, uncollected refuse and a lack of clean water, UNICEF said. ""Last year, we had a near collapse of basic social services,"" said Tsitsi Singizi, a spokeswoman for the organization. ""Municipal services were not providing clean water anymore and they were not collecting refuse anymore. There was also a collapse of the health-delivery system. So if you went to the clinic and you were affected by cholera, you would not be attended to."" The possibility of a new wave of cholera cases looms, Singizi said. ""We might have another spike in the number of cases once we have our first rain, because cholera is waterborne and the contaminated water will be flowing towards open sources and people will be drinking from unprotected wells,"" she said. Nearly 100,000 people have been infected since the current epidemic broke out, according to a new Red Cross report. The cholera crisis comes as Zimbabwe is struggling with an economic meltdown. In May, Zimbabwe announced that it would receive a $22 million grant from the World Bank to help the country's battered economy.","The cholera crisis has killed 4,000 Zimbabweans and could to worsen, the U.N. said .

"(CNN) -- Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's former finance minister, recently said his country is enjoying ""its best period in 300 years."" CNN looks at how the country emerged from communism to become one of eastern Europe's most stable and thriving democracies. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa addresses striking workers in Gdansk, Poland in 1989. Modern Poland gained independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Almost six million Poles, including the majority of the country's large Jewish population, died during the devastating six-year conflict. The shadow of Stalin continued to loom large over Poland after the war, when the communist-dominated government ensured that Poland would become a Soviet satellite state for the next 40 years. The following decades were punctuated by revolts against the repressive authoritarian regime in Warsaw, but none had a greater impact on Poland's political future than events in 1980 at a shipyard in western Poland. With a struggling economy and rumors of corruption and mismanagement within the state causing widespread discontent, a series of strikes by workers paralyzed the country. Eventually the government was forced to negotiate and on August 31, 1980, workers at the massive Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, led by an electrician named Lech Walesa, signed a deal giving workers the right to strike and form trade unions. This heralded the creation of the Solidarity movement, which would ultimately be instrumental in bringing Poland's communist era to an end. The presence in the Vatican at the time of Polish-born Pope John-Paul II was also a significant influence on the movement throughout the 1980s, as the Catholic church had remained a very potent force in Polish life. The Pope even made a visit to the country in 1979. Despite Soviet-endorsed attempts to slow the erosion of the regime's grip on power -- including the declaration of martial law by General Wojciech Jaruzelski in 1981 which outlawed Solidarity -- Poland's worsening economic situation, compounded by further nationwide strikes, meant that the government had no alternative but to negotiate a date for free elections with Walesa and the Solidarity movement. Solidarity members won a stunning victory in the election of 1989, taking almost all the seats in the Senate and all of the 169 seats they were allowed to contest in the Sejm or parliament. This gave them substantial influence in the new government. Activist and journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki was appointed prime minister, while Lech Walesa was elected as president the following year. Were you in Poland in 1989? Send us your memories . After years of economic mismanagement under the communists, Poland embarked on a painful reform program under finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz -- especially in traditional heavy industries such as coal and steel -- which moved away from the inefficient state-controlled system of economic planning. Despite growing unemployment and a dilapidated infrastructure, Poland was slowly transformed into an investment-friendly, market economy. Banking and lending policies were reformed, while newly reshaped ownership relations, independent enterprises and strengthened domestic competition all had a massive impact. Over a relatively short period of time, Poland had become one of the most dynamically developing economies in Europe and by the mid-1990s, it became known as the ""Tiger of Europe."" Poland also liberalized its international trade during this period. The national currency -- the zloty -- became convertible to other currencies and internal convertibility was also established, providing another platform for dynamic economic growth. New markets in countries that had been treated not so long before as ideological as well as economic enemies were opened up to Polish companies. The EU and U.S. were now the key markets for Polish goods. This realignment of policy was emphasized by its accession into the European Union in 2004. It had also joined NATO in 1999. Unfortunately the continuing problem of high unemployment and the promise of better salaries encouraged many Poles to work in other EU countries after 2004. However this trend started to reverse in 2008 as the Polish economy enjoyed a boom period. Politically, Poland has also successfully transformed itself into a fully democratic country. Since 1991 the Polish people have voted in parliamentary elections and four presidential elections -- all free and fair. Incumbent governments have transferred power smoothly and constitutionally in every instance to their successors.","Poland was ruled by Soviet-backed regime after the Second World War .

"(CNN) -- Solomon Brown of San Jose, California, is one of the millions of voters who helped elect Barack Obama to be the future president. He's also one of the voters in California, Arizona and Florida who cast ballots in support of same-sex marriage bans that got considerable support in each state. Jim Smotherman, left, and Pat Wright of La Mesa, California, rushed to get married in June. His voting choices are a picture-perfect model of the paradoxical results of the 2008 U.S. presidential election. They also illustrate how Obama's inclusive strategy won over many voters who didn't necessarily toe the Democratic Party line. The war in Iraq and the economy were the main issues Brown, 18, a first-time voter, said he considered in choosing a president. But when the time came to vote on the ""one man and one woman"" issue, he followed his moral beliefs and voted in support of California's Proposition 8. He said he isn't at all surprised that many voters did the same. ""They did that because of religion,"" Brown said of voters. ""They wanted change for the country but weren't going to change their religion."" He had no qualms about voting for Obama, either, and adds that his choice wasn't related to race. But he worries what moral beliefs will be taught in coming years. iReport.com: Read Brown's thoughts on Proposition 8 . ""I don't want a man and a man to be married,"" Brown said. ""When I have kids, I don't want them to see that."" Still, he says he doesn't hate gay people and has several gay friends. He emphasizes that he dislikes the fact that people are gay, but not the individuals themselves. ""I can't be prejudiced against them, with me being an African-American,"" Brown said. ""That would be hypocritical in my eyes."" But Maggie Cassella of Toronto, Ontario, said she watched the U.S. elections and couldn't help but feel thankful for being in Canada. iReport.com: Watch Cassella express her disdain over the election . ""I'm tired of talking about it, because I live in a country where I have all my rights now,"" she said. ""I talk about politics, but it's never gay rights because we're done."" She said she felt upset by the election and couldn't help but wonder why voters would want to make the decision to elect a black man as president and then outlaw gay marriage at the same time. ""I would just like someone to talk to an African-American gay person from California or any person from California and ask them what it feels like to have your rights to be an equal citizen taken away concurrent with this great day in history,"" she said. ""My guess is it actually doesn't feel so great. After all, civil rights are civil rights. I don't care what anybody says."" iReport.com: Share your story or opinion of same-sex marriage . The issue hits close to home for Pat Wright of La Mesa, California, who married his partner, Jim Smotherman, in June. He says he doesn't like seeing the animosity from both sides and has personally lost friends over the issue. ""A lot of ugliness and nastiness has come out. I don't know how these people have a direct connection to God,"" Wright said. ""How can people be so badly informed, why are they qualified to vote on my marriage, and should 52 percent of the population be able to take away my rights? A very ugly situation.""

They were saddened to see ""Yes on 8"" signs in nearby yards, but never expected the proposition to succeed. iReport.com: ""We are still numb and in mourning"" Two states away, Fred Thorne of Washington Terrace, Utah, said he was disappointed about the same-sex marriage decisions. Thorne says he comes from a long line of Mormons and that locals' views are highly shaped by their religion and the church. He describes his parents as ""freethinkers"" who encouraged him to break away from the church's views and support ""equal rights."" Thorne said he thinks religious organizations in Utah have a huge local and national political influence that oversteps the separation between church and state. iReport.com: Watch Thorne discuss ""sexual equality behind the Zion curtain"" ""Gays have the right to marry and be openly gay, in my opinion,"" Thorne said. ""If it offends somebody, I'm sorry. I'm offended that you're offended by it.""

""Even though it's 2008, we really are still in the 1950s when it comes to gay rights,"" he said. Dinant, who is gay, said he feels Obama must make the legalization of gay marriage part of his agenda for change as he assumes the nation's top post. The move to outlaw gay marriage adds ""discrimination into a state's constitution,"" he said. But the legal side of the issue looms large for John Riolo, a Rhode Island voter who prefers not to state the results of his last-minute voting decision. Riolo says both sides like to dig in their heels, and he wishes they would see eye to eye. iReport.com: Watch Riolo talk about his complex views . ""My liberal and some, but not all, of my gay friends see same-sex marriage as a civil rights issue,"" Riolo said. ""My conservative friends see gay marriage as fundamentally altering society and/or a violation of religious tradition."" Riolo doubts both religious consequences for gay marriage and violation of civil rights if the unions are banned. He said the decisions should be drawn up in courts and that both sides of the issue should maintain a clear head whatever the result. ""Marriage is little more than a license,"" Riolo said. ""It is a privilege given by the state and, like a driver's license or any other type of license, the state can set up rules and criteria."" But for Wright, who feels fortunate he got to marry his partner, the decision boils down to legislating personal lives and Proposition 8 stings hard. iReport.com: Watch the scene of protests in California .

"(CNN) -- Walk into Naughty Auties, a virtual resource center for those with autism, and you'll find palm trees swaying against a striking ocean sunset. Were it not for the pixelated graphics on the computer screen in front of you, you would swear you were looking at a tropical hideaway. David Savill, who has named himself Dave Sparrow in Second Life, has Asperger's syndrome. David Savill, 22, lives in Gloucester, England, in real life and created this spot within the virtual world of Second Life. Residents of this digital realm can represent themselves with 3-D images called avatars and connect with each other over the Internet. Savill has Asperger's syndrome and said he wanted Naughty Auties to serve those with autism spectrum disorders and their friends and family. Savill, who represents himself in the virtual world using an avatar named Dave Sparrow, said one benefit is that visitors can practice social interaction and find information about the condition. The graphical representations of real people create a ""comfort zone"" that can coax users out of their shells and get them communicating with others, he said. ""You're on your own computer, in your own room, your own space,"" Savill said. ""So you're not going out into the real world meeting people, you're going meeting people online and in your own home, so you're perfectly relaxed. It's just a fantastic tool to use to bring people together.""  Take a video tour of Naughty Auties with Savill Â» . Autism, more precisely the autism spectrum, is a range of brain disorders that can cause difficulties in social interaction, communication and behavior. Asperger's syndrome is at the milder end of this spectrum. People with Asperger's are often high-achieving but can have difficulty in social situations. CNN learned about Savill's Second Life place from an iReporter in England who has named herself Janey Bracken in Second Life. Bracken, who prefers not to share her real name, submitted stories to iReport.com describing Savill's resource center and providing information about other places where those with the condition can turn. ""[Savill] said that his life changed when his family decided to get the Internet,"" Bracken wrote. ""He was able to use chat rooms and soon realized that people used symbols to express themselves: the smiley signs, the angry signs, hug signs, etc., to enhance the text. He went on to say that subconsciously his brain was learning about communication from these sessions of chat."" Second Life has its own economy and social scene, and Bracken and Savill hope it could become a haven for those seeking help for autism. While many think such computer interactions could eventually be helpful in treating autism, scientists say more information is needed to truly assess their value. Dr. Fred Volkmar, a professor in Yale University's Child Study Center, said he would want more concrete studies done before he could be sure. ""Although not much research is yet available, there is clearly considerable potential in use of new technologies for fostering social skills,"" Volkmar said. To answer this need, scientists are beginning to explore the possibilities in Second Life. One such researcher is Simon Bignell, a lecturer in psychology at the University of Derby in Derby, England, who is running a project that is evaluating teaching and research in Second Life. Bignell, known in-world as Milton Broome, said Second Life is an uncharted but promising area for new applied psychological research. Virtual reality can be used to simulate new environments for people on the autistic spectrum, he said. ""For people with autism, we've found it's a very nice way of setting up situations they might come across in their everyday lives,"" Bignell said. ""For people who have social, emotional, communicational problems ... we can get them familiar with an environment before they actually try it out in real life.""  Watch more on autism research in a virtual world Â» . He started the ""Autism Research"" discussion group within Second Life to serve as an information-sharing tool for interested parties. He also has an office within Second Life and can sometimes be found working in SL-Labs, the university's in-world psychology lab space. The lab areas contain meeting spots, informational kiosks and games. A portion of these areas contain information about autism and Asperger's. Savill said Second Life excels at minimizing geographical separations between people and bringing people from all over the world to meet together quickly and easily. He added that he wanted to emphasize that virtual worlds are an emerging and important tool not just for autistic people, but for the people who know them. ""It's not just to help people with autism, it's to help people whose lives have been affected by autism, be they family or friends or employees of people who have autism,"" Savill said.

"(CNN) -- Switzerland's Lara Gut made history on Saturday when she became the youngest-ever winner of a women's World Cup race when claiming victory in the super-G at St Moritz. Gut holds the Swiss flag aloft after becoming the youngest skier to win a women's World Cup race. Cheered on by the local supporters, the 17-year-old finished ahead of compatriot Fabienne Suter with Italy's Nadia Fanchini -- the winner of  the opening super-G in Lake Louise, Canada, finishing third. Gut gave a clear indication of her immense talent on Friday when finishing fifth in the super-combined and she produced a near flawless run of 57.38 seconds to finish well clear of her rivals. Suter, who finished third on Friday, moved up one place on the podium with a time 00.63 secs behind Gut. World Cup leader Lindsay Vonn failed to finish on a piste that had been considerably shortened to deal with poor visibility caused by falling snow. American Vonn, the defending overall champion, was one of many racers caught out by a bump in a fast section after a sharp right-hand turn. Vonn said Gut's maiden win was not a surprise. ""She has been skiing well all season so far,"" said the 24-year-old. ""She has got a lot to learn still, but on a day like today, going first, it was a perfect chance for her. She definitely executed and seized the opportunity."" Gut added: ""I was really nervous as I wasn't used to being the leader, but gradually I began to realise that in fact I had skied really well especially when I saw that Nadia  and Fabienne were behind me.""","Swiss Lara Gut makes history by winniing the women's Super-G at St Moritz .

Obama went to Marine Corps Base Hawaii Kaneohe Bay on Oahu where he mingled with Marines and sailors. Obama and the troops also had a traditional dinner including turkey, roast beef, ham and trimmings. Obama, dressed casually in a blue polo shirt and dark khaki trousers, chatted casually, shook hands and posed for photos with men and women in the dining hall, which had been decorated with Christmas trees and Santa figurines. Shortly before Obama entered the room, a Marine shouted to the crowd scattered across 25 tables, ""You need to take you seats, the president-elect is going to be coming."" Obama, who spent about an hour at the Marine base, worked his way around the room, table by table. ""Just wanted to say, 'Hi, hey guys,'"" Obama said at one point while reporters were allowed in the room. ""Hey guys, Merry Christmas,"" he said to another group. Obama also highlighted the service of the country's military men and women now overseas in a holiday message to be broadcast on radio this Saturday. ""As we celebrate this joyous time of year, our thoughts turn to the brave men and women who serve our country far from home,"" he said in the message, which was posted online Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- A British man was jailed Tuesday for raping two of his daughters and fathering nine children over 27 years, a case with echoes of Austria's Josef Fritzl. The two daughters were made pregnant 19 times; there were nine births, five miscarriages and five terminations. Seven of the children are alive but suffer genetic deformities. The father, who cannot be named for legal reasons banning the identification of his victims and the surviving children, pleaded guilty Tuesday at Sheffield Crown Court, northern England, and was sentenced to serve 25 life sentences to run concurrently. The judge said the minimum term the 56-year-old rapist should serve in jail should be 19Â½ years. South Yorkshire Police Chief Superintendent Simon Torr said, ""The victims of these terrible crimes have asked me to state the following: 'His detention in prison brings us only the knowledge that he cannot physically touch us again. The suffering he has caused will continue for many years, and we must now concentrate our thoughts on finding the strength to rebuild our lives.' "" Speaking for the police, Torr added, ""The main concern ... is for those who have been so badly affected: the victims who have suffered a terrible ordeal. We will continue to offer them our full support to try and help them get on with their lives. ""As far as the sentence goes, we are satisfied that this offender has received the strongest possible punishment for his heinous crimes. Now we need to ensure continuing support for those who have suffered as a result of his actions."" The daughters first told police about their ordeal in June, but the abuse dated to 1981. It emerged that in 1998 one daughter rang Childline, a charity to help abused kids, and asked for assurances about being able to keep her children if she came forward. When Childline could not make that guarantee, the daughter did nothing more to raise her plight.  Watch how the case came to light Â» . The UK's Press Association reported that the rapes began in 1981 with daily attacks and that for long periods, they would be raped up to three times a week, and the assaults would continue through pregnancies. Their only reprieve came after they had just given birth or when they were ill because of the abuse. If either daughter tried to refuse their father's attacks, they would be punched, kicked and or held to the flames of a gas fire, burning their eyes and arms, PA reported. Despite visiting hospitals and meeting with social workers over the 27 years of abuse, no investigation was launched into the family. The case comes in the wake of the death of a baby, known only as Baby P, which has dominated headlines in Britain. The baby endured horrendous torture and died despite being on the local authority's child protection register. In Austria this year, Josef Fritzl was arrested, accused of keeping his daughter in a basement dungeon and fathering seven children through the rapes.","Dad in UK sentenced to life in jail for subjecting daughters to rapes over 27 years .

Searchers have recovered items from the wreckage of the cargo plane. The bodies of two of the nine crew members on board were recovered, the report said. The Philippines Air Force plane was declared missing after the control tower at Davao International Airport lost radio contact with the pilot halfway between Manila and Davao, an Air Force official said. The plane, with two pilots and seven crew members on board, was to have picked up members of the Presidential Security Group for transport to Manila.

"Editor's note: The U.S. Marshals Service last week launched one of the largest weeklong fugitive sweeps in the southeastern United States. CNN takes you inside the operation. Authorities received a tip that a convicted child molester was living here. He was captured at a hardware store. ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The trail for the convicted child molester seemed to grow cold as the police combed his empty apartment. James Maurice Robinson, 25, a confessed sex offender, had been on the run for more than two years, and it looked as if he would elude capture yet again. The authorities huddled in a nearby parking lot to discuss Plan B, an air of disgust hanging over them. James Ergas, the U.S. Marshal helping to lead this operation, acts on a tip. He pulls out his cell phone and calls a hardware store where the suspect may be working. Using a ruse, he begins speaking to the manager and, at one point, Robinson himself gets on the phone and unknowingly talks to the very man trying to catch him. Gotcha! Authorities now know exactly where their man is. He's seven miles away, on the other side of town. It's 11:02 a.m. Ergas guns his unmarked sport utility vehicle at 95 miles per hour through downtown Atlanta, zipping in and out of the city's notorious traffic congestion.  Hear cops bang door, see raid on a home: ""Get down!"" Â» . ""I've got no place in my heart for pedophiles,"" he says, pressing down harder on the gas. The vehicle thrusts forward. Ten minutes later, he whips his SUV into the store's parking lot. The suspect's car, a burgundy, four-door Pontiac Grand Am, sits near a back stairwell. ""When we go in there, he's going to run out the back,"" Ergas says. He parks near the front of the building and alerts his backup. Within minutes, the full team arrives. Two take position near the back stairwell. Ergas and other team members, dressed in black flak jackets, enter the front door at 11:19 a.m. Robinson doesn't have a chance. He tries to run, but slips. Ergas points his Taser and prepares to zap him. Robinson knows his gig is up. He surrenders peacefully. ""He saw the Taser,"" Ergas says, with a smile. ""Nobody wants to be Tased."" More than 100 miles away, the man who first arrested Robinson in March 2004 gets word of the capture. ""Anytime we can get a pervert off the street like that, it's going to make me happy,"" said Robert Tate, a detective with the LaFayette Police Department in northwest Georgia, near the Tennessee border. Robinson had been accused of exposing himself to a 10-year-old boy in a Wal-Mart bathroom and masturbating in front of him. Police records indicate the boy was so petrified he was afraid to leave the stall for 15 minutes afterward. Robinson pleaded guilty to one count of child molestation on May 26, 2005, according to the Walker County District Attorney's Office. But he skipped town and never made his sentencing hearing on February 14, 2006, authorities said. A warrant was then issued for his arrest. Robinson now faces five to 20 years in prison, the DA's office said. Robinson was one of 1,250 fugitives busted in Georgia last week as part of Operation Falcon, a nationwide sweep to arrest some of the most violent offenders. Of the arrests in Georgia, 724 came in metro Atlanta; two were suspected killers, authorities said. Multiple sweeps like these have already taken place in other cities in recent weeks as part of Falcon. More are coming to undisclosed regions of the country. Authorities would not release further details about the nationwide hunt due to the ongoing nature of the operation. ""Our primary focus when we do this operation are violent offenders, sex offenders and gang members,"" says Keith Booker, the commander of the U.S. Marshals Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force leading this sweep that included 115 federal, state and local agencies. The fugitives were wanted on felony charges ranging from murder and aggravated assault to rape and armed robbery to child molestation and an array of parole violations. On this day, while Ergas and his eight- to 10-member team hit multiple spots where fugitives were believed to be living, another 150 agents, investigators, detectives, officers and deputies were working other parts of metro Atlanta. Of the 700-plus arrests made around Atlanta, authorities smashed through 154 doors. Not every suspect was captured, but the hunt generated leads that will be followed up. The work involved grueling and dangerous 14- to 18-hour days, but the officers still found time to laugh. There was one who Tasered himself while running after a suspect, and another who held up a bag of oregano thinking it was pot and quizzed his subjects. Both provided fodder for the watercooler. Then, there was the suspect wanted for aggravated assault who authorities said tried to jump over a 30-foot wall, breaking several bones when he landed. ""He didn't want to go to jail. Instead, he went to jail crippled,"" Ergas said. The police kept close tabs on the six different teams' arrests, an internal competition to see who could bag more wanted felons. Team Vulture beat out Team Osprey with 147 arrests to 132. At the end of the operation, about 80 officers crowded into a large conference room and were briefed on the final results. ""You prevented a lot of victims this week,"" Booker told them. Law enforcement studies, he said, indicate the typical fugitive commits an average of 13 crimes while they're on the run. If that's true, more than 15,000 potential victims have been spared. ""These people can't commit crimes against other people while they're locked up,"" Booker said.","U.S. Marshals carry out massive fugitive sweep, nab 1,250 fugitives in Georgia .

"HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe described the U.S. government and Western nations as ""quite stupid and foolish"" Tuesday for trying to be involved in the African country's affairs. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe has ignored international calls for him to step down. Mugabe made the comments at the funeral for a former senior soldier, just days after a top U.S. diplomat said the United States no longer supports a power-sharing deal between Mugabe and his political rival, Morgan Tsvangirai, that might pave the way for economic, health and other reforms. Jendayi Frazer, U.S. assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said Sunday that the U.S. felt a viable unity government was not possible with Mugabe in power. At the funeral, Mugabe reacted: ""The inclusive government ... does not include Mr. Bush and his administration. It does not even know him. It has no relationship with him.  Watch U.S. say Mugabe needs to go Â» . ""So let him keep his comments to himself. They are undeserved, irrelevant and quite stupid and foolish. Who are they to decide who should be included or should not in an inclusive government?"" Mugabe and Tsvangirai, who leads the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, signed the unity deal September 15, but Mugabe's ZANU-PF party and the MDC have failed to implement it because they cannot agree on who should control key ministries. Under the power-sharing proposal brokered by former South African leader Thabo Mbeki, Mugabe would remain president while Tsvangirai would become prime minister.  Watch what options the international community has in Zimbabwe Â» . U.S. President George W. Bush and other leaders have urged Mugabe to step down amid a cholera epidemic that the United Nations says has killed more than 1,000 people since August. Mugabe blames Western sanctions for Zimbabwe's worst economic and humanitarian crisis since independence from Great Britain 28 years ago. The nation is facing acute shortages of fuel, electricity and medical drugs. The inflation rate -- the highest in the world -- is 231 million percent. Mugabe, referring to Bush's call for him to leave office, said: ""We realize that these are [the] last kicks of a dying horse. We obviously [are] not going to pay attention to a sunset administration. Zimbabwe's fate lies in the fate of Zimbabweans. They are the ones who make and unmake the leaders of the country. Their decision alone is what we go by."" Bush leaves office January 20. Tsvangirai announced Friday that his party will withdraw from efforts to form a unity government unless 42 kidnapped party members are released or brought to court to face formal charges by New Year's Day.","President Robert Mugabe describes U.S. and West as ""stupid and foolish""

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon met with the country's 32 governors Thursday to create a plan to combat the nation's staggering rise in crime and kidnappings. Mexican President Felipe Calderon has noted that kidnappings have reached an alarming level. In a heavily guarded meeting at Mexico's National Palace, the leaders devised a plan that detailed 65 specific actions to could be taken in the next several months. Those actions are aimed at helping families like that of prominent businessman Alejandro Marti. He told the group that the new focus on kidnapping has come too late for his 14-year-old son, Fernando. Fernando was grabbed from a car on a busy street at a fake police checkpoint this year. The next day, his chauffeur and bodyguard were found bound and strangled in the trunk of a car. Next to their bodies, police found a yellow chrysanthemum, a calling card from a gang that calls itself the Band of Flowers. Some investigators believed the flower was a coded message to police telling them not to investigate too closely, that the kidnappers were police, also. In July, Fernando's decomposed and bullet-ridden body was found stuffed in the trunk of a car. At least one police officer and one civilian have been taken into custody, accused of involvement in the kidnapping and killing, police and Alejandro Marti said. Marti told the group of leaders to do a better job to protect other children like his son. ""There are university students who could do their jobs better than you can,"" Marti scolded the group. To address the crime increase, Mexican leaders called Thursday for building special prisons exclusively for kidnappers, bolstering the justice system, cleaning up corrupt police forces, clamping down on kidnapping tools such as prepaid cell phones and money laundering. Calderon noted at the meeting that kidnappings had reached an alarming level. ""The truth is we are all responsible,"" Calderon told the group. ""We must recognize the traditional way of combating crime has not been sufficient. We must act in a more coordinated and vigorous manner."" According to official figures, there have been 314 kidnapping in Mexico this year. The numbers topped 700 in 2007. Authorities say the real figures may be even greater because victims often don't report crimes to a police force they don't trust. Experts say the rise is also a result of a perception sense that crimes go unpunished. Non-governmental groups estimate that there have been more than 1,500 killings in Mexico this year linked to organized crime. The group of leaders pledged to implement changes within the next three months. Activists said they hoped the one-day crime summit does not end up becoming just a photo-op.","Actions are aimed at helping families like that of businessman Alejandro Marti .

"SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Dust off every disaster plan from Washington to San Diego, scrutinize them to your heart's content, and it's still unlikely you'll find mention of the emergency services provided by Shary Shores. Eric Campbell of Palomar Mountain became a reluctant tailgater at Qualcomm Stadium with his two cockatiels. Shores, a volunteer registrar at San Diego's evacuee shelter, has appointed herself the shelter's ""hugger."" Every person she signs in gets a warm, heartfelt hug. Having lost her own home to foreclosure in March, Shores says she has empathy for the suddenly homeless. Her embraces may not be government-sanctioned, but they are appreciated. ""I can't tell you how many people say 'Thank you. ... I needed that,'"" Shores said. Welcome to Qualcomm Stadium, home of the San Diego Chargers and, for the time being, thousands of people who have fled the California wildfires that destroyed nearly 1,600 homes and burned some 679 square miles. Some 76,000 people stayed in 42 San Diego County shelters Wednesday night, county emergency spokeswoman Lynda Pfieffer said. Those numbers were dropping as residents were allowed to return home. Qualcomm Stadium housed 11,000 evacuees at the peak of the disaster, but that number dropped to 5,000 Wednesday morning. Those staying in shelters represented only a small fraction of the nearly 1 million evacuees. ""We believe many people are staying with family and friends or going to hotels,"" said Red Cross spokeswoman Jeanne Ellinport in Washington. Conceived on paper as a safe -- if uncomfortable -- refuge for thousands of people, Qualcomm Stadium has become in practice a wonderland of surprises. Were it not for the absence of a Ferris wheel, the tent city just inside the stadium's gates could be mistaken for a county fair.  Watch volunteers make life easier at Qualcomm Â» . Stiltwalkers stroll around the grounds waving at gawking children. Food and drink are abundant. Signs hawk free massages, acupuncture treatments and spiritual aide. Math tutors -- admittedly not a staple of county fairs -- are available free of cost. ""This is amazing, what's going on here,"" said Robert Norman, who sought shelter at Qualcomm with his wife and 1-year-old son. ""They've made it very comfortable."" The real purpose of this midway, however, becomes apparent only at second glance. At a booth where one might expect to buy cotton candy, a volunteer pharmacist dispenses aspirin and antacid. Other tents are labeled ""Safeco Insurance"" and ""All State."" Catholic Charities has erected a tent, as has a local politician. And, in a cold slap of reality, there is a drab tent where evacuees can privately read the list of homes that have been destroyed. The cost of homes destroyed by the wildfires is likely to top $1 billion in San Diego County alone, an emergency official said.  Watch how valiant efforts sometimes fall short Â» . The outpouring of help has been so massive that some volunteers are being turned away, and donated food and water is being stored in tents in the far reaches of the stadium's parking lot. ""If you need kosher food, we've got it!,"" exclaims Phillip Dewitt, a defense department contractor who is volunteering at the site. On Tuesday, volunteer teachers outnumbered kids three to one, said Edwin Lohr, another volunteer. Anitra Means showed up to volunteer on Tuesday and found herself managing one of several food banks that seemed to spontaneously appear on the midway's fringes. She doesn't know who organized the food bank, whether it be a city, state, federal government or a private enterprise, nor does she seem to care. Her one concern is that pallets of donated soup and pudding are appearing quicker then they are disappearing, she said, leaving her to wonder if food will be left over. Meanwhile, nearly 400 Red Cross volunteers from across the country were to arrive in the San Diego area Wednesday, said Red Cross worker John Degnan, who came in from Massachusetts. Also, 75 emergency response vehicles were coming to the region to deliver meals and other supplies to shelters. Disaster experts say planners sometimes focus on the negative consequences of disasters, such as public panic or rioting, which are rare. And planners rarely focus on the more likely consequences of disaster -- massive outpourings of help. But whether by accident or design, San Diego is offering emergency planners a lesson in harnessing volunteerism.

"ASHEVILLE, North Carolina (CNN) -- Greg Melville's neighbors in Vermont looked at him like he was crazy 2Â½ years ago when he drove what he refers to as his ""vegetable vehicle."" It's a car that runs on vegetable oil instead of gasoline. Greg Melville converted a 1985 diesel station wagon to run on vegetable oil when his family needed another car. Back then, gasoline cost about $2.20 per gallon. Now that the cost of gas is nearly twice that, many Americans are starting to think that converting to a vehicle that runs on vegetable oil isn't such a bad idea. Melville, who now lives in Asheville, North Carolina, says the decision to convert a 1985 diesel station wagon to run on vegetable oil came about when his wife was in medical school and the couple needed a second vehicle. ""We did some research and found out that the old Mercedes engines were very easy to convert, just because they are practically indestructible,"" Melville explained. After he found a good deal online, the couple purchased the car and found a conversion kit from a company in Massachusetts called Grease Car. The Melvilles then took the car and kit to an expert installer in their area and in no time, they were driving around -- with free fuel. The kit and installation cost about $1,000 each, and Melville says it took about 1Â½ years to recoup that cost. ""We're kind of playing with house money, because we're driving on free gas, and it's paid for itself many times over,"" he said. Melville, who is a writer, has driven the gas-free vehicle more than 60,000 miles, including two cross-country trips he's written about in an upcoming book.  Veggie car makes a cross-country road trip Â» . The converted car was outfitted with a 15-gallon tank. Melville says it gets about 20 miles per gallon, the same fuel economy it would have gotten with the original diesel system. But according to a recent editorial he wrote for The New York Times, Melville says his carbon footprint is cut in half while driving the car fueled by vegetable oil. But all is not golden -- or green, as the case may be -- in this veggie tale. Melville admits that there are a few downsides to having a vegetable-oil powered vehicle. The process of collecting and filtering the grease can be time-consuming and a bit messy. He's made arrangements to get most of his waste oil from local restaurants, and each week, his suppliers leave him five-gallon drums that he must pick up. But when he travels long distances, he has to find new restaurants on the road that are willing to give him their used grease. Once Melville gets the grease, he pours it into a large gas can that's been painted black. The dark color helps absorb the sun's rays, which heat the oil inside. The process helps thin the grease and makes it easier to filter bits of onion rings and other fried foods.  ""[It's] not always the cleanest thing. I've spilled it all over me a couple times,"" Melville said. Another side effect of using vegetable oil is the smell. The undeniable aroma of french fries and other deep-fried foods wafts up frequently from the exhaust. Depending on a person's palate, the aromatherapy could be a deal-breaker or a fringe benefit. Still, Melville says he would recommend a vegetable vehicle to anyone -- with the following caution: . ""Make sure you have a supplier lined up, because suppliers are becoming harder to find."" Even though many Americans love to eat fried food, there's not enough leftover oil to power all of the cars in the United States. The vegetable-oil powered cars have become so popular, there have been reports of cooking oil thefts from eating establishments across the country and talk of restaurants charging for the leftover oil. For now, Melville isn't concerned. ""My hope is ... by the time that happens, some other alternative like plug-in hybrids will come along and make these cars obsolete,"" he said. ""Then I won't have to be filling it up with vegetable oil, and I can have a plug-in hybrid and go to a regular gas station and not have to feel guilty or worry about it.""","Greg Melville converted a 1985 diesel Mercedes to run on vegetable oil .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Archaeologists have discovered what they say is the oldest surviving human brain in Britain, dating back at least 2,000 years to the Iron Age. A representation of the skull generated from the CT scans taken at York Hospital. The remains of the brain were found in a skull unearthed during excavations at York University in northern England, a statement from the university said Friday. The dig site was described by investigators from York Archaeological Trust as being in an extensive prehistoric farming landscape of fields, track ways and buildings dating back to at least 300 BC. They believe the skull, which was found on its own in a muddy pit, may have been a ritual offering. Rachel Cubitt, who was taking part in the dig, described how she felt something move inside the cranium as she cleaned the soil-covered skull's outer surface. Peering through the base of the skull, she spotted an unusual yellow substance. ""It jogged my memory of a university lecture on the rare survival of ancient brain tissue. We gave the skull special conservation treatment as a result, and sought expert medical opinion,"" she said in a statement on York University's Web site. A sophisticated CT scanner at York Hospital was then used to produce startlingly clear images of the skull's contents. Philip Duffey, Consultant Neurologist at the Hospital said: ""I'm amazed and excited that scanning has shown structures which appear to be unequivocally of brain origin. I think that it will be very important to establish how these structures have survived, whether there are traces of biological material within them and, if not, what is their composition."" Dr Sonia O'Connor, Research Fellow in Archaeological Sciences at the University of Bradford added: ""The survival of brain remains where no other soft tissues are preserved is extremely rare. This brain is particularly exciting because it is very well preserved, even though it is the oldest recorded find of this type in the UK, and one of the earliest worldwide."" According to York University, the find is the second major discovery during archaeological investigations on the site of the University's $745 million campus expansion. Earlier this year, the skeleton of a man believed to be one of Britain's earliest victims of tuberculosis was discovered in a shallow grave. Radiocarbon dating suggests that the man died in the fourth century late-Roman period.","Skull found at site of York University's $745 million campus expansion .

"(CNN)  -- The mother of an 8-year-old boy suspected in the shooting deaths of his father and another man said Monday that the youngster ""loved his dad"" and had a strong relationship with him. ""He's a very good little boy,"" Eryn Bloomfield said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""What happened to being innocent until proven guilty?"" For legal reasons, Bloomfield -- who is identified in court papers as Eryn Thomas -- could not discuss details of the case. She said she is not even allowed to discuss the case with her son. Prosecutors in Apache County, Arizona, filed a motion Friday to dismiss one of the two murder charges against the boy -- the charge involving the death of his father. The filing gave no explanation, saying only, ""The state believes the interest of justice will be served by such a dismissal."" Authorities last week released a videotape of the boy's police interview in which he initially denied any involvement in the shootings, but later said he had shot his already-wounded father ""because he was suffering.""  Watch the boy talk to police Â» . Legal questions surround the interview. One of the boy's defense attorneys said he was not read his rights and had no attorney or parent present. Police have not responded publicly to those complaints. Asked what she heard on the interview tape, Bloomfield responded, ""A scared little boy, that's what I hear -- someone who's very afraid of what's going on."" ""He had a very good relationship with his father. He did a lot with him,"" she said. ""They did everything together. He loved his dad."" She described her son as ""very outgoing. He loves animals. He likes to ride his dirt bike, skateboarding, you know, outdoor things."" Asked if he's ever been in trouble at school, she replied, ""No. Not at all. I mean, acting out as far as not raising your hand when he needs to speak -- you know, just normal stuff like that."" The boy lived with his father, Vincent Romero, 29, in St. Johns, Arizona. Bloomfield lives in Mississippi. The Apache County Superior Court clerk's office said the latest legal agreement between the boy's parents was from April 2006. The mother had weekly visitation rights and had the boy on some weekends and holidays, according to court documents. Romero and Tim Romans, who rented a room in Romero's home, were found dead inside the house November 5. Police said the next day that the boy had confessed to shooting the men with a .22-caliber weapon.  Watch why observers find the interrogation troubling Â» . The killings shook the town of about 4,000 residents near the New Mexico border. Trying to hold back tears, Bloomfield told ABC that her son is scared and living alone at a juvenile detention center. The other children were removed so that older juveniles could not influence him ""in the wrong way,"" she said. ""So he's in there by himself, in his cell by himself,"" she said. Authorities have said the boy is attending school at the detention facility. Apache County Court Administrator Betty Smith said earlier this month, ""Every effort is being made to see that he's comfortable."" Bloomfield described heart-wrenching visits -- 30 minutes each day -- when she can speak to her son through a glass partition. ""I get two visits with him that are physical visits -- to where we sit in a room and he will come and sit in my lap pretty much the whole time and hold onto me,"" she added. She will be allowed 48 hours with him at home over the Thanksgiving holiday, she said. ""We're going to watch movies, play games, try to keep things normal as possible,"" she said, adding that the boy had picked out the movie ""Kung Fu Panda."" Officials from the juvenile detention center and a court-appointed guardian will be present during the visit, Smith said. According to a report in The Arizona Republic, Judge Michael Roca warned the media not to contact the juvenile. ""The minor is off-limits,"" he said, according to the newspaper. ""I think common decency should protect him, but, just in case, he is not to be contacted."" Asked what she'll say to him on Thanksgiving, Bloomfield answered, ""I tell him every day that I love him, and I don't know how much more I can express that, but I definitely plan on doing that -- just to let him know that I'm here for him and how much I do love him.""","Mother: Son rarely in trouble outside of incidents like speaking out of turn in class .

"(CNN) -- At the time of his death, Heath Ledger had just concluded his work as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" the sequel to 2005's ""Batman Begins."" Heath Ledger died in January at age 28. He had been expected to hit new heights of stardom. The buzz surrounding his performance was electrifying. He was remaking the Joker; he wasn't a camp comedian like Cesar Romero or a malevolent clown like Jack Nicholson. He was pure nihilism, with his jagged makeup and ragged hair. Even glimpses of his smile on the ""Dark Knight"" movie posters were thrilling. And then he was gone. ""We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications,"" read the New York City medical examiner's office report, affectlessly. Who knows what could have happened? The hype surrounding ""The Dark Knight,"" partly fueled by Ledger's death, turned out to have been warranted; the film earned critical praise and planeloads of money. Ledger has been posthumously nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild award and is expected to receive an Oscar nomination, as well. Had he lived, he could have named his price. We'll never know. ""Prediction is very difficult, especially of the future,"" the physicist Niels Bohr is credited with saying. Ledger's movie, ""The Dark Knight"" -- with its uncertain, bleak Gotham City --seemed symbolic of the year in entertainment. A writers' strike cast a pall over awards season. The paparazzi's favorite target, Britney Spears, was institutionalized for a time. Pixar's brilliant ""Wall-E"" depicted an Earth abandoned to the waste of consumerism.  See some of the year's top entertainment stories Â» . Even the presidential campaign, source of so many laughs for late-night comedians, was fraught with 3 a.m. phone calls and ""terrorist fist bumps."" Why wouldn't people be attracted to change and hope? Hollywood, usually a prime provider of optimism, is littered with the stories of lights put out early. James Dean was 24 when a Ford coupe crossed into his lane and hit his Porsche Spyder head-on near Cholame, California. River Phoenix was 23 when he died of a drug overdose outside the Viper Room in Hollywood. They are two of too many. So: On January 22, 2008, Heath Ledger was found dead in a New York apartment. He was 28. Asking ""what if"" is a dead end. ""Saturday Night Live,"" many years ago, used to mock it: What if Superman grew up in Nazi Germany? What if Eleanor Roosevelt could fly? The past is past, what's done is done, and the future can be fickle, anyway. So many of the year's stories had unexpected outcomes. Consider: For almost two decades, movie audiences eagerly awaited a new Indiana Jones film. This year, they got their wish with ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" and the film was widely criticized for taxing the credulousness of even its most dedicated fans. It's one thing to chat with a centuries-old Grail Knight, but surviving an A-bomb by hiding in a refrigerator? Not quite. Then there was the ultimate reality show: the election. If you'd polled media professionals last year, they might have named Hillary Clinton and Fred Thompson as the future nominees. John McCain's campaign was on life-support; Barack Obama's was struggling. We all know how things turned out. And the election also made a star -- a celebrity, if you will -- of Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate. Palin had a charisma -- the TV execs call it ""breakthrough"" -- that, at times, overshadowed the man at the top of the GOP ticket. iReport.com: What was your most memorable entertainment event this year? There was something else about Palin: She looked like Tina Fey, once the ""Weekend Update"" anchor and head writer for ""Saturday Night Live,"" now the star of the smart ""30 Rock."" Fey went back on her old show and had great success parodying Palin, driving ""SNL"" to some of its highest ratings in years. (Palin also looked like ""King of the Hill's"" Peggy Hill, but unlike Fey, the animated character wasn't a Second City-trained comedy performer who could strike in real time.) Some observers foresee a bright future for the Alaska governor; others believe she'll wear out her welcome. Time, again, will tell. Cast members of ""Saturday Night Live"" are object lessons: John Belushi and Chris Farley, gone before their times; Robert Downey Jr. (1985-86) emerges from a lifetime of troubles with two hit movies and Entertainment Weekly's Entertainer of the Year distinction. Other notables had a chance to live out three rich acts. Paul Newman, who epitomized the best qualities of a performer and human being -- thoughtful, charitable, capable, courageous -- died in September. Visionary author Arthur C. Clarke died in March; elemental guitarist Bo Diddley died in June. And comedian George Carlin, who viewed life as ""a ticket to the freak show"" and ""a zero-sum game,"" died in June. Carlin, who reveled in absurdity, had the right attitude to try to figure out ""what if."" In his surrealist way, he noted that the light at the end of the tunnel could be daylight -- or, maybe, an approaching train. Either way, it'll be here soon enough. ""The future,"" he once said, ""will soon be a thing of the past.""","Heath Ledger died in January, had been expected to reach new stardom .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. ""FÃ¼r Elise"" Bob Dylan wrote ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" for Joan Baez. Written by: Ludwig van Beethoven . Written for: Some girl probably not named Elise. In fact, as far as most historians can tell, Beethoven didn't even know an Elise. Instead, the song was originally titled ""Bagatelle in A minor"" based on some handwritten notation a Beethoven researcher claimed to have seen on a now-lost copy of the sheet music. Further complicating things, Beethoven had hideous handwriting -- to the point that some scholars speculate the song was actually written ""for Therese,"" as in Therese Malfatti, one of several women who turned down a marriage proposal from the notoriously lovesick maestro. 2. ""Philadelphia Freedom"" Written by: Elton John & Bernie Taupin . Written for: Billie Jean King, as a thank-you for a tracksuit she gave Elton. And what a tracksuit it must have been! The 1975 song remains one of the most popular disco hits ever, leaving thousands of Hustle enthusiasts wondering just what Billie Jean King had to do with Philadelphia, anyway. Turns out, the song was a reference to King's pro tennis team, The Philadelphia Freedoms. Prior to 1968, tennis players were all considered ""amateurs"" and weren't eligible to receive prize money. So, if you didn't have the wealth to support yourself, you couldn't play. Billie Jean King fought against those constraints, ultimately founding Professional World Team Tennis in 1974 and turning tennis into a paid league sport. 3. ""Lola"" Written by: The Kinks' Ray Davies . Written for: A transvestite. But the question is, which one? According to Rolling Stone, ""Lola"" was inspired by Candy Darling, a member of Andy Warhol's entourage, whom Ray Davies briefly (and cluelessly) dated. If that's the case, then ""Lola"" is just another notch on Darling's song belt -- she's also referred to in Lou Reed's ""Walk on the Wild Side."" (""Candy came from out on the Island/ In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'."") But, in the Kinks' official biography, Davies tells a different story. He says ""Lola"" was written after the band's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him. 4. ""867-5309/Jenny"" Written by: Jim Keller (of Tommy Tutone) and Alex Call . Written for: Unknown, as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they're asked. While the woman continues to remain a mystery, however, the phone number is all too real. In fact, it's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time hasn't quelled of the number of crank calls. In 1999, Brown University freshman roommates Nina Clemente and Jahanaz Mirza found that out the hard way, when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system. Immediately, the girls' innocuous Room No. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish. Other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions, like the holder of 212-867-5309, who put his phone number up for auction on eBay in 2004. Bids approached $100,000 before eBay pulled the item at the request of Verizon, the number's actual owner. 5. ""Oh, Carol"" Written by: Neil Sedaka . Written for: Carole King, naturally. Sedaka and King actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance Sedaka was able to successfully milk with ""Oh, Carol,"" a then top-10 (if now somewhat forgettable) 1959 pop song. However, the real success of ""Oh, Carol"" came a few months later, when it inspired King to write a rebuttal entitled ""Oh, Neil."" At the time, King and her husband, Gerry Goffin, were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune. ""Oh, Neil"" wasn't that, but it did pay off. After Sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss, King and Goffin landed jobs at the legendary Brill Building pop music factory, where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""The Loco-Motion."" 6. ""It Ain't Me, Babe"" Written by: Bob Dylan . Written for: Joan Baez, though it clearly wasn't the nicest gift Dylan could have given her. The two met in 1961, when Baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and Dylan was a nobody from Minnesota. Desperate to make his break in the music biz, Dylan worked like crazy to get Baez's attention. He eventually ended up going on tour with her, which is how he first became famous, and also how the two began dating. For a while, they seemed like the golden couple, but things soon went downhill. During a European concert tour together in early 1965, they had a huge fight and parted ways. That May, Dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus, and Baez, hoping to remain friends, decided to bring him flowers. Sadly, that's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else. That someone else was Sara Lownds, whom Dylan married a mere six months later. 7. ""Our House"" Written by: Graham Nash (of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Written for: Joni Mitchell. In December 1968, Nash and Mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the Laurel Canyon section of Los Angeles. Though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon, Laurel Canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for San Francisco society -- not just CSN&Y, but also Jim Morrison, the Eagles, Frank Zappa, and more. ""Our House"" was directly inspired by a lazy Sunday in the Nash/Mitchell household. The couple went out to brunch, hit an antiques store, and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly, at which point Nash literally ""lit a fire,"" while Mitchell ""placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day."" No, really. The whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to Nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it. E-mail to a friend .

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- Letters containing white powder were mailed to 16 U.S. embassies across Europe, according to the State Department on Wednesday. Emergency services surround U.S. Embassy in Madrid, Spain. The substance has proved to be harmless in 15 locations with results still pending for the final embassy in The Hague, Netherlands, Deputy Spokesman Robert Wood said. He said the list of U.S. embassies where the powder was received includes Berlin, Germany; Bern, Switzerland; Brussels, Belgium; Bucharest, Romania; Copenhagen, Denmark; Dublin, Ireland; Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; Oslo, Norway; Paris, France; Reykjavik, Iceland; Riga, Latvia; Rome, Italy; Stockholm, Sweden; Tallinn, Estonia; and The Hague. An envelope, containing what testing revealed to be white flour, prompted the U.S. Embassy in Madrid to close the staff entrance on Wednesday, a U.S. embassy official told CNN. Mail at the U.S. Embassy in Madrid is received near the front entrance and was closed amid security concerns, he said, though most employees remained at work. ""We know where the package is coming from,"" the official said, but declined to elaborate. The official spoke on coindition on anonymity because he is not authorized to speak to the media. He described the incident as ""very serious"" but went on to say there is probably ""more commotion"" outside the embassy, where local media reported police and ambulances had gathered. A similar letter was mailed to the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen on Tuesday, embassy spokeswoman Melissa Ford said Wednesday. She said the contents of that envelope ""still aren't in,"" contrary to Wood's statement. ""It usually takes more than 24 hours (for the cultures), so perhaps we'll know later today or early tomorrow,"" Ford told CNN.

"ASHEVILLE, North Carolina (CNN) -- In 1988, a relatively unknown rock and blues guitarist named Warren Haynes got some of his friends together to play music in Asheville, North Carolina. It was just an opportunity for local musicians to jam during the holidays, the one time of year they were all in town together. Warren Haynes' good work has been noted by the street named after him. The artists also wanted to give back to the community, so they gave the money raised by their show to various charities. The tradition has continued. Now celebrating its 20th anniversary, Haynes' Christmas Jam has evolved into an epic annual event for the musicians, fans, and particularly Habitat for Humanity. ""We need Habitat For Humanity more now than ever, with the whole mortgage crisis that put us where we are now, and the fact that Habitat is about building homes for people that can't afford homes as opposed to lending money to people who can't afford homes,"" Haynes told CNN. Haynes and his wife, Stefani Scamardo, decided to donate 100 percent of the Christmas Jam proceeds to Habitat for Humanity years ago because they could see exactly where the money was going. They go back each year and meet the families they helped build homes for. Singer Joan Osborne echoed Haynes' thoughts. ""It's a scary time. A lot of people are losing their homes so it's good to be able to do something that helps with that specific problem,"" she said. Going into 2008's shows, which were held December 12 and 13, the Christmas Jam had raised more than $665,000 for Asheville's Habitat For Humanity. The money has gone into building 12 houses in Enka Hills, a wooded community surrounded by mountains on a street the organization appropriately named Warren Haynes Drive. (In 2005 Habitat also built a house in the New Orleans Musicians Village.) The Thursday before the show, Haynes presented the key to a new home to single mother Suzie Cromer and her 8-year-old daughter. ""Meeting the families and seeing the work that Habitat's doing with our help -- you know its hard to see that and not get emotional,"" Haynes said. ""Warren is a hero in our mind,"" said Habitat's Arianne Kjellquist. ""In western North Carolina, the housing costs are really out of whack with what the local wages are, so there's a big discrepancy there. There are more people that maybe would have been approved previously when the lending standards weren't so strict."" This year's Christmas Jam lived up to the long-lasting and crowd-pleasing traditions of previous shows. The first night's show ran more than nine hours, ending with an Allman Brothers set after 4 a.m. The second night's show ended at 3:30 a.m. Performers included Ben Harper and Relentless 7, Travis Tritt, Michael Franti, Osborne, Ivan Neville's Dumpstaphunk, Steve Earle and Haynes' band Gov't Mule. Perhaps the most anticipated addition this year among both fans and artists was former Led Zeppelin member John Paul Jones, who played acoustic mandolin, bass and keyboards throughout the weekend with just about everyone. Jones said he was happy to pitch in. ""In the economic climate like this, people really just want to get out and enjoy themselves and forget about the day to day stuff that they have to deal with. So it works on many levels,"" Jones said. ""The fact that it is for a good cause is just a huge bonus."" Haynes says the 20-year evolution of the Christmas Jam reflects his career. ""We've grown up together. Its a parallel of the progress that I have achieved, and the event reflects not only the philosophy I share with these people but the mission."" And as fans danced the night away while the artists played their hearts out, families' dreams of owning their perfect home come true. ""I would have never imagined or dreamed that it would turn into what its turned into,"" Haynes reflected with a huge smile.","Guitarist Warren Haynes helped start Christmas Jam 20 years ago .

"(CNN) -- The leader of this week's coup in Guinea assured senior officials Thursday ""they are safe,"" a journalist with the state-run newspaper told CNN. Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara with Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souare. Coup leader Capt. Moussa Dadis Camara met with Prime Minister Ahmed Tidiane Souare and about 30 other top officials at a military camp in Conakry, the nation's capital, said Ousmane Barry, a correspondent for the state-run Horoya newspaper. Camara has declared himself president of the National Council for Democracy, which he called a transitional body that will oversee the country's return to democracy. In effect, that makes Camara president of Guinea, which was thrown into turmoil Monday after the death of President Lansana Conte. Souare called Camara ""Mr. President"" at Thursday's meeting, which was witnessed by journalists, Barry said. The two men also discussed Conte's funeral, scheduled for Friday. Camara has suspended the government, constitution, political parties and trade unions and formed his own government, Africa News reporter Mamdou Dian Donghol Diallo told CNN on Wednesday. The newly formed government, made up of 26 military personnel and six civilians, is negotiating a power-sharing deal that would reflect its ethnic make-up, Diallo said. International institutions, including the African Union, have condemned the coup. ""What we want to see is the transition to a more democratic governing structure for the people of Guinea,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said earlier this week. Guinea, in western Africa bordering the Atlantic Ocean, has had only two presidents since gaining independence from France in 1958. Conte came to power in 1984, when the military seized control of the government after the death of the first president, Sekou Toure. The country did not hold democratic elections until 1993, when Conte was elected president. He was re-elected in 1998 and 2003 amid allegations of electoral irregularities. Worsening economic conditions and dissatisfaction with corruption and bad governance prompted two massive strikes in 2006, the CIA World Factbook says. A third nationwide strike in early 2007 sparked violent protests that resulted in two weeks of martial law. To appease the unions and end the unrest, the Factbook says, Conte named a new prime minister in March 2007.","Safety guarantees given to leading Guinea officials, reporter tells CNN .

"(CNN) -- Between 1.5 trillion and 2 trillion tons of ice in Greenland, Antarctica and Alaska have melted at an accelerating rate since 2003, according to NASA scientists, in the latest signs of what they say is global warming. This image shows the changing rate of mass in mountain glaciers on the Gulf of Alaska. Using new satellite technology that measures changes in mass in mountain glaciers and ice sheets, NASA geophysicist Scott Luthcke concluded that the losses amounted to enough water to fill the Chesapeake Bay 21 times. ""The ice tells us in a very real way how the climate is changing,"" said Luthcke, who will present his findings this week at the American Geophysical Union conference in San Francisco, California. NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, or GRACE, mission uses two orbiting satellites to measure the ""mass balance"" of a glacier, or the net annual difference between ice accumulation and ice loss. ""A few degrees of change [in temperature] can increase the amount of mass loss, and that contributes to sea level rise and changes in ocean current,"" Luthcke said. The data reflects findings from NASA colleague Jay Zwally, who uses different satellite technology to observe changing ice volume in Greenland, the Arctic and Antarctica. In the past five years, Greenland has lost between 150 gigatons and 160 gigatons each year, (one gigaton equals one billion tons) or enough to raise global sea levels about .5 mm per year, said Zwally, who will also present his findings at the conference this week. GRACE measured that mountain glaciers in the Gulf of Alaska lost about 84 gigatons each year, about five times the average annual flow of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon, according to NASA. ""Every few extra inches of sea level have very significant economic impacts, because they change the sea level, increase flooding and storm damage,"" said, Zwally, ICESat Project Scientist. ""It's a warning sign."" Melting ice, especially in Greenland and the Arctic, is also thought to contribute to global warming, Zwally said. When the vast ice sheets and glaciers melt, they lose their reflective power, and instead, oceans and land absorb the heat, causing the Arctic waters and the atmosphere to warm faster. ""We're seeing the impacts of global warming in many areas of our own lives, like agriculture,"" Zwally said. As an example, he cited the pine beetle infestation of this summer in the forests of Colorado and western Canada. ""They were believed to be spreading because the winter was not cold enough to kill them, and that's destroying forests,"" he said. In the 1990s, Greenland took in as much snow and water as it let out, Zwally said. But now, about 15 years later, sea levels are rising about 50 percent faster, making the global climate situation even more unpredictable. ""The best estimates are that sea levels will rise about 18 to 36 inches by the end of the century, but because of what's going on and how fast things are changing, there's a lot of uncertainty,"" he said.","About 2 trillion tons of ice have melted in Greenland, Antarctica, Alaska since 2003 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- As millions of people enter the job market and business owners struggle to entice consumers, Ryan Taylor may be better positioned than most to weather the economic crisis. Ryan Taylor, right, and client Shawn Stockman of Boyz II Men at Taylor's downtown Los Angeles office. Taylor is a custom tailor who brings his showroom to clients' homes and offices. The day before former New Edition artist Johnny Gill left for a U.S. concert tour in March, Taylor sat in the musician's modest condominium taking measurements for a customized shirt and suit that needed to be completed and shipped in a few days. Even on short notice, ""Taylor the Tailor,"" as he is known, delivered on his promise -- and made Gill a loyal and satisfied customer. Taylor says he wants to change the apparel business model by personalizing a customer's needs, instead of having large inventories and high overhead costs that can quickly put someone out of business in a bad economy. His recipe for success: virtually no inventory and prices competitive with brand name department stores. His story in the apparel business began with the word ""wardrobe"" itself. ""I had seen it numerous times and thought, 'Why would a word associated with business suits or casual attire have such a negative prefix?' "" He decided to remove the word ""war"" and create a brand called DROBE that would offer professionals and smaller mom-and-pop boutiques his personalized custom style. But his first foray into the apparel business began and ended about 10 years ago at a trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada. He borrowed money to pay for a booth, but like many entrepreneurial designers getting started, Taylor said buyers were not interested in clothing without established brand names. Soon after, Taylor was broke. ""When I came home from that show thousands of dollars in the hole, I thought, 'How can I create a better story?' ""  Watch Taylor discuss how his business started Â» . Several months later, Taylor was surprised that some of his personal customers were coming back for more shirts because of his attention to size and detail. ""I discovered that clothes off the rack fit less than 50 percent of the consumer population,"" he said, ""and that my custom clothes can be generally close to the same price as those on the rack."" He also began visiting his clients in their living rooms or offices for custom fittings and offering a range of fabrics, textures and designs conducive to an individual's style. When a sale is made, Taylor collects half the money up front, which helps pay for the cost of materials. ""Nine times out of 10 we visit clients in their home or offices, we take their measurements right there inside their office, have them select the fabric they prefer, take their measurements right then and there, and [in] a couple weeks have a tailor-made garment to wear,"" he said. Although he discovered his custom-tailored clients looked great in his shirts, he noticed that most Main Street customers wore pants and suits that did not properly fit, so Taylor saw that as another opportunity to expand. With no inventory and a small staff on commission, Taylor's reputation spread throughout the Los Angeles, Chicago, Illinois, and Atlanta, Georgia, business communities, partly with the help of fellow Hampton University alumni. He said television shows and celebrities began to take notice, and soon he found himself in the fitting rooms of major motion picture and recording studios. Taylor told CNN's Ted Rowlands that one of his first clients was the late comedian Bernie Mac. ""I called the Bernie Mac show and the stylist there said come on in and he was my first celebrity client.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama showed Thursday night that they have more common ground than differences when it comes to making national service a priority in their presidential administrations. The presidential canidates put aside partisan politics as the nation remembers the terrorist attacks. The candidates took the stage separately in a forum sponsored by TIME at Columbia University in New York. A coin toss determined who took questions first from moderators TIME Managing Editor Rick Stengel and PBS's Judy Woodruff. Asked why it seems the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, are ""fading"" in the minds of many Americans, McCain said: . ""We needed at that time [September 11, 2001] to take advantage of the unity in the United States of America."" McCain criticized the Bush administration for not taking advantage of that sense of unity and instead imploring the American public to live their lives as usual and ""go shopping."" ""I would have called them to serve,"" said McCain.  The GOP candidate said he suspects people feel uninspired by leaders in Washington and that Americans want ""change"" in federal government. ""They understand the challenges that we have in this world. They see the Russian invasion of the little country called Georgia. They see the problems in Afghanistan growing larger. They see a whole lot of things happening in the world that's going to require us to serve, and that opportunity has to be provided to them.""  Watch McCain talk about service Â» . McCain praised the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, saying they and similar organizations don't receive ""sufficient recognition"" from Washington. But McCain was careful to say government should limit its involvement. Asked about compensation for service McCain said: . ""I'd be glad to reward [volunteers] them as much as possible. But you want to be careful that the reason is not the reward of financial or other reasons, but the reward is the satisfaction of serving a cause greater than yourself. ... Finding new ways to serve. That's what this next few years should be all about."" McCain also fielded a question about his running mate Gov. Sarah Palin's dismissive comments about Sen. Barack Obama's community service in Illinois. ""Look, Gov. Palin was responding to the criticism of her inexperience and her job as a mayor in a small town. That's what she was responding to. Of course I respect community organizers. Of course I respect people who serve their community. And Sen. Obama's record there is outstanding."" McCain also said that politics is ""tough business,"" and that Obama set the tone of the whole campaign when he refused to take part in town hall meetings with McCain across America. Obama said his views don't necessarily differ from McCain's on national service. He said creating opportunities for national service would be a priority for his administration as well. ""Part of what makes America work is the fact that we believe in individual responsibility and self-reliance, but we also believe in mutual responsibility, in neighborliness, in a sense that we are committed to something larger than ourselves."" Obama cited a plan to provide college tuition aid in return for student community service. ""One of my central platforms in this campaign is we're going to provide a $4,000 tuition credit every student, every year, but in exchange for giving something back. And so, young people of modest means, who are interested in going to college, this gives them an opportunity to serve and at the same time, pay for their college education. I think there are a lot of creative ways where we can provide opportunities than exist right now."" Obama also said he wants to attract more young people into civil service careers. ""The fact is that we have to have government.  When a hurricane strikes, as it did with Katrina, we have to have a FEMA that works, which by the way, means that we should be encouraging young people, the best and the brightest, to get involved as civil servants, to pursue careers of public service so we've got people who are trained in federal emergency management who are able to take on the job.""   Watch Obama talk about service Â» . ""Now, that does not crowd out the Red Cross. That doesn't crowd out the thousands of church groups that went down there. What it means is that each area has a role to play."" The forum is part of a two-day summit meant to promote national service. Nearly 500 leaders from business, foundations, universities and politics are meeting to ""celebrate the power and potential of citizen service"" and lay out a plan to address ""America's greatest social challenges through expanded opportunities for volunteer and national service,"" according to the organizers' Web site. Each presidential candidate has served his nation in different ways. McCain was a Navy officer for over two decades and often encourages Americans to serve a ""cause greater than oneself."" Obama served as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago after he graduated from college. In a speech in December, the Illinois Democrat said he would ask Americans to serve if he becomes president. ""This will be the cause of my presidency,"" he said. Today's joint appearance came amid recent sniping between the campaigns. McCain's campaign recently attacked Obama for ""lipstick"" remarks made during a campaign stop in Virginia on Tuesday. ""John McCain says he's about change too, and so I guess his whole angle is, 'Watch out George Bush -- except for economic policy, health care policy, tax policy, education policy, foreign policy and Karl Rove-style politics -- we're really going to shake things up in Washington,' "" he said. ""That's not change. That's just calling ... the same thing something different. You know you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. You know you can wrap an old fish in a piece of paper called change, it's still going to stink after eight years. We've had enough of the same old thing.""  Watch how tensions are rising on the trail Â» . The crowd erupted in applause when Obama delivered the line. McCain's campaign said Obama's remarks were offensive and a slap at vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, despite the fact that the Arizona senator himself used the phrase last year to describe a policy proposal of Hillary Clinton's. Obama shot back Wednesday and accused the McCain campaign of engaging in ""lies"" and ""swift boat politics."" ""I don't care what they say about me. But I love this country too much to let them take over another election with lies and phony outrage and swift boat politics,"" he said in Norfolk, Virginia. ""Enough is enough.""  Watch Obama deliver his harsh words Â» . The phrase ""swift boat"" comes from the 2004 presidential election, when the group ""Swift Boat Veterans for Truth"" launched an attack ad campaign against Democratic candidate John Kerry that was said by some to be false. But the two presidential candidates agreed to put aside partisan politics on Thursday. They appeared together in New York to lay a wreath at ground zero, where the World Trade Center towers collapsed after two airliners hijacked by al Qaeda operatives plowed into them on September 11, 2001. The two met with families of victims as well as state and local officials. Earlier in the day, McCain attended a ceremony in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, to remember those who lost their lives when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed in a field there on September 11, 2001. Many believe that the hijackers intended to crash Flight 93 into the U.S. Capitol in Washington. ""Hundreds, if not thousands, of people at work in that building, when that fateful moment occurred, could have been destroyed along with a beautiful symbol of our freedom,"" McCain said. ""They -- and possibly I -- owe our lives to the passengers who summoned the courage and love necessary to deprive our depraved and hateful enemies their terrible triumph. ""I've had the great honor and privilege to witness great courage and sacrifice for America's sake,"" he said. The Obama campaign released a statement earlier Thursday for its candidate in which he said, ""We will never forget those who died. ""On 9/11, Americans across our great country came together to stand with the families of the victims, to donate blood, to give to charity, and to say a prayer for our country,"" Obama said. ""Let us renew that spirit of service and that sense of common purpose."" Meanwhile, a CNN poll out Thursday suggests that voters view McCain as the better presidential candidate to handle terrorism but do not consider terrorism their primary concern in voting. Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed, 62 percent, believe that the Republican presidential nominee would be the better candidate to handle the issue of terrorism, compared with 34 percent who believe that his Democratic rival, Obama, would be better on the issue. The poll's margin of error is plus-or-minus 3 percentage points. Opinion Research Corp. conducted telephone interviews with 1,022 adults from September 5-7 for the poll. Time's Michael Duffy contributed to this report.","Sens. McCain and Obama met at a forum on national service in NYC Thursday night .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- A Florida woman accused of killing her toddler daughter made a rare court appearance Thursday for a hearing regarding ""disturbing"" images of the scene where her daughter's skeletal remains were found. Caylee Anthony, 2, had been missing since June in a case that has received national attention. The hearing began without Casey Anthony, as defense attorney Jose Baez saying she waived her right to appear. But prosecutors objected, saying Anthony should be brought into court and questioned before waiving her appearance. Orange County Circuit Judge Stan Strickland agreed, sending deputies to retrieve Anthony from jail but starting the hearing without her. She later was brought in, wearing navy jail scrubs. Answering Strickland's questions in a clear voice, Anthony confirmed that she had waived her right to appear in court.  Watch Casey Anthony appear in court Â» . Strickland, however, had her remain for the rest of the hearing. She sat expressionless, appearing to listen closely as prosecutors and defense attorneys hashed out routine discovery and evidentiary issues. Anthony, 22, is accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, who was last reported seen in June. She was arrested in October and charged with first-degree murder and other offenses, even though Caylee's body had not been found. The girl's skeletal remains were found last month in woods about a half-mile from the home of Anthony's parents, where Caylee and her mother had been living. Authorities have been unable to determine how the girl died but said she was the victim of a homicide. In Thursday's hearing, prosecutors and defense attorneys wrangled over defense experts' access to images from the scene where the body was found. Prosecutors said they did not want the defense to copy, print or send any photos or X-rays of Caylee to their experts, many of whom were outside Florida, out of concern they might wind up in the media's hands. Because the experts are outside the jurisdiction of the Florida court, Strickland would have little recourse if the photos wound up ""displayed on some magazine at the checkout at the Publix,"" prosecutor Linda Drane Burdick said Thursday. The pictures ""are not necessarily gruesome, but they are disturbing,"" especially images of the child's skull when it was found and removed from the woods, she said. Baez agreed he did not want the photos to be made public, and said he doubted his experts would jeopardize their reputations by leaking them, noting they have signed confidentiality agreements. The parties agreed that the defense would set up a secure Web site for its experts to evaluate the photographs. Strickland also ordered Baez not to copy the images or transmit them in any way. In an earlier hearing Thursday, another Orange County circuit judge ruled that a lawsuit filed against Anthony may proceed, but the judge is not requiring Anthony to submit to a deposition at this time. In questioning after Caylee's disappearance, Anthony told police she had left the child with a baby sitter named Zenaida Gonzalez and had not seen her since. Checking out her story, authorities found that the apartment where Anthony said she left Caylee was vacant and located a Zenaida Gonzalez, who said she had never met Anthony. Gonzalez filed a defamation suit against Anthony, saying that as a result of Anthony's statements, she has been suspected wrongly of involvement in Caylee's disappearance. Her attorney, John Morgan, told the judge Thursday that Gonzalez lost her job because of those claims. Anthony's defense attorneys asked that proceedings in the Gonzalez suit -- specifically, Anthony's deposition -- be postponed until the criminal case against Anthony is resolved, because Anthony's answers to questions in the deposition could potentially incriminate her, meaning she would have to invoke her Fifth Amendment right in refusing to answer. Circuit Judge Jose Rodriguez agreed that Anthony should not be compelled to undergo an oral deposition, but said Morgan could depose her with written questions and answers. ""No matter how much we want to separate these cases, they're intertwined,"" Rodriguez said in issuing his decision. Morgan noted that Anthony has filed a countersuit against Gonzalez, and said Anthony cannot duck a deposition at the same time that she is suing his client. ""They cannot have their cake and eat it too,"" Morgan said, adding that Anthony ""can't sue someone and then say, 'You can't question me because of the Fifth Amendment.' "" Anthony's countersuit accuses Gonzalez of attempting to cash in on the high-profile case. A trial date has not been set for Anthony, who could face a sentence of life in prison if convicted of killing Caylee. Prosecutors have said they will not seek the death penalty against her.","Judge calls Casey Anthony to hearing at request of prosecutor .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- A potential victim became a compassionate counselor during a recent robbery attempt, changing the would-be criminal's mind -- and apparently his religion. Surveillance video shows storekeeper Mohammad Sohail holding a robber at bay with a shotgun. Storekeeper Mohammad Sohail was closing up his Long Island convenience store just after midnight on May 21 when -- as shown on the store's surveillance video -- a man came in wielding a baseball bat and demanding money. ""He said, 'Hurry up and give me the money, give me the money!' and I said, 'Hold on',"" Sohail recalled in a phone interview with CNN on Tuesday, after the store video and his story was carried on local TV. Sohail said he reached under the counter, grabbed his gun and told the robber to drop the bat and get down on his knees. ""He's crying like a baby,"" Sohail said. ""He says, 'Don't call police, don't shoot me, I have no money, I have no food in my house.' "" Amidst the man's apologies and pleas, Sohail said he felt a surge of compassion. He made the man promise never to rob anyone again and when he agreed, Sohail gave him $40 and a loaf of bread. ""When he gets $40, he's very impressed, he says, 'I want to be a Muslim just like you,' "" Sohail said, adding he had the would-be criminal recite an Islamic oath. ""I said 'Congratulations. You are now a Muslim and your name is Nawaz Sharif Zardari.'"" When asked why he chose the hybrid of two Pakistani presidents' names, the Pakistani immigrant laughed and said he had been watching a South Asian news channel moments before the confrontation. Sohail said the man fled the store when he turned away to get the man some free milk. He said police might still be looking for the suspect but he doesn't intend to press charges. ""The guy, you know, everybody has a hard time right now, it's too bad for everybody right now in this economy,"" said the storekeeper.","Long Island storekeeper Mohammad Sohail faces man wielding baseball bat .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- An emotional Nancy Reagan helped unveil a statue of her late husband, President Reagan, on Wednesday, calling the 7-foot figure ""a wonderful likeness."" Nancy Reagan, with House Minority Leader John Boehner, wipes away tears at Wednesday's event. ""I know Ronnie would be deeply honored to see himself with a permanent home in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol and very proud to be representing his beloved California,"" Nancy Reagan said.

Nancy Reagan stood arm-in-arm with House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio to pull down the curtain from the statue. She thanked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California for making the event possible. In her remarks, Pelosi noted that the former president's statue contains pieces of the Berlin Wall, ""as a symbol of his commitment to national security and to his success."" The wall was torn down shortly after Reagan left office. ""I'm so grateful to Californians for giving him this honor,"" Nancy Reagan said. ""Artist Chas Fagan has captured his likeness so well, and I think the addition of the pieces of the Berlin Wall in the pedestal reflects my husband's commitment to freedom and democracy for everyone."" The former president is credited with polices that led to the break-up of the former Soviet Union and the dismantling of the wall that divided Berlin as a symbol of Cold War politics. James Baker, a longtime Republican who served in the Cabinets of Reagan and President George H.W. Bush, recalled that Reagan inherited some major problems when he took office in 1981. Citing the former president's trademark optimism, he quoted from Reagan's first inaugural address that ""we are not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline.""

"CNN's Susan Lisovicz sat down with her uncle Lenny Lisovicz, a decorated D-Day veteran, to talk about his experiences at war. CNN's Susan Lisovicz spoke to her Uncle Lenny about his D-Day and war experiences. HOUSTON, Texas (CNN) -- Decorated D-Day veteran Lenny Lisovicz says the whispers are true. For 65 years my family had heard whispers that he and 220 men stormed Omaha Beach and that he and his captain later went AWOL in Paris, France. They heard he returned to combat and fought all the way to Germany and his courage was rewarded with the prestigious Silver Star. Then -- after that sacrifice and loss -- he was committed to a hospital. On the 65th anniversary of D-Day, Uncle Lenny finally talked at length about everything he had seen and done. And he said it was all true. Nowadays, Uncle Lenny lives a tranquil life. At 91, he is proud of his garden, where he grows corn, tomatoes and grapefruit. He takes in stray cats, attends Mass and sends money regularly to Catholic missionaries. But his thoughts are never far away from a sliver of sand thousands of miles away. He turned down my offer to visit Normandy. ""I don't want to see it. I try to rub that out of my mind. It won't go away,"" he said. But now, he finally agreed to share his memories.  Watch Uncle Lenny describe storming the beach Â» . It began with The Longest Day: June 6, 1944. My uncle was a 26-year-old lieutenant with the Army 1st Infantry Division, the famed ""Big Red One."" They had been training in England for something big for months. Then, over the loudspeakers in the barracks came the famous declaration from Gen. Dwight Eisenhower: ""You are about to embark on the Great Crusade."" The Germans were taken by surprise in one of the greatest amphibious invasions of all time, which would mark a turning point of the war in Europe. ""I just imagined what that enemy observer felt when he looked through that concrete bunker and looked out at that ocean and all he could see was boats, warships,"" Lisovicz said. But the Nazis had a superior position. ""They had you pinpointed. It was just like shootin' ducks on a pond. Your comrades would get artillery busted. A hand flying here, a leg there, guts laying out on the ground, asking for help and you couldn't help them. You had to move. You just had to push them aside,"" he recalled. But the Allies couldn't push their way onto the cliffs until a massive air assault began. ""At times there were so many planes in the sky you couldn't see the sky... ,"" Lisovicz said. ""You could see them forming from all directions coming into one pattern. And that's how we got off the beach, darlin'."" Their orders were to meet up with the paratroopers, who landed behind enemy lines. My uncle said they found them by smell, because they were all dead. ""They backed them in a corner and machine gunned them down and didn't have enough decency to cover them,"" he said. That was when an unwritten order came down: ""No prisoners. And we didn't take any."" It was shortly after this that he decided he had enough. He and the captain went AWOL in Paris. To add insult to injury, they stole the major's jeep. Their freedom lasted only about a week. ""The MP told us he was going to shoot us for going AWOL. But who cares? You didn't care anymore,"" Lisovicz said. ""You were just fed up with war, fed up with killing, just absolutely fed up."" But they weren't shot -- not by Americans, anyway. My uncle and the captain went back into combat. The captain was killed by a camouflaged tank. My uncle was now the commanding officer. And the fighting was ferocious as he battled his way into Germany. He set trip wires for flares in one pivotal battle. At about 3 a.m., the flares went off. The Germans had overrun the outer defenses of the platoon. It was chaos. The Silver Star says that he ""skillfully deployed men and weapons into strategic positions and with accurately directed fire, held the foe at bay until supporting troops arrived and repulsed the attack."" But there was more. ""When I looked up I seen a man walking up with two of my comrades. It was a German. So I went after him. And got him and brought my men back,"" he said. The Silver Star described it as ""extraordinary gallantry and aggressive leadership."" Only 22 of the 220 men that stormed the beach with him came home alive. That was the last time my uncle saw combat. He had been hit. He learned about his Silver Star in the hospital. He wanted to return, but he was shell-shocked. ""It took them a year and a half of my life for them to straighten me out and get back to civilian life,"" he said.","Sixty-five years after D-Day, CNN correspondent's uncle talks about experience .

"HERMOSILLO, Mexico (CNN)  -- President Felipe Calderon traveled to Hermosillo on Saturday to meet with health officials as the death toll of a day care center fire there grew to 38 children. A crib and baby seats lie outside a day care center Friday in Hermosillo, Mexico, as police cordon off the area. The cause of Friday's blaze remained unknown, but investigators concluded that the fire did not start inside the ABC Day Care, Eduardo Bours, the governor of Sonora state said. As of Saturday night, 23 children remained hospitalized, 15 of them in critical condition, Sonora spokesman Daniel Duran told CNN. Another 10 children had been transported to other hospitals: eight to Guadalajara, one to Ciudad Obregon, and one to Sacramento, California. A team of 29 medical experts in Hermosillo were deciding if any more victims would be moved to the Shriners Hospital in Sacramento, or elsewhere. In addition, six adults were injured, Duran said. ""Without a doubt this is the worst disaster we've had,"" Bours told CNN. The president arrived with Interior Secretary Fernando Gomez Mont and Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova to get firsthand updates from doctors and investigators, the state news agency Notimex reported. Calderon ordered the nation's attorney general to investigate the blaze. Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation and not burns, Bours said. But the fire was enough for the roof to collapse, he added. At the time of the blaze, 142 children were inside the ABC Day Care. The day care is for children ages 2 to 4, but Bours confirmed that children even younger were among the victims. All the children at the day care had been accounted for by Saturday evening, Bours said. A severely burned 3-year-old girl arrived Saturday at the Sacramento hospital -- where pediatric burn treatment is a specialty -- and was in critical condition, according to Dr. Tina Palmieri, assistant chief of the burn unit. The child was burned over 80 percent of her body, the doctor told reporters. She said the hospital normally can save just over half of the children with burns that severe. In Hermosillo, a large crowd gathered outside of the emergency entrance of the city's general hospital and many people consoled each other, video from the scene showed.

"HOLLYWOOD, Florida (CNN) -- The slot machines are ringing, music is blasting at the crowded poolside bar, and people are dancing to celebrity DJs at hip nightclubs. But this is not a scene on the Las Vegas strip. This action is taking place on an Indian reservation. Richard Bowers Jr. says the Native American Group is intended to help tribes with basic needs. Business at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida, is booming and contributing to the Seminole Indian Tribe's great wealth. Now the Seminoles are taking that wealth -- and the power that comes with it -- and using it to do something that has not been done before: organizing Native American tribes with the intent of spreading economic opportunities across Indian Country. ""Some of these reservations I have been to -- it's like the Third World right here in the United States,"" says Richard Bowers Jr. As president of the Seminole Tribe of Florida Inc., Bowers has oversight over all the Hard Rock cafÃ©s, hotels and casinos in the world except the cafÃ© in London and the casino in Las Vegas. The Seminole Tribe purchased the Hard Rock properties in 2007 for a reported $965 million. Bowers, a former alligator wrester and cattle rancher, is thankful for his tribe's success and has used his influence to create a consortium of Native American Tribes called the Native American Group. The goal of this group is to bring tribes throughout the United States and Canada together in an effort to promote Native American-owned businesses and services. Keeping the dollar within Indian Country, Bowers hopes, will help the less fortunate tribes with basic needs such as housing, food and education. ""I view this as historic in nature,"" says Donald Laverdure, the chief legal counsel from Montana's Crow Tribe. ""We haven't had first-nation to first-nation actually occur, and now with the success of the Seminoles and others, they have an opportunity to help tribes such as ourselves."" The help that the Crow Nation seeks is financial. For the Crow Tribe, gaming is not an option, according to Laverdure. ""There's less population, so the success in gaming cannot be paralleled as elsewhere,"" he says. ""So we've always viewed our future in energy."" That energy would come from coal. The Crow Tribe wants to mine some of the 9 billion tons of coal that it estimates is on its land. Crow Nation Chairman Cedric Black Eagle hopes the success of his tribe will lie in turning coal into liquid diesel. ""It will open the door for Indian Country in energy fields and help this country start veering away from its dependence on foreign oil,"" he says. As the group meets to discuss coal, Bowers recalls that it was the need for beef that prompted his idea for the Native American Group. ""Here we have all these cafes, casinos -- everybody eats a hamburger,"" says Bowers. ""And than (I) realized that we don't have enough beef to supply our own needs, and that's when I reached out to other Native Americans that did have cattle."" Bowers discovered there are more than 2 million heads of cattle on Indian land. If there is not enough cattle on Indian land, then members of the group are encouraged to keep the business in the country and buy American. The Native American Group has come a long way since Bowers was looking for cattle. The group now has more than 100 tribal members and more than 100 Native-owned businesses. One successful business that joined the group is the largest Native American-owned contractor, Flintco. Robin Flint Ballenger, who is Cherokee, is its chairman of the board. ""It wasn't a far stretch for me at all to take a risk on this new organization because we are successful, we're doing very well,"" says Ballenger, who adds that a third of the company's work is done for Native America. One of the projects Flintco is working on is a casino being built on Choctaw tribal land in Durant, Oklahoma. With every Native American-owned casino, Bowers sees an economic opportunity for all. ""Trash bags, everybody uses trash bags -- so just for an example, let's all get together and order trash bags and it's going to be cheaper on all of us,"" Bowers says, pointing out that there is a Native American trash bag supplier. When discussing the potential of the Native American Group, Ballenger remembers something her father used to show her. ""(He) showed me one stick and [said] you can break one stick easily,"" Ballenger recalls. ""When you bundle many sticks together, it is impossible to break."" This is her wish for the consortium -- ""That we will bundle these many sticks together and become impossible to break.""","Seminole Tribe owns Hard Rock properties, looks to help unify Native Americans .

"(CNN) -- Fresh faced and pictured wearing a crisp military uniform, the photo of a young Jim Tuckwell looks like it was taken before he'd seen action. But in fact, at the age of just 22, he had already experienced the full horrors of war. World War II veteran Jim Tuckwell as a young soldier. Shot twice on Gold beach during the Normandy Invasion or ""D-Day landings,"" Tuckwell was later deafened by a shell that blew off his friend's legs nearby. By the end of the war, the British soldier had been promoted to the rank of full sergeant, as he put it, simply because so many of his seniors had been killed. Now 86-years-old, he and many of his former comrades will remember the 65th anniversary of the landings Saturday at ceremonies along the French coast. It was a massive air and sea operation that marked the turning point of the war in Europe. And he knows how lucky he is to be alive. ""My mate Jimmy went up the beach with two cases of bombs. I never saw him again. If I hadn't been hit, who's to say I wouldn't have been in the same position as he was when he was killed?"" With bullet wounds to his chest and arm, Tuckwell collapsed unconscious on the beach. It was more than nine hours later that he was picked up by the stretcher-bearers. Incredibly, he was back fighting within six weeks.  Watch Tuckwell tell his story Â» . So much time has passed since then, but the pain is still etched into his face. Sitting there in full military uniform, blazer adorned with half a dozen medals, his voice frequently cracks with emotion. He frequently tails off as he relives the past. ""Every time I go back to Normandy I go to his grave, and it brings a tear to me eye even now. We were going do so much after the war ... but it never happened."" Tuckwell, who saw action with the 1st Battalion, Dorset Regiment, has since formed a close friendship with Frank Rosier; they are members of the Normandy Veterans Association. Both men say their experiences were so commonplace among their generation that none were able to talk about it until 40 years later. Rosier told me that what he and the veterans discuss among themselves is very different to what is said in television interviews; but when pushed, he describes what it's like to kill another man. ""We could never get our fathers to talk about the first World War, because they were involved in close combat. And twice in the second World War it happened to me. ""I came face to face with a German, and I beat him to the draw. I killed him. I sat on the grass and was sick and I cried ... he was some mother's son."" I get the sense that there was a great deal of respect between these soldiers and the Germans on the other side. Younger generations try to relate to the scale and the carnage of D-Day through movies like ""Saving Private Ryan."" The veterans talk of the noise, ""big battleships firing, rocket ships firing, mortars landing, planes strafing, floating artillery and the Germans were totally unsociable about it, they were firing back at us, so there was a hell of a lot of noise there,"" recalls Rosier. They are lighthearted at times, citing the fact that British troops are renowned for their humor -- even in the darkest hours. But it is impossible to gloss over the horror and the danger they faced. Standing together in one of the landing crafts at the D-Day museum in Portsmouth, England, Rosier described what it was like to approach Gold beach.  Watch Rosier's full interview Â» . He spoke of the bullets thundering into the sides of the craft, a ramp on one side hitting a mine and being disabled, and the knowledge that when the front ramp was dropped, the troops inside would be peppered with machine gun fire. He and his infantry were lucky that day - making it onto the beach with minimal loss. But as he told me later, of the 800 men in his infantry, only five survived the war unharmed, ""the rest were killed, missing or wounded."" Rosier, who fought with the 2nd Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment, bears the visible scars of battle. He lost an eye to a shrapnel wound -- a 'Blighty one,' meaning that he was taken home to recover in Britain -- and has had to live with the psychological trauma of facial disfigurement. But it's the pain of the ones they left behind that hurts the most. ""There was no time to mourn, you didn't have time to mourn,"" said Tuckwell. ""And the worst thing about later battles was that when you lost people, you normally had to bury them yourself. You couldn't leave the bodies on the ground, there was nowhere else to put them."" Rosier added: ""When your best friend gets killed it is surprising how hard you can become on a battlefield, I think you switch your mind off. My best friend, we called him Smokey Joe, Battersea boy, London boy, he was 18 years when he died. ""At the time I just said 'oh Reggie is gone,' but ... I will be going back to Normandy and I will see his grave and cry. I have never figured out why I a mourn him now and not at the time. To lose a brother is a terrible thing and he was a brother. I lost two actual brothers in the war, but I miss Reg a lot."" There was so much pain, so much suffering and such massive loss of life. Was it worth it? Rosier's response is emphatic. ""Yes, every minute of it. We go back to Europe quite frequently, and even in Germany people say to us 'thank you for our freedom'. It is only in recent years that I have realized how important freedom really is, you can't taste it, you can't feel or hear it.

"KATHMANDU, Nepal (CNN) -- The leader of Nepal's former communist rebels was named as the country's new prime minister Friday. Prachanda is still the supreme commander of the Maoists People's Liberation Army. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, also known as Prachanda, was elected four months after elections in which his Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) became the largest party in the 601-member constituent assembly. Prachanda received 464 votes of the 577 votes cast, while his rival Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress party received 113 votes. Most of the parties in the assembly voted for the Maoist candidate. A simple majority was enough to be elected the prime minister. Prachanda's victory became certain on Thursday when the third and fourth biggest parties in Nepal's assembly decided to back him. He will now lead a coalition government, although talks are ongoing on about the allocation of ministerial portfolios. The Maoists signed a peace deal with the government in November 2006, joined an interim parliament and government in 2007 and fought multi-party elections in April this year. The Communist Party of Nepal unexpectedly became the largest party in the elections, winning 220 of the 575 elected seats in the assembly. The assembly declared Nepal a republic in May and in July elected Nepal's first president, physician Ram Baran Yadav. Prachanda, 54, entered politics when he was 17 but went underground in 1981, making his first public appearance after 25 years in 2006. The Maoists launched an insurgency to abolish the monarchy in 1996 and the ten-year conflict claimed more than 13,000 lives. According to the peace deal agreed in 2008, the estimated 19,602 Maoist combatants would be integrated into the country's security structure, the process of which is yet to be worked out. Prachanda remains the supreme commander of the Maoists People's Liberation Army. Besides completing the peace process, the new government has to face many challenges including inflation, lawlessness, impunity and ethnic aspirations.","Prachanda, Communist Party of Nepal chairman, won 464 out of 577 votes .

"LEESBURG, Virginia (CNN) -- The clock is ticking for Ray O'Bryhim: he has less than a week to sell his last 40 cars. This Virginia dealership cannot legally sell any new Chryslers, Dodges or Jeeps after June 9. His ads for Pohanka Chrysler-Dodge scream, ""Everything must go, regardless of profit!"" On June 9, his franchise to sell new Chryslers and Dodges will be terminated, along with those of almost 800 other Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep dealers nationwide. This comes as a result of Chrysler's announcement last month that they would shrink their dealer base in the United States. O'Bryhim cannot legally sell any new cars he has left after June 9 -- and because the manufacturer is in bankruptcy protection it isn't obligated to take them back. A customer comes out of his showroom with the keys in her hand for a new Dodge Nitro SUV she just bought. She won't give her name, because she took the day off work to pounce on the discount. But she says she has been monitoring new-car prices for months, and they just took a steep dive, so she came in and made off like a bandit. O'Bryhim points to a new Nitro he has discounted 40% off the sticker: $17,510 instead of the MSRP of $29,170. Soon, he says, he may mark it down even further. ""As we get closer to June 9,"" he says, ""we're going to have to do what we have to do to move these cars.""  Watch how dealerships are making record price cuts Â»  His salesmen have sold 80 cars in the 19 days since their termination letter arrived, with the cars and minivans selling faster than the trucks. Nationwide, Chrysler's terminated dealers had about 44,000 cars sitting on their lots when they got their notifications May 14. Chrysler spokeswoman Kathy Graham says the company plans to help redistribute any leftover inventory to the 2,400 surviving dealers, who could otherwise run low while factories are idled. ""Our manufacturing facilities have been shut down since May 1,"" she said. ""We have dealers that are looking for inventory."" Down the street at Dulles Motor Cars, Hamid and Kevin Saghafi have sold off about half their $1.5 million inventory of Jeeps. Hamid says they are ""taking a beating,"" asking $10,000 less than the invoice price for high-end models like the Jeep Commander. But he still worries they won't be able to sell them all in time. ""Chrysler has told us they're going to help us send these cars to other dealers' inventories,"" he says. ""But we don't know what kind of prices we're going to be offered."" The affected dealerships are not only furiously trying to sell off their inventory; at the same time, they are trying to figure out what they will do once they stop selling new Chryslers, and how they can save the jobs of their employees. Pohanka will focus on service and used-car sales, or maybe switch to another brand; Dulles will focus on the two other brands they already sell, Subaru and Kia. How much do the Saghafi brothers stand to lose in shutting their Jeep showroom? ""Millions,"" says Kevin. CNN's Brian Todd contributed to this report.","Nearly 800 Chrysler/Dodge/Jeep dealerships must stop selling new cars by June 9 .

"(CNN) -- For CNN, Tiananmen Square was a watershed story -- a seminal moment in the network's history. Beijing bureau chief Mike Chinoy, producer Nancy Lane and Moscow bureau chief Steve Hurst . Only nine years old in 1989, CNN was the only 24-hour news station on the air at the time. But staffers say the network suffered an inferiority complex when comparing itself to the major players in American television, who had dismissed the new upstart for years as ""Chicken Noodle News."" Enter Tiananmen Square. Change the face of television news. Take your place in the big leagues.  ""It put CNN on the map,"" said Mike Chinoy, CNN's Beijing bureau chief during the crisis. ""It was the first time an upheaval in a previously isolated, distant, inaccessible location suddenly was available on television sets in living rooms and foreign ministries around the world. It was a pivotal moment for television."" And it was an accident too. Foreign reporters had flooded Beijing to cover the historic visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev. Suddenly, they found themselves covering a very different story. For CNN, it all started in early April when Alec Miran, CNN's special events producer for the Gorbachev visit, went to Beijing to propose an ""outlandish idea"" to the Chinese authorities -- bringing in the network's own transmission equipment to beam live television pictures from China. ""It was unprecedented,"" said Miran. Before that, networks would feed their material from CCTV (Chinese Central Television), who would monitor -- and censor -- everything that was sent out. ""Our own transmission was a scary idea to them,"" said Miran. But he says he thinks the Chinese eventually agreed -- after much back and forth -- because, above all, they wanted international coverage of Gorbachev's visit. The Chinese gave CNN permission to bring in their own ""flyaway"" satellite dish and additional microwave gear to be able to transmit live -- a permission unheard of at the time in closed, Communist China. CNN was granted exactly one week's permission, timed to coincide with the Soviet leader's visit.  See photos of the CNN team in Tiananmen Square in 1989 Â» . CBS was also granted permission to transmit live, but because CNN was on the air 24 hours a day, the permission it was granted turned out to be much more significant. ""On the first day of the Gorbachev visit, we not only had our own satellite transmission, we also had a live camera overlooking the square,"" said Miran. ""We were really well set up."" But the situation was deteriorating rapidly for the Chinese leadership. Huge groups of students demanding reform had occupied Tiananmen Square and had launched a hunger strike just days before the Soviet leader's visit was about to begin. CNN's live camera, at the Gate of Heavenly Peace overlooking the square, showed the hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who had gathered in Tiananmen Square where Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was due to greet Gorbachev at the Great Hall of the People. ""On the day of the big meeting, we waited, and waited, and waited, watching the signal from CCTV,"" said Miran. ""No picture. We called our contact at CCTV to see if there were technical problems. Nope."" ""They couldn't take Gorbachev in the front door of the Great Hall of the People because there were more than a million people in the square asking for reform,"" said Cynde Strand, CNN's cameraperson in Beijing at the time. ""The students upstaged Deng in one of his biggest moments, his big rapprochement with the Soviet Union."" And the massive crowd -- as well as the non-appearance of Deng welcoming Gorbachev at the Great Hall of the People -- was all captured live on CNN. Soon afterwards, the Chinese informed CNN they could no longer maintain their live position overlooking the square, a position that had become vital for the network's coverage. Entire shows anchored by Bernard Shaw had been taped there. Miran and Chinoy huddled and decided that although the Chinese had forbidden further transmission from the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the network still had permission to use its portable microwave transmitter. So for the next few days -- always looking nervously over their shoulder -- CNN continued live transmissions using their microwave transmitter, both from their bureau at the Sheraton hotel -- but also from the middle of Tiananmen Square. ""Everywhere you looked, there was a great picture,"" said Miran. ""Soldiers would be on the steps of the Great Hall of the People and students would go up to them, offering flowers or to read to them. There were long staring contests between the armed soldiers and the students. It was riveting television."" On the night of May 19, after the network had gotten word that troops were moving towards Beijing, Shaw and Moscow correspondent Steve Hurst broadcast from Tiananmen Square for several hours -- in the dark. The students in the square were edgy and had asked them to turn off their lights. ""I don't remember what we were able to show people that night,"" Miran said, ""little flickers of light."" The next morning, Chinese authorities arrived at CNN's bureau and ordered the network to cease transmitting -- before its week-long permission had expired.  Watch a Chinese official order CNN staff in Beijing to stop broadcasting Â» . Again, the entire exchange between CNN and the Chinese officials was captured on live television.  Watch the moment when CNN stopped transmitting Â» . ""You get almost numb to it now,"" said Vito Maggiolo, CNN assignment editor on duty in Beijing at the time. ""But that live capability -- people watching events as they happen -- was truly special at that time."" ""It was our first big live moment,"" said camerawoman Strand, now director of coverage for international news in Atlanta. ""And it became our signature, what we did very well."" At one point in the live stand-off, while CNN tried to buy time before pulling the plug on itself, Marin gave out his telephone number for the Chinese authorities to call him -- an attempt to squeak out just a few more minutes of air time. The phone rang. It was a woman from Minnesota, a viewer who had been watching the events unfold in China from the comfort -- and safety -- of her living room. ""You're doing a great job' she said to me,"" Miran recalled. ""Everybody's watching. And we're rooting for you."" ""It was all just momentous,"" Miran said. ""I felt like we had actually made a difference. And if people hadn't heard of CNN before, they had certainly heard of it then.""

"TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Gunmen on motorcycles fired Friday on a campaign office for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, wounding two adults and a child, according to a report by Iran's state-run news agency. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was not present at the time of the attack. The shooting happened about 5 p.m. in front of the entrance to the campaign office, campaign representative Mohammed Reza Zahed Shaikhi told IRNA. Ahmadinejad, who is running for a second term in office, was not present. Iran's presidential election will take place on June 12. The attack happened in Sistan-Balochistan province in southeastern Iran, the same province where a Shia mosque was bombed Thursday. Several suspects have been arrested in connection with Thursday's attack in the town of Zahedan, which killed between 15 and 20 people, according to Iranian media reports. No group publicly accepted responsibility for the mosque attack, but the provincial governor, Ali-Mohammad Azad, blamed a terrorist group that he said would be unveiled to the public once the suspects have been interrogated, IRNA reported. Zahedan is about 1,100 km (700 miles) southeast of Tehran, near Iran's borders with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Sistan-Balochistan province -- which shares a border with Pakistan -- is the site of frequent clashes involving Iranian police, drug dealers and armed groups. The province is located on a major narcotics-smuggling route between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Azad said information on the arrested terrorist group would be unveiled to the public once interrogations were complete. ""The terrorists and notorious gang planned to stir order and security in the province on the eve of (the June 12 presidential) elections, using ongoing insecurity in our eastern neighbors,"" he said Thursday. Several days of mourning were reported to be under way for victims of the explosion. Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a hard-line cleric who led Friday prayers in Tehran, said there were signs that the United States and Israel were involved in the mosque bombing, IRNA reported. The cleric, who put the death toll at 25, condemned the bombing before a congregation on the Tehran University campus. CNN's Shirzad Bozorghmehr contributed to this report.","Gunmen fire on campaign office for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, .

"(CNN)  -- Free elections 20 years ago this week in Poland marked the unraveling of the Soviet bloc of Eastern European nations and the beginning of market reforms. Shipyard workers hold Solidarity trade union flags on the anniversary of free elections in Poland. The events of June 1989 also marked the turning point for companies like KGHM, which has grown into a global player in the world's copper market and one of Poland's largest companies with 18,000 employees. ""A lot of changes have happened since that moment, since 1989,"" said Zbigniew Klich, a development engineer who has worked at a company copper smelter near Lubin for more than 30 years. ""This is the Poland of my dreams,"" Klich said. ""Even though I will probably retire in the next few months I feel so fortunate to have seen the last 20 years in my professional career."" The financial crisis has had minimal impact on the company so far. ""In comparison to other sectors of the Polish economy, the commodity business has been doing quite well,"" said Jarek Romanowski, sales director of KGHM. Poland's export prowess has led the nation to become one of the great success stories of former communist bloc economies. In 2008, it ranked 22nd in the world with more than $190 billion in exports, ahead of Australia and India, according to the CIA Factbook. The country's economy has grown every year since 1992, and bucked the recessionary trend of other European Union nations by expanding its economy by just under 1 percent in the first quarter of this year. ""Poland is not an island and we are very much linked to other EU countries so a lot depends on the performance of the German economy,"" said Dominik Radziwill, Poland's deputy finance minister. ""But even with the current forecasts which are really pessimistic for the German economy, we still think Poland should be doing relatively OK."" Leszek Balcerowicz was the country's first Finance Minister after the fall of communism and initiated Poland's free market reforms. ""Socialism (was) a very bad system and everybody knew that it was a bad system without any hope for a better life,"" he said. ""Transition to a better system is sometimes difficult but you have to overcome these difficulties on the way to a better regime."" One industry that exploded was Poland's once state-run media industry, which now includes eight daily national newspapers plus dozens of television channels and radio stations. ""The transformation had many phases in Poland. The state totally withdrew from the press market and step-by-step, private TV stations appeared,"" said Polish journalist Adam Mischnik. ""So, today we have a pluralist media which represents very different tendencies."" Janusz Weychert and Mariusz Walter founded the ITI group, a leading private media company in Poland with television stations - including the influential news network TVN24 - as well as a home video, new media and theatrical production operations. ""Under one umbrella there's various projects put together,"" Weychert said. ""The advantage it gives us is the free flow of content and information between all the platforms."" Communism and absolute media control may have only been twenty years ago - but in Poland today, certainly for the country's youth and the media, it's a lifetime. Maciej Popowicz set up ""Nasza-Klasa"" - Poland's equivalent to Facebook -- with three friends in 2006. Its success made 25-year-old Popowicz one of Poland's youngest millionaires. He's also too young to remember what life was like under Communism. ""I'm very glad that I live in these times because we have so many more opportunities than our older friends so for example, you couldn't manage your own business twenty years ago, now there is an opportunity to do that,"" Popowicz said. ""So you can develop your ideas, create your own firms."" But market reforms haven't been kind to the historic shipyards of Gdansk, where the Solidarity Union movement began with union leader and future Polish president, Lech Walesa. Marching with him was Brunom Baranowski, a shipyard worker for more than 30 years who spent nearly a year in jail for civil disobedience for his role in the union. In the 20 years since the end of communism, he's seen the shipyard workforce shrink from 18,000 to about 2,700 today. The shipyard, in danger of going bankrupt, was given a lifeline this week when Neelie Kroes, European Commissioner for Competition, met with Polish officials and told the press an EU bailout of the shipyard was likely. Still, Baranowski said ""shipyard workers don't have much reason to be happy. Over the past 20 years we have been trying to save our jobs."" While the fortune of his nation improved, he still lives in the same tiny apartment as he did in 1989 and has the same worries about his job. But Brunom says it was all worth the fight. ""Of course it's much better. In the old days all you could get at the shop was vinegar and mustard. To get anything else you had to know people. Now everything is available,"" he said. CNN's Fred Pleitgen and Fionnuala Sweeney contributed to this report.","Twenty years after democracy Poland has strongest economy in former Soviet bloc .

"(CNN) -- Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland's former finance minister, recently said his country is enjoying ""its best period in 300 years."" CNN looks at how the country emerged from communism to become one of eastern Europe's most stable and thriving democracies. Solidarity leader Lech Walesa addresses striking workers in Gdansk, Poland in 1989. Modern Poland gained independence in 1918 only to be overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union during the Second World War. Almost six million Poles, including the majority of the country's large Jewish population, died during the devastating six-year conflict. The shadow of Stalin continued to loom large over Poland after the war, when the communist-dominated government ensured that Poland would become a Soviet satellite state for the next 40 years. The following decades were punctuated by revolts against the repressive authoritarian regime in Warsaw, but none had a greater impact on Poland's political future than events in 1980 at a shipyard in western Poland. With a struggling economy and rumors of corruption and mismanagement within the state causing widespread discontent, a series of strikes by workers paralyzed the country. Eventually the government was forced to negotiate and on August 31, 1980, workers at the massive Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, led by an electrician named Lech Walesa, signed a deal giving workers the right to strike and form trade unions. This heralded the creation of the Solidarity movement, which would ultimately be instrumental in bringing Poland's communist era to an end. The presence in the Vatican at the time of Polish-born Pope John-Paul II was also a significant influence on the movement throughout the 1980s, as the Catholic church had remained a very potent force in Polish life. The Pope even made a visit to the country in 1979. Despite Soviet-endorsed attempts to slow the erosion of the regime's grip on power -- including the declaration of martial law by General Wojciech Jaruzelski in 1981 which outlawed Solidarity -- Poland's worsening economic situation, compounded by further nationwide strikes, meant that the government had no alternative but to negotiate a date for free elections with Walesa and the Solidarity movement. Solidarity members won a stunning victory in the election of 1989, taking almost all the seats in the Senate and all of the 169 seats they were allowed to contest in the Sejm or parliament. This gave them substantial influence in the new government. Activist and journalist Tadeusz Mazowiecki was appointed prime minister, while Lech Walesa was elected as president the following year. Were you in Poland in 1989? Send us your memories . After years of economic mismanagement under the communists, Poland embarked on a painful reform program under finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz -- especially in traditional heavy industries such as coal and steel -- which moved away from the inefficient state-controlled system of economic planning. Despite growing unemployment and a dilapidated infrastructure, Poland was slowly transformed into an investment-friendly, market economy. Banking and lending policies were reformed, while newly reshaped ownership relations, independent enterprises and strengthened domestic competition all had a massive impact. Over a relatively short period of time, Poland had become one of the most dynamically developing economies in Europe and by the mid-1990s, it became known as the ""Tiger of Europe."" Poland also liberalized its international trade during this period. The national currency -- the zloty -- became convertible to other currencies and internal convertibility was also established, providing another platform for dynamic economic growth. New markets in countries that had been treated not so long before as ideological as well as economic enemies were opened up to Polish companies. The EU and U.S. were now the key markets for Polish goods. This realignment of policy was emphasized by its accession into the European Union in 2004. It had also joined NATO in 1999. Unfortunately the continuing problem of high unemployment and the promise of better salaries encouraged many Poles to work in other EU countries after 2004. However this trend started to reverse in 2008 as the Polish economy enjoyed a boom period. Politically, Poland has also successfully transformed itself into a fully democratic country. Since 1991 the Polish people have voted in parliamentary elections and four presidential elections -- all free and fair. Incumbent governments have transferred power smoothly and constitutionally in every instance to their successors.","Poland was ruled by Soviet-backed regime after the Second World War .

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- A Brazilian supreme court judge on Tuesday suspended a lower court's order that would have given custody of a 9-year-old boy to the U.S. Consulate in Rio de Janeiro, where he was to be reunited with his American father. David Goldman has been fighting for custody of his son, Sean, since the boy's mother took him to Brazil in 2004. Judge Marco Aurelio argued against taking Sean Richard Goldman from what has been his home for almost five years to the United States ""in an abrupt manner."" Doing so, he wrote in his order published on the court's Web site, could subject the boy to psychological harm. The decision, which means the entire Brazilian supreme court will take up the case, comes a day after a superior court justice ordered Sean taken Wednesday to the U.S. Consulate in Rio and handed over to his father, David Goldman, who arrived Tuesday from New Jersey to pick up his son. The two were separated in June 2004 when the boy's Brazilian mother, Bruna Bianchi Carneiro Ribeiro, told Goldman -- to whom she was then married -- that she was taking the boy on a two-week vacation to Brazil.  Watch Goldman describe his fight to get his son back Â» . Mother and son never returned. Instead, Bianchi stayed in Brazil, where she divorced Goldman and married a Brazilian lawyer. But in September, Bianchi's death during childbirth led Goldman to renew his efforts to regain custody of their son. Sean, who has been living with his half-sister and his stepfather, was to have spent a 30-day adaptation period in the United States before his father gained full custody. That prospect sparked outrage from an attorney representing the boy's Brazilian relatives. ""The child wasn't heard,"" lawyer Sergio Tostes said. ""The child said many times that he wanted to stay in Brazil. This is not human, and it is a cruelty."" The case has attracted high-level attention. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton referred to the case Monday, telling reporters, ""I also wanted just to take this opportunity to recognize the decision by the Brazilian federal court today ordering a young American boy, Sean Goldman, to be reunited with his father, David. It's taken a long time for this day to come, but we will work with the Goldman family and the Brazilian government, with the goal of ensuring this young boy's return."" David Goldman's attorney, Patricia Apy, did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.

"(The Frisky)  -- Recently, I discovered that one of my best friends had ditched me after I logged onto Facebook and found her profile had disappeared from my page. When you break up with a best friend online, things can get murky. We'd been having problems that had culminated in a huge argument the day before, but I figured we'd get through it. I figured wrong. Still, being given the heave-ho by way of a social networking site? My first reaction was to laugh. I mean, we're adults. Unfriending me seemed tantamount to toilet-papering my locker or scribbling my phone number on the boy's locker room wall. We had been close for well over a decade. We supported each other through parental deaths, and together we'd bitched and moaned about men for untold hours. I loved her amazing daughter -- buying that little girl Christmas presents was the highlight of my holidays. Suddenly, that was all gone. Suddenly, I wasn't laughing. I was crying. We know what to do when boyfriends dump us: sob. We eat everything in the house or take to our beds and refuse all sustenance. Usually, there's yelling -- at least at my house.

But when you break up with a girlfriend, things are murkier. For one thing, people don't feel sorry for you the way they do when a romantic relationship bites the dust. You can't blame them; it's not like you were in love or planning a future with your friend. (Even though you assumed she'd be part of it.) So, getting wound up about the loss seems somehow, I don't know, less legit. Is it? It hurts as much as any other heartbreak. Victoria Clark made a short film on the subject: ""Ruminations on You and Me."" I asked her about the process of grieving a dead friendship. ""As a woman, I expect men to come and go because of the nature of love,"" she explained. ""But your girls are supposed to be on your side, no matter what ...

"RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (CNN) -- The Brazilian air force said that debris picked up Thursday near where officials believe Air France Flight 447 crashed Monday into the Atlantic Ocean was not from the plane. Image released by the Brazilian Air Force shows oil slicks in the water near a debris site. ""It has been verified that the material did not belong to the plane,"" Brigadier Ramon Borges Cardoso told reporters in Recife about the material recovered Thursday. ""It is a pallet of wood that is utilized for transport. It is used in planes, but on this flight to Paris, there was no wooden pallet."" He added that oil slicks seen on the ocean were not from the plane, either, and that the quantity of oil exceeded the amount the plane would have carried. ""No material from the airplane was picked up,"" he said. The announcement left open the question of whether other debris that had not yet been plucked from the ocean might be from the plane. On Wednesday, searchers recovered two debris fields and had identified the wreckage, including an airplane seat and an orange float as coming from Flight 447. Officials now say that none of the debris recovered is from the missing plane. Helicopters had been lifting pieces from the water and dropping them on three naval vessels. Brazilian Air Force planes spotted an oil slick and four debris fields Wednesday but rain and rough seas had kept searchers from plucking any of the debris from the water. Officials said searchers had found objects in a circular 5-kilometer (3-mile) area, including one object with a diameter of 7 meters (23 feet) and 10 other objects, some of which were metallic, Brazilian Air Force spokesman Jorge Amaral said. The debris was found about 650 kilometers (400 miles) northeast of the Fernando de Noronha Islands, an archipelago 355 kilometers off the northeast coast of Brazil. Eleven aircraft and five ships are engaged in the search, including airplanes from France and the United States. Earlier Thursday, a public interfaith service was held for the 228 victims at a 200-year-old Catholic Church in downtown Rio. Joining family members were members of the Brazilian armed forces, who are leading the recovery effort. ""Whoever has faith, whoever believes in God, believes in the eternity of the soul,"" said Mauro Chavez, whose friend lost a daughter on the flight. ""This means everything."" Investigators have not yet determined what caused the plane to crash. The flight data recorders have not been recovered, and the plane's crew did not send any messages indicating problems before the plane disappeared. A Spanish pilot said he saw an ""intense flash"" in the area where Flight 447 came down off the coast of Brazil, while a Brazilian minister appeared to rule out a midair explosion. Meanwhile, a report in France suggested the pilots were perhaps flying at the ""wrong speed"" for the violent thunderstorm they flew into early on Monday before the Airbus A330's systems failed. Le Monde newspaper reported that Airbus was sending a warning to operators of A330 jets with new advice on flying in storms. As several ships trawled the debris site in the Atlantic, Brazil's defense minister said a 20-kilometer (12-mile) oil slick near where the plane, en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, went down indicated it probably did not break up until it hit the water. If true, that would rule out an in-flight explosion as the cause of the crash of Air France Flight 447, Defense Minister Nelson Jobim told reporters. However, both pilots of an Air Comet flight from Lima, Peru, to Lisbon, Portugal, sent a written report on the bright flash they said they saw to Air France, Airbus and the Spanish civil aviation authority, the airline told CNN. ""Suddenly, we saw in the distance a strong and intense flash of white light, which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds,"" the captain wrote. Air Comet declined to identify the pilot's name but said he waited until landing to inform Air Comet management about what he saw. Air Comet then informed Spanish civil aviation authorities. The Air Comet co-pilot and a passenger aboard the same flight also saw the light. But Robert Francis, former vice chairman of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, said the question of determining where a plane broke up ""is a very difficult one to deal with."" He told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360"" that ""there are lots of things that cause a plane to go out of control."" He added that extremely strong winds are not unusual near Brazil. Pilots who fly over that part of the world keep track of radar and ""are very, very wary about the weather as they go back and forth down in that area."" Jobim said currents had strewn the debris widely and that the search area had been expanded to 300 square miles.  Watch report on the struggle to find pieces of the plane Â» .

The NTSB said Wednesday it has accepted an invitation from the French aviation accident investigation authority, the Bureau d'Enquetes et d'Analyses, to aid in the investigation.

Some investigators have noted that the plane flew through a severe lightning storm. Foul play has not been ruled out.

Most of the people on Flight 447 came from Brazil, France and Germany. The remaining victims were from 29 other countries, including three passengers from the United States.

"(CNN) -- For three years, the thieves crept into some of the poshest homes in the most exclusive enclaves in the nation. The gated community of Bel Air was one  of several enclaves targeted by the so-called ""Hillside Burglars."" Police said they finally have a break in the case, and wealthy residents of Los Angeles, California, are breathing a sigh of relief. ""These guys were real good,"" said L.A. City Councilman Jack Weiss, who oversees Bel Air where some of the burglaries were committed. ""They were professionals."" The thieves hauled away more than $10 million worth of valuables and cash from 150 homes in upscale neighborhoods such as Bel Air, Pacific Palisades and Beverly Hills, police said. Homes of Hollywood celebrities, professional athletes and multimillionaires were hit. According to CNN affiliate KABC, country music stars Faith Hill and Tim McGraw and former Paramount Pictures CEO Sherry Lansing were among the victims. DNA evidence led the LAPD to suspected ringleader Troy Corsby Thomas, 45, of Los Angeles. He was arrested near L.A. International Airport last weekend. Police say Thomas led a gang dubbed the ""Hillside Burglars"" that targeted the neighborhoods overlooking Sunset Boulevard. ""It's a very euphoric, satisfying feeling that we got this person,"" said the police Lt. David McGill. ""It's a very frustrating feeling to tell the victims, 'I'm sorry I don't have any news for you.' Finally when we got some good detective work and breaks, things started lining up."" Police are looking for more suspects linked to the three-year spree but are not naming them. Thomas is being held on $2 million bail, according to the L.A. County District Attorney's Office. He is likely to stay in custody because he must reveal the origin of any funds used to pay the bail, authorities said. At a court appearance Tuesday, Thomas pleaded not guilty to two charges of residential burglary, one in January 2006 and another in March 2008. The preliminary court date for Thomas will be set on January 29 and additional charges are expected to be filed, according to CNN affiliates KABC and KTLA. Police will not comment on Thomas' background. The Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas told police he had been working as an auto broker. The Hillside Burglars have not struck since Thomas' arrest, police said. ""Hallelujah!"" said L.A. Councilman Bill Rosendahl, whose district includes Brentwood and Pacific Palisades. ""Even a crafty crook does make his mistake and that's what happened to this one."" Some residents are cautiously optimistic. ""We're delighted,"" said Robert RenÃ©, president of Brentwood Homeowners Association, which represents about 800 homes. ""We are very fortunate to have the due diligence of the Westside LAPD."" Harvey I. Saferstein, president of the Bel Air Association, agreed, ""We are all obviously thankful and relieved."" The financially strapped LAPD created a Hillside Burglars task force. People donated cameras and other equipment and police stepped up patrols. The outlay amounted to ""millions of dollars,"" Rosendahl said. Neighborhood watch groups formed. One in Bel Air donated $8,000 for infrared cameras that can spot burglars in the dark. Robert Ringler, president of the Bel Air Beverly Crest Neighborhood Council, hosted a community meeting with the LAPD at the five-star Bel Air Hotel a year and a half ago. As swans swam in ponds in the background, about 150 Westside residents sipped Perrier and vented their fears. ""It had gotten to be such an epidemic,"" Ringler said. The impressive mansions -- usually gated and hidden by walls and hedges -- dot the lush hillsides and canyons between the coast and the mountains. The qualities that make them so desirable also make them vulnerable. The seclusion that appeals to upscale homeowners also appeals to thieves. Because many of the homes are tucked into the sides of mountains and canyons, behind gates, it's easy for a thief to escape unseen and hard for police to get there quickly. ""It's the perfect target,"" Ringler said. ""You can access the property and nobody would ever see you."" Frequently, maids, pool workers and gardeners have access to the property, which allows burglars to pass as the help and slip in unchallenged. According to police and media reports, the methods were sophisticated. Burglars waited till homeowners went on vacation or out for the night. They used lawn furniture and ladders to creep into the second floor, which often lacked alarms. They quickly went in, looked for jewelry, safes and cash, and ducked out with the goods. They never attacked any of the homeowners, preferring stealth to confrontation. Residents say they learned to keep jewelry and other valuables in safety deposit boxes and out of sight. Many added alarm systems and insured their belongings. ""It's not just about money,"" said Robin Stevens, who lives with her husband and son in Brentwood. ""A lot of people lost things of sentimental value."" Stevens, whose neighbors have been burglarized,  said she feels safer knowing that police arrested Thomas, but will continue hiding her mother's antique jewelry and locking the windows. During a two-week trip to the South Pacific last fall, Stevens made sure to e-mail her neighbors, notifying them that she would be gone so they could look out for strangers. Other residents remain skeptical. Pacific Palisades Community Council Chairman Richard G. Cohen said he feels relief but is waiting for a conviction. ""The arrest doesn't mark the end of our concern,"" he said. With the economy in a tailspin, Steve Twining, who serves on the West Los Angeles Police advisory board, believes thefts will continue. ""In these dire economic times, I don't think it's going to dissuade others from trying to do the same thing,"" he said. ""The burglary situation will probably get worse before it gets better.""","Wealthy Bel Air, Beverly Hills residents feel cautious relief .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British authorities and environmental groups were welcoming the launch this week of the world's first biodegradable chewing gum, which they say could help save some of the millions spent on clearing up the mess ordinary gum creates. Manufacturers say the gum decomposes within six weeks. The new gum becomes non-adhesive when dry and decomposes to dust within six weeks, a spokesman for Mexico's Chicza Mayan Rainforest Chewing Gum told CNN. The makers of Chicza say it is the first biodegradable chewing gum ever sold. Environmental and waste management groups told CNN that they, too, believe it is a first. Unlike other gums that contain petrochemicals the natural gum is produced from the sap of the chicozapote tree found in the Mexican rainforest, a spokesman for Chicza told CNN. A spokesman for campaign group Keep Britain Tidy told CNN they welcome any product that can help eradicate the staining on pavements caused by dropped chewing gum. Removing chewing gum litter costs local authorities Â£150 million ($222 million) a year, a spokesman for the Local Government Association told CNN. Sixty-five percent of British streets have chewing gum stuck on them, a spokesman from Keep Britain Tidy told CNN. One of the worst-affected areas is Westminster in central London, where a comprehensive gum clean-up would cost Â£9 million ($13.4 million), according to Westminster City Council. ""Gum litter is a constant problem for us, especially given the vast number of visitors to Westminster every day. We spend Â£100,000 ($148,000) a year cleaning ugly blobs of conventional chewing gum off our streets,"" Westminster City Councilor Danny Chalkley said in a written statement. ""It's an incredibly expensive and time-consuming task, so anything that could reduce the problem is very welcome indeed."" he said. British parliamentarians have called on the government to introduce a tax on chewing gum, with the money raised going toward the cost of gum removal. In Britain, offenders can be fined up to Â£80 ($119) for discarding used chewing gum on a street. The producer of the new gum is Consorcio Chiclero, which comprises 46 cooperatives with around 2,000 chicleros farmers, working in an area of 1.3 million hectares of rainforest, according to a statement from Chicza. Locals have been extracting the natural chicle gum base from the bark of the chicozapote trees for a century, a spokesman for Chicza told CNN. After years of exporting the gum base to be used as an ingredient in the manufacture of regular chewing gum, the cooperative recently decided to start making its own gum using only chicle gum base and natural flavorings and sweeteners, Chicza said. The company launched its gum in Britain this week. It is available at a chain of supermarkets and Mexican restaurants. The Chicza gum sells for Â£1.39 ($2.06) for a pack of 12 squares.","Authorities, green groups welcome launch of world's first biodegradable gum .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- For actress Jane Alexander, the criticism of a $50 million boost in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts is a sequel. Tony-award winning actress Jane Alexander says giving money to the arts will save and create jobs. She was chairman of the agency from 1993 through 1997 when arts funding was cut sharply by the Republican-led Congress, which questioned whether it was an appropriate way to use government money. Now the issue is whether giving money to the arts should have been part of the economic stimulus program. Among those who have criticized the new spending this year is Lousiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who delivered the Republican response to President Barack Obama's message to Congress Tuesday. On Monday's ""Larry King Live,"" Jindal said, ""Fundamentally, I don't think $30 million for the federal government to buy new cars, $1 billion for the Census, $50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs."" It's no surprise that Alexander disagrees and argues that arts spending can give a vital boost to the economy. The actress, who will appear later this month in a new comedy at the New York theater company Primary Stages called ""Chasing Manet,"" won a Tony Award for her role in the ""The Great White Hope."" She has been nominated eight times for an Emmy and four times for an Oscar for films including, ""All the President's Men"" and ""Kramer vs. Kramer."" Alexander spoke to CNN.com last week. CNN: What do you think of the controversy over the $50 million in increased government spending for the arts? Alexander: I think it's long overdue and I was very, very happy to see it. Since 1995-96 we had an incredibly decreased budget for the NEA. Finally we're getting back to where it was when I came in [as chairman]. It's all vitally needed. In fact, the endowment has not kept pace with inflation as other agencies have. ... This $50 million will certainly help a great deal. What people forget is that there are over 2 million people in the United States of America who are professional artists. Those are jobs like any other jobs. The artists have families, they have people for whom they're responsible and they give to their communities. We all have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The life part would be health and housing. The liberty part would be our civil rights. And the pursuit of happiness, the arts would come under that. And it's as vital a part of well-being in the United States as anything else. CNN: When you say 2 million artists, could you define artist? Alexander: Well they include everything from writers, painters, all the visual arts spectrum and that's pretty large, including graphic arts. Theater and so on, music, ceramicists, costume designers, makeup artists, filmmakers, it's a huge panoply. CNN: How far can $50 million go? Alexander: Well for the endowment which has had a budget of around $144 million currently, it can go quite a way. When I came in it was about $175 million and then it was cut under my aegis by Congress down to $99 million. CNN: Some people will say that while the NEA may consider this a victory, it's really a pittance, a drop in the bucket, so little money given the challenges many arts organizations are facing today. Alexander. It will help, it will help enormously, because every single NEA grant that goes out is a challenge to the community to come up with the same amount of money, or a 3 to 1. ... By the way, the public should know that within this coming year, we're going to see an awful lot of arts organizations closing. I just came from working at a theater in Pittsburgh, [Pennsylvania] and the International Poetry Forum, which has been going for 43 years, will close its doors this year. The Milwaukee Shakespeare Festival has already closed. The LA [Los Angeles] Opera has laid off 17 percent of its staff. CNN: So this isn't going to be enough to reverse those kinds of things? Alexander: No, but it will challenge the community to understand what the imperiled status of their arts organizations are. It will only help. It will help an enormous amount, and for some organizations, it will make all the difference in their staying alive. Now the NEA this fall gave out 884 grants, totaling $20 million and that was 38 percent of the project cost of the applicants. So 38 percent is a nice healthy piece of change for the cost of a project. CNN: How did you personally get involved in this cause? Alexander: As an actress who spent most of my career in nonprofit theaters, They began with the seed of an NEA grant back in the late 60s, most of them. Today we have about 450 nonprofit theaters across the United States. Back in 1965, when the NEA was founded, there were only about 23 of them. CNN: Your forthcoming play -- is that being done for a nonprofit theater? Alexander: Yes. It's another nonprofit called Primary Stages in New York City, a small theater. What people don't quite understand about theaters is that they never increase their size. They're bound by the number of seats within a given theater, and meanwhile there's inflation and the costs rise. So currently most theaters can never make more than 50 percent of their income from ticket sales. The rest has to be raised. CNN: How's the company doing? Alexander: It had a good play last year, ""Dividing the Estate,"" by Horton Foote, which got a lot of attention but I don't think it made back its nut on Broadway. It transferred from the nonprofit to a commercial venue on Broadway. ... In the film business, independent films are considered nonprofit in many instances. It's interesting to see that an independent won the Academy Award. Of course it was distributed by a major studio. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" started off as an independent. It did extraordinarily well. ... Many of the commercial arts are fed by the nonprofit arts. And that's another thing most people don't fully understand. Where do you think the Tom Hanks, the Cate Blanchetts of the world come from? They come from small venues that are independent and are nonprofit usually and then they move into the mainstream. CNN: What's your attitude about the future, under the Obama administration. Do you think there's reason for hope about the arts, or despair? Alexander: I think there's reason for great hope. President Obama has said repeatedly and he's said it for a couple of years now, that he thinks arts education is vital for children of all ages, starting right away. We have the arts in nursery school anyway, but he believes in institutionalizing the arts so it's part of the curriculum for every child in America. ... Everybody in all walks of life know people who are out of work presently or are about to be out of work. And the same is true for artists. I know so many artists -- for example visual artists, the gallery has closed or it's cut back. Theaters that are no longer going to do productions with more than five actors. And so on. So I know a lot of people out of work: costume designers, makeup people. And let's not forget all the ancillary jobs from having an arts organization in your neighborhood. That includes restaurants, taxicabs, whatever. CNN: Gov. Jindal said he didn't think the arts money should be part of the economic stimulus plan. Alexander: Well what he doesn't understand is that $50 million goes directly ... as a grant to organizations which employ people. It's quick and it's a system that works beautifully and it's done within a year.","Jane Alexander: Increasing funds for the arts is a good way to boost economy .

"(CNN) -- More than nuclear bomb tests, the suicide of former South Korean president Roh Moo-Hyun has stunned the South Korean public. While the news has shocked the nation, perhaps the level of surprise at the method wasn't as great. The suicide of former president Roh has shocked South Korea. In a country with one of the highest suicide rates among economically advanced countries, traditional concepts of honor and public ""face"" remain powerful social forces. According to World Health Organization figures, rates of suicide in South Korea doubled to 21.9 deaths per 100,000 people between 1996 and 2006. The United Nations cites that 90 percent of suicide cases were caused by mental disorders, but socio-cultural and economic pressures play a large part. While each case of suicide has a number of complex personal issues, the connection between suicide and honor has a historical basis in many Asian countries. ""There are cultural histories in Asian societies of honorable suicide, such as hara-kiri in Japan, where the person assumes total responsibility,"" said Dr. Erminia Colucci, research fellow at the University of Melbourne's School of Population Health. ""In many western countries, a suicide in someone of Roh's position might be more about looking for understanding. In collectivist societies, like Japan and Korea, where a person's identity is more tied closely to other groups, suicides can be seen as the ultimate way to rebuild or reclean your image, if it changes."" ""I think there is something paradoxical in it. On one hand, some see it as a way of maintaining status and restoring honor to you and the people you represent, but the pressure from that group could contribute to you considering suicide."" Roh was under investigation for corruption and some believe the pressures he felt just became too great. ""Roh had come to power as a human rights lawyer, as an uneducated outsider pledging to clean up Korean politics, so it was particularly hard on him to have what he stood for and the reality of what happened under his administration. I think that was particularly hard for him to take,"" David King, director of the Korean Studies Institute at the University of Southern California told CNN. Watch more on the rise and fall of Roh . In a suicide note to his family, Roh described his life as ""difficult"" and was sorry for making ""too many people suffer."" Roh had said he was ashamed about the scandal and in the first round of questioning, he said he was losing face and that he was disappointing his supporters. In South Korea, Roh is the latest and highest profile of recent suicides of public figures. In late 2008, two South Korean actors took their lives. Police cited malicious online rumors as a possible cause for the suicide of Cho Jin-sil in October 2008. The blogs and chat rooms had speculated that she had been pressuring fellow actor Ahn Jae-hwan to repay a debt before he took his own life in September 2008.  Video: How South Korean continue mourning Â» . High-profile suicides can make for lurid headlines, which Dr Paul Yip, director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, believes are far from helpful in combating suicide rates. ""Common in Asia is to sensationalize suicides, especially among celebrities. Often the local or national media publish lots of details of how it was done. The media (in Hong Kong) has got better in their responsible reporting,"" he said. ""Whenever famous people kill themselves there is an effect on those people who are most vulnerable from a similar age group -- we see this in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan and China, "" said Yip. ""People at risk can see Roh's death as an example and say, 'Well if he can do it, so can I'. Neither Roh nor any of the high-profile people who have committed suicide would have thought about this affect. There are a number of complex issues. There isn't just one that leads someone to take their life."" Copycat deaths are a worry for Yip, and Colucci agreed that there can be lots of meaning in the method of a suicide, which people may be encouraged to follow. ""The way that Roh died is similar to some of the methods used in Japan, which is interesting. It really suggests it's about the people wanting to relieve the burden they feel they are on others. For young people, it can be really connected to ideas of identity. For many, they feel it's the last thing they have control over,"" said Colucci. Watch CNN's report on Japan's suicide forest . Yip advised the South Korean Ministry of Health during Roh's administration to help them devise a new approach to dealing with mental health issues and the problem of suicide. ""It is sad that Roh, whose government really did a lot to tackle the issue, should have done this. Last year a mental health act was passed by the South Korean government, as it recognized that more steps needed to be taken,"" said Yip. While there are distinct differences between the societies and traditions of Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, Yip was at least encouraged that the Chinese Special Administrative Region has seen a decline in the number of suicide cases since its peak in 2003 of some 1,200 to around 9000 . A key element has been breaking though the taboo of talking about mental health issues, one that Yip believed was common across Asia. ""They've been stigmatized, and very common that it would not be talked about, especially if there is not a good mental health support system in place. Ten years ago in Hong Kong, people didn't want to talk about it."" However, Yip is well aware of the link between suicide rates and economic change, which many have cited as a reason for suicide rates increasing. ""The rate generally goes up more in Asian countries than the west when there is an economic downturn. For an age group like Roh's, suicide can seem like a very traditional, if extreme way to solve problems. The problems at first are economic, but make people feel great shame or disgrace. There is a large sense of pride in middle-age men and working people."" Making it acceptable to talk about problems, making people feel connected to their community and having a support system in place were methods Yip believed has helped to reduce those at risk. But it was not just something that charities or governments can work on, Yip said: ""We have to reach out to the main concern groups, it's a multi-layered approach.""","South Korea has one of the highest rates of suicide in developed countries .

"(CNN) -- William Whitaker is certain that somebody in the central Oklahoman community where he lives knows who killed his daughter. Taylor Paschal-Placker, left, and Skyla Jade Whitaker were found shot to death along an Oklahoma road a year ago. The dirt road where the bodies of 11-year-old Skyla Jade Whitaker and Taylor Paschal-Placker, 13, were found is too remote for the killings to be the work of a stranger passing through, he says. ""There's absolutely no way that somebody from out of the area could've just stumbled upon the place,"" Whitaker said. ""I know whoever did it told somebody, whether they were drinking or bragging or whatever, and whoever knows just needs to bring the information forward."" It has been a year since the two friends were shot multiple times in the stomach and chest less than a half a mile from Taylor's home in the rural community of Weleetka, with a population just over 1,000. ""Taylor was shot five times. My daughter was shot eight times. Thirteen shots between two little girls who never did anything to anyone,"" Whitaker said. ""I don't know how a person can go to work, eat or sleep knowing what they did. I couldn't live with that on my conscience, but they've been doing it for a year now.""  Watch father plead for answers in killings Â» . In the beginning, hundreds of tips poured in. Authorities pursued leads and analyzed evidence, but a year later, they have no suspects or witnesses leading them to any viable conclusions. Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation spokesperson Jessica Brown said during a press conference Monday that authorities have ""good evidence"" in the case but lack the final piece to make an arrest. ""If we could get this one piece of evidence that would help solve this case, that's what we need,"" Brown said Monday. Investigators believe that the killer or killers could be from Okfuskee County, or that a member of the community knows something about what happened to the girls the afternoon of June 4, 2008. ""What we are frustrated about is the lack of cooperation we're getting from members of the public,"" Brown said. She stressed Monday that a $36,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to a conviction. The girls were shot with two different guns, leading to the possibility that two people were involved, Brown said. The OSBI released a sketch of a person wanted for questioning last year, but they have not received information leading to him, she said. But the killings remain fresh in the minds of Oklahomans. A billboard with the girls' faces and a tip hotline has loomed over Interstate 40 for several months. A memorial service was planned for Monday in Weleetka to mark the anniversary. ""I can't go to the dry cleaners, the gym without people asking me, 'what's going on with those two girls?' Everyone in Oklahoma is emotionally involved in this case, and I think it's because it happened to two small children in an area you wouldn't think you'd ever have to worry about,"" Brown said. The same posters adorn storefronts and bulletin boards in banks, restaurants and post offices throughout Okfuskee County, a sparsely populated manufacturing region best known as the birthplace of songwriter Woody Guthrie. Weleetka Police Officer Stacey Rice will never forget the image of the dead girls. He was the second officer on the scene after a relative called 911 around 5:30 p.m. that day. ""I really hope I never see anything like that again. It's just emotionally and visually traumatic. You see two small children lying on the ground like that and it's kind of hard to explain. Makes you want to go find your children,"" said Rice, a father of two teenage boys. ""It took me several minutes to realize what happened, but after a while, it kind of sank in, and that's when emotions started running ... anger, lots of anger, sadness, disbelief. Nobody wanted to believe what had happened."" The incident stripped the small, close-knit community of its innocence as people came to realize that they weren't safe, Rice said. Parents kept close tabs on their children and started locking their doors. Since then, the guard has come down, Rice said. ""I don't think the fear level is as high as it was. People are kind of aware of it, that something like this can happen. They're still cautious, but I don't think as cautious,"" he said. ""Just the monotony of everyday life, the basic routine, people get used to it and they forget about the dangers we face every day. We're not oblivious, but we put it in the back of our mind."" Skyla's father says he and his wife try to carry on for the sake of their youngest daughter, who asks about her older sister nearly every day. Skyla's room is the same as it was a year ago except for the boxes of cards from across the globe, as far as Japan, expressing sympathy and support. Whitaker finds solace in visiting the memorial site set up at the crime scene, where people leave bouquets of flowers, stuffed animals, cards and other mementos. The most recent addition to the site is an 8-foot cross donated by members of the community. ""I just get a feeling whenever I'm there. It's real quiet out there, and I see the stuff people brought and it's kind of comforting, it really is. I know she's in a better place right now, she don't feel sickness, don't feel pain.

"(CNN) -- Researchers have discovered a previously unknown group of rare monkeys in the forests of Vietnam. The Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys were so skittish, researchers captured a photo of only one: an adult male. Several biologists caught fleeting glimpses of about 15 or 20 Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys in a remote area near the Chinese frontier, the wildlife conservation group Fauna & Flora International said Thursday. The ""bizarre-looking"" monkeys -- on the brink of extinction -- were so skittish around people that researchers were able to snap a photo of just one of them: an adult male scampering through the trees. The monkeys were ""very sensitive to the presence of people, giving warning signs to one another and fleeing"" whenever biologists approached, the group said in a statement. ""It was apparent that the monkeys associated humans with danger -- perhaps due to ongoing threats from hunters,"" the group said. So few Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys have survived in the wild that scientists thought until recently that they were extinct. Now they estimate that roughly 200 remain, mainly in parts of northern Vietnam near the Chinese border. Hunters with a taste for bush meat and the loss of habitat have pushed the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey toward extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It classifies the primate as critically endangered ""because its population size is estimated to number fewer than 250 mature individuals, with no subpopulation greater than 50 mature individuals, and it is experiencing a continuing decline."" Fauna & Flora said it is working with a variety of groups to improve the livelihoods and ""reduce human pressures on the forest ecosystem"" in an effort to safeguard the newly discovered group, which was spotted in a patch of forest in the Quan Ba district of Vietnam's Ha Giang province. The sighting thrilled conservation biologist Le Khac Quyet, described by Fauna & Flora as ""one of the few people in the world who can claim to be an expert on this mysterious species"" and as the person credited with discovering the new group of that species. ""When I saw the Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys ... I was overjoyed,"" he said in the Fauna & Flora statement. ""There is still time to save this unique species, but with just 200 or so left and threats still strong, we need to act now.""","About 15 or 20 Tonkin snub-nosed monkeys seen near Chinese frontier .

"(CNN) -- When rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings didn't work for Eddie Freas, he sought another way to kick his 20-year drug and alcohol addiction. Eddie Freas fights drug addiction by putting all his energy into training for triathlons. He swam 2.4 miles. He biked 112 miles. He ran 26.2 miles. The Pennsville, New Jersey, resident found relief in triathlons. ""I feel better when I'm working out,"" said Freas, 33. ""It does wonders for the mind. The reason I started running -- it was a switch that went off in my head. I started feeling positive and feeling great about myself."" Freas spent his youth in pursuit of drugs. At the age of 13, he snuck bottles of Amaretto and rum from his mother's liquor cabinet. He also developed a taste for marijuana and cocaine. By his senior year of high school, Freas was kicked off the wrestling and football teams after failing a drug test. Then in 2007, after a three-day binge, ""I came home and was crying,"" Freas said. ""I was so depressed. I turned on the TV."" The set was tuned to ESPN, which was airing a story about a former drug addict who competed in triathlons. The program's subject was Todd Crandell, who had lost a college hockey scholarship because of a drug addiction. After 13 years of using drugs, Crandell started competing in Ironman races and championed finding positive ways to fight addiction through his program called Racing for Recovery. ""Having an athletic background, I was drawn to getting back in shape,"" Crandell said. ""It makes you turn intellectually and spiritually fit. Exercise is essential. It decreases addiction, depression and you use it as part of the recovery."" Freas was entranced by the parallels. ""His whole story seemed like mine,"" Freas said. ""That's why it hit me so much. It was my story but it happened to somebody else. I knew I had to get back into fitness."" He took a bus to Racing for Recovery's office in Sylvania, Ohio. There, Freas said he learned to ""stay clean and use other things -- fitness, instead of drugs."" On his first day, Freas pushed himself to run 10 miles. ""It killed me,"" Freas said. ""I was just motivated. I was sore for a week and I gradually got into it. As soon as I started including fitness into my everyday lifestyle, it made it so much easier. It kept me busy and because of the physical fitness, it was making me feel better about myself."" He pushed himself to run farther and raced in his first Ironman competition in 2008. ""It's different when you use drugs, you temporarily feel good and afterwards, you feel like doing more drugs,"" Freas said. ""When you go for a long run and do physical fitness, you feel good doing it."" Research in animals and humans show that exercise can be a mild antidepressant. ""It isn't a huge surprise when you consider many positive effects exercise can have with regards to the brain chemistry: dopamine, serotonin, endorphin, epinephrine -- these are all associated with mood altering effects,"" said Dr. Cedric Bryant, the chief science officer for the American Council on Exercise. ""If they're able to get this natural high, through a natural endeavor such as exercise, it allows them to replace the means to achieve that high with a more positive approach."" One study showed that women trying to quit smoking were more successful when they exercised. And the National Institute on Drug Abuse held a conference last year to explore the possible role of physical activity in substance abuse prevention. ""The thought centers around the release of mood-altering brain chemical, mainly endorphins,"" Bryant said. ""It gives you euphoria or what you call 'runner's high.' "" Crandell said some people who battle drug addiction ""want something more than sitting in support groups filled with smoke, complaining about drinking."" ""I've had some of my naysayers from other programs who say you've taken one addiction and replaced it for another,"" Crandell said. ""I've taken addiction and put into a new focus that includes exercise. Exercise for me is essential to my recovery and well-being."" The purpose of Racing for Recovery is not to turn everyone into an athlete, but to focus on positive pursuits in a person's life. ""Whatever you lost during your addiction, that should be your Ironman, not just running,"" Crandell said. ""If your goal is to become a teacher, let that be your Ironman."" After Freas spent six months in Ohio, he returned to his hometown. ""I didn't want to come back home, because this was where I did all the dirt, all the partying and stuff,"" Freas said. ""As time went on, I had to come back here. My life is turned around. I got to help people in my hometown."" Back in New Jersey, Freas helped train Dustin Deckard, 19, a former high school star wrestler, who is recovering from a four-year heroin addiction. Deckard wanted to get clean after a near-fatal overdose. ""I have to be clean the rest of my life,"" Deckard said. ""Sometimes that overwhelms me. I just feel that sometimes it's not fair that other people can go out and have fun and drink and do whatever at a party. But me -- if I do anything -- it's off. I can't stop. I definitely have troubles with that."" Freas and Deckard have developed a brotherhood. ""I know how he was feeling, being down, not wanting to use drugs,"" Deckard said. ""I just relate to him in every way. We both used. He's also into sports and into wrestling like I was. That's what's cool."" This Sunday, Freas and Deckard head to Racing for Recovery's half triathlon at Monroe, Michigan where the teen will race for the first time.","New Jersey man finds solace in exercise after spending youth on drugs .

"(CNN) -- Photographer David DeJonge plans to capture a vanishing bit of history Tuesday on a trip to Arlington National Cemetery near Washington. Antonio Pierro, 110, of Massachusetts served with the U.S. military in World War I and died in 2007. There, he hopes to photograph 107-year-old Frank Buckles, one of the few men still alive who fought in World War I. Buckles will lay a wreath at the grave of Gen. John J. ""Black Jack"" Pershing, who led U.S. forces in Europe in World War I. The visit comes 90 years to the day after the end of World War I, an occasion that led to Veterans Day in the United States and Armistice Day in other nations. For DeJonge, it's a poignant reminder that time is running out in his quest to find and photograph the few surviving veterans of the war, which raged from 1914 to 1918. ""In my view, America has missed the boat in documenting this part of history,"" said DeJonge, a portrait photographer from Zeeland, Michigan. ""It was such a pivotal moment in global history."" He has raced the clock for the past two years to photograph the dwindling number of surviving World War I veterans, a mission he embraces with a keen appreciation for the ticking clock: Eight of 12 veterans he has photographed in the past two years are now dead. ""It's a tragic loss: a tragic loss for the project and for global history,"" he said. ""These are the last breaths of the last souls who witnessed one of the most horrific wars this world has ever seen.""  Watch photo sessions with remaining veterans Â» . DeJonge knows of only 10 living veterans worldwide who fought during World War I. Four live in Britain, two in Australia, two in France and two in the United States: Buckles and 108-year-old John Babcock of Spokane, Washington, who served with Canadian forces during World War I, DeJonge said. Each week or month that passes, it seems, brings news of an aging veteran succumbing before DeJonge can find the time and money to photograph him. Not long ago, he said, two Jamaicans who fought with the British during World War I died. The last known German, French and Austro-Hungarian veterans died in the last year as well. ""These are the last of the last,"" he said. DeJonge said he became interested in photographing war veterans in 1996, when he worked on a project to chronicle U.S. veterans of several wars. The subjects included two men who served during World War I. He tried to interest a photography organization in a national project to document the remaining U.S. World War I veterans -- about 600 were alive in the mid-1990s, DeJonge said -- but that didn't happen. So he set out two years ago to try to do it on his own. DeJonge has received some financial help here and there, he said, but has paid most costs himself. ""I have paid about $100,000 of my own money,"" he said. He spends about half his time at home in Michigan, taking photographs to earn his living. He spends the other half conducting research, traveling to points distant or photographing aging vets. ""I have an incredibly supportive wife,"" he said. He is trying to find money and time to take pictures of two vets in Australia and two in France, he said. And he would love to check out unconfirmed reports of an elderly man in the Ukraine who says he served with the Russian military during what also is known as the Great War and the War to End All Wars. In March, he donated nine portraits of World War I veterans that the Pentagon plans to display permanently. He traveled to Washington that month with Buckles, who drove an ambulance in Britain and France during the war as a corporal in the U.S. Army. In a White House ceremony in March, President Bush paid tribute to Buckles, who said he lied about his age and enlisted at age 15. ""Mr. Buckles has a vivid recollection of historic times, and one way for me to honor the service of those who wore the uniform in the past and those who wear it today is to herald you, sir, and to thank you very much for your patriotism and your love for America,"" he said during the March ceremony. DeJonge and Buckles plan to drive Tuesday from Buckles' cattle farm in Charles Town, West Virginia, to Arlington National Cemetery near Washington. The photographer said he feels ""just an unbelievable respect"" for men and women who served their country. And he savors the living history lessons they provide. ""It really is like stepping back in time,"" he said.","David DeJonge photographs the surviving veterans of WWI, which ended in 1918 .

"WEIMAR, Germany (CNN) -- A long narrow road winds through a thick forest up a hill called the ""Ettesberg,"" on the outskirts of Weimar in central Germany. The ovens where tens of thousands of bodies were cremated are restored and working. The road goes on for miles through the forest, but every once in a while you see an old railway station, a tower, or an old structure withering in the German rain. This road was named ""the trail of blood,"" by inmates of the infamous concentration camp Buchenwald, because of the death marches they were forced to undertake as they were deported to work as slave laborers for Nazi Germany's defense industry from 1937 to 1945. ""The trail of blood"" leads straight to the entrance gate of the former concentration camp -- a structure with a huge iron gate in the middle, a tower with a clock above, and arrest cells in the building's wings. U.S. troops saw the horror of the Nazi regime first hand when they came through this gate on April 11, 1945, and found camp inmates starved to the bone, many too weak to stand. ""We couldn't even show our joy at this moment, which we had been waiting for so long,"" said former inmate Zeev Factor, recalling the day American troops came to liberate the camp. Now the camp is getting ready to host President Obama, who has a special relationship with Buchenwald. His great-uncle Charlie Payne, 84, helped liberate a sub-camp here when he was an infantryman fighting in World War II. ""The survivors see President Obama almost like a grandson of theirs,"" said the director of the Buchenwald memorial, Volker Knigge, speaking just outside the front gate. ""The president is related to one of the brave men who came here and saw the Nazi horror first hand. The soldiers only had vague knowledge of what concentration camps actually were, but here they saw people too weak to survive, even after having been liberated."" Historians estimate that of the 20,000 inmates who were liberated by U.S. troops, 1,000 died shortly after because of exhaustion and the effects of years of starvation. It is easy to see why. Every building in the Buchenwald complex radiates death, suffering and evil. In the crematorium, where tens of thousands of bodies were burned, the ovens have been restored and are fully functional. In a cellar below the cremation room, meat hooks in the walls were used by SS guards to hang and strangle more than 1,000 inmates, many of them women and children. Obama will see these testimonies to the barbarism of the Nazis when he takes a tour of the camp with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He will also meet some of the survivors who Volker Knigge says feel so close to this president.","President Obama visits Buchenwald concentration camp, Germany, on Friday .

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to Georgia to learn about the toll military service is taking on two veterans. Chris Tucker, who served three tours in Iraq, suffers from hearing, back, foot problems and still has nightmares. SAVANNAH, Georgia (CNN) -- As his tank rolled into Baghdad in April 2003, Chris Tucker mounted his camera to capture the moment. ""It's history; we made history,"" he told CNN back then. ""It's my first war, hopefully my last war."" He could not have imagined then that six years later, Iraq would still be a combat zone. ""I thought we would get there quick and handle our business and we'd be out,"" Tucker told us this week. ""At least, that's what we were told anyway."" Tucker received a medical discharge from the Army last year and he now is Officer Chris Tucker of the Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police Department. ""You still get to serve your community and your country in other ways,"" he said. At age 26, he is a veteran of three combat tours. The patrol skills he learned on the streets of Baghdad, Fallujah and Sadr City come in handy as he drives his police cruiser around the neighborhoods of his Savannah precinct. ""Some people -- you will be moving around the corner and they will just run,"" Tucker said as he drove his cruiser. ""And you can tell they are favoring one side -- maybe they have a gun."" He loves his new job, and the joys of fatherhood. His daughter Callie was born three months ago. iReport.com: Send your salute to troops . ""So my life is slowing down,"" Tucker said. ""But I enjoy the slow pace."" But he hasn't left it all behind. As the war hits the six-year mark, Tucker is part of a history -- and a legacy -- still being written as the military tries to better understand the depth of the damage to those exposed repeatedly to the violence. ""I still have the nightmares and wake up and find myself downstairs and I don't know how I got there,"" Tucker said. ""I still see and dream the same things. ... Faces. Kids' faces. People that you have engaged or you have had contact with. ... You see your colleagues blown up. Things like that."" He left the Army with a sour taste. He was sent back for his third tour despite the nightmares, depression, major hearing loss and painful injuries to his back and both feet. Then, the Army decided to give him a medical discharge for his back issues even though Tucker believes he could have recovered with rehabilitation. But he tries not to dwell on his frustration. ""I try to distance myself from it as much as I can, because for me, the more I think about it, the more I reflect on what happened and what we did, the more I think the dreams and the nightmares actually come back."" Tucker is as tired of the Iraq war as anyone, but his experience tells him things can suddenly take a turn for the worse, and so he is skeptical of President Obama's promise to get most combat troops out of Iraq by August 2010.  Watch former VP Cheney discuss Iraq war strategy Â» . ""I think we are in too deep to pull out,"" Tucker said. ""You can't just commit the way we committed and then say, 'OK, we are done.' ... Politics should not be involved in the way the war is handled."" There will be no more tours for Tucker, but a colleague on the Savannah-Chatham force will soon deploy for his first Iraq tour, and is being ribbed around the precinct, by Tucker and others, as ""the grandpa going off to war."" Police Cpl. Randy Powell is 50 years old and became a grandfather just last week.  Watch Tucker and Powell tell their stories Â» . Powell served nearly 20 years ago in the Persian Gulf War, then in 1992 took an early retirement package when the Army was downsizing after the war. The deal required him to stay on what the military calls the IRR -- the Individual Ready Reserve -- but even as troops were sent to Afghanistan after 9/11 and then to Iraq for repeat combat tours, Powell heard nothing. Then last year, nearly 15 years after leaving the military, he was told to report to a local Reserve center. Another request came in January of this year. Both times, after some perfunctory paperwork, Powell was sent home. But when he returned home from work one day last month, an overnight letter from the Army had arrived with orders that he was being activated for an Iraq deployment. First, starting next month, he'll have refresher training on radar systems at Fort Jackson in South Carolina. ""They're kind of shocked,"" Powell said of his family. But there are no complaints from Powell -- to the contrary. ""I still feel I am fully capable of being a soldier,"" he told us outside at his police precinct. ""Once a soldier, always a soldier. I find that it's an honor to serve within the military. I enjoyed the military while I was in.

"Editor's note: Ken Ballen is president of Terror Free Tomorrow: the Center for Public Opinion, a nonprofit institute that researches attitudes toward extremism. Amjad Atallah co-directs the Middle East Task Force at the New America Foundation, a think tank that promotes ideas across the ideological spectrum. Kenneth Ballen says Iranians overwhelmingly favor better relations with the United States. (CNN) -- In a new public opinion poll before Iran's critical June 12 presidential election, by large margins, most Iranians said they support an American-Iranian rapprochement for bringing a new era of peace to the Middle East. Surveyed on a wide range of issues, Iranians overwhelmingly favor better relations with the United States and greater democracy for Iran. The poll shows that the Iranian public remains far removed from the stereotypes of apocalyptic fanatics commonly asserted in some circles in the United States. The survey suggests that Iranians instead are a people with self-confidence and hope in a more democratic future. It also reveals a population with a strong awareness that the United States is as much a potential ally as it is now seen as a current threat. This holds much promise for U.S. national security interests in the region. These are some of the many findings from a new nationwide public opinion survey of Iran, to be released Monday. Independent and uncensored nationwide surveys of Iran are rare. Typically, pre-elections polls in Iran are either conducted or monitored by the Iranian government and other affiliated interest groups. Consequently, they are notoriously untrustworthy. By contrast, our poll -- the third in a series over the past two years -- was conducted by telephone from a neighboring country, uncensored, with time-tested methodology. Funding for the survey was provided by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. The poll was led by Terror Free Tomorrow: the Center for Public Opinion and the New America Foundation, with fieldwork by KA Europe SPRL. The full results and methodology are available at terrorfreetomorrow.org. The survey was conducted from May 11 to 20, with 1,001 random interviews proportionally distributed covering all 30 provinces of Iran, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Though our poll results show President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the lead, it appears that that none of the presidential candidates will pass the 50 percent threshold needed to automatically win; a second-round runoff between the two highest finishers -- as things stand, Ahmadinejad and Mir Hussein Moussavi -- is likely. Regardless of whom they may vote for, the No. 1 priority Iranians have for their government is improving the Iranian economy, very closely followed by ensuring free elections, a free press and better trade and relations with the West. It is in this context that the Iranian people strongly support a fundamental change in American-Iranian relations. Right now, Iranians consider the United States and Israel as the greatest -- and only -- threats to Iran. As a result, more than six out of every 10 Iranians oppose any peace deal with Israel and are in favor of the government of Iran providing military and financial assistance to Palestinian groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad, as well as providing military and financial assistance to Iraqi Shiite militias. A majority of Iranians also favor Iran developing nuclear weapons. These ""hard-line"" attitudes dramatically change, however, as part of a potential deal with the United States. More than 70 percent of Iranians favor providing full access to inspectors and a guarantee not to develop or possess nuclear weapons, in return for outside aid and investment. In another consistent trend over the past two years, 77 percent of Iranians also back normal relations and trade with the United States. Indeed, as part of a deal with the United States, 54 percent of Iranians would endorse the Iranian government ending support for Iraqi militias instead of providing military assistance. Rather than supporting the destruction of the state of Israel, as they do now, as part of a deal with the United States, a majority of Iranians would even favor recognizing the state of Israel. Greater democracy, economic progress and good relations with the United States are the ultimate goals for most Iranians. In another indication of the public's strong support for a more open and fully democratic system of government, 77 percent said they support a political system where the supreme leader, along with all leaders, can be chosen and replaced by a free and direct vote of the people. The vision of the Iranian people for a more democratic future, with normal trade and relations between Iran and the United States, remains the consensus over our three nationwide surveys. Iranians also view their support for Ahmadinejad -- or whoever might be elected the next president of Iran -- as consistent with those goals. The Iranian people are apparently looking to their next president, whether or not it's Ahmadinejad, to be a Persian Nixon going to China. They want a tough negotiator to bring home a deal for Iran. His mandate is not to continue current hard-line polices with the United States but to change -- if the United States, in turn, is willing to recognize the Islamic Republic and end its policy seeking regime change in Tehran. For Washington, this means that the Iranian people are not an obstacle and that a real bargain can be struck that would find popular support. But the Iranian people are endorsing a negotiating position that leaves little time and much room for miscalculation. President Obama needs to integrate this reality into his strategy for the greater Middle East and, once the elections are complete, engage Iran on the potential of a new strategic relationship. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ken Ballen and Amjad Atallah.","Ballen, Atallah: Most Iranians are not extremists; they favor peace with U.S.

"Editor's note: James Alan Fox is Lipman Family Professor of Criminal Justice and professor of law, policy and society at Northeastern University in Boston. Fox has written 16 books, including ""Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder"" and is writing a book on school violence and security. James Alan Fox says perpetrators of mass shootings usually do not suddenly go berserk. (CNN) -- Massacre/suicide has become an all too familiar sight on the electronic pages of this and other news sites. But Tuesday's rampage in Samson, Alabama -- with a body count reaching to the double digits -- forces us to struggle mightily in search of plausible explanations and effective solutions. What could have prompted 28-year-old Michael McLendon to shoot to death his mother, grandmother, uncle, cousin and six others -- some of whom appear just to have been in the worst place at the worst time -- before turning the gun on himself? Mayor Clay King summarized the collective bewilderment in Samson in the immediate aftermath of the bloodshed. ""I don't think anybody has any idea of what the motive is,"" he said. In just over a few moments of horror, this rural community of a couple thousand residents that hadn't had a single homicide in well over a decade, based on FBI crime reports, now had a multitude of questions about the will to kill. ""Apparently something just snapped,"" speculated Wynnton Melton, mayor of Geneva, Alabama, the community just outside Samson where McLendon ended his own life after a police chase. Because McLendon chose suicide, the complete truth to his motivation may never be known. But from what can be learned from countless similar episodes in America and abroad, the crime may not be so unfathomable after all . Contrary to the widely held belief of ""snap judgment,"" perpetrators of mass murder -- and family annihilation in particular -- generally do not suddenly go berserk. If he was like most others who have walked in his shoes, McLendon would have contemplated his actions for some period of time, surely more than the few moments it took to load his assault rifle. With a list of enemies and a large arsenal, his planning would probably have reflected calm deliberation and cool determination. In decades of research in collaboration with my Northeastern University colleague Jack Levin, certain common characteristics of mass killers emerge time and time again. First, the perpetrators tend to have experienced a long history of frustration and failure, resulting in a diminished ability to cope with life's disappointments. Second, they typically externalize blame, frequently complaining that others didn't give them a decent chance. Without this, their destructiveness would instead be directed inward. In addition, these killers generally lack emotional support from friends or family. They are loners as well as losers. Lacking this support system and reality check, they come to perceive some precipitating event as being absolutely catastrophic. This most often involves some kind of major disappointment: the loss of a job, the breakup of a relationship or financial ruin, surely a major issue in today's economy. Finally, they need access to a weapon powerful and rapid enough to satisfy their intense need for revenge. Without much hope for a brighter tomorrow, these assailants often decide that life is not worth living; rather than just taking their own life in quiet solitude, they are eager for payback. It becomes their all-consuming mission to avenge, with a death penalty, against those who caused them to suffer -- in reality or perhaps only in their paranoid interpretation of events. Experiencing disappointment and failure so profound as to extinguish their desire to survive, most mass killers deliberately and methodically execute those closest to them, those they hold responsible for their troubles. There is little surprise, therefore, that mass murder overwhelmingly involves family members or co-workers, not total strangers. Although there certainly are many well-known episodes of random slaughter of complete strangers, these are more the exception than the rule. In the wake of extraordinary shooting sprees like the Alabama tragedy, calls for tighter gun control typically surface as a possible policy response for prevention. Yet the mass shooting just hours later and thousands of miles away in rural Germany, where gun limits are stricter than in the United States, reminds us that any debate must confront questions broader than just guns, even if the use of a high-powered firearm tends to increase the victim toll. Regrettably, there are no simple fixes nor any means for reliably identifying mass killers before they act, despite the consistent profile. There are tens of thousands of Americans who would fit the mold, yet, fortunately, very few of them decide literally to take matters and guns into their own hands . The best we can do, in terms of public policy and hometown approach, is to reach out to those around us who appear to be struggling emotionally or financially and offer friendship, compassion and understanding. At the end of the day, our efforts may not eliminate the risk of mass murder or necessarily deter the next Michael McLendon from turning his community into a personal battle zone, but at least we can enhance the well-being of countless citizens in the process of trying. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of James Alan Fox.","James Alan Fox: Alabama and Germany shootings raise questions about motive .

"PLAYA DEL REY, California (CNN) -- The black sedan pulled up to the parking lot at Dockweiler State Beach in California, and the five members of The Lost Trailers stepped out -- no chauffeur, no publicist, no manager, no entourage. From left to right, Jeff Potter, Stokes Nielson, Ryder Lee, Manny Medina and Andrew Nielson of The Lost Trailers. But that's the way this rising country band rolls these days. When they embarked on their current ""Lean, Clean and Local"" tour, they streamlined their operation in the greenest way possible. Since September, they've reduced their carbon footprint by 132 tons. That meant giving up their tour buses, as well as their road crew and traveling with their own equipment. Their new buzz phrase is ""hiring local"" -- local roadies, local T-shirt vendors, local suppliers for amps and equipment. If they can't stuff it in a suitcase, they don't bring it. The Lost Trailers have also partnered with Keep America Beautiful, a national organization dedicated to litter reduction and recycling. On a recent day off in Los Angeles, singer Ryder Lee, guitarist Stokes Nielson, bassist Manny Medina, keyboardist Andrew Nielson and drummer Jeff Potter met up with a group of young adults from the L.A. Conservation Corps for a little coastal cleanup -- country style.  Watch the band at work on the beach Â» . Three of the band members sported cowboy boots as they sifted through the sand. The kids were from South Central Los Angeles, an inner-city area not generally known for its love of country music. After the cleanup, we pulled the CNN van up to the beach, popped in The Lost Trailers' CD, and hit ""play"" on their hit single, ""Holler Back."" As the fiddle and banjo strains of the high-octane hillbilly tune blared through the speakers, there were blank stares all the way around from the students. But after joining in the chorus of ""heys"" and ""hos,"" one young man named Virgil LaFlora started rapping over the verses. It was the most unexpected country/hip-hop mash-up since Tim McGraw and Nelly joined forces for ""Over and Over"" in 2004. All of a sudden, the two camps had discovered some common ground, and the song ended in cheers and hugs. One girl asked if she could have the CD. CNN talked to the Trailers' members about their activism and their tour. The following is an edited version of the interview. CNN: ""Lean, Clean and Local"" isn't just about recycling. You guys are actually going into the community and hiring local people. Stokes Nielson: We did a show with Tim McGraw in New York at the end of last year. It was a fly date for us, so we hired local, and this guy came up to us and said, ""Thank you so much for hiring local, 'cause I haven't had a check in three weeks."" And we realized as the recession was heading into place, that one of the things we could do to benefit these communities is hire local, and not just bring in our own crews and just extract money form the locals and then leave, but we could also leave a small stimulus of our own. CNN: As rising artists, you work hard to earn the right to have a tour bus. Now you're giving it up. Stokes Nielson: Since we won't have a crew, we thought, ""OK, we're not going to have the bus anymore, and we're just going to fly to dates,"" and that cut down our diesel consumption. Andrew Nielson: We travel really light so that we can roll into town, hire the crew, and also hire local equipment. Potter's a drummer, and everywhere we go, we rent drums. Jeff Potter: We were trying to figure out a way that was practical to get a drum set on a plane, but it didn't really work out. I like it because I get to show up, and somebody working there locally has already set it up for me, and I get to just sit down and play. Ryder Lee: We were trying to get Potter some of those electric drum pads (which will fit into a suitcase), but that's just not as cool. CNN: Or you could just get a drum machine and eliminate the problem altogether! That would save the most money. Potter: I like being in the band. Manny Medina: I'm afraid they're going to hire local bass players, and I'll be out of a job! (Laugh) CNN: Do you save money by hiring local, or does it cost you more this way? Stokes Nielson: No, it's about even. It's not about the money. Obviously, the government is putting a lot of money into trying to get this thing (the economy) kick-started. As small-business owners, we want to do our part as well. It's also really been great to realize that we actually can do something besides just writin' a song and singin' it. Lee: We've set up a Web site: LeanCleanAndLocal.com, and that's become kind of a Yellow Pages for the local businesses we've hired. And we have videos on there, and a directory of the folks we've used, so if other acts were to hire this way, they could come in and use these same people. CNN: Doesn't that lead to disaster sometimes? Medina: So far, it's been great. Potter: Either we've been very lucky, or we've really come up against some great people, but when you're a national act, there's a certain level of competence with the people you deal with, and that's great to see. CNN: I'm sure there were a lot of organizations you looked at before partnering up with Keep America Beautiful. Why that organization? Lee: I think as country artists, it's really important to preserve the things that we grew up with. We're naturally outdoors men because of where we grew up, and keeping the rivers and streams clean is part of being country, and we're really proud of that. And Keep America Beautiful and their efforts in recycling and litter cleanup was really fitting for us, so it was a natural place to reach out -- not to mention, at our shows, there tends to be a few bottles and cans that build up. (Laugh) Stokes Nielson: This tour may not last forever. Maybe just until the recession is over. But definitely, we want to do our part to give back. Medina: Plus you really get to know the towns better. You meet the people. You don't just stay on your bus, play a show and leave. You really get to know the towns.","Members of The Lost Trailers try to hire local, reduce carbon footprint .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- John Travolta, still in mourning over the death of his teenage son earlier this year, issued a rare public statement urging fans to see his latest movie, ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" which he filmed last year. John Travolta stars as a villainous ex-inmate in ""The Taking of Pelham 123,"" which opens in theaters Friday. ""I promise, you won't be disappointed,"" said Travolta, who plays a deranged ex-inmate who takes hostages on a New York subway. Travolta did not join co-star Denzel Washington in the promotional tour for the movie -- which hits theaters Friday -- because he said his family needed ""additional time to reconcile our loss."" His son Jett, 16, was found unconscious on January 2 while on vacation with his family in the Bahamas. The teen was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, local police said. Washington, who plays a subway train dispatcher forced to face down Travolta's character, said he talked to the actor about three weeks ago. ""Needless to say, he's struggling,"" Washington said in an interview last week. Travolta's statement, which can be read on his official Web site, said Washington, director Tony Scott and the producers ""stepped up without hesitation to help promote this wonderful film, and their unselfish efforts have allowed my family the additional time to reconcile our loss."" Making the movie was ""a labor of love,"" Travolta said. ""Tony gave me the freedom to define, and then to become, the ultimate evil mastermind,"" he said. ""This role as an actor gave me the chance to dispense with all moral and ethical limitations, and explore just how bad this character could really be. I believe you will like the result."" Much of the movie is a dialogue between Washington and Travolta's character over a two-way radio. Many of the action shots were filmed in New York subway tunnels.","John Travolta releases statement on his Web site about ""The Taking of Pelham 123""

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Hundreds of Pakistani residents have taken up arms and are battling local Taliban militants in the wake of a deadly mosque attack last week. A Pakistani police stands guard at a checkpoint in Peshawar, Pakistan on June 8. It is the first major battle between the residents of northwest Pakistan and Taliban militants near the Afghanistan border. The residents are outraged over a suicide attack on a local mosque during Friday prayers that killed at least 40 people and wounded some 80 others. Starting on Saturday morning, some 400 villagers in the Upper Dir district formed a ""lashkar"" -- or militia -- to fight the Taliban, killing 14 of the militants as of Sunday evening, according to local administrator Atiq Ur Rehman. Four of the villagers have been injured in the battle, Rehman said. The militia have burned a number of houses thought to be sheltering the militants, according to Upper Dir police chief Ijaz Kahn. Both the residents and Taliban fighters are using heavy weapons, including rocket launchers and anti-aircraft weapons, Rehman said. There is a long history of Taliban presence in the area, including foreign fighters in leadership roles, local officials said. Authorities said Taliban fighters were driven out of Shot Ghas and Ghazigay -- two villages where the Taliban have support. The villagers took up arms against the Taliban after Friday's suicide attack at a mosque in Hayagay Sharqi -- a village in Upper Dir located about 35 km (22 miles) from the Afghan border and known for being against the Taliban. Upper Dir is a part of the Swat Valley, where the Pakistani military has waged a month-long operation against Taliban militants, but the district has not been part of the ongoing military offensive. The United Nations has said an estimated 2 million Pakistanis have been displaced by fighting between the Pakistani military and Taliban militants. The militants threatened to continue attacking cities in Pakistan until the military ends its operations against Taliban militants. As a result, Pakistani authorities have increased security in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital city. CNN's Ingrid Formanek and journalist Nasir Habib contributed to this report .","Upper Dir, part of Swat Valley, is where Pakistan army are fighting Taliban militants .

"ORLANDO, Florida (CNN) -- Hobbled with age, weathered with time, the World War II veterans stood at attention. One by one, a two-star general delivered flags flown over the Pentagon in their honor. He looked them in their eyes and snapped his right hand in salute. Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles salutes Berga survivor Edward Slotkin, 84, at an event in Orlando Saturday. ""National treasures,"" Maj. Gen. Vincent Boles said Saturday evening. It marked the first time in history the U.S. Army recognized 350 soldiers held as slaves inside Nazi Germany. The men were beaten, starved and forced to work in tunnels at Berga an der Elster where the Nazi government had a hidden V-2 rocket factory. Berga was a subcamp of the notorious concentration camp Buchenwald. ""These men were abused and put under some of the most horrific conditions,"" the general told a private gathering of Berga survivors. ""It wasn't a prison camp. It was a slave labor camp."" No ranking Army official had ever uttered the words ""slave labor camp"" in reference to the men's captivity at Berga. Boles knew the gravity of his statement -- that he was setting the historical record straight after 64 years.  Watch general set record straight after six decades Â» . ""That's why I'm here. That's why the Army sent me here: To look them in the eye and tell them that."" It's a rare moment to witness history, even more rare when it pertains to America's greatest generation six decades later. But that's what happened at the Rosen Centre Hotel in Orlando, first in a private meeting and then in the larger ceremony to honor them. ""It's humbling,"" Boles said. It was a bittersweet moment. More than 100 of the Berga soldiers died at the slave camp or on a forced death march of more than 200 miles in April 1945. About 80 of the 350 soldiers had been singled out for being Jewish by the Nazis. Dozens more survived captivity but died as the years passed. There are 22 known Berga survivors still alive, but only a handful made the trip here. ""He used that term slave labor camp. That was never used by anyone before,"" said survivor Samuel Fahrer. ""It was a long time coming.""  See photos inside the camp Â» . The six Berga survivors present -- Fahrer, 86; Morton Brooks, 83; Sidney Lipson, 85; Peter Iosso, 83; Wallace Carden, 84; and Edward Slotkin, 84 -- looked on stoically as Boles spoke privately with them. The men's faces hid decades of pain from what they endured in the waning months of World War II in 1945. They'd given up decades ago that the Army would recognize them. ""It means a great deal -- that it's being recognized and understood,"" Brooks told the general.   See excerpts from diary inside Berga Â» . Boles recited a soldier's war ethos: I will always place the mission first; I will never quit; I will never accept defeat and I will never leave a fallen comrade. He looked at each of the weathered war heroes and said, ""Just as they never left their fallen comrades, we will never leave them."" ""You were good soldiers and you were there for your nation."" Boles added, ""They're looking around and they're thanking me for coming. And I'm the one thanking them because I get to bask in the character of these great heroes."" If there was a skeptic coming into the evening, it was Fahrer, a U.S. medic held at Berga. He had dedicated much of his life in the years after the war seeking recognition for the men. He had been outraged that the government in 1948 commuted the death sentences of two Berga commanders, Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz. Fahrer sought for their death sentences to be reinstated.  See document from War Department letting commanders off Â» . A native of Long Island, New York, the typically talkative Fahrer was rendered nearly speechless as the general spoke. ""After 60 years, I gave up hope a long time ago, and I'm glad you're here with us tonight,"" Fahrer told Boles. Boles said he couldn't speak to why the Berga commanders got off so easy, but he said he knew ""it caused a great deal of pain for these men."" In modern times, he said, if U.S. soldiers were held at a slave camp in Iraq or Afghanistan, he'd expect justice for those responsible. ""I think full justice is the right word."" The general even addressed documents that many of the Berga survivors signed before they were sent back home to the States. ""The interests of American prisoners in the event of future wars, moreover, demand that the secrets of this war be vigorously safeguarded,"" it says. The survivors believed the document meant they were never to speak about their Berga experience. ""That was not our intent at all, but we screwed that up,"" Boles said. ""What the intent of the documents was, for those who had been POWs, not to talk about escapes, people who had assisted them, people who had helped them. Our inability to explain that correctly was, therefore, misunderstood by them."" He added, ""What they went through didn't need to be kept a secret."" The night would get more special as this evening progressed. The Berga soldiers were honored in front of a gathering of World War II POWs. About 100 veterans and their families packed a banquet hall. Boles told the group what he said in private -- that the men are ""national treasures."" ""You may wonder if it mattered, if your service and sacrifice made a difference, if it stood the test of time,"" he said. ""You may rest easy. I have seen your service live."" The room grew quiet. The general, in dress blues, strode to the six Berga survivors and presented each one with the flags flown over the Pentagon. ""Your nation remembers and it salutes each of you,"" Boles said. Each of the elders saluted the general back. The room was then told to stand on orders of the president of the United States. The entire room came to a hushed silence and rose to its feet. Fahrer, the medic who had fought so hard for justice for his Berga comrades, was asked to step forward. And there before the crowd on this historic evening, he was presented with one of the nation's highest honors, the Bronze Star. ""To all who shall see these presents, greeting: this is to certify that the President of the United States of America authorized by executive order, 24 August 1962, has awarded the Bronze Star Medal to Private Samuel Fahrer, Army of the United States, for meritorious achievement while serving with Medical Detachment, 110th Infantry Regiment in the European Theater of Operations on 19 December 1944, in military operations against an armed enemy of the United States."" He had earned the medal 65 years ago, but due to clerical errors it had never been given to him. Fahrer beamed with pride. He had shed few tears since his time at Berga. But on this night, even Fahrer had trouble containing his emotions. ""I'm not the crying type, but it got me right here,"" he said, his hand over his heart as he searched for words. At long last, the Berga men finally had some comfort. ""It's satisfying that after all this time amends could be made,"" Brooks said. ""When there's talk of the Holocaust, we understand it."" The general commended CNN for its reporting on the issue in recent months, saying those reports helped change the men's legacy. Boles applauded Reps. Joe Baca, D-California, and Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Alabama, who urged the Army to act to honor the Berga soldiers. At one point Saturday evening, Berga survivor Sidney Lipson pulled me to the side. ""Why did you care so much that we be recognized?"" ""Because you deserved it,"" I replied. He clutched his encased flag, pulled it to his heart and smiled. ""Thank you."" Note from CNN's Wayne Drash: For Berga survivors who were not able to attend the Orlando event, the Army is working to coordinate events in the men's communities. I also want to thank CNN's audience who lobbied Congress and the Army to give these soldiers recognition.","For first time in history, Army recognizes soldiers held as slaves in Nazi Germany .

Velez-Mitchell is the author of ""Secrets Can Be Murder: What America's Most Sensational Crimes Tell Us About Ourselves."" Jane Velez-Mitchell says tougher penalties are needed to keep sex offenders from committing more crimes. NEW YORK (CNN) -- Early last month, beautiful 25-year-old Laura Garza went missing. Her family holds out hope she is still alive. An aspiring dancer from Texas, Garza moved to New York City to pursue her career. On December 2nd, she went to the posh Manhattan nightclub Marquee to blow off some steam with her friend. Security video shows Garza leaving the club with convicted sex offender Michael Mele, according to the New York Police Department. NYPD officials confirmed that Mele then drove Garza about an hour away toward his apartment. Garza was reported missing the next day. New York state police searched Mele's apartment and court documents indicate officers observed apparent bite marks on Mele's hand and scratches on his back and shoulder. According to court records and state police, large pieces of carpet were missing from his apartment and days later, carpet pieces that seemed to match Mele's were found on the side of a nearby road. Search parties have been combing roads, woods, and swampland, and police divers searched for clues in a nearby lake, but the search has gone cold in recent weeks. Mele is in jail for violating probation and is a suspect, but he has not been charged in Garza's disappearance, according to state police. Laura Garza is still missing more than a month later. Her family has joined search efforts in New York and prays they will find her alive, but police are treating the case as a homicide. The worst part about this tragic story? It may have been preventable. Laura Garza had no idea she was leaving that club with a sex offender. After all, most of them look pretty normal. Few fit the Hollywood stereotype of the creepy guy wearing a trench coat and driving a white van. Laura Garza may have been unaware who she was with that night, but the legal system certainly knew him. Michael Mele previously pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault, including one count of masturbating in front of two women. And he was violating probation. And he had an outstanding warrant for allegedly exposing himself to a woman in a mall parking lot. Mele hasn't been convicted of anything in this case or charged in Garza's disappearance, but even if he is innocent, the larger question of how the criminal justice system deals with sex offenders remains a vital issue. In a sane world, Mele is not a free man on that night, able to allegedly target Laura Garza. But we don't live in a sane world. We live in a world where sexual assault is business as usual. Where's the outrage? The Garza case is a microcosm of a societal problem. As a nation, we must realize there is no such thing as a ""minor"" sexual offense -- because sex offenders often start small and graduate to more serious crimes. According to a 2003 Department of Justice study, 78 percent of imprisoned sex offenders had prior arrests and 28 percent had prior arrests for sex crimes. According to the same study, one quarter of men serving time for rape and 19 percent of those serving time for sexual assault had been on probation or parole at the time of the offense that landed them in prison. The formula is simple. Sex offenders start off by nabbing the easy prey -- committing the so-called ""minor"" sexual offenses like flashing random women, or the crimes Michael Mele committed. Then, after getting away with it or receiving a slap on the wrist, they become hungrier and develop into full-fledged predators. And it's only when they sink their teeth into their prey that the legal system finally brings down the hammer. But it's too late. To stop this progression, we must start treating all sexual offenses as major crimes. In the same Justice Department study, on average, the sex offenders served less than half of their sentences. So basically that means Paris Hilton served more of her sentence than the average person convicted of a sex crime does. I'm glad our justice system has its priorities straight. The simple answer is to take all sex offenders off the streets, from the moment they commit the first ""minor"" offense. I'm not just talking about putting them behind bars. We need to rehabilitate these predators at the earliest stage possible, before their behavior worsens. And if the prisons are too crowded to hold them, how about releasing some of the nonviolent drug offenders to make some room? They can't be worse than sex offenders on the prowl who, compared with non-sex offenders released from prison, are four times more likely to be rearrested for a sex crime, according to a government study. This problem is out in the open. I see it. My viewers see it. But how many Laura Garzas will it take to before politicians and judges see it and are willing to do something about it? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jane Velez-Mitchell.","Jane Velez-Mitchell: Sex offenders are often let out on the street too soon .

"(CNN) -- Gabon's President Omar Bongo, Africa's longest-serving ruler, died Monday morning, the country's prime minister said, settling conflicting reports from government and media accounts. Gabon's President Omar Bongo, who died Monday, was Africa's longest-serving ruler. Calm was reported after the announcement, but Gabon's Ministry of Defense nonetheless announced it was closing all of the country's land, air and sea ports, according to a ministry statement. The statement, which was broadcast on state television and radio, said that in ""the best interest of the nation, the Ministry of Defense calls on the population to increase their vigilance and patriotism during this difficult and painful time the country is facing."" In a statement, Prime Minister Jean Eyeghe Ndong said Bongo suffered cardiac arrest at a hospital in Barcelona, Spain. ""He dedicated his political life to his country and the Gabonese people, always cultivating the unity and cohesion of the Gabonese toward a true peace,"" Ndong said. The government declared a 30-day national period of mourning. Bongo, 73, had been receiving treatment for intestinal cancer at the Quiron clinic in Barcelona, Spain, according to the Gabonews agency. Earlier in the day, the prime minister strongly refuted initial French news reports of Bongo's death. He had vowed to lodge a protest with the French authorities about ""repeated leaks in the French press."" Shortly afterward, hospital officials reported Bongo's passing to Gabonese officials. Bongo took power in 1967, seven years after the West African country's independence from France. He imposed one-party rule a year after succeeding the country's first president, who died in office. He allowed multiparty elections after a new constitution in 1991, but his party has retained control of the government since then. President Obama said Bongo ""played a key role in developing and shaping the strong bilateral relationship that exists between Gabon and the United States today."" ""President Bongo consistently emphasized the importance of seeking compromise and striving for peace, and made protecting Gabon's natural treasures a priority,"" Obama said in a statement Monday. ""His work in conservation in his country and his commitment to conflict resolution across the continent are an important part of his legacy and will be remembered with respect."" CNN's Per Nyberg and Al Goodman contributed to this report.","NEW: Defense Ministry closing all of the country's ports after leader's death .

"(CNN) -- Gunmen killed three police officers in Acapulco, Mexico, early Monday morning in attacks on two police stations, the state news agency Notimex reported. Suspected gang members are handcuffed after a gunbattle in Acapulco, Mexico, on Saturday. The attacks came two days after a ferocious street gunbattle that left 18 people dead, including two soldiers. Mexican soldiers, in trucks and helicopters kept watch over the resort town Monday. Along with swine flu fears, the uptick in violence threatens the tourist economy of Acapulco and other popular resort areas. Witnesses told police that just before 6 a.m., gunmen armed with AK-47s stepped out of two luxury vehicles, walked toward the police station in the Ciudad Renacimiento neighborhood and began shooting. Acapulco officers Gilberto Reducindo Salazar and Arturo Tonala Aguilar were killed in that incident, according to Notimex. Shortly afterward, at a second local police station, attackers fatally wounded officer Andres Guzman Casiano, Notimex said. A fourth officer was injured. The Guerrero attorney general's office said the attacks could have been conducted by the same people, as there was a 30-minute gap between them, the state agency reported. It was unknown whether the attacks were connected with Saturday's shootout, which started when soldiers went to a location called Avenida Rancho Grande in Acapulco on an anonymous tip. They were met by gunfire, according to a statement from Mexico's Ministry of Defense. Five people were arrested in connection with the shootout. Sixteen gunmen and two soldiers were killed, and nine soldiers were wounded, the statement said. After that incident, authorities seized 36 large-caliber weapons, 13 small-caliber weapons, two grenade launchers, 13 fragmentation grenades, 3,525 rounds of various caliber ammunition, 180 charges and eight vehicles, the ministry said.","Attacks came 2 days after ferocious street gunbattle that left 18 people dead .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Enya is an anomaly. Think about it: How many recording artists have enjoyed 20 years of success while never having toured? Enya sets her own pace when making albums. ""And Winter Came"" is her first CD in three years. ""The fans are very, very loyal,"" says the Irish chanteuse. ""They're always saying, 'When is the next album?' They know when I finish in the studio it's got to be a few years before the next album."" Perhaps it's the vast gaps between releases that help make Enya, 47, the Emerald Isle's second-biggest-selling artist of all time (after U2). Thanks to a stipulation in her recording contract, the Grammy winner has the luxury of setting her own pace with each project, another rarity in the music business. She'll devote two to three years to each album, flitting between her Dublin castle and the studio, where she works tirelessly to perfect every celestial chord and layer harmony upon harmony. ""I always felt that the music sells by itself,"" she says. ""The music has always been the successful aspect on my career and that means that, to me, I can always still stay very focused on music.""  Watch Enya revel in harmony Â» . Her latest album -- the seventh of her career -- celebrates both the drama and quiet contemplation that come with the winter season. Called ""And Winter Came,"" the release has reached the top 10 on album charts across Europe and in the U.S. since its November release. And while Enya won't commit to the idea of taking her tunes on the road, she does hint at the possibility. ""To actually tour with the songs would be wonderful. It would be very much on a large scale: the orchestra, the choir. There'd be a lot of rehearsals, but it'd be very exciting,"" she says. Enya spoke to CNN about how her music is like an onion (think layers, not tears), keeping a low profile, and marking the 20-year anniversary of ""Watermark,"" her breakout album. CNN: What does wintertime mean to you? Enya: Wintertime for me is a time when I do a lot of my writing in the studio. It's a time I enjoy. And it's very reflective and a very calming time of the year. Throughout the year I gather a lot of musical inspirations and this is where I bring them to the studio and see what will evolve musically. CNN: You set out to make a Christmas album. How did the project evolve? Enya: I've always wanted to put together a Christmas album. So I was writing some Christmas carols and what happened was some of the songs started to veer more into winter themes. And when I discussed it with [producer and lyricist] Nicky and Roma [Ryan], they felt, well, within winter is the celebration of Christmas, so let's infuse the two themes together. CNN: A lot of people think of Enya as a soloist, but really you're kind of a trio, aren't you? Enya: I work with two other people, the producer Nicky Ryan and Roma Ryan, the lyricist. The way I work with Nicky and Roma is firstly I do the writing of the melodies in the songs, and that's kind of the solitude moment for me in the studio, which I enjoy very much. When I have the melody -- the idea of the melody -- I play that to Nicky and Roma. ... I get to see their reaction immediately. Is this a song for the album? And I can see from their reaction -- ""Yes, this is going to work,"" or perhaps it's not. There are a lot of ideas that Nicky had wanted to experiment with. When I met with him first he had this idea of using a voice -- one voice -- as an instrument to layer many times and he knew my love of harmonies. Some people who hear the songs think that we have a set routine, a set formula we work with. It isn't, ... because each song is very different, and it's very spontaneous on my part. CNN: About the layering of your voice ... at any given time how many Enyas might we be listening to? Enya: I don't count! It's a very spontaneous moment on my behalf. I will listen back to the last harmony I've sung, and then I'll sort of try to enhance that harmony. Then Nicky will decide if he'll record my voice 20 times or 30 times [for] that one part. CNN: I read that you might [record] as many as 80 vocal tracks. Is that a reasonable number? And then I read 500. That's got to be ridiculous! Enya: Yes, it can be, but you have to remember that [if] it's 500 vocals I wouldn't have sung them at the same time. We're talking about over two years that we keep going back to arrange vocal parts on these songs. It's a very slow process. CNN: It's hard to believe that it was about 20 years ago that you made ""Watermark."" Do you ever go back and listen to that record? Enya: Well, with the anniversary, yes, I've been listening to ""Watermark."" It's kind of like a journal for me. It takes you back to that time in your life. Each song has its own little story and I can hear the life of that song. You know how it was written, what inspired me, what worked, what didn't work. But the nice thing about spending two to three years on an album is I can say there's nothing I would change on any of the albums. CNN: You've said that you change the formula a little with each album, but to an untrained ear your music has sort of stayed the same throughout your career. Are you a believer in the saying ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""? Enya: Musically it has to be something that I'm comfortable to perform. Would we ever hear Enya with a guitar solo? I say, ""Never say never."" And there's a guitar solo on ""My! My! Time Flies."" This happened because it suited the song. It's always got to sound like me because it's my voice and there's always this little sense of melancholy that is inherent in my melodies. I think that's because of my Irish culture. CNN: Your manager has suggested that one of the secrets to your success is that you keep a fairly low profile. Do you agree? Enya: It's very easy for me to keep a low profile because the focus I feel is always on the music. Success and fame are two different things. And so I feel the success is always towards the music, which means that I can have a very normal and private lifestyle.","Enya's new album is ""And Winter Came""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Oooooooshie the clown knows the instant effect he has on patients. The Lev Leytzan clowns perform for children and patients in hospitals to spread laughter and joy. ""When you walk out of a room hearing people laugh and smile, you hear them talking about it,"" said the clown, whose real name is Asher Mechanic. He entertains children and patients as part of a clown troupe in New York called Compassionate Clown Alley, bringing laughter to those in hospitals. ""It's the spreading of giving from one person to another, like a chain reaction,"" Mechanic said. The clown organization is also known as Lev Leytzan, a name derived from the program's roots working with Jewish youth. In Hebrew, lev means heart, and leytzan is a clown, so the translation is ""The Heart of the Clown.""   Watch the clowns talk about their work. Â» . ""Lev Leytzan allows me to take [something] scary and mundane for the patient and into something exciting beautiful and playful,"" said the group's founder, Dr. Neal Goldberg, a Woodmere, New York-based clinical psychologist. For the last two and half years, the clowns have been bringing cheer to the patients at the South Nassau Communities Hospital. ""The patients get satisfaction from having some sunshine coming to them in the hospital,"" said Phyllis Citera, director of volunteer services at the hospital.  ""Sundays at the hospital are typically quiet, especially for those patients who don't have visitors stopping by. The clowns especially cheer them up."" A positive approach empowers people who are ill, said Goldberg, who works with children, teenagers and young adults. Six years ago, while working on a bereavement project, he realized he was making a clown of himself and others in an effort to help people cope with pain.  He wondered what would distract the patients from their pain and bring joy. Inspired by the work of Dr. Patch Adams, who was portrayed by Robin Williams in the 1998 film ""Patch Adams,"" Goldberg thought of running a similar program in which he and others could bring joy to people in orphanages, hospitals and retirement homes using the same whimsical approach. Goldberg researched the subject before putting on a red nose and trying out therapeutic clowning for himself. ""I found it powerful in terms of my own growth and freedom of expression and creativity, and thought it would be something wonderful and powerful to bring back to the community, to teens in particular,"" he said. Goldberg's clowns range from 13 to 22 years old and say they find it both empowering and humbling. ""As a clown, you get more than you give,"" said Dassy Newman, a former clown. ""You can't hold back, you have to give it all. You have to give your heart, your soul, your energy, everything. It's the most exhausting thing you've ever done, but at the same time it's the most exhilarating."" Dr. Carolyn Fein-Levy, a pediatric oncologist at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York, said Goldberg's clowns provide relief to the patients. ""Whenever the clowns are around, the children are happier,"" Fein-Levy said. ""When they are happier, their parents enjoy watching them. They recapture their childhoods lost as a result of being sick. Clowns are a good distraction and it helps them feel normal. Nothing is more important for them than feeling normal, because their lives are not normal while going through therapy."" She also teaches an oncology class to the Lev Leytzan clowns. ""It adds another dimension to their training and gives them an overview and an understanding to know what it's like to be a kid with cancer,"" she said.  Fein-Levy also draws from her own experience, having survived ovarian cancer as a child after a year of chemotherapy. ""I teach in the clown school but I'm not worried about patients being harmed,"" she said.  ""I'm more worried about harm for clowns because it's hard to see sick children. Some of the clowns have never really seen illness, and they can be afraid, and that's OK."" Clowning might be assumed to be all fun and games, but Goldberg takes the work very seriously. ""Some of the kids may have told you there's intense amounts of hours of training and rehearsals with doctors and clowns and debriefings,"" he said. Ultimately, Goldberg said, the goal of Lev Leytzan is to ""change people's worlds, create worlds for people that need it, and to help people play."" He does it all under the mantra of ""serious clowning, a story behind every smile.""","Clown group Lev Leytzan gets name from working with Jewish youth.

"BETHESDA, Maryland (CNN) -- Josh Winston is a self-described problem solver. From his spacious office on the seventh floor of a high-rise building in Bethesda, Maryland, he fills out tax returns and keeps the books balanced for a number of his accounting clients. Josh Winston stands outside the 1983 RV he was converting to run on vegetable oil. ""Everything on the left always equals everything on the right. For math-oriented people and musicians like me, that's very satisfying,"" he says. Four years ago, Winston was watching a late-night news program and saw a segment about converting diesel vehicles to run on alternative fuels. That night, Winston was hooked. He ordered a conversion kit for $900 and proceeded to convert a truck to run on used vegetable oil -- just to see if he could. Soon after, he converted his 1998 Jetta and affixed a sticker to the rear bumper that said, ""This vehicle runs on straight vegetable oil."" ""For a single bumper sticker, I was surprised at how many people stopped me and said, 'Hey, how do you do that?' "" Before taking on his first conversion, he hadn't worked on a car since his 1978 Plymouth Volare -- which he drove in college. By Winston's estimate, there are fewer than 10,000 vehicles on the road that have undergone these diesel conversions. Now, he sells and installs his own kits -- and he's the only person in the Washington, D.C., area to offer the service. Though his side business, named ""Feed My Wheels dot com,"" has only converted a handful of vehicles, he recently took on his largest project by far -- a 1983 Itasca RV. ""There's a lot of trial and error,"" says Winston.  Watch the ""problem solver"" at work Â» . Over the course of two days, Winston ran into many a problem. First, the batteries kept dying. Later, there was an issue with the alternator. By the end of Day 2, as Winston was preparing to fill a 40-gallon veggie-oil tank in the RV with recycled oil from a Chinese food restaurant, a neighbor watching him tipped over an 80-gallon holding tank, spilling tens of gallons of brown, smelly oil down his street. ""It's OK,"" Winston quipped, ""earthworms love this stuff."" After nearly 50 hours of cutting and reattaching hoses, Winston managed to get the RV running and successfully switched over to the vegetable oil tank. He claims that veggie-oil emissions are about half of those of petroleum-based diesel fuel. ""If you're emitting half the carbon dioxide that our neighbor is, that means one of two things: Either your neighbor can drive twice as much, or you're having a significant positive impact on the environment,"" Winston says. ""In some small way, we're contributing to saving the environment. It's going to save a glacier somewhere.""","""Problem solver"" converts vehicles to run on vegetable oil, not diesel .

"EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- CNN Hero Maria Ruiz has been changing the lives of children and their families in Juarez, Mexico, for more than 12 years. But lately, it's been Ruiz's own life that's been changing. Crews prepare to demolish Maria Ruiz's home as part of ABC's ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition."" In November, ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" honored Ruiz for crossing the Texas border to Juarez several times a week to deliver food, clothing and toys to impoverished children and their families. Months later, Ruiz and her family received another surprise, courtesy of ABC's ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition."" Ruiz, her husband and their two children were sent on a five-day vacation to the Bahamas while thousands of volunteers built the family a custom-designed home. ""When Ty Pennington came to our home and said, 'Ruiz family, come on out,' we all just ran out and couldn't believe that we were chosen,"" Ruiz said. ""It's a blessing to us, but we weren't expecting all of this at all, and it has been overwhelming."" Pennington is the host of ""Extreme Makeover: Home Edition,"" which selected Ruiz and her family from thousands of applicants throughout Texas. Pennington said the idea was to give Ruiz what she needed most: the tools to do more.  Watch Ruiz and her family react to their new home Â» . In addition to bringing supplies to the people of Juarez, Ruiz and her family are completing construction of a complex there, which includes a community kitchen, an orphanage and a trade school. Read more about Ruiz's work . In order to devote their time to the Juarez community, the family put construction of their own home on hold in 1996, Ruiz said, leaving many parts unfinished. They were also using much of their living space as a warehouse for all of the donations for the Juarez families, she said. ""A home is somewhere you can go after a long day's work and relax and where the family can get together and be able to sit down and talk about our day,"" Ruiz said. ""When we had the things in the living room, we couldn't do that there."" Upon returning from the Bahamas, Ruiz and her family were surrounded by thousands of volunteers and community members who blocked them from seeing the changes by the show's large bus. After chanting the show's coined phrase -- ""Move that bus!"" -- Ruiz and her family were introduced to their new home. ""For us, it is a new beginning, and it's going to change our lives,"" Ruiz said. With her new home, Ruiz will be able to continue -- and even expand -- her family's work for those in need. According to Executive Producer Anthony Dominici, both an additional kitchen and storage space were built in the new home for Ruiz. And ""through the generosity of the community,"" enough donations of food, clothes and toys were collected to fill a 20-foot shipping container and a 16-foot cube truck -- including more than 75,000 cans of food, Dominici said. ""That's the whole point here,"" Pennington said. ""To give her what she needs to make her life easier to literally spread dreams and hope to people who have absolutely none of either one of those."" For Ruiz, it's about teaching young minds so they can in turn give back to their community. ""If you teach them and train them as a child and they go out and do the same, we would live in a much better world."" ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" introduced Ruiz to the world when it premiered on Thanksgiving on the global networks of CNN. Actress Selena Gomez introduced and presented Ruiz with her CNN Hero award. Each of the top 10 CNN Heroes also received $25,000.  Watch Ruiz accept her CNN Hero Award Â» .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- The jet carrying 228 people from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, that disappeared overnight as it entered an area of strong turbulence probably crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, the CEO of Air France said Monday. Anne and Michael Harris, who lived in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were two Americans aboard the flight. Brazilian and French ships and planes were looking for any sign of the missing plane, authorities said. The first three hours of what was to have been an 11-hour flight appear to have been uneventful, CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said. But about 4:15 a.m. Paris time, Flight 447's automatic system began a four-minute exchange of messages to the company's maintenance computers, indicating that ""several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down,"" he said. ""This succession of messages signals a totally unforeseeable, great difficulty,"" he said. ""Something quite new within the plane."" During that time, there was no contact with the crew, Gourgeon said. ""It was probable that it was a little bit after those messages that the impact of the plane took place in the Atlantic,"" he added. He said the Airbus A330 was probably closer to Brazil than to Africa when it crashed. He noted that turbulence made flying ""difficult"" in the area but that it is ""too early to say"" exactly what happened. The chances of finding any survivors were ""very low,"" French President Nicolas Sarkozy admitted Monday. ""This is a catastrophe the likes of which Air France has never seen before,"" he said at Charles de Gaulle International Airport, where he met with relatives of the missing. ""I said the truth to them: The prospects of finding survivors are very low,"" he said. The airline company identified the nationalities of the victims as two Americans, an Argentinean, an Austrian, a Belgian, 58 Brazilians, five British, a Canadian, nine Chinese, a Croatian, a Dane, a Dutch, an Estonian, a Filipino, 61 French, a Gambian, 26 Germans, four Hungarians, three Irish, one Icelandic, nine Italians, five Lebanese, two Moroccans, three Norwegians, two Polish, one Romanian, one Russian, three Slovakian, two Spanish, one Swedish, six Swiss and one Turk. An official list of victims by name was not available late Monday. The American victims were identified as Michael Harris, 60, and his wife, Anne, 54, by the couple's family and his employer, Devon Energy in Oklahoma -- the largest U.S.-based independent natural gas and oil producer. Michael Harris was a company geologist in Rio de Janeiro, according to a company spokesman. Anne Harris' sister, Mary Miley, told CNN the couple had been living in the city since July 2008 and that they were traveling to Paris for a training seminar for Michael and for a vacation. ""Anne and Mike were indeed a beautiful couple inside and out and I miss them terribly already,"" Miley said in an e-mail. Sarkozy said French authorities sent ships and planes to the area about 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Brazil. ""Our Spanish friends are helping us; Brazilians are helping us a lot as well."" French Transport Minister Jean-Louis Borloo told CNN affiliate France 2 that France asked the U.S. military to assist in the search through U.S. detection satellites. Pentagon officials in Washington did not immediately confirm the request. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva told reporters in San Salvador, El Salvador, that he had spoken with Sarkozy but neither leader knew what to say. ""All we could do was thank each other,"" Lula said. ""He thanked me for the speed with which the Brazilian air force took charge."" He added, ""In times like these, there is little to do but to deeply lament, to wish the families a lot of strength, because there are no words in times like these."" Sarkozy said authorities were seeking the help of satellites that might be able to pick up signs of what happened to the 4-year-old Airbus 330. No possibility was being excluded: Turbulence in the area was strong, but other planes were able to pass through it without incident, he said. The plane reported a problem with the electrical system, ""but the specialists refuse for the moment to express themselves about any possibility,"" Sarkozy said. The jet also sent a warning that it lost pressure, the Brazilian air force said.  Watch aviation expert describe possible scenarios Â» . It lost contact with air traffic control between Galeao International Airport in Rio de Janeiro and Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris, the airline said Monday. The Airbus A330 sent out an automatic signal warning of the electrical problems just after 2 a.m. GMT Monday as it flew ""far from the coast,"" said an Air France spokeswoman who declined to be identified. It had just entered a stormy area with strong turbulence, she said. The jet was flying at an altitude of 35,000 feet and a speed of 521 mph, the air force said. Among the passengers were 126 men, 82 women, seven children and a baby, in addition to the 12 crew members, Air France officials in Brazil said. Much of the route is out of radar contact, Brazilian air force Col. Henry Munhoz told TV Globo. The flight, AF 447, took off from Galeao International Airport at 11:30 p.m. Sunday GMT. It was scheduled to land in Paris at 9:10 a.m. GMT.  Learn more about recent notable airplane crashes Â» . Its last known contact occurred at 2:33 a.m. GMT, the Brazilian air force spokesman said. It was expected to check in with air traffic controllers at 3:20 a.m. GMT but did not do so, the Brazilian air force said in a statement. Brazilian authorities asked the air force to launch a search mission just over three hours later, at 6:30 a.m. GMT, the statement said. The plane reported no problems before takeoff, Joao Assuncao, Air France's manager in Brazil, told the country's Record TV. The airline set up a crisis center at the Paris airport. It listed numbers for families to call: 0 800 800 812 for people in France and 00 33 1 57 02 10 55 for families outside France. At a crisis center at the airport in Rio, relatives of the missing complained of a dearth of information from Air France, the Brazilian state news agency reported. One man, who identified himself as Bernardo, said his brother, Romeo Amorim Souza, and his wife were on the missing flight. ""I came to the airport because I wasn't finding information, and my parents are very nervous,"" he told Agencia Brasil. The missing A330 last underwent a maintenance check on April 16, the airline said. CNN air travel expert Richard Quest said the twin-engine plane, a stalwart of transatlantic routes, had an impeccable safety record, with only one fatal incident involving a training flight in 1994. ""It has very good range and is extremely popular with airlines because of its versatility,"" he said. Its crew was composed of three pilots and nine cabin crew members, including a captain who has logged 11,000 hours in flight. About 1,700 of those hours were on the A330 and A340. Of the two co-pilots, one has 3,000 hours of flying experience and the other 6,600 hours. The aircraft has flown 18,870 hours. The model is ""capable of communicating in several different ways over quite long distances even if they are out of radar coverage,"" said Kieran Daly of the online aviation news service Air Transport Intelligence. The French Accident Investigation Bureau for civil aviation is investigating, the company said in a statement. CNN's Lianne Turner, Ayesha Durgahee, Helena DeMoura, Isa Soares and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.","CEO: ""Several pieces of aircraft equipment were at fault or had broken down""

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- Four men were indicted Tuesday in what prosecutors said was a plot to bomb two New York City synagogues and fire surface-to-air missiles at U.S. military planes. Three of the four suspects in the alleged synagogue bombing plot are shown after their arrests. The defendants -- James Cromitie, 44; David Williams, 28; Onta Williams, 32; and Laguerre Payen, 27 -- were charged with conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction within the United States, conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles and six other counts. They face a maximum penalty of life in prison. Arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday. The plot was uncovered in a yearlong investigation involving an FBI informant. It ended with federal agents and New York police used an 18-wheel truck to block a vehicle carrying the suspects after they planted what they believed were explosive devices in cars near the synagogues, said New York City Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The planted devices were actually duds. The four are accused of plotting to detonate explosives near two synagogues in the Riverdale section of the Bronx and seeking to fire missiles at planes at an Air National Guard base. Kelly described the plot as homegrown, with no known links to any foreign or domestic groups. At a court hearing on May 21, U.S. Magistrate Lisa Smith ordered three of the suspects -- Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams -- to remain in custody without bail. Prosecutor Eric Snyder described the suspects as violent men ""eager to bring death to Jews."" At a later hearing, the fourth suspect -- Laguerre Payen -- also was remanded without bail. Payen received medical treatment for injuries during the arrest and had a bandage over one eye at his hearing. Payen's lawyer told the hearing that her client had a history of mental instability, but Snyder, the prosecutor, said videotapes of the plotters showed Payen to be a coherent and willing participant. Payen told the judge he has prescriptions for drugs used to treat depression and conditions including bipolar disorder. Cromitie, David Williams and Onta Williams are U.S. citizens, while Payen is Haitian, according to the New York governor's office. Mayor Michael Bloomberg praised the work of his city's Police Department and federal authorities in uncovering the alleged plot. ""The good news here is that the New York Police Department and FBI did exactly what they're trained to do and prevented what could have been a terrible event,"" Bloomberg said. ""We have to constantly be vigilant."" ""Unfortunately, this is the world we live in,"" said Nurit Bacharach of the Gan Miriam Early Childhood Center at the Hebrew Institute in Riverdale. ""We just have to forge ahead and keep a positive mind and live life and just be cautious and aware."" According to state and federal authorities, an FBI informant met with Cromitie in June 2008 in Newburgh, New York. During that meeting Cromitie said his parents live in Afghanistan, he was angry about the U.S. war there and that he had an interest in ""doing something to America."" The four suspects began meeting with the informant at a home equipped with concealed video and audio equipment, plotting to bomb the synagogues, authorities said. The suspects also conducted surveillance, including photographs, of an Air National Guard base where they wanted to blow up planes, authorities said. The informant provided the men with a surface-to-air guided missile and C-4 plastic explosives, none of which could actually be used. ""No one was at risk,"" said Kelly, the police commissioner, describing the explosive devices as duds created to dupe the suspects.

"PALMETTO, Georgia (CNN) -- The idea of investing in new home construction and high-end restaurant businesses would send most entrepreneurs running these days, but developers in a small community in rural Georgia say they're still growing. The community of Serenbe in rural Georgia is surrounded by 40,000 acres of dense forest. At first glance Serenbe is a bucolic scene of horses and stables ringed by 40,000 acres of dense oak and pine forest, but as you drive around the first bend, a collection of look-alike white houses emerges, giving the distinct impression of a conventional high-end housing development. But a 21st century high-tech eco-village soon emerges from the mists. There are paths leading to water recycling facilities, composting, recycling, and 25 acres of organic-certified farmland, four of which are planted with anything from hops for beer making to sweet peas. A silver sign is prominently displayed in recognition of Serenbe's ecologically sound construction, proving that Serenbe is not the average cookie-cutter housing development. Serenbe, a community founded on principles of farm-to-table cooking and environmentally conscious building techniques, has seen its fortunes rise while the rest of the country struggles. The development's founders have sold four homes and five building lots at the development since January alone, and they believe that innovation may be just the thing the economy needs. Founders Marie and Steve Nygren say they're running their business the old-fashioned way: looking back to what they call a ""village model,"" where people shop and dine locally, helping to sustain each other's business while also creating less waste. ""People are looking for what's important, quality of life, for them and their children. Many of the residents want to know their neighbors, and we're creating public spaces where they can interact,"" Steve says. The community started small: the Nygrens bought a farmhouse and 90 acres of land back in 1991. At first they used it as a weekend retreat from nearby Atlanta, but three years later they made it their permanent residence and workplace. Soon the 90 acres became 1000, the farmhouse became an inn, and the Nygrens developed a vision of community. ""We're intentional in the way that we respect the environment. It's about the way you live, the way you interact, the way you eat,"" says Marie. It has also been a business success: today Serenbe is a four-year-old upscale housing development, where the starting price for a house is $350,000. In the last three years Serenbe has grown to a community of 160 residents, mostly young families who work in the Atlanta area, the self-employed or retired. So far, 102 freshly built environmentally friendly homes and business spaces have been rented and sold, a small collection of boutiques and galleries has popped up, and at the heart of the community, three restaurants are thriving.  See photos of what the community looks like Â» . Hilary White is the latest chef to join Serenbe's community, and her 18-month-old restaurant, The Hil on the Hill, is now the centerpiece of the community's small commercial block. White came to Serenbe for the four-acre organic farm that is now steps away from her kitchen. She gets her kale there in the winter, her fruit in summer, and for most of the year enough produce for all of her cooking at the restaurant. Not only does she save fuel and energy by minimizing the products she has to have shipped in, but diners near and far are drawn to the freshness of farm-to-table cuisine. ""The winter is a smaller menu, but in the summer it's endless,"" she says. Harvesting the last delicate bundles of this season's spinach for tonight's dinner, she already knows how to use them: ""We like these leaves, nice and crinkly, holds the vinaigrette really well, and it's just got a real good flavor."" In colder months she makes her culinary creations with hearty winter vegetables like shitake mushrooms, cabbage and Kohlrabi, a water chestnut-textured turnip. But what's driving the restaurant's success in these cold economic climes? Jim White, Hilary's husband and business partner, says it's the alternative nature of their business that has saved them from going under. ""We don't have as much of a roller coaster ride, people are traveling to see us, and they come from the city because of the whole farm-to-table concept.""  Watch a farm-to-table cooking demo Â» . Hilary and Jim admit that the restaurant's sales have slowed recently, but business is brisk enough that they have no plans to scale back. And Serenbe is also bucking some of the national trends, especially when it comes to real estate. According to the National Association of Realtors, new home sales in 2008 were down nearly 37 percent, and it is projected that in 2009 sales could fall another 39 percent. The figures have scared developers away from investing in new types of property, but Steve Nygren says that Serenbe is maintaining sales even now. ""We still have consistent movement,"" Steve says, ""and considering the current environment we're really pleased."" Shelton Stanfill was one of Serenbe's first full-time residents. Before moving to the development in 2006 he ran Atlanta's Woodruff Arts Center. He says he was attracted to Serenbe because he saw it as a ""poster child for the anti-sprawl mentality."" Like many other residents, Stanfill was also drawn to the communal feel of the development. ""We lived in Atlanta for 11 years and within four months of being at Serenbe I knew more people by first name than I ever did in my old neighborhood,"" he says. When Steve Nygren started building his vision of an eco-community, conventional developers were skeptical about Serenbe, but now Steve says that ""a lot of those developers are coming out now with tape measures and cameras to see what we're doing. They're realizing that high-quality environmental developments sell.""","Serenbe founded on principles of farm-to-table cooking, green building techniques .

"MIAMI, Florida (CNN)  -- You don't expect to hear an electric saw in church, but Kevin Cross uses the tool along with a frying pan, blender and toaster oven to help free people from debt. Kevin Cross holds the boards steady as a woman uses a reciprocating saw to cut up her credit cards. This money missionary helps people destroy those little plastic shovels, otherwise known as credit cards, that so many people have used to dig their way to financial ruin. ""It's such an easy message. It really is,"" says Cross, an ex-con who credits religion for his conversion from thief to money coach. ""That's why it doesn't take a rocket scientist, it doesn't take a CPA to do it. A first-year bookkeeper can figure out that you can't spend more than you make,"" he said. Earlier this month, Cross spoke to about 150 people at the Miami Vineyard Community Church where Kevin Fischer is the pastor. ""You've got to plan your spending; you've got to give back a part to God. You've got to save for the future, and you've got to learn to be content,"" said Fischer. Fischer says the pressure of money and debt is enormous on people, especially more recently. ""We should change the marriage vows from 'till death do us part' to 'debt do us part' because that's what's going on, and it's so true,"" he said. Cross is breathless. As he speaks to the crowd, he's a non-stop, doesn't-come-up-for-air, high-octane money missionary. He uses Christian principles, prayer, common sense, and a few good one-liners to get his message across. ""I had a 401k, it went to a 201k, went to 101k, now it's just K,"" he said as the crowd laughs. ""I'm thinking I got a thousand bucks left, and I can retire for about a week."" Cross presides over a day-long sermon on how people can make their lives better by taking control of their spending. He says he tries to demonstrate the long-term effects of irresponsible borrowing. Simple stuff, he says, will make people more content and give them the cushion necessary to give back. His new book is ""Building Your Financial Fortress in 52 Days."" ""I want to get people to have more margin, so instead of investing in stuff, and stuff that doesn't last, they can invest in people's lives,"" he said. The tools he uses to hammer home his message go beyond his overhead TV screens, charts and calculators. Cross invites his guests, who pay $25 a head to hear his message, to come up to the front of the room for what he calls the beginning of ""freedom."" On a table, sit a frying pan, a toaster oven, a blender and a wooden sawhorse and an electric saw. About six people cut up their credit cards and bake them in the toaster oven as if they were TV dinners. Others sliced and diced their Visa, MasterCard and Amex, before mixing the pieces with Spam in the blender. At one point, Cross called for some cooking oil as one lady stood over her credit card-saute with a spatula. Holding a plate full of the little pieces of credit card, Cross said, ""This looks like a melted credit card, but this really represents freedom in these people's lives, because it's the first step."" Cellie Mayol says she used to have 10 or 11 credit cards. She put on protective goggles, taped her cards to a two-by-four and shredded them with a reciprocating saw. ""It just felt like the right thing to do to get me started on the right path,"" she said. ""The Sawzall [reciprocating saw] was exhilarating. I love that feeling."" Kevin Cross wasn't always this way. About 20 years ago, as a teen, he embezzled about $300,000 from the sheriff's office in Broward County, Florida. Yes, the sheriff's office. Cross was a bookkeeper and skimmed money from an account filled by payments from court judgments. He invested the stolen funds and profited about $50,000 before he was caught. He was charged with fraud and theft, and spent minimal time in jail. He paid half the money back. But, he says, that was another life ago. Cross says it took him four years to crawl out of his own hole; He was $100,000 in debt. ""I could spend a thousand dollars a day,"" Cross told the crowd. ""Although, I'd have to spend about two days recovering from that -- you know what I mean,"" he said. ""I completely sabotaged my life, all in one year. I did more damage in one year than most people do in their whole life."" One night, as a 20 year old, he says, he was parking cars at Miami's Hyatt Regency hotel. He was wearing black ladies garden shoes, because he couldn't afford the black sneakers that were part of his uniform. A Jaguar pulled up, and inside was one of Miami's most recognizable newsmen, anchorman Dwight Lauderdale. He took the car, turned on the radio, and heard a Christian financial expert say, ""There is hope for the hopeless. All you have to do is give your heart and soul to the Lord."" ""And then, I thought, oh Lord, if you're there. I need you."" ""I wasn't going to find satisfaction in money. The only place I was going to find it was outside of that, and I found it, in turning my heart over to God."" He became a CPA and spends one full day each week doing free financial counseling for needy people. He says he no longer gets high on money. He only helps people understand that they can manage their money in a way that can help themselves, their families and others. Juan and Beth Diaz were at the seminar. They said they ran up their credit cards and that their home, south of Miami, went into foreclosure last year. ""America has been a very greedy, give-me-now country for so long, and I think it's a wake-up call for everybody that we can live differently,"" said Beth Diaz. Juan Diaz, her husband, says doing away with credit cards has helped them. The couple plans to be debt free in about 18 months. ""They're telling you: 'Use me, you need me' -- and they own you. We've gotten to the point where we just don't need credit cards,"" he explained. ""Everything we do, we plan, and if we don't have the money, we just don't buy it,"" he said.","Kevin Cross teaches churchgoers about the evil of credit cards .

"(CNN) -- Three Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, police officers became the first department fatalities since 1995 Saturday morning while responding to a domestic dispute call, Police Chief Nathan Harper said. Law enforcement from several jurisdictions respond to a shooting standoff at Pittsburgh home Saturday. ""We have never had to lose three officers in the line of duty at one time at one call,"" Harper said. Suspect Richard Poplawski surrendered around 11 a.m. outside the Stanton Heights home he shares with his mother after a standoff that lasted nearly four hours and left two more officers injured. Wearing a bulletproof vest and armed with an AK-47, a long rifle and a pistol, Poplawski fired about 100 rounds during the standoff, Harper said.  Watch officers respond at the scene Â» . Poplawski was taken into custody after surrendering to law enforcement. He is expected to face charges of homicide, aggravated assault and other related offenses, Harper said. Officer Paul Sciullo III was the first to approach the home after responding to the scene around 7:05 a.m. He was shot in the head as he entered the doorway. When Officer Stephen Mayhle tried to help his fellow officer, he too was shot in the head, Harper said. Officer Eric Kelly, who rushed to the scene on his way home after finishing his shift, was fatally shot as he attempted to assist his fallen colleagues, Harper said. The shootings triggered a standoff between Poplawski, who was shooting from his bedroom window, and law enforcement agencies from several jurisdictions, Harper said. Poplawski opened fire at an Army SWAT vehicle that arrived around 8:30 a.m., preventing them and medics from reaching the wounded policemen. Officer Timothy McManaway also was shot in the hand, the chief said. Another officer, Brian Jones, broke his leg while trying to get over a fence while securing the rear of the house, he said. Some neighbors were evacuated during the standoff. Neighbors reported that the family had caused trouble before and Harper said police had responded to calls from the home two or three times.","NEW: Suspect was wearing bulletproof vest, armed with AK-47, police chief says .

"(CNN) -- Midway through Jason Dinant's fitness journey to get six-pack abs by June, the 27-year-old had a breakdown. Halfway through his fitness goal,  Jason Dinant said he sees a four-pack gradually forming. After months of eschewing junk food in favor of lean protein -- egg whites, chicken breast and vegetables -- he devoured pie. The slice came from Marie Callender's, drizzled with caramel, loaded with candied apples and layered with cream cheese. Yes, it was delicious, Dinant said. Then he got home and had a Tootsie Roll. Then, he ate a Klondike ice cream bar. The breakdown came late February after months of following a lean diet. It also came with consequences. ""When I woke up the next day, I had a horrible stomach  ache,"" Dinant said. ""My trainer said once you're on the diet, you can try to go back and have a day where you binge on bad food and it's going to give you a stomach ache."" Since January, CNNhealth has been following the progress of three iReport contributors as they strive to meet their New Year's diet and fitness goals. One of them is Dinant, a Las Vegas, Nevada resident, who wanted to get a six-pack by summer in time for his 10-year high school reunion.  He also wants to show off a chiseled stomach on his blog called ""Naked Boy News,"" where he stands shirtless to give ""the naked truth about today's news."" The junk food breakdown came after almost two months of staying on a lean diet.  The self-described ""candyaholic"" often craved his favorite treats like York Peppermint patties, macaroons, Mounds bars and Coca Cola. ""The key to falling off the wagon is not to stay off the wagon,"" said Gregg Avedon, a certified fitness trainer and model whose chiseled six-pack has appeared on the cover of Men's Health magazine 18 times. ""If you fall off the wagon for one day, the problem is it could lead to two days, three days, a week, then you fall off completely. Next thing you know, it leads to two weeks of binge eating."" Dinant has maintained his diet of 16 egg whites, one and a quarter-pound of meat, four cups of vegetables, potatoes and rice a day. He treats himself to one Tootsie Roll a day, and sometimes indulges in gelato. Dinant's quest for six-pack abs -- which initially included 500 daily crunches  -- brought attention from his neighbors, an egg company that ships him 15 dozen eggs every two weeks and news media such as USA Today and his hometown newspaper, Las Vegas Review-Journal and blogs. Some people left words of encouragement for Dinant's quest for tight abs, but others were less supportive. A picture compared him to a toothpick. Another one showed a kitten shooting a shirtless Dinant. ""A lot of people said, 'You need to put on a shirt,'"" he said, so Dinant set up a Web site called putonashirt.com where he compiled the comments. The hate mail comes ""when they see a thin guy trying to be more fit. They're jealous,"" Dinant said. The negative comments add fuel to his fire. ""I've wanted to do this before and last year, I had the same resolution,"" Dinant said.  ""I did it for two weeks and by January 15, it was time to move on. So I applied for iReport. I wanted people to follow it, so I'm motivated to do it.  So many people are watching, so mentally, I have to do it. I put my mind to it. I have to do it."" Watch Dinant's video . Dinant doesn't have a six-pack yet. ""You can see four,"" he said.  ""It's more defined. The middle two are coming in. I need a tan. I'm so white it's hard to see."" In January, Dinant's exercise regimen started with 500 stomach crunches a day, after hearing a Britney Spears interview about her sit-ups for toned abs.  Dinant has abandoned the crunches and enlisted a personal trainer who has designed 11 core body exercises. For 20 minutes, Dinant performs 25 repetitions of the exercises, which include a floor bicycle, upward leg lifts and a type of sit-up where he lifts his legs and arms up at the same time. He spends an hour jogging, doing cardio and lifting weights.  He also changes his exercise routines and works out four to five times a week. Recently, Dinant lost his job in sales for a Las Vegas show, which he attributes to a sluggish economy.  He still has his job as an emcee for a night club and on the bright side, he said he ""can dedicate more time to work out."" ""I'm working out my legs and arms to burn the calories, to lose the layer of fat,"" he said. ""I don't want to plateau and have a two-pack."" Many fitness fanatics do the same exercises and never see improvements because they plateau, said Avedon, a trainer in Sunrise, Florida. ""In the gym, you need to change the factors of what you're doing,"" he said.  ""If you're doing heavy weights and lower reps, you can change to more moderate weights and moderate repetitions.  You can change exercises, do different types of cardio. It's creating change. The body adapts to change quickly and responds really well when you hit a plateau."" At the same time, some people have difficulty getting a six pack, because of elevated levels of cortisol which can lead to belly fat, said Avedon, author of ""Muscle Chow: More Than 150 Meals to Feed Your Muscles and Fuel Your Workouts."" ""You've got to make sure the cortisol level is not elevated,"" he said. ""One way is proper sleep and reducing stress."" Before blaming hormones for flab, Avedon warned, ""you really need to make sure you're doing all the right things first. So many people don't take accountability."" The good news for Dinant is that the hardest part is getting the initial six pack and afterwards, it gets easier. ""There's a big learning curve,"" Avedon said.  ""Granted there are people who can eat pizza and can get a six-pack.  For people struggling to get a six pack, you learn to eat properly, get in a gym and be consistent. You know what you need to do. Definitely, it would be easier to maintain it and more difficult to obtain it in the beginning.""","iReporter Jason Dinant on a quest for six-pack abs has sweet tooth binge .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A paper cape sits loosely around your shoulders, covering your naked chest. A radiology technologist directs you toward an imposing-looking machine. As you hold your breath, one bare breast at a time is tightly compressed between two flat panels and X-rayed. You'll undress from the waist up for a mammogram; wearing two pieces, not a dress, makes it easier. It's a scene that's been repeated more than 35 million times in the past year at certified mammogram facilities around the United States. No matter what their age, race or medical history, the female patients probably shared a similar experience during the 20-minute procedure. ""Mammograms are known to be uncomfortable,"" concedes Dr. Sujatha Reddy, an Atlanta, Georgia,-based gynecologist. ""The harder they squeeze and squish that breast, the less tissue the X-rays have to go through and the more likely they are to find something."" The American Cancer Society reports two to four mammograms out of every 1,000 lead to a diagnosis of cancer. About 10 percent of women who have a mammogram will require more tests. Accuracy often depends on patient cooperation, but Reddy reveals there's another side as well: ""A mammogram is only going to be as good as the technician and the doctor who read it, so you want to go to a good place."" A recent study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute reports that doctors reading mammograms miss an average of two in every 10 cases of breast cancer. Medical experts remind women that mammograms alone don't guarantee a clean bill of health. ""I wish I could say the mammogram could find 100 percent of breast cancers,"" Reddy said. ""I think we have to rely on having a clinical breast exam once a year at a health care provider and doing your self-breast exam on a monthly basis."" Reddy recommends having mammogram screenings at a reputable facility that is certified. She also suggests going to the same office every year so that old X-rays can be compared with new films. A convenient location is another factor that makes it more likely that someone will actually show up for an annual mammogram appointment.  Health Minute: Watch more on what to expect during a mammogram. Â» . Fear of discomfort is what often keeps some women away. Reddy advises her patients to schedule a screening appointment for the early part of their menstrual cycle. ""The best time of your cycle to do a mammogram is going to be when your period is over, maybe the week after your period is done when the breasts are not going to be tender."" Caffeinated coffee, tea and soft drinks may also contribute to tender, lumpy breasts. Experts recommend avoiding caffeine for a week before the procedure. Before having any type of imaging test, the Cancer Society warns patients to tell technicians if they think they might be pregnant or are breast feeding. Similarly, reveal any unusual breast symptoms or problems before a mammogram. The screening requires women to undress from the waist up. You'll be given a disposable wrap to put around your shoulders and chest. Wearing a two-piece outfit will make the process easier and more convenient. Technicians tell patients not to wear deodorant, antiperspirants, perfumes or powders. They might leave a residue that can be picked up on the X-rays, interfering with the results. All mammogram facilities are required to issue results within 30 days, but many will contact patients within a week if there is a problem with the mammogram. The Cancer Society recommends women 40 and older get a mammogram every year. Younger women may be advised to be screened earlier if there is a family history of breast cancer. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- You'd love to go. Just think of the history, the beautiful artwork ... the things you could learn. But upon hearing the word ""museum,"" your kids break into a chorus of ""I'd rather die."" Your children can pet some of the world's insect species at the Insectarium in New Orleans, Louisiana. So you wheel, deal and promise ice cream in massive amounts. In return, they agree to whine only when it's absolutely necessary -- or every five seconds, whichever comes first. Perhaps you can avoid a situation like this on your vacation. Pauline Frommer, creator of the Pauline Frommer Guidebooks, has two kids, ages 6 and 10. As a travel author, she knows what makes a museum educational and interesting for adults. As a mom, she knows what will keep children from being bored to tears. ""I think it's impossible to pick the very best five,"" Frommer said. ""But here are five really terrific museums, with very different subject matters, that both kids and adults will groove on."" The Spy Museum, Washington . Frommer describes this museum as ""an intriguing, surprisingly scholarly, fun and highly interactive introduction to the shadowy world of spies."" When you enter the Spy Museum, you will be asked to pick an alternate identity. Throughout the building, you and your kids will be tested on keeping this cover. In addition to seeing all kinds of cool spy gadgets -- umbrellas with poison tips! --- you'll learn about famous spies throughout history, how the government uses these undercover agents and the common ways spies practice their trade. ""I had trouble dragging my kids out of this one,"" Frommer said. ""And I've been through it twice and enjoyed it both times."" Adults $18; children ages 5-11 $15; children under 5 free . The Grammy Museum, Los Angeles, California . Only 3 months old, the Grammy Museum goes well beyond the famous music awards. ""In truth, it's a museum that celebrates the history of recorded music and does so in a cutting-edge, highly interactive manner,"" Frommer said. Every genre from rock to hip-hop to country music is explored here. Top recording artists serve as your guide as they discuss, for example, what makes jazz such an important American phenomenon, what the song-writing process is like or how one genre of music has deeply affected another. Sound like child dull-ville? ""Kids will love the booths that allow them to mix and produce music,"" Frommer said. The museum also has a dynamic touch-screen map that allows visitors to explore the nation's musical heritage and several video displays that will distract any kid's short attention span. Adults $14.95; children 6-17 $10.95; children under 5 free . The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York . You might not think world-renowned art exhibits would be a good fit with your kids; priceless objects don't often mesh with PB&J-smeared fingers. But Frommer says you will be doing your children a great disservice if you visit New York and don't bring them to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ""Don't worry, what with all the armor, the mummies and Egyptian temples, the always fun costume collection and the over-the-top grandeur of the place, there's no way they could be bored,"" she said. The museum also offers a number of family programs, associate museum educator Mike Norris said. The museum's kids Web site has activities to keep kids entertained while visiting, including guides that focus on specific areas of art like a scavenger hunt, from animals to doors to stained glass. Norris' top recommendation is not to view the museum as a whole, but as 16 to 18 mini museums. ""It's best not to conquer us in one visit,"" he said. ""Remember, [kids'] legs go at twice the RPMs that yours do."" Other offerings from the museum include family audio guides that are best for ages 6 to 12, Norris said, and a ""Make your Mark!"" sketching book that is aimed at younger children. Suggested admission for adults $20; children under 12 free . The Insectarium, New Orleans, Louisiana . The Insectarium, part of the Audubon Nature Institute, pays tribute to everything creepy and crawly. Many up-close insect encounters will take place here, from watching winged beauties in the butterfly garden to the bugs you (or just your children!) can pet. The Insectarium's Web site boasts of trips through the Louisiana swamp, an animated insect film and a special exhibit where you'll be shrunk to insect size. ""I thought I'd be grossed out but came away fascinated,"" Frommer said. ""And all the kids around me were enthralled."" Can't make it there in person? Visit the Web site to download butterfly origami and coloring pages or let your kids read Harry the Praying Mantis' blog. Adults $15; children 2 to 12 $10 . Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois . ""What kid doesn't love dinosaurs?"" Frommer asked. The Field Museum of Natural History sports one of the largest, most complete Tyrannosaurus rex fossils around. The museum also has a new exhibit called ""Real Pirates,"" running through October 25, that will let your children experience the pirate life. They can hoist the skull-and-crossbones, tie pirate knots, learn how to fire a cannon and more, the museum's Web site says. Permanent exhibits include displays about Africa, animal biology, bird habitats, ancient Egypt, Eskimos and Native Americans.

"LA PAZ, Bolivia (CNN)  -- Bolivian officials have declared a health emergency after three deaths attributed to dengue hemorrhagic fever, the often-lethal form of a mosquito-borne disease that more than 1,000 Bolivians are thought to have contracted since November. Brazilian soldiers pour insecticide to fight dengue fever in 2008. Bolivia also is battling the mosquito-borne disease. At least 12 unconfirmed instances of dengue hemorrhagic fever have been reported in the first 17 days of 2009, the official ABI news agency said. About 250 cases of dengue fever, the milder, nonlethal form of the disease, have been confirmed in the past two weeks, said Health Minister Ramiro Tapia in the Los Tiempos de Cochabamba newspaper. Authorities said they have committed more than 20,000 military personnel and 2.5 tons of insecticide to combat the disease. A preteen boy died last week at Children's Hospital of La Paz, a few days after arriving with internal bleeding, hospital director Christian Fuentes told La Razon newspaper in La Paz, the nation's capital. ""By that time, there was nothing we could do. He had multiple internal hemorrhages,"" Fuentes said. A 17-year-old boy and a 30-year-old woman also died last week, the ABI news agency said, citing the national director of epidemiology, Juan Carlos Arraya. Cases of dengue fever usually spike from November through January, which is Bolivia's hot and rainy season. Alberto Nogales, the country's vice minister of health, said the fight against mosquitoes will last until April. Dengue occurs in tropical and subtropical parts of the world, transmitted by the bite of a mosquito infected with one of four dengue viruses, the World Health Organization says. Symptoms, which appear three to 14 days after the bite, can include mild to high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain and a rash, the WHO says. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially fatal complication that affects mainly children, the WHO says. Symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting and bleeding. The disease cannot be transmitted directly from one person to another. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are up to 100 million cases worldwide each year. ""It actually is quite common,"" Dr. Ali Khan of the CDC told CNN last year. ""And unfortunately, over the last 30 years or so we've seen an increase in the number of countries infected with dengue fever."" Khan attributes the increase in part to population growth. Mosquitoes that carry dengue typically breed in areas near humans. ""This is a disease that occurs where there's lots of population,"" he said. The WHO says mosquitoes carrying dengue viruses breed in exposed water, including places as shallow as jars, discarded bottles and plant saucers. Last year, 55,000 people in southeastern Brazil contracted the disease. The outbreak was confirmed as causing the deaths of at least 67 people -- almost half of them children under 13 -- and another 58 deaths were under investigation last summer, the Rio de Janeiro state's ministry of health reported at the time. Final statistics on the outbreak were not immediately available.","At least 12 unconfirmed instances of dengue hemorrhagic fever reported in Bolivia .

"CANTON, Georgia (CNN) -- Meet Kaden, bomb-sniffing dog in training. Jeff Schettler coaches handlers on how to work with detection dogs, including Kaden, far right, in the field. His name, a Gaelic word meaning ""little battle,"" is fitting for the energetic 12-pound puppy with a perky tail that curls like a cinnamon bun. At 4 months old, Kaden is a playful, black- and white-coated basenji being schooled at Georgia K9 National Training Center. Once fully trained, he will assist federal and local police officers as well as private corporations in nosing out deadly explosives at schools, airports and public events. His detective skills can potentially save thousands of lives in an era where law enforcement agencies are aggressively fighting against drugs and terrorist attacks. ""Think about a scenario like the 1996 Olympic bombings,"" says Kaden's trainer Jeff Schettler, a cheery man who has coached hundreds of dogs to sniff out bombs, drugs, missing people and corpses since the mid-1990s. Demand for these detection canines -- including bomb dogs such as Kaden -- has surged as homeland security and drug crackdowns become a bigger priority for government and law enforcement. The North American Police Work Dog Association says 35,000 dogs are trained to do detective work in the U.S. The association estimates up to 10,000 dogs have been added since the September 11, 2001, attacks.  Watch three detection puppies in action Â» . Official records of training puppies to work as detection dogs date back to the early 1900s in the U.S. In more recent years, police departments realized a dog's nose was a valuable asset. Dogs possess impressive olfactory abilities -- some breeds more than others. For each drop of odor detected by a dog, the human nose would require 1,000 to 10,000 drops of odor, veterinarians say.  Can your pooch be a detection dog? Â» . Other animals may have smelling skills that rival a dog's, such as pigs nosing for truffles in France or honey bees that can sniff out TNT particles, but veterinarians say dogs are the most controllable and sociable for their human handlers. Police dogs remain the most affordable and reliable solution to solving crimes that require scent detection, police officers say. Trained dogs can track down cocaine camouflaged inside car seats. They can find children who have mysteriously vanished overnight. Detection dogs can even weed out pest-infested apples and oranges accidentally left in suitcases at airports. ""They are a growing aspect of law enforcement,"" says Jim Watson, secretary at the North American Police Work Dog Association and a handler for decades. Earlier this month, investigators were baffled during the international manhunt for George Zinkhan, a former University of Georgia professor accused of fatally shooting his wife and two other people. Two weeks into the search, two cadaver dogs, a German shepherd named Circe and an Australian shepherd named Madison, arrived. Within 10 hours, the dogs picked up the scent of Zinkhan's remains in a shallow pit hidden in a thick forest. Once the dogs neared the suspect's body, they gave their handlers personalized signals. Circe barked excitedly. Madison lay down. Trainer Jeff Schettler explains Kaden is an unlikely candidate for police work. Basenjis, a breed that originated in central Africa, are usually used as hunting or show dogs. There are only two other trained police dog basenjis recorded by the North American Police Work Dog Association. Most trainers in the police dog world dislike experimenting with new dogs, preferring to stick to breeds with a proven track record. Most law enforcement agencies rely on Belgian Malinoises and German shepherds for detection work because of their protective yet friendly personalities, but labs, bloodhounds and beagles also can be used. ""We're not trying to fix anything,"" Schettler says. ""We're trying to enhance it."" Schettler points out some of Kaden's advantages: The dog's weight will peak at about 25 pounds, enabling him seamlessly to sift between cramped luggage and lockers. Kaden is barkless because basenjis have an oddly shaped larynx, ideal for quiet searches. On a recent rainy Saturday morning at the Georgia K9 National Training Center, little Kaden undergoes testing. Passing the exam depends on his whiffing talents. Upon the instructor's command, Kaden's pencil-thin legs playfully trot along the damp grass to an oversize wall scattered with dozens of holes. His instructor has hidden black gunpowder wrapped in pantyhose in one of the holes. If Kaden's nose sniffs out the gunpowder, he will immediately sit. Kaden begins on the left side, quickly taking a zigzag pattern from one hole to another. His pace is methodical, a sniff for each hole. Soon he slows, pauses, inhales again and then sinks his tiny hindquarters to the ground. ""What a good boy,"" coo several of Kaden's trainers, stroking his sleek fur and rewarding him with one of his favorite treats, torn bits of venison jerky. As Kaden nibbles on his treat, Schettler admits there are drawbacks to training basenjis. Basenjis don't have a furry coat to endure cold weather like a German shepherd. Basenjis are also a highly independent, stubborn breed with personalities similar to cats, making them difficult to train. Kaden's personality, however, is contrary to most basenjis. He was culled from a litter in Atlanta at 7 days old because of his unusual sociability with humans. ""At eight weeks, he was in the airport going up to people and running around like he owned the place,"" Schettler says. Training detection dogs such as Kaden often begins during puppyhood so imprinting scent differentiation becomes innate, handlers say. Puppies are selected based on breed purity, confidence, sociability and temperament. In any training program, there are doggie dropouts. In those instances, the puppies become pets. On the job, dogs can suffer from on-site injuries, such as mild sprains and bruises. Some dogs have even been killed when a bomb explodes or buildings collapse. As police dogs age, health problems such as arthritis can send them into early retirement.  A work dog's career typically spans about seven years, instructors say. Different breeds specialize in certain detection jobs, says Joseph Morelli, a canine handler for the Connecticut State Police. Morelli says he relies on Labrador retrievers for arson cases. German shepherds at his school are saved for patrolling or drug cases. ""People are really starting to see how useful these dogs can be,"" says Morelli, who has started to train dogs from neighboring states in recent years. ""We're really seeing our program take off.""","Police dogs can nose out explosives, drugs, bodies and missing people .

"(CNN) -- You can call 18-year-old Marc Davis a veteran of the racetrack. On everything from BMX bikes and Bandolero cars to Legends and Late Models, Davis has steadily moved up the ranks of competitive racing. Marc Davis, left, talks strategy with crew chief Billy Venturini in Concord, North Carolina. ""I've been racing for 13 years. Started out when I was 6 years old,"" said Davis, who is set to race this month as NASCAR's only current African-American driver/owner. Two years ago, Davis signed a six-year contract with the Joe Gibbs Race team as a developmental driver. But then the economy went south, and Davis was let go in a cost-cutting move. He was another casualty of the recession. ""We got bit by the economy,"" Davis said. Mike Herman Jr. has worked as Davis' coach for the past two years and feels that NASCAR could be in store for even rougher financial times. ""In my honest opinion, I feel like motorsports is a year away from feeling the brunt of the recession."" Davis' father, Harry, breaks it down further and says it's all about sponsorship money. ""Sponsors are harder to find. Teams want more money. So now instead of being unemployed, Marc is now self-employed, moving forward and racing his own team.""  Watch Marc Davis at the track Â» . Davis formed his own two-car team to compete in this year's Nationwide Series, with his first entry set for Bristol, Tennessee, on March 21.  His team is being funded by family and a few sponsors, not an easy feat when it costs a minimum of $75,000 to enter a Nationwide Series race. In fact, a two-car team is considered a skeletal operation by NASCAR standards. Some of the better-funded racing teams have 12 to 20 cars at their disposal. But Davis' crew chief, Billy Venturini, says a two-car team can work for the time being. ""It's a start-up deal, but I think with the short schedule he's got, I think we'll be in fine shape."" Several NASCAR teams have scaled back on their budgets, and Davis feels that it actually levels the playing field a bit. ""With a lower-budget team, you have a better shot of making races and winning races to be more competitive, since a lot of the higher teams have cut back their budgets as well."" NASCAR spokesman Ramsey Poston agrees with Davis and goes one step further. ""Several teams are watching their spending, and that brings more parity in the sport, with the result being a more competitive and enjoyable product for race fans."" Davis plans to compete in a number of Nationwide Series races before moving on to the Sprint Cup Series. ""I want to progress through the Nationwide Series and enter the Sprint Cup Series and win championships and hopefully be a full-time owner years down the road, so I think everything's going in the right direction,"" Davis said. With a strong family and a nuts and bolts crew behind him, Marc Davis could be on the cusp of something special.","NASCAR racer Marc Davis,18, lost driver's contract and became owner .

"In the dining room's soft amber glow, dozens of patrons peruse the menu at Rock Creek restaurant in Bethesda, Maryland. From a health standpoint, making a smart choice is easy. Watch your portion size and inquire about the nutritional content of your meal when you eat out. Whether it's the slow-cooked salmon with sesame seeds, warm bok choy salad, and miso mustard dressing or the jumbo lump crab cakes with celeriac-apple slaw and lemon-caper aioli, each meal contains 600 or fewer calories -- nearly half the amount found in a typical restaurant entree. ""We offer what you're supposed to eat -- proper portions, great flavor-and we use fresh, local ingredients as much as possible,"" says co-owner Tom Williams, who, with partner Judith Hammerschmidt, opened Rock Creek two years ago. The pair worked with Cynthia Payne Moore, R.D., a Baltimore, Maryland-based dietitian, to obtain nutritional analyses for every item on the menu, and they adjust recipes to avoid unnecessary fat and determine portion sizes.   ""We put the nutritional information in the back of the menu-people who want to look at it do, and those who don't, don't,"" Hammerschmidt says.   The concept and execution have proved so successful that earlier this year, the pair opened another Rock Creek in Washington, D.C. Enjoying restaurant food like Rock Creek's -- tasty, good for you, and with a reasonable amount of calories -- was once a difficult order to fill. No longer.   ""The idea that eating healthy doesn't mean feeling deprived is something restaurants see as a vehicle for change, as a way to differentiate their offerings from their competitors,"" says Master Chef Mark Erickson, vice president for continuing education at the Culinary Institute of America.   While some restaurants make it clear they offer more healthful fare -- by using symbols, calorie counts, and the like -- others practice what Erickson calls ""stealth health,"" making some healthful changes on the menu without fanfare. ""When restaurants make their menus more healthful, consumers benefit,"" Erickson says. And, in fact, eating well when dining out is a growing trend. Healthfulness on the menu . Part of what's driving these positive changes is consumer demand. Nearly three out of four adults say they are trying to make healthier choices when eating out than they did just two years ago, according to the National Restaurant Association.   ""It's hard to refute that health is related to diet,"" Erickson says. ""And restaurants are making up more and more of the daily diet -- the average American eats one out of three meals away from home."" Increasingly, savvy consumers expect restaurants to have a conscious approach to food preparation similar to the one they use in their own kitchens -- using fruits and vegetables creatively or cooking with less saturated fat or salt. CookingLight.com: Secrets to eating out . Legislative changes are also having an effect. The New York City-initiated ban on trans fats has become far-reaching; at least eight other major metropolitan areas have legislated similar bans, as have restaurants, hotels, theme parks, cruise lines, and many other businesses.   Meanwhile, New York City recently took another stand on upgrading restaurant menus. In a move affecting mostly fast-food restaurants, the city's board of health recently asked food service establishments with standardized preparation methods that already have nutrition analyses to post calorie information on menus so customers can see it when deciding what to order. Many restaurants purposefully take their offerings to a more healthful level. Since he took over the kitchen at the highly regarded Gramercy Tavern in New York City last October, Executive Chef Michael Anthony has created lighter dishes, many of which feature vegetables rather than meat as the plate's centerpiece. ""The goal is to leave consumers feeling invigorated, not lethargic because they've overindulged,"" Anthony says. Like Rock Creek, some restaurants are building their business around a more healthful model. Seasons 52, which has five locations in Florida and two in Atlanta, Georgia, takes a lighter approach to dining by featuring fresh foods that rotate with the seasons and dishes that contain a maximum of 475 calories.   The chefs do this by taking out fat, lowering sugar and salt when possible, and relying instead on flavorful accents such as balsamic vinegar, lemon juice, garlic, and fruits. ""We call it 'palate distraction,'"" explains Clifford Pleau, director of culinary development. ""If you can give the mouth something else to focus on, it says, 'Wow! I haven't tasted something that interesting before,' instead of 'Wow! Something's missing.'"" CookingLight.com: An expert take on healthful dining-out trends . Tap into the trend . ""While restaurants are becoming more health-conscious, it's only going to keep happening if people ask for it,"" says Katherine Tallmadge, R.D., a Washington, D.C.-based spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Here's how to support the trend while ordering sensibly: . â¢ Do a little homework. ""If you decide ahead of time what you want to order, it will eliminate temptation while you are at the restaurant,"" Tallmadge says. Many national chains post nutrition analyses on their Web sites, so you can find out how much fat, cholesterol, sodium, protein, carbohydrates, fiber, and calories a potential meal contains. Healthydiningfinder.com, a Web site operated by the National Restaurant Association, can help you pinpoint nutritious fare at nearly 30,000 restaurants across the country -- enter your ZIP code or your city, and you can search for restaurants by cuisine or price range. â¢ Watch portion size. Prodigious entrees remain common in many restaurants, despite other changes for the better. Because patrons tend to place a premium on value -- they want to feel as if they're getting their money's worth -- piled-high plates aren't likely to become a relic of the past anytime soon.   ""You can negotiate such situations by having part of your meal boxed to take home, downsizing your order by selecting an appetizer and side salad instead of an entree, or splitting the entree with someone,"" says Dawn Jackson Blatner, R.D., a Chicago, Illinois-based ADA spokesperson. CookingLight.com: How to practice portion control . â¢ Sample small plates. Tapas-sized servings -- i.e. small plates -- will continue to be in fashion in coming years, according to Restaurant Startup Consultants, Inc., which counsels new food service businesses. Small plates allow you to sample a variety of dishes without consuming too many calories. In addition to high-end restaurants, the trend is also appearing in some national chains. In March, TGI Friday's unveiled a new Right Portion, Right Price menu, offering smaller portions of certain entrees that contain 500 calories or less and 10 grams of fat or less per serving. CookingLight.com: Tapas at home . â¢ Choose seasonal ingredients. A less-is-more approach governs the preparation of fresh, seasonal ingredients: They're often minimally dressed or sauced, allowing fresh flavors to play the starring role. Look for items like spinach and roasted beet salad or roasted butternut squash on fall menus.   ""If you have a high-quality meat, fish, or vegetable that has a great deal of flavor, you don't need to eat a lot of it to feel satisfied,"" says Hugo Matheson, chef-owner of the Kitchen CafÃ©, who practices this principle at his Boulder, Colorado, restaurant. CookingLight.com: Ultimate summer cookbook . â¢ Select healthful sides. These days, healthful sides, ranging from steamed broccoli to grilled asparagus to sautÃ©ed spinach with garlic, have more space on restaurant menus. ""The idea that you can have an indulgent entree but improve your sides is something I enjoy because it's a small change,"" Blatner says. ""If you make small steps to improve what you eat, you'll be healthier for it."" â¢ Look for balance. Chefs and restaurateurs are reexamining the fundamentals of their offerings. At Seasons 52, for example, each entree plate is made up of one-third protein and two-thirds fruits, vegetables, and starches. Others are practicing what the Culinary Institute refers to as ""the protein flip.""   ""Finer dining establishments are flipping the traditional plating concept. Vegetables and carbohydrates are the main component, and protein is secondary,"" Erickson says. â¢ Ask questions. When ordering, inquire about the meal's composition or preparation. ""Go to restaurants where the people serving the food know what the ingredients are,"" Pleau says. For example, Rock Creek uses phyllo instead of traditional lard-laced dough in its piecrusts; but unless you ask them, you won't know that you can enjoy a slice of their pie and avoid unnecessary saturated fat and calories. â¢ Enjoy yourself. While we're all eating out more often these days, consider a restaurant meal to be a treat. Savor the flavors, and select dishes you can't or wouldn't make in your own kitchen. ""Look at the meal as a source of pleasure,"" Anthony says. ""The key is to relish the experience -- within moderation."" For more tips on making healthy taste great, try Cooking Light - CLICK HERE .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- On March 30 the Open Skies treaty went into effect, liberalizing air travel between the U.S. and Europe. But how will the ease of restrictions on transatlantic routes affect business travelers? Under Open Skies, European and U.S. airlines will be given unlimited access between Europe and U.S. points. The treaty puts an end to the exclusive arrangement granted to British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, United Airlines and American Airlines to fly transatlantic out of London Heathrow. But with the airport currently operating at almost-maximum capacity, new flights will be severely limited. As a result competition is fierce for Heathrow slots, with airlines paying as much as $60 million to get their hands on them. For each flight that is added, another less lucrative service is scrapped. Airlines are giving priority to high-yield business routes to and from Heathrow. While European carriers are now allowed to fly from any point within E.U across the Atlantic, the U.S. domestic market remains closed to them. Operators in Europe hope that a second phase of the Open Skies deal will mean a relaxation of restrictions on European airlines' investment in U.S. carriers and the ability for European airlines to compete in the U.S. domestic market. The issue is pending in U.S. Congress. If the U.S. doesn't deliver, there is a clause in the agreement that states the Open Skies treaty -- phase I included -- can be torn up. Industry experts foresee some fare wars in both economy and business-class. Service options are also likely to improve as competition intensifies. U.S. airlines will vie with BA, the dominant carrier at Heathrow, that currently has flights to 24 U.S. cities. The biggest challenge to the incumbent airlines operating out of Heathrow will come from carriers in the SkyTeam alliance, that includes Air France and KLM, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines News, and Continental Airlines. Before Open Skies, the SkyTeam alliance offered no transatlantic routes to and from Heathrow. By summer they will offer 10 percent of these flights. SkyTeam carriers will be located for the first time in Terminal 4. Given the size of the market for U.S.-London flights, airlines will continue to offer services from Gatwick, London's second-busiest airport. Open Skies will intensify competition for ailing U.S. airlines on what has been their most profitable route. Analysts expect to see consolidation between U.S. airlines as they combine international networks to beat competition. One advantage U.S. airlines can offer is opportunity for connecting flights to other European cities as well as on to Asia and the Mideast. European carriers on the other hand, cannot operate domestic flights within the U.S. New flights and new airlines . Oneworld Alliance . British Airways will shift its Dallas and Houston services from Gatwick to Heathrow and its Warsaw operation to Gatwick. Flights to Detroit and Harare will be axed. In June, the airline will also launch services between Continental Europe and New York. Operated by subsidiary OpenSkies, the daily flights will fly from either JFK or Newark to Brussels or Paris CDG using Boeing 757s from its existing fleet. In the future, OpenSkies plans to fly to other business centers, including Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Milan, Madrid, Zurich, and Geneva. BA will also commence business-only flights between New York and London City Airport next year using Airbus A318 jets in a 32-seat layout.

"(CNN) -- The current debate over controversial interrogation practices -- tactics that some say constitute torture -- is rooted in the early years of the fight against terrorism and the Iraq war. The photographs from Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq sparked outrage across the globe. After the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, the Bush administration crafted the legal basis for aggressive interrogation techniques of prisoners and terrorism suspects. The techniques included keeping the prisoner in stress positions for extended periods of time, sleep deprivation, slapping, enclosing the prisoner in a box with insects, and waterboarding, which simulates drowning. Those techniques were detailed in four Bush-era legal memos -- one from 2002 and three from 2005 -- released by the Obama administration last month. The memos concluded that such techniques did not constitute torture and were not illegal.  See timeline of events Â» . The Obama administration disagrees. President Obama formally banned the techniques by issuing an executive order requiring that the U.S. Army field manual be used as the guide for terror interrogations. ""I can stand here tonight and say without exception or equivocation that the United States of America does not torture,"" he said during an address to a joint session of Congress in February. More than 400 people have been disciplined based on investigations involving detainee abuse, according to Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. He said the punishments have ranged from prison sentences to demotions and letters of reprimand. ""The policy of the Department of Defense is to treat prisoners humanely, and those who have violated that policy have been investigated and disciplined,"" he said. The most notorious of the cases centered on Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In 2004, images leaked to the media showed U.S. troops abusing Iraqi prisoners. Some prisoners were stacked atop each other while naked, and others were being threatened by dogs.  See disturbing images from Abu Ghraib (discretion advised) Â» . One widely disseminated photograph showed an Iraqi prisoner hooded and wired, as if an electrocution were about to take place. Eleven American soldiers were tried and convicted of Abu Ghraib offenses, and some officers were reprimanded. Some received prison sentences. Janis Karpinski, a brigadier general and commander of the prison during the time the photographs were taken, was demoted to colonel. She was eventually rotated out of Iraq. The prison was shut down in September 2006. Karpinksi, now retired, said the recent disclosures have validated her earlier claims that she and her troops were following orders and that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were not simply the work of a few ""bad apples,"" as once described by then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.  See gallery of key players Â» . ""That is what we have been saying from the very beginning, that, wait a minute, why are you inside pointing the finger at me? Why are you pointing the fingers at the soldiers here? There's a bigger story here,"" Karpinski said. ""I was never inside an interrogation room where they were conducting interrogations, but I read the memorandums many times over,"" she added. ""Waterboarding is torture."" Other recent disclosures of harsh interrogation tactics have also raised questions. One Bush-era memo -- dated May 30, 2005, and recently released by the Obama administration -- said CIA interrogators used waterboarding at least 266 times on two top al Qaeda suspects. The technique was used at least 83 times in August 2002 on suspected al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaydah, according to the memo. Interrogators also waterboarded Khalid Sheikh Mohammed -- said to be the mastermind of the September 11 attacks -- 183 times in March 2003, the memo said. Obama said last week that he felt comfortable releasing the classified memos because the Bush administration acknowledged using some of the practices associated with the memos, and the interrogation techniques were widely reported and have since been banned. ""Withholding these memos would only serve to deny facts that have been in the public domain for some time,"" Obama said in a statement. ""This could contribute to an inaccurate accounting of the past and fuel erroneous and inflammatory assumptions about actions taken by the United States."" However, Obama recently reversed course on the court-ordered release of hundreds of additional images said to show abuse in detention facilities in Afghanistan and Iraq. He argued that the photos could ""inflame anti-American opinion"" and have ""a chilling effect"" on further investigations of detainee abuse. The photos ""are not particularly sensational, especially when compared to the painful images that we remember from Abu Ghraib,"" he said last week. The Obama administration said last month that it would not object to the release of the photos. The images are from more than 60 criminal investigations into detainee abuse between 2001 through 2006, Pentagon officials said. The release was ordered in response to a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the American Civil Liberties Union. ""Essentially, by withholding these photographs from public view, the Obama administration is making itself complicit in the Bush administration's torture policies,"" ACLU attorney Amrit Singh said. Bush-era officials, especially former Vice President Dick Cheney, have defended the controversial interrogation tactics, arguing that they helped provide valuable information in the fight against terrorism and other conflicts. ""I know specifically of reports that I read,"" Cheney told Fox News last month, ""that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country."" The Obama administration ""didn't put out the memos that showed the success of the effort,"" he said. The memos' release has added momentum to the debate over whether Bush administration officials ought to be prosecuted for authorizing such policies. Obama said Attorney General Eric Holder would decide whether to investigate Bush administration officials who formed the legal basis for the techniques. The Obama administration has said that CIA interrogators who followed the instructions would not be prosecuted for their work. ""We are going to follow the evidence, follow the law and take that where it leads,"" Holder said. ""No one is above the law."" CNN's Arwa Damon, Terry Frieden, Ed Hornick, Jonathan Mann, Mike Mount and Samira Simone contributed to this report.","Recently released Bush-era memos detail controversial interrogation practices .

"(CNET) -- Now that stereo Bluetooth has become a common feature in a lot of music phones, it's no surprise that stereo Bluetooth headsets have become quite popular as well. Stereo Bluetooth headsets come in many shapes and sizes, from the behind-the-ear style of the Motorola Rokr S9 to the over-the-head style of the Jabra BT8030. The Jabra BT3030 is in the style of a pendant, or as its design suggests, more of a dog tag. It's been available for a while now, but we think it's still worth it. The Jabra BT3030 can be purchased for around $39.99. Of course like any stereo Bluetooth headset, the Jabra BT3030 requires a cell phone with the A2DP or stereo Bluetooth profile. The Jabra BT3030 consists primarily of a small remote control unit housed in a dog-tag style pendant. Measuring 2.1-inches long by 1.6-inch wide by 0.38-inch thick, the pendant is slim and compact with a metal finish and a rubberized border all around it. All of the controls are laid out right on the front face in a straightforward grid. They are the Play/Pause key, the track shuffle keys, the volume controls, plus the multifunction Call key. The keys are all made of rubber, and are raised above the surface for a nice tactile feel. The 3.5mm headset jack is on the right spine, while the charger jack is on the bottom. On the top is an opening for an optional lanyard. Also on the top is a tiny microphone. Getting the headset set up is pretty simple. Just power it on via the multifunction Call button, and turn on the Bluetooth pairing mode on your cell phone. We managed to pair the Jabra BT3030 with the LG Chocolate 3 without a problem. From there, we could play/pause tracks, skip songs, and adjust the volume, all from the Jabra BT3030. The Jabra BT3030 comes with nice pair of ear buds that sit comfortably in the ear, but since it has a 3.5mm headset jack, you can use any headphones of your choosing. Aside from using the Jabra BT3030 for music, you can also use the it to make calls via the last number redial or voice command. When there's an incoming call during music playback, the music will pause and you will hear a ringing tone. You can then hit the Call button to answer the call. After you hang up, the music will resume from the paused point. Other features include call-waiting support, the ability to reject calls, plus the ability to transfer calls from the headset to the phone, and vice versa. Sound quality was quite good, and comparable to most MP3 players on the market. The bass was a little weak, but the overall quality was decent. Call quality was mixed. While we heard our callers just fine, we did have to bring the pendant close to our mouths for callers to hear us. They reported a little bit of static and echo from us as well. This seemed to vary from caller to caller, however, so we urge you to give it a trial run before you settle for it. The Jabra BT3030 also comes with an optional clothing clip accessory, plus an AC adapter. It has a rated battery life of 8 hours talk time, 7 hours music streaming, and 9.58 days standby time.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- From Fitzrovia to Covent Garden, London is embracing its charming -- and sometimes cheeky -- past. Every era, from the roaring '20s to the swinging '60s, is represented, with new takes on old-fashioned locales: chip and sweets shops, hidden Prohibition-style hangouts, even ballrooms. The shelves at Hope and Greenwood, in Covent Garden, are filled with glass jars brimming with British sweets. But rather than flaunt themselves as fusty Churchillian relics, these new spots are drawing stylish Bright Young Things who can't get enough of the city's collective nostalgia trip. They're celebrating inspired design, tastes and bygone lifestyles with zeal. At the forefront of London's retro renaissance: sugar. Behind a shiny strawberry-red faÃ§ade in Covent Garden, British confectionary is experiencing a resurgence at Hope and Greenwood, a sweet 1950s-style candy store named after its sugar-loving owners. Glass jars and cut-crystal candy dishes that grandma would love brim with classic and all-but-disappeared ""pick and mix"" English candies -- Minty Humbugs, Raspberry Ruffles and Traffic Light Lollies. It's the kind of place that will even inspire adults on a strict diet to indulge in sweets (and sweet thoughts) of yesteryear. Travel + Leisure: See London's best retro spots . Over in the trendy, up-and-coming neighborhood of Marble Arch, Cocomaya is attracting followers with its jewel-like handcrafted chocolates tantalizingly displayed under glass domes on marble counter tops and antique mirrors. And places such as East End's Treacle are delighting locals and visitors alike with a return to the no-nonsense proper British teahouse, serving up comforting classics like Jammy Dodgers and buttercream cupcakes. Bourne & Hollingsworth (named after the department store that once existed on its site) is decidedly more adult; the quirky basement bar in Fitzrovia is tricked out to feel like grandma's -- complete with signature floral wallpaper and consciously stodgy dÃ©cor. Still, zany accents, like a fireplace full of discarded Champagne bottles, reflect the underground boÃ®te's joie de vivre spirit of excess. On Prohibition themed nights, vintage gin cocktails arrive hidden in teapots, as Billie Holliday sets the mood. Geales, in Notting Hill, is the ideal spot to start -- or end -- an evening on the town, London-style. Now a shadow of its former 1939 no-frills self, the newly renovated fish and chips shop is giving a lighter gourmet twist to an old London standby; golden, delicately fried cod and haddock is the restaurant's main event, supported by more elegant briny treats like raw oysters and classic shrimp cocktail.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A Florida man told police he drove across the country to meet ""Dancing with the Stars"" contestant Shawn Johnson because she was communicating with him through the television, according to a restraining order application filed this week. ""Dancing With the Stars"" contestant Shawn Johnson  is a gymnast who won a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics. Robert Michael O'Ryan entered a not guilty plea Thursday to a felony count of stalking and two misdemeanor counts of carrying a loaded firearm in a vehicle stemming from his arrest outside the ""Dancing with the Stars"" studio earlier this week. O'Ryan, 34, was ordered held on $220,000 bail, the Los Angeles District Attorney's office said. O'Ryan is accused of driving from Florida to Los Angeles to meet Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson, 17, who is appearing on the show, prosecutors said. He was arrested Tuesday after he allegedly tried to jump a security fence at CBS Studios in the Wilshire district of Los Angeles, where the ABC television show is filmed, authorities said. Police found a loaded handgun and shotgun in his car. O'Ryan was also ordered to have no contact with Johnson or her family and to stay 500 feet away from the gymnast and the CBS studio. A preliminary hearing was set for April 27. O'Ryan told police at the time of his arrest that ""he packed all his belongings, permanently left Florida to drive across the country because he believes [Johnson] is speaking to him personally through the television and via ESP and that he will be with her no matter what,"" according to an application for a restraining order against him filed by Johnson's mother, Teri. Also found in O'Ryan's car were love letters, clippings and other information on Johnson, the court documents said, along with items such as duct tape and ""zip ties."" The application said Johnson fears for her life. ""She is extremely upset by this incident and her entire family and those around her are all extremely concerned and fearful that the respondent might try to kidnap her or harm her in an effort to make good on his statements."" O'Ryan was attempting to contact Johnson at the studio, and was detained by security while police were summoned because no one knew who he was, Teri Johnson said in an affidavit accompanying the application. ""It was extremely disturbing to us that this person had so much information on my daughter's life,"" the court documents said. ""This incident has caused us severe emotional distress. We have been on the move ever since and have not been able to rest at all for fear that this disturbed person will attempt to make good on his statements and attempt to harm my daughter and possibly us as well."" A temporary restraining order was put in place, with a hearing set next month on the matter. If convicted, O'Ryan could be sentenced to up to four years in prison, prosecutors said. It was not known whether he had retained an attorney. ""The appropriate authorities are handling the matter,"" a Dancing With the Stars"" spokeswoman said. ""The matter has been turned over to the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. It is currently an ongoing investigation and we are confident that it will be handled appropriately by all involved,"" said Johnson's publicist, Susan Madore. Johnson won a gold medal on the balance beam and three silver medals in the women's team, all-around and floor competitions at the 2008 Olympic games in Beijing, China.

"(Southern Living) -- Mount Vernon is undergoing a renaissance. Today the site's annual attendance matches its highest since 1976. Why? Visitors used to spend only an hour or so at his house, then leave still thinking of George Washington as that grim, old man on the dollar bill. Now, visitors meet him face-to-face in three life-sized statues, and they can't get enough of America's first action hero. At the museum at Mount Vernon, the 45-year-old future president is depicted riding in Valley Forge. ""He's tall! He's strong! He's handsome!"" they may exclaim when seeing him for the first time. Today's first President is a well-rounded figure at the expanded visitors center, museum, and education facility at Mount Vernon Estate & Gardens in Virginia. A new face for George . Washington now startles visitors. As they walk through the Donald W. Reynolds Museum and Education Center, one of three life-size models depicts him at age 19, standing 6'2"", with his auburn hair pulled back in a queue.

"LAGOS, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigeria's military has rescued 18 hostages held by militants in its oil-rich Niger Delta region, a military spokesman said Monday. File image shows Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta fighters. The first group -- nine Filipinos and five Nigerians -- were released on Saturday, while four Ukrainians were released on Sunday, according to Col. Rabe Abubakar, spokesman for the Nigerian military's joint task force. Nigeria's military began clearing the western Niger Delta region last week, its first major operation against the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, an armed militant group that demands a better distribution of the country's oil wealth. Both the Nigerian military and the militants have said the ongoing fighting has resulted in a high number of casualties. As many as 1,000 have been killed, according to Victor Burubo, a spokesman for the Ijaw National Council which represents the region's largest ethnic group. However, aid groups and journalists have been unable to verify that figure. ""We want the international community to know that we are getting rid of criminals and terrorists in our communities so foreigners who come here to work and invest are safe,"" Abubakar said. Four villages near the militants' camps have been destroyed in the fighting, Burubo said. However, the military spokesman stressed that Nigerian forces are not targeting civilians, blaming such attacks on the militants. ""We are not attacking villages -- just (militant) camps,"" Abubakar said. On Friday, MEND declared ""an all-out war"" on the government after what it said was a deadly bombing raid on civilians. It is not the first declaration of war by MEND, which demands that more of Nigeria's oil wealth be reinvested in the region instead of enriching those the militants consider corrupt politicians. The militant group declared war against the government in September for what it said were unprovoked attacks. At that time, MEND destroyed several oil facilities, forcing Nigeria to cut its oil exports by as many as 1 million barrels of oil per day, or 40 percent. The recent violence -- which has included attacks on pipelines and hostage-taking -- has limited shipment of crude oil supplies out of Nigeria, Africa's largest producer. MEND has threatened to blockade oil vessels, and has warned oil companies in the region to leave and ""cease oil production until further notice."" The militant group said Friday the country's armed forces conducted ""indiscriminate aerial bombardment on the defenseless civilians in the Gbaramatu area of Delta state."" It said the strikes were punishment ""for the humiliating defeat"" of the army in raids on two militant camps Wednesday. ""Casualties are mostly women, children and the elderly who could not get away quickly into the bush or high sea,"" the militant group said. The military says it is responding to the militants' attacks on troops, hijackings of vessels, and threats to innocents, such as the ""expatriates who were given ultimatum to leave the region by the militants."" It characterized the various claims by the militants as ""propaganda."" ""We are not at war with any individuals or groups in the region,"" Abubakar said. ""Ours is to protect lives and property and also to rid the region of criminals who hide under the guise of struggle agenda to perpetrate crime.""

"ASUNCION, Paraguay (CNN)  -- Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo acknowledged Monday that he is the father of a 2-year-old child who was conceived when he was a Roman Catholic bishop. Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo speaks at a news conference in Asuncion on Monday. ""It's true that there was a relationship with Viviana Carrillo,"" Lugo told reporters, citing the mother. ""I assume all the responsibilities that could derive from such an act, recognizing the paternity of the child."" He said he was making the acknowledgment ""with the most absolute honesty, transparency and feeling of obligation."" The announcement came in the week after Carrillo had filed suit in a city in southern Paraguay seeking a paternity test. Judge Evelyn Peralta, who is overseeing the case, said she was treating it routinely. ""It is a case like any other, which involves the president and nothing more,"" she said. ""It will be processed as it should be."" Some Cabinet members interpreted Lugo's acknowledgment of paternity as an indication of the change he has promised to bring about to achieve greater transparency in the public sector. ""This is the Paraguay that we want,"" said Liz Torres, minister of children's issues. ""This is the Paraguay of serious change, in which there is no double standard or secrets. It seems to be an example, a very big lesson."" But some opposition party members said it appeared that Lugo had practically been forced to acknowledge what happened; that he had not done so willingly. Sen. Julio Cesar Velasquez of the opposition Colorado Party called on the Vatican to excommunicate Lugo. Lugo was laicized last year, around the time he assumed the presidency.

"(CNN) -- Some of the worst fighting to hit Somalia's capital city in recent months uprooted nearly 34,000 people in less than a week, according to a United Nations report released Monday. A young girl feeds her baby brother at a refugee camp  on the outskirts of Mogadishu, Somalia. Relief workers said the fighting between the Somali government and rebels over Islamic law has left Somali civilians with the choice of facing bloody battles or fleeing to squalid camps. The displaced people have found shelter in already overcrowded camps in and around Mogadishu, while others have fled into neighboring Kenya, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). OCHA said that an estimated 34,000 people were displaced by the fighting between insurgents and Somalia's government from May 8-14. Although Somalia's border with Kenya is officially closed, an estimated 5,000 displaced Somalis arrive every month in the U.N. refugee camps in the Kenyan border town of Dadaab, according to Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF. ""The situation is simply scandalous,"" said Joke Van Peteghem, who heads the MSF mission in Kenya. ""These refugees have risked everything to escape the fighting in Somalia. Now some are telling us they would rather take their chances in Mogadishu than die slowly here."" One nurse called the refugee camps in Kenya ""public health time bombs."" ""The refugees, many of whom are already suffering from serious war-related injuries or illnesses, are packed together without the bare minimum to survive,"" said Donna Canali, who worked for MSF at Dagahaley Camp. ""After all these people have endured, how can their most basic needs continue to be so woefully neglected?"" Nearly a quarter of the more than 90,000 refugees at Dagahaley suffer from acute malnutrition, according to MSF. MSF is calling on the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Kenya's government, and international donors to help alleviate the ""dire living conditions"" at the camps in Kenya which house more than 270,000 Somali refugees. More than 100 people have died in the latest fighting in Somalia, and hundreds more have been wounded in the bloody insurgency, government officials said last week. The violence stems from an interpretation of sharia, or Islamic law. Somalia's new president, Sheikh Sharif Ahmed, recently approved implementing sharia, but the al-Shabab rebel group wants the country to institute a stricter form. On Sunday, al-Shabab seized control of Jowhar, the president's hometown about 55 miles (88 km) north of Mogadishu, according to a local journalist. The violence is exacerbating the already precarious humanitarian situation in Somalia, where an estimated 40 percent of the country's population -- more than 3 million people -- need humanitarian support, according to the U.N. The fighting erupted days after a mortar attack on Somalia's parliament that killed six people and wounded more than a dozen others on April 25. The fatalities included a soldier and three children who were killed when the rounds struck a nearby school, a police spokesman said. Members of parliament were meeting when the attack occurred, but none of them was injured, an official said.","Fighting in Somalia uproots 34,000 civilians in a week, report says .

The congress also approved a new census, seven parliamentary seats to be reserved for representatives of indigenous villages, and a referendum on autonomy for five resource-rich eastern regions and the eastern province of Gran Chaco. It also set April 4, 2010, for regional and municipal elections. For the opposition, the requirement of a new electoral census and tighter rules regarding who gets to vote was an important victory. ""It will give to all of us the assurance that our vote counts, that our vote will not be manipulated and that, therefore, we will define our future and the future of Bolivia,"" said Oscar Ortiz, a senator with the opposition Democratic Power party. But Jose Antonio Quiroga, a political analyst, predicted that the national electoral court will face big difficulties in deciding how the new census will affect who gets to vote -- both inside and outside the country. ""That's an enormous job that must be decided not only by the electoral court, but the Office of Civil Registry, the National Police or perhaps the office of personal identification, which is where I believe the biggest problems will emerge,"" he said. The approval of the electoral law marked the end not only to days of political tension but to the hunger strike by Morales, who reportedly carried out an 18-day hunger strike in 2002 -- when he was expelled from Congress.","December 6 set as date for country's general elections .

"(CNN) -- Two high-profile political officials linked to Guinea-Bissau's recently assassinated president were killed Friday, according to a statement from the West African country's interim army chief. The killings raised fears that a military coup may be under way. Guinea-Bissau Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr, left, and interim President Raimundo Pereira are currently out of the country. The military confirmed the killings of former Defense Minister Helder Proenca and presidential candidate Baciro Dabo, saying the men were killed because they were plotting a coup against the current government. The military said several members of the ruling party have been arrested on allegations of taking part in the plot, which included a plan to assassinate the current prime minister and the interim president, according to the statement from interim army chief Zamora Induta. However, the move by the military has raised fears that the military itself is plotting to take over the government, particularly since the arrests and killings took place while Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr., interim President Raimundo Pereira, and defense minister Artur Da Silva are out of the country. President Joao Bernardo Vieira, 69, was assassinated on March 2 during an attack on the presidential palace. The attack happened a day after Gen. Tagme Na Waie, chief of Guinea-Bissau's military, was killed in a bomb explosion in his office. The army and Guinea-Bissau's president clashed in the months prior to Vieira's assassination.

"(InStyle.com) -- From barefoot tomboy to fashion supernova, fearless pop renegade Rihanna lives to bust all the rules. ""I love the heavy chain over this pretty dress -- it's exactly the way I would do it,"" says Rihanna. What are some rules you'd like to crush? The idea of not wearing brown and black together seems so dated. The other day I wore a black T-shirt, black Nobody jeans, a brown leopard-print belt by Dolce & Gabbana, and brown Giuseppe Zanotti shoes, and it looked awesome. Also the rule about not matching your makeup to your outfit. I do that onstage, matching red lipstick to a bright red jacket or neon-pink eye shadow to a pink jumpsuit. And I also love to mix prints. We've had the Meg, the Jennifer, and now people ask for the Rihanna at salons. Will you be switching it up again? The first time I heard people were asking for the Rihanna, it was really flattering and maybe a little strange. It caught me by surprise, but now I feel it's a very cool thing. I don't feel the pressure to change it up again at all. I like it, as they like it. Can you talk about your style obsessions and how your look has evolved over the years? It has evolved without my even noticing it. Lately I'm obsessed with Thierry Mugler... Grace Jones inspires me. She is the most iconic woman ever, in my eyes. She has extraordinary style and she's fearless. I love designer Martin Margiela; Kanye West told me about him. I also like Dsquared, ChloÃ©, Zac Posen... But you weren't always a fashion maven? Growing up in Barbados, you were a tomboy. I wore my brother's clothes, dresses with sneakers, or no shoes at all. I would always get into trouble with my mom. She would say things to scare me like, ""You're going to get cut!"" But I couldn't help it. I would climb trees, steal mangoes, catch birds--silly things that were fun to us at the time. My cousin and I were the only girls in the group. We would have to stand up for ourselves because the guys didn't want us around. You stood out in Barbados because of your light complexion. Do you remember having trouble fitting in at school? Definitely. It made me angry... For the first six years of school, I would go home traumatized. The harassment continued to my very last day of elementary school. High school was better. I read that your mom owns a boutique and your dad works at a garment factory -- it seems you have the Rihanna fashion line already partly sewn up. [Giggles] Well I am working on that right now. It takes a lot of effort, and I want to be involved with every step of the process. What do you do for kicks in L.A.? I don't go out much. I'm moving into a new four-bedroom home in Los Feliz that I'm excited about. Parts of it will be inspired by India. I love things like canopy beds, printed fabrics and Spanish touches. Then I can stay at home and cook West Indian dishes like callaloo [stewed greens]. But I do want a sports car--as soon as I get my license. Who knew you were so domestic. Wait a minute. You're such a rebel. In the video for ""Take a Bow,"" you drive a car. I have my Barbadian license, just not my American one. How will you celebrate your 21st birthday? Don't scare me! I have till February. I feel like I have so much more to accomplish before I'm 21. No party plans yet. Many showbiz types say, ""Don't ever read your own press,"" but you do, even the online stuff. What's the kookiest thing you've read about yourself? The Grammy thing -- that I brought Jay-Z on stage and BeyoncÃ© was upset, which is so ridiculous. Or the idea that I've had breast implants -- I don't even have much cleavage. It was just the dress! So yes, I read about myself and about everybody else in the gossip pages. It's comedy to me; I laugh about it. The tattoo behind your ear is a Pisces symbol -- two fish swimming head to tail in a circle--which represents life after death. If possible, what would you be reincarnated as? If I had to come back in another form, it would be as my dog, DJ. He gets the best treatment, all the attention in the world, and he's so adorable. Plus, he goes everywhere I can take him. Get a FREE TRIAL issue of InStyle - CLICK HERE! Copyright Â© 2009 Time Inc.

"(InStyle.com) -- Actress Cameron Diaz talks candidly about love, guys, friends, family and charting her own course. Sunny days and a smiling Diaz, here shot near the Malibu shore. ""I'm mostly a jeans girl,"" she says . Casual style . Diaz doesn't strive to be taken seriously. Her style is relaxed, never more evident than with her wardrobe. ""I don't like overdone or being too put-together,"" she explains. ""I like casual chic. Eclectic style. I want to feel like I can go anywhere, whatever I'm wearing."" Today is no exception. She's half glam, half laid-back. Her casualness comes courtesy of frayed jeans that show off her lightly tanned legs. ""I found these jeans today and was, like, 'Well hello, Abercrombie jeans!' They're really old, and I love them. I don't care that they've got holes in them.""  Watch thoughts on friends and sexy poll results Â» . She has paired them with a simple black sweater and added a dash of glitz with a crystal-and-gold cocktail ring from Barneys. ""I'm Cuban, so I'm drawn to things that sparkle. I like to use accessories to give things a bit of my own flavor."" Men . So, is Diaz dating? ""I'm a woman,"" she says, like, Duh! ""Of course I'm dating. And is that so surprising? Oh my god, she's dating!"" So when you make a reported $15 million per movie, how do you make the call that someone is boyfriend material? ""I trust my judgment,"" she says. And though she won't divulge whom she's spending time with, she's clear on what she's looking for. ""My list is all about balance. You can have smart but not funny. You can have funny but not very smart. You can have intellectual but not social. But ... I want it all!"" Not that her life has gone exactly as planned. ""I thought I'd be married and have kids by the time I was 22. But when I got to 22, I realized that wasn't what I wanted, which was a huge lesson for me,"" she says. ""Am I going to have a baby? Who knows? I don't. I'm not going to live my life looking just for that. How can I know what my future holds?"" She pauses, then offers an answer: ""How about this -- I am happy right now. Does that count for anything?"" Family . Diaz lives 45 minutes from her family and has always spent a great deal of time with them. She raves about her parents, crediting them with fostering her sense of humor. ""They just celebrated their 39th wedding anniversary. They're just really good, cool people."" This is one woman with a well populated inner circle. Says Diaz: ""I know I'll never be in a situation where I can't get to somebody for support."" That support will never be more important. Sadly, after this interview was conducted, her father, Emilio Diaz, passed away unexpectedly. In the following days, the actress released a statement on behalf of her sister and mother: ""My dad was so loved by so many people, and his humor and spirit will always live in our hearts."" Two of her father's favorite groups were the ocean conservation organizations Reef Check and Surfrider. To honor her father, she has asked that donations be made to those organizations in his name. In her interview, Diaz remembered how her dad taught a then scrawny young girl how to fight bullies in school. ""He said he'd always back me up if I got in trouble. He is a good man, stand up and loyal."" Looks like that runs in the family.","Actress Cameron Diaz likes ""casual chic, eclectic style""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Britain's House of Lords voted Wednesday to suspend two of its members over corruption claims -- the first time a lord has been barred from the chamber since 1642, a spokesman for the chamber said. Britain's House of Lords voted to suspend two of its members. It's first time a lord has been barred since 1642. Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Lord Truscott allegedly agreed to use their influence to get a loophole into a proposed tax law in exchange for cash, but the person offering the bribe turned out to be an undercover reporter. The Sunday Times newspaper ran the sting operation, in which journalists approached members of the House of Lords, claiming to be acting on behalf of a foreign business looking to open a chain of stores in the United Kingdom. ""Secret recordings showed Lord Truscott, a former energy minister, discussing a fee of up to $113,000 to work 'behind the scenes' on behalf of the lobbyists, while Lord Taylor offered to conduct a campaign to persuade ministers and officials for a one-year retainer of $189,000,"" the newspaper said. ""Neither peer took any money or offered to [introduce] an amendment themselves."" Truscott and Taylor were among four lords investigated by the House of Lords Sub-Committee on Interests. The ethics panel found last week that Truscott ""was advertising his power and willingness to influence parliament in order for substantial financial inducement."" He called the verdict ""outrageous and slanderous,"" according to the official report by the panel, which rejected his appeal against the decision. Taylor said he knew the journalists were running a sting operation and that he made ""increasingly extravagant and outlandish claims in an effort to 'flush out' the truth,"" according to the official Lords report on the incident. The ethics committee considered his defense ""full of internal contractions"" and found him in breach of the Lords Code of Conduct. Two other lawmakers, Lord Moonie and Lord Snape, were found not to have breached the code. The suspension of Truscott and Taylor is officially for breaching the Code of Conduct, which states that members are required to ""always act on their personal honor."" They will not face criminal charges, London's Metropolitan Police said. The suspension will last until the next session of parliament begins in November. Only the Queen can permanently strip a lord of his title. Both Taylor and Truscott are associated with the governing Labor Party. Thomas Taylor joined the House of Lords, the upper house of parliament, in 1978. Peter Truscott got his baronage in 2004. Their historic suspension comes a day after the speaker of the House of Commons, the lower house of parliament, was forced to resign -- the first such resignation in more than 300 years. CNN's Nicola Goulding contributed to this report.","Lord Taylor of Blackburn and Lord Truscott barred for corruption charges .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- British new wave ska legends The Specials rounded off the Brixton leg of their 30th anniversary tour with an electric performance that threatened to bring the crumbling south London venue crashing to the ground. The frenzied crowd at London's Brixton Academy . The six-piece 2-tone outfit originally from the English Midlands played a total of five dates at what is now the O2 Academy, such was the phenomenal demand for tickets. It's no surprise really. From the rarefied perspective of the VIP bar, the sea of bobbing heads and mobile phone displays (which seem to have replaced cigarette lighters) created a fantastic spectacle. But down among the rude boys and rude girls the carnival atmosphere seemed to ratchet up a notch with each song. Balding, sweaty 40-something men in Fred Perry polo shirts were transported back to the late 1970s as they bounced around unselfconsciously, while post-Margaret Thatcher indie kids sloshed their pints in the air and enjoyed this unique experience for the first time. No one was standing with their arms folded here. Despite songwriter Jerry Dammers' continued absence and Lynval Golding's lost voice, the band was as tight as it ever was, both musically and personally. As soon as the curtain rose the band wasted little time plugging into the hysteria that greeted them. If ""Do The Dog"" appeared to hit the spot, then tracks such as ""Too Much Too Young,"" and ""Gangsters"" literally had the earth moving in this imposing old theatre. Terry Hall, showing no sign of fatigue after a recent throat infection and the band's homecoming gig in Coventry the previous night, was in a chirpy mood. The Manchester United fan enjoyed reminding the London audience about his team's league success that afternoon. Meanwhile, the irrepressible Neville Staple seemed to galvanize the rest of the band with his seemingly limitless energy -- he must have spent the entire gig running on the spot. The dapper singer has aged well and was clearly reveling in the band's return to the spotlight. Despite only reforming recently, The Specials have rediscovered their mojo. They possess the kind of stage presence reserved for the truly great acts, while their lyrics still resonate today. ""Ghost Town"" encapsulated the gritty reality of Britain's urban landscape in 1981, and few in the audience would have argued that it remains a relevant portrait in today's troubled economic times.","The Specials reformed for a 30th anniversary tour .

"(CNN) -- Chris Helmbrecht is a 37-year-old German who lived in New York and Spain before moving to Moscow nearly six years ago. He runs an advertising agency and also writes Moscow Blog, a lifestyle blog about the city. Chris Helmbrecht: ""Not many places have as much energy as Moscow."" CNN: You've traveled around a lot -- what makes Moscow unique? Chris Helmbrecht: Not many places have so much energy and so many things going on. It can be very nerve wracking and exhausting, but on the other hand it's very exciting. New York is one of those places, Tokyo too, but there are only a handful of cities in the world that have that kind of energy. CNN: You used to be a DJ -- what's your opinion of Moscow's nightlife? CH: For some people the nightlife is the best in the world, but for me it's very commercial and posh. You can sum it up in one sentence, which is a general thing about Moscow: people here live ""Sex and the City."" They just want to go out and spend money and pretend they're rich and successful and live this dream. I recently had a conversation with the club editor of Timeout Moscow and I asked her if she thought the clubs were suffering right now with the economy. She said that in the modern ""New Russian"" culture people would rather sell their Mercedes than not go out and spend anywhere between $4,000 and $6,000 on a table in a club and admit that they're not rich anymore. Moscow is dominated by posh parties, but it's no different at a subculture place like a techno club -- you're always judged by the labels you wear, the car you drive and the music you identify yourself with. CNN: Where do you like to go in the city? CH: Novodevichy Monastery is a really beautiful old monastery. Stalin demolished a lot of churches and monasteries but this one was spared. There's a pond below it that you can walk around, and all the Russian Orthodox popes are buried in he cemetery. It's a very nice place. Another place is would be Vorobyovy Gory (Sparrow Hills), where you can look out over Moscow. It's pretty industrial looking but it has good views. I also enjoy the center of Moscow. I like hanging out on the roof bar of a hotel, having a drink, looking out over Red Square. It makes you feel like you're away from the noise of the city. What makes Moscow special to you? Let us know. CNN: What do Muscovites do at the weekend? CH: It depends on the time of year, but in the summer they take every opportunity to get out of the city. Everyone has a little weekend house called a ""dacha"" and every Friday night after work people leave the city. From 4pm in the afternoon to 10pm at night you have long traffic jams on all the roads out of the city. People will spend three or four hours in traffic jams just to travel 60km -- and on the way back on Sunday and Monday mornings it's the same. Some ""dachas"" are really basic wooden houses and some are palaces but every family has one, or even two or three. People go out to the woods or lakes and they have barbeques, they drink and they do some gardening. They value this ""dacha"" life so much that they're willing to spend 6 hours in traffic to spend 1 Â½ days in the woods. CNN: So is Moscow is deserted in the summertime? CH: Moscow is very quiet in the summertime -- it's my favorite time. You can already notice that there are less people in the clubs and less people in the streets at the weekend. Towards the end of June, Moscow is really empty. You really notice it from the middle of July until September, when it's school vacations. CNN: Has Moscow change a lot since you moved there? CH: Yes -- you can see it renewing itself. I know how it went with Berlin -- in 10 years you won't recognize Moscow anymore. Streets have changed so much in the last five years, in a good way and a bad way. A lot of cool-looking brick buildings were torn down to create business centers, but on the other hand you have great new modern buildings and hotels -- the Ritz Carlton for example. There are lots of new museums popping up, art centers, alternative art, new shops and cafes. It's so different to when I came here five years ago and to be honest, I never would have expected it. CNN: What do you miss about Moscow when you're away? CH: I miss the excitement. There's something going on all the time. There's so much choice in terms of theater, classical ballet, the nightlife, the galleries. You have that in Berlin but it's harder to find and not as exciting, and New York has lost a lot of its flavor, glamour and energy at the moment. CNN: If Moscow were a person, what would he or she be like? CH: An ugly princess who wears a lot of makeup and tries to be pretty! She would probably seem pretty rude, but inside she's a good person.","Chris Helmbrecht is a 37-year-old German who now lives in Moscow .

"(InStyle.com) -- Style-maker, TV host and opinionated fashionista Carson Kressley explains how to give yourself a complete makeover--inside and out. Style-maker Carson Kressley spills the naked truth on giving yourself a mental makeover. Minimize the negative . As Coco Chanel said, ""Fashion is architecture: It's a matter of proportions."" In other words: No matter which part of your body you dislike, there's a clever way to divert the eye elsewhere. Try different styles and employ horizontal (widening), vertical (elongating) and diagonal (slimming) lines as necessary. Venture out of your comfort zone . ""Many women get used to dressing their body a certain way because they think it's the only thing that works for them,"" says Kressley. Find a boutique or department store with well-trained salespeople and try on three styles you've never worn. It might be a fabric such as jersey that you've always deemed too clingy or an Empire-waist camisole that you're convinced looks too young. Not every experiment will be a success, but even one new style or color will prove that there are more ways than you thought to look your best. Don't be ruled by your insecurities . If you've been avoiding the beach or missing out on parties because you're afraid of being the largest person there, grab a friend and go to the very place that incites terror--just be sure you're wearing an amazing outfit. Avoid a blackout . ""Have you ever seen a happy goth?"" muses Kressley. ""I think everyone needs color to feel good."" Too many women rely on head-to-toe black as a form of camouflage. But any hue can be slimming if worn monochromatically--so instead of black, reach for plum, gray or chocolate brown. Clean out your closet . Whether you're holding on to clothes that are too small because you hope you'll fit into them someday, or clothes that are too big for fear you'll grow back into them, you're keeping past wounds open. ""Old clothes stop you from living in the present,"" says Kressley. ""They reinforce what you used to look like."" Get rid of anything you haven't worn in two years and replace it with something new that makes you feel pretty. And while you're out shopping, have a house-cleaner swing by for good measure. Write yourself a love note . Some women are so obsessed with their hips that they fail to notice their flat tummy. Remind yourself of your virtues by writing a note that says something like ""Hey, you have a great chest!"" Tack it to the bathroom mirror so you'll see it in the morning and before bedtime. ""We're so trained to look for the negative that we need a physical reminder of the positive,"" explains Kressley. Have a princess moment . Treating yourself to a massage, a body exfoliation, a professional blow-out, a brow shaping or a mani-pedi can elevate your mood by affirming to yourself that you're worth the splurge. Get naked . Some women on Kressley's show are so self-conscious about their bodies that they're reluctant to be naked around their husbands. That discomfort affects how they feel when dressed too. Before you can move as if you own the room, you'll have to be at ease inside your skin, and spending time in the buff can help. One idea: Take a bath with the (gasp!) lights on--no candles. ""Feeling comfortable with your body alone is the first step to feeling comfortable with your body around others,"" says Kressley. If all else fails, fake it . One of Kressley's favorite mantras is ""looking cute is feeling cute."" So if you're having a low day, force yourself to go through the motions. Put on your makeup, do your hair, wear a great outfit. Sometimes faking it can give you enough of a boost to lift you out of the doldrums. ""Feeling pretty,"" Kressley says, ""changes your whole outlook because you feel good about yourself.""

"JERUSALEM (CNN) -- A U.N. team entered Gaza on Monday to investigate possible human rights abuses by Israel and Hamas during a three-week conflict that ended January 18. Palestinians run from an Israeli airstrike on a U.N. school in northern Gaza on January 17. Richard Goldstone, a former Rwanda and Yugoslavia war crimes prosecutor, is leading the Human Rights Council investigation of the conflict that claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. Goldstone and three other investigators entered Gaza via Egypt for a five-day visit. Upon crossing into the Palestinian territory, Goldstone told reporters, ""We've come here to see. We've come here to learn. We've come here to talk to people in all walks of life, ordinary people, governmental people, administrative people, obviously nongovernmental organizations that are so important in this sort of situation."" The Geneva, Switzerland-based Human Rights Council established the fact-finding mission April 3 ""to investigate all violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law that might have been committed at any time in the context of the military operations that were conducted in Gaza during the period from 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009, whether before, during or after."" Israel launched its offensive in Gaza with the stated intent of stopping a barrage of rockets -- primarily short-range homemade Qassam rockets -- fired from the territory into southern Israel by Hamas fighters. The Israeli government is not assisting the investigators, who are not scheduled to visit Israel as part of the inquiry. Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry, said that ""there is not a chance we will cooperate with this mission"" under the terms of the Human Rights Council mandate. ""The resolution was adopted by a vote of non-Democratic countries, and the democratic countries either abstained or rejected the resolution,"" Palmor said. Israel has been long been a critic of the Human Rights Council, arguing that it is one-sided in its approach to the Jewish state. The Israeli military conducted an investigation of its actions in the Gaza conflict and concluded in a report released in April that it ""operated in accordance with international law."" An Israeli human rights group called that conclusion problematic since an impartial external body did not lead the investigation. The Palestinian Center for Human Rights has said that 1,417 Palestinians were killed in the fighting, of which 236 were active combatants. The Israeli military put the death toll at 1,166 and has maintained that more than half were ""Hamas terror operatives"" The Hamas movement welcomed the arrival of the investigators. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, said, ""We are ready to help these committees and encourage them to unveil the truth and bring out all the hidden details of what took place during the war, hoping to show the entire world the truth."" Barhoum went on to say that Israel's lack of cooperation was evidence that it was trying to cover up crimes committed in Gaza. The U.S. State Department has labeled Hamas, a Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist organization, a terrorist group. Its military wing, Izzedine al Qassam, has admitted responsibility for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians as well as attacks against the Israeli military.","Human Rights Council enters Gaza to investigate possible abuses by Israel, Hamas .

"(InStyle.com) -- The holiday season is also the engagement season! A gorgeous cushion-cut stunner by Daniel K. Yes, you read that right. It's been said that nearly 40 percent of all marriage proposals occur between Thanksgiving and Valentine's Day. If you're one of the lucky ladies hoping for a ring this season (or one of the nervous gentlemen contemplating popping the question), use this guide to popular diamond shapes and cuts -- and the stars who sport them -- to get acquainted with the dazzling world of engagement rings. Emerald . No shape more aptly fits the diamond nickname ""ice"" than the emerald, a rectangular cut with lean facets extending down the sides. This elegant art deco shape received its confusing name during the 1920s, when it was typically used for emeralds. Characterized by a flat top and step-shaped side facets, an emerald cut cries out for a clean setting. Star Power: Eva Longoria, Ellen Pompeo, Melania Knauss . Asscher . The Asschers of Amsterdam, gem cutters for the British royal family, designed this striking, dramatic shape in 1902. A square with diagonally cropped corners and stepped sides, it features a high crown and sheds a gentle light. Star Power: Tameka Foster, Ashlee Simpson, Christine Costner . Cushion . A square with curved sides and rounded corners, this stone shines softly instead of sparkling. Cushion-cut center stones surrounded by tiny diamonds are especially in vogue. Star Power: Jeri Ryan, Courtney Ford, Guiliana DePandi . Princess . Think of this flirty, flashy option as the ""Yeah, baby!"" stone, and not only because it was dreamt up in London during the swinging sixties. The arrangement of the gem's many (49 to 144) facets produces a hall-of-mirrors effect. Star Power: Stephanie March, Kara Janx, Sarah Michelle Gellar . Oval . Ovals have been enjoying a high profile since Tom Cruise placed a gorgeous one on Katie Holmes's finger. The cool cousin of the round, the oval shares many of that stone's features, with plenty of sparkle and versatility when it comes to settings. The long shape is especially flattering. Star Power: Bridgette Wilson, Toni Braxton, Rebecca Romijn . Pear . Made to sit with the point facing up, this lusciously feminine (and unusual) cut frequently goes solo because few wedding bands fit easily beneath the large underside of this stone. Star Power: Katherine Heigl, Lela Rochon, Tiffany Fallon . Marquise . The name for this cut comes from 18th-century Versailles, where courtiers wore ship-shaped rings as a sign of their rank. Today the marquise can be worn lengthwise or sailing sideways across the finger. Star Power: Catherine Zeta Jones, Victoria Beckham, Portia de Rossi . Round . Created by Marcel Tolkowsky in 1919, the round diamond is the most popular shape for engagement rings. It's often called the round brilliant because it has triangular facets, arranged to direct light from the bottom of the stone up through the top for maximum sparkle. Star Power: Katherine McPhee, Roselyn Sanchez, Mary J. Blige . Radiant . This rectangular stone, introduced in the seventies, lives up to its name: By combining long, lean, step-cut and triangular facets, it refracts lots of light. So if you decide on this shape, keep the setting simple. Star Power: Heidi Klum, Leslie Grossman, Anna Chlumsky . Rose-Cut .

"(CNN) -- It's not as achingly hip as Barcelona and it's more manageable than Madrid: Spain's third city has plenty of flavor, an urban edge and uniquely Valencian oddities. From medieval cathedrals to Calatrava's futuristic City of Arts and Sciences, Valancia packs in plenty. Where else could you glimpse the Holy Grail in the morning, gorge on paella on a Mediterranean beach for lunch and then wander along a old river bed transformed into a park and visit architectural blockbusters that look like a Star Trek vision of a colonized planet? After an early morning shot of coffee and, depending on your sugar tolerance, churros, the Cathedral in the heart of the old city is the best place to start the day. Located on the Plaza de la Reina, the cathedral is an impressive mix of gothic, baroque and Romanesque architectural styles. As striking as the many parts of the cathedral are, the sight of the Holy Grail my leave you underwhelmed -- to the unenlightened it resembles something closer to a plastic mug circa. 1973. If you're in town on a Thursday, catch the enactment of a tradition almost as old as the grail. The Tribunal de las Aguas, or Water Court, is the meeting of the city's elders, who gather outside the cathedral's Plaza del Palau for around twenty minutes. It generally involves a number of old men sitting down not doing very much, while one pronounces what has been decided, and it's a bit of a tour-group hot spot. On the other side of the plaza is the octagonal Miguelte Bell Tower, where you can climb 207 steps for a panoramic view of the low-rise old city. Not far through the old city's happy tangle of narrow streets is the Lonja: a fifteenth-century trading house, studded with a fine collection of mugging gargoyles now preserved under UNESCO Heritage status. Bringing yourself out of the city's medieval landmarks, you can feast on modern culture at IVAM, the city's cheap and excellent modern art gallery. But for a vision of the future as designed by local superstar architect Santiago Calatrava, wander along the city's old river bed towards The City of Arts and Sciences. It's made up of four gleaming white architectural confections, including the Palau de Les Arts Reina Sofia concert hall, which is covered in cracked white tiles that glisten in the sunlight. A few minutes away is the final piece of the architectural dreamscape, the Oceanografico -- one of the world's biggest aquariums. With two shark tunnels, beluga whales, walruses and thousands of fish it should sate anyone looking for a glimpse of the life aquatic. The Mediterranean Sea itself is not far away, and public transport in Valencia is a convenient way to get around town when things get out of comfortable walking distance. To get to the beach from the center of town hop on a tram on line 5 from Colon towards Neptu. When there you'll find a beachside strip of hotels and paella restaurants offering versions of the city's most famous culinary dish. The area was scrubbed up when Valencia hosted the Americas Cup, sailing's blue riband event, in 2007. Beyond the rice and seafood delights and the anodyne redeveloped area by the docks, the beach bar of Hotel Neptuno offers some choice classy cocktails. To be extra chilled, snag one of the massage therapists walking along the promenade for a bargain 10 euro beach massage or reflexology session. Back in town, the covered market of the Mercado Central is a must, not just for foodies, but for people-watching. The beautiful modernista building was constructed in 1928 -- look out for the green parrot weathervane. Eating and drinking in the city is a rich experience. Tapas is ubiquitous, but make sure you try horchata -- a sweet local specialty made from a mix of water, sugar and ground tigernut. Among the city's numerous specialist bars serving the cooling drink, the Horchataria de Santa Catalina provides some fine mixes in a traditional tiled interior. For late night drinks the bars and cafes around Barrio del Carmen are popular with locals and visitors -- San Jaume, housed in an opulent old pharmacy, is a prime spot for people watching at any time of day or night and a little further away, CafÃ© Lisboa is buzzy and friendly on the Plaza Dr Collado. Summers in the city are blistering, with mid-autumn and spring the best seasons to visit. But it's every March that Valencians exhibit the Spanish love for a street party during the Las Fallas festival. Its origins are a bit murky, harking back to pagan rituals, but today it's a noise fest, with daily processions and ear-splitting fireworks set off through the city's streets, even during the daytime. The biggest daily barrages take place in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento -- the city's main square. Out of season some of the effigies and floats built during previous festivals can be seen year round at the Museum of Las Fallas on Plaza Monteolivete.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Any woman who's ever watched ""Sex and the City"" has at some point tried to guess which of the characters she's most like. The overly confident Samantha? The slightly prudish Charlotte? The pessimistic Miranda? The overanalytical Carrie? Candace Bushnell attends a fashion show during the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in September. But an honest viewer probably would have to admit that she's similar to all of the characters in some way. As a writer, that is Candace Bushnell's gift. In her books, including ""Sex and the City,"" ""4 Blondes"" and ""Lipstick Jungle,"" Bushnell has given the pop culture world feminine role models with which it can identify. And the best-selling author's newest book, ""One Fifth Avenue,"" provides a few more -- including attorney Annalisa Rice, gossip columnist Enid Merle and gold digger Lola Fabrikant. Although all of her characters are fictional, Bushnell said each one is based on a common type of person. ""I've always been interested in people. It's part of being a novelist, really, part of the job,"" she said. ""As a writer you can never know a real person as well as you know your characters.""  Watch Bushnell talk about her new book Â» . Bushnell said a minor character or two often will appear in several of her books. Other characters she develops in her head for years before releasing them on the literary scene. For instance, she kept one fictional character, Schiffer Diamond, under wraps for 20 years, never seeing a place where she fit in -- until ""One Fifth Avenue."" The story of a vicious scramble for a penthouse apartment once owned by a high-society queen shows the life of New York City women through the lens of where they live. One Fifth Avenue -- an actual building near Washington Square Park -- is an address that each character thinks will be her ticket to fortune. Bushnell contrasts old and new money -- and old and new media -- in the course of her tale. A New York lover herself, Bushnell looks like she belongs on a fashion walkway. Arriving at CNN in a blue dress, bright green jacket and what look like 6-inch heels, it's obvious the author isn't just a bystander of the fashion capital. But those expecting a who's who of the designer world should take another look at Bushnell's subject matter. ""My books are social satire. They have a sense of the absurd,"" Bushnell said. ""They have to say something about contemporary life."" ""One Fifth Avenue"" touches on art and antiquities theft, crosses back into the world of blogging and zips over to the stock market in less than 400 pages. Though the book is just out in stores, it was written months ago. So how did the author -- who's been celebrated in the past for her ahead-of-the-curve approach to trends -- know the economy would be such a central focus of her readers' current lives? ""I keep my eyes open,"" she said with a smile.","Candace Bushnell has a new book, ""One Fifth Avenue""

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- At the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, some of the best music happens miles from the Fairgrounds, hours after the crowds have gone and the last of the crawfish bread has been consumed. Shamarr Allen, Mark Mullins and Ben Ellman sport the Midnite Disturbers T-shirts as they perform. It happens with the arrival of Midnite. At 1:18 a.m., Bonerama -- a brass-funk rock band lead by three trombones -- has just finished a 90-minute set that started with a soulful, passionate original tune written by bandleader Mark Mullins, and concluded with a cover of Jimi Hendrix' ""Crosstown Traffic,"" complete with the trombones running through wah-wah pedals. Suddenly the crowd of about 75 clears out of the way as a dozen musicians parade in the room. Dressed in black shirts, they are the Midnite Disturbers, a Jazz Fest supergroup whose appearance is as infrequent as a lunar eclipse. Each member of the Midnite Disturbers fronts his own band, and the artists are rarely in the city at the same time. The band was started by New Orleans drummers and longtime friends Stanton Moore and Kevin O'Day. In the weeks following Katrina, O'Day had moved into Moore's house, where the two hit on an idea. ""We realized we had never had our own band together, and we decided to invite all of the best horn players we know to play with us,"" O'Day said. Each artist has a name, printed in red, on his shirt, following the command ""Listen to"": Smokey Johnson ... Brian O'Neill ... Henry ""Red"" Allen. They're the band's predecessors and mentors. Although probably little known outside the Crescent City, they're the musicians who shaped New Orleans music: masters of their craft. Modern-day masters in their own right, the Midnite Disturbers live up to their name, splitting the night with their loud, hard, funky jams. There are up-and-comers Troy Andrews and Shamarr Allen, and veterans such as Mullins from Bonerama, Stanton Moore and Ben Ellman from Galactic. Their black shirts are drenched with sweat by the time they finish playing. ""Its an honor to play with such veterans because it's confirmation that I'm doing my thing on a level to where people are noticing the hard work that I have been putting in,"" said trumpet player Shamarr Allen. ""Playing with this kind of band keeps you on your toes. It's more interesting and challenging to try to understand everyone's musical approach and find a spot for yours to fit. ""That's the beauty of it,"" he said. ""How to sound good, have fun, listen to each other, entertain a crowd, and stay on the same page at the same time. It lets me know, if I'm not there yet, I'm on my way to being one of the big boys."" The Midnite Disturbers will be at Jazz Fest -- of course -- holding down a 5:55 p.m. slot Saturday afternoon. And then, when it's over, they'll be gone -- ready to get together when the moon beckons.","Midnite Disturbers is an all-star band of New Orleans musicians .

"(CNN) -- One of the most cosmopolitan cities in Africa, Johannesburg is multicultural and multifaceted. Make the most of your time there with these tips. The Apartheid Museum is an often disturbing view of South Africa's troubled past. Apartheid Museum It's a disturbing experience, but a visit to Apartheid Museum is essential if you want to understand the city's troubled past. On arrival, visitors are randomly allocated a pass labeling them as white or non-white, referencing the apartheid pass laws that obliged black South Africans to carry identity passes at all times. Harrowing multimedia displays and news footage recreate the brutality of the apartheid era, while nooses hanging from the ceiling represent the political prisoners executed under the system. Less bleak are the tributes to those who fought against the injustice of that era, paving the way for equality and democracy in today's South Africa. The museum is open between 10 am and 5 pm (GMT +2) Tuesday to Sunday. Admission is R30 ($3.20). For more information visit http://www.apartheidmuseum.org/ . Meaty treat The Carnivore is one of the city's more unusual restaurants. A few miles outside Jo' burg proper, on the Muldersdrift Estate, The Carnivore is designed to satisfy your primal meat cravings. As well as the usual chicken, lamb and beef dishes, this eatery offers an intriguing selection of big game dishes, including crocodile, giraffe and ostrich. There are veggie options available for those who aren't tempted by the thought of slow-roasted impala, but if you choose the vegetable lasagna you may never find out if crocodile really does take like chicken. See Hugh Masekela's Johannesburg Â» . Day tripping Jo' burg is well positioned for some interesting day trips. Pretoria is just 50km away, but has a very different to feel to Johannesburg, offering more of an insight into Afrikaans history. The Voortrekker monument and museum, just outside the city, celebrate the pioneer spirit of the Boer and their ""Great Trek"" from the Cape to the country's interior. If African wildlife is more your scene, head to The Lion Park, a small nature reserve about 25km north of Johannesburg. It's not the full safari experience, but you will get to see lions, cheetahs, antelopes, zebra and impala, among other local fauna. What are your tips for Johannesburg? Let us know below. Get around Too big to explore on foot, Jo' burg is a driver's city. Public transport is generally poor and minibus taxis and the Metro train are crime hotspots. There are plenty of car-hire outlets in the city but if you'd prefer someone else to do the driving City Tours offer minibuses to destinations including Soweto and The Lion Park. The advantage of a tour is that your guides can offer a local's insight into the city's history and culture. Crime There's no doubt that progress has been made in reducing crime over the last couple of years, but it remains a problem in many parts of the city. ATMs are a magnet for criminals. Be sure to only use ATMs in well-lit areas and be wary of people offering to help you use them. If you're driving, keep the car doors locked at all times and don't open the windows too wide. Keep your wits about you when stopped at traffic lights and when you're getting into and out of the car, and keep your valuables out of sight. Put bluntly, it is not safe to walk around most of Johannesburg after dark.","A visit to the Apartheid Museum offers an insight into the city's troubled past .

"(CNN) -- If Lagos were a person, he (or she) would be described as ""mad, bad and dangerous to know."" Locals get about in traffic-heavy Lagos on motorcycles known as okadas. But we all know that these types of people are usually the most exciting kind. They are a lot of fun and you just never know what's going to happen when they're around. By the same token, any visitor to Lagos should prepare for the unexpected -- it can feel like a literal assault on the senses from the moment you step off the plane and feel the intensity of the dense tropical heat. Lagos is big, brash and bold and creaks under the weight of the 17 million people who live there. The former capital of Nigeria, Lagos remains its economic nerve center and teems constantly with the buzz of buying and selling (usually performed at the top of the vendors' voices.) There's only one volume level in Lagos and that's loud. From the constant tooting of horns in the snail-paced traffic, known locally as go slows, to music blaring from homes round-the-clock, the city buzzes constantly with noise. Getting around is not easy and you will be caught in the frequent go slows, where you will be confronted by vendors selling all manner of things, from English football team merchandise to dinner sets to plantain chips to frozen yogurts. Locals often joke they can kit out their entire home in a short car journey. The city is divided into three islands adjacent to each other and the mainland. Most expatriates and employees of multinationals, that proliferate in Lagos, are based on two of the islands; Ikoyi and Victoria Island. The vast majority of wealth in the city is concentrated on these upmarket islands, with their western-style shopping malls and entertainment complexes. The best restaurants, bars, boutiques and galleries can also be found here and it's best to stick to these areas to make the most of your time in Lagos. A stay in Lagos would be incomplete without visiting one of the lively and colorful markets like the Balogun market off Breadfruit St, Lagos Island. It is not for the meek or faint-hearted but you're guaranteed to get a bargain or two if you're prepared for a good haggle. It's great for African prints and carvings but is a maze of a market, so best to hop on the back of popular motorcycles known locally as okadas to help you navigate it. To relax from all that haggling, you can head down to one of the five beaches in the city -- the best of them is Tarkwa Bay -- a small beach at the entrance to the Lagos port. It is easily accessible by boat from Tarzan Jetty at Maroko (around $6 per person) or under Falomo bridge on Victoria Island. At Tarkwa Bay you can browse through some local African arts, cloth or even locally produced honey brought round by the occasional hawker. For a spot of lunch, make like locals and indulge in some ""pepper fish"" or suya -- very spicy chunks of meat, similar to kebabs, cooked over a charcoal grill), washed down with ice cold beer. For authentic Nigerian cuisine that won't give your stomach too much ""wahalla"" (trouble), the Yellow Chili restaurant on Oju Olubun Close, Victoria Island is recommended. Those with an adventurous palate can order the special delicacy of Isi-Ewu - goat's head, while others can tuck into jollof rice and chicken or spicy bean cakes (moi-moi) -- a favorite with most Nigerians. For a spot of culture, a short taxi ride away is one of the city's main attractions, the National Museum on King George V Road, Onikan.  It opened in 1957 and houses bronze sculptures and ivory carvings from Benin dating back 300 years. Is Lagos the most exciting city in Africa? Use the Sound Off box below to have your say. If you are in the market for some art, you can pick up some tasteful, but admittedly, not cheap, Nigerian art at the Bogobiri boutique hotel in West Ikoyi. The hotel owner's brother, Azu, will take you to his studio where you can see the artists at work. Lagos is a see-and-be-seen place and later you can party at one of the most fashionable places in town, Caliente on Goriola Street, off Adeola Odeku Street, a fun cocktail bar with a South American vibe and salsa dancing. Lagosians also let their hair down over a bucket of champagne or two at Bar Ten in Saka Tinubu Street, owned by Nigerian football star Jay Jay Okocha. There's no chance of missing it as his name is engraved with golden letters above the entrance! Be prepared to empty your wallet though, as Lagosians are big spenders. However, if your taste is less opulent, visit one of the numerous beer parlors found on every street corner and which are open 24 hours a day. Lagos is a city that never sleeps. For those staying on the mainland, check if musician Femi Kuti is in town on a Sunday and go to ""The Shrine"", Ikeja - the home of Afrobeat. This is an amazing experience reminiscent of his dad, the legendary musician Fela Kuti. Or you can catch the current king of Afrobeat, Lagbaja at his club Motherlan' on Opebi Road, Ikeja. The clubs don't kick off in earnest until around 10pm and you can party well into the night, just don't forget to make it in time for your flight home!

"(CNN) -- As the swine flu outbreak escalates across the globe, U.S. travelers returning from Mexico are wondering what to do when they come home. Travelers leaving a Mexican airport fill out questionnaires about their health. On Wednesday, Christine Kovar of San Francisco, California, returned from a vacation to Nuevo Vallarta, Mexico. She said she wasn't sure whether she should attend work or stay home. ""I feel fine,"" said Kovar. ""It will be the discretion of my boss whether I go back to work."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, is advising U.S. travelers back from Mexico with at least two of the swine flu symptoms to stay at home and avoid public places upon return. Symptoms of swine flu, also known as 2009 N1H1, can include a fever, sore throat, cough, chills, headaches and runny nose. People with symptoms should report to a health care provider or local health department and provide itinerary details and symptoms, according to the CDC. If infected, the swine flu is contagious for up to seven days. People who aren't sick should continue to work and use normal precautions like washing hands, according to the CDC. They should monitor their health for seven days. ""As long as they aren't presenting any flu-like symptoms, there is no reason why they can't continue to do things that they normally would,"" said Llelwyn Grant, a spokesman for the CDC. Meanwhile, the death toll from swine flu continues to climb. On Thursday, the World Health Organization reported 236 cases of swine flu worldwide. In the United States, the CDC said it confirmed 109 cases of swine flu, or 2009 H1N1, in 11 states, an increase of 18 from its previous total. On Wednesday, the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to 5 on a six-step scale . These numbers are causing alarm among the public, as schools and businesses try to contain the disease and protect the health of others. Some companies are erring on the side of safety, telling employees who returned from Mexico to stay at home for a few days. One university in Pennsylvania barred nearly two dozen students back from Mexico from attending graduation. More than 100 schools across the country have shut down. Greenville County School District in South Carolina shut down on Thursday to clean the buildings and busses when 18 students reported flu-like symptoms after a band trip to Disney World in Florida. School officials are awaiting the test results of the children. ""We are being proactive and trying to take [the] right precautions,"" said Oby Lyles, spokesman for the Greenville County School District. Several state health departments such as the New York, where there are 50 confirmed cases, and Kansas, where there are two confirmed cases, said they haven't made state-level advisories yet on whether travelers from Mexico who feel healthy should attend work or not. If travelers are feeling sick, the state departments said travelers should follow CDC guidelines and stay at home. ""If you aren't sick, make sure you are practicing the common sense precautions,"" said a spokesman at the New York State Department of Health. ""Wash your hands. Cover your mouth when you sneeze."" In addition to advising ill U.S. travelers returning from Mexico to stay confined, government officials are turning to the travel industry for help, particularly air travel. The CDC is advising airline crew members who have arrived from domestic and international areas affected by the swine flu to be on the lookout for ill passengers. Airlines have been advised to stock the planes with gloves and face masks in case of an emergency. The CDC said airline crew members need to ask passengers who appear sick to be quarantined at one of the CDC's 20 locations across the country. It's been smooth sailing at U.S. airports, several passengers say. There have been no nationwide questionnaires being issued at the airports, according to a spokeswoman at U.S. Customs and Border Protection yet. In contrast, at some Mexican airports, travelers are asked to fill out forms asking about his or her health, passengers interviewed say. Still, travelers will find warnings about swine flu all over the airport. At O'Hare International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, travel warnings about the flu are being distributed. Signs informing passengers about swine flu, particularly in the international terminal, are posted. As of Friday, the CDC was recommending U.S. travelers avoid all nonessential travel to Mexico.","Travelers with flu-like symptoms coming back from Mexico should stay at home .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- If you're interested in actor Marlee Matlin, you'll want two questions answered before deciding whether to read her memoir, ""I'll Scream Later"": . Actress Marlee Matlin appears on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" to talk about her sexual abuse. 1. What does she say about her relationship with William Hurt, her former lover and costar in ""Children of a Lesser God,"" for which Matlin won a Golden Globe and an Oscar in 1987? 2. Why does she want to scream? The answer to the first is easy: Yes, yes, good Lord, yes, Matlin can't stop talking about Hurt and their passionate, turbulent, at times violent relationship. For instance, ""We made amazing, mind-blowing love. And we fought."" Good to know. And also, ""No matter what triggered our fights, they were made far worse by his drinking and my drug use."" Got it. Mr. Hurt no doubt sends his regards. The answer to the second is more complicated -- something to do with Matlin's being deaf in a hearing world, and being headstrong and wild, and receiving news of her Oscar nomination while dealing with drug addiction (at the age of 21) at the Betty Ford Center. This memoir, dutifully wrestled into order by L.A. Times film critic Betsy Sharkey, is more ramble than holler, but Matlin clearly enjoys making some noise. EW Grade: C+ .

"(CNN) -- Rick Perlstein could have called his book ""Paranoia."" Richard Nixon was ""the guy who exploited these tensions to create a new kind of politics,"" says Rick Perlstein. If Perlstein's history of the 1960s and early '70s in America has a throughline, it's mistrust. Parents don't trust their children. Enlisted men don't trust their officers. Blacks don't trust whites, Southerners don't trust Northerners, the Silent Majority doesn't trust the Intellectual Establishment, and -- soon enough -- nobody trusts the government. And in the midst of it all was Richard Nixon: Red-baiter, former vice president, failed gubernatorial nominee, punch line, political strategist and president, a master at playing both sides to maintain his hold on power. In doing so, he provided a roadmap for his successors. Hence Perlstein's actual title: ""Nixonland"" (Scribner). ""I'm fascinated with how Americans fight with each other,"" says Perlstein, 39, who was born the year Nixon took office. ""And the '60s is the best, the most -- besides the Civil War, I can't think of a more dramatic canvas. And Nixon fits in as the guy who exploited these tensions to create a new kind of politics that we're still living with now.""  Slideshow: What made the '60s the '60s Â» . Perlstein's book has earned rave reviews. In The Atlantic magazine, conservative writer Ross Douthat praised the author for ""the rare gift of being able to weave social, political, and cultural history into a single seamless narrative."" Newsweek's Evan Thomas called it ""the best book written about the 1960s"" in more than a quarter-century. Perlstein says he's long had an obsession with the '60s -- which, in ""Nixonland,"" start with the Democratic landslide of 1964 and end with the Nixon landslide of 1972. The author, now a senior fellow at the left-leaning Campaign for America's Future in Chicago, considers the book a sequel to his earlier work, a biography of Barry Goldwater and the rise of the conservative movement. But ""Nixonland"" is as much a cultural history as a political chronicle; indeed, in the '60s the two were tightly enmeshed. The decade saw the full flower of youth culture, which was intertwined with Vietnam War protests, increasing drug use and distinctive music. It also saw the rise of what Nixon, in a major 1969 speech, termed the ""Silent Majority"" -- older, more conservative Americans buffeted on all sides by change, taking refuge in the familiar. Both groups had their pop culture heroes and touchstones, Perlstein observes. ""The generational divide went so deep as to form a fundamental argument about what was moral and what was immoral,"" Perlstein says. ""This was how people lived in the world -- through popular culture and through politics. The two feed off each other."" Though the era is now remembered through the rosy lenses of the baby boomers, their parents -- the heart of the ""Silent Majority"" -- didn't look upon the culture so fondly. Many disdained the era's pop music, the most obvious expression of youth. Moreover, some of the highest-rated TV specials of 1969 and 1970 were Bob Hope programs, Perlstein writes, and when a movie such as 1970's ""Joe"" came out -- about a hardhat who loathes the hippies -- many in the audience came to cheer for the hardhat. Movies may have been the most revealing mirror of society. The rise of the youth culture coincided with the death of the studio system. Some of what emerged were films willing to show the grit and ugliness of the cities (""the cities"" being a common euphemism for civic decline). ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""The French Connection,"" the Academy Awards' best pictures of 1969 and 1971 respectively, show a weary, cold New York crumbling under its residents' feet. Television tiptoed more gingerly into the new age, Perlstein says. With just three networks catering to the entire country, ""everything had to have this lowest-common-denominator mass appeal,"" he says. ""You could watch TV in 1966 and it's really not any different from what it looked like in 1956. ""When you did get interesting shows, it was often an accident -- a midseason replacement,"" he adds. "" 'The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour' was supposed to be a typical variety show. [CBS] never would have signed it up had they known that they were going to start talking about how much they hated the Vietnam War and started putting on Pete Seeger and making jokes about Richard Nixon. It was an accident."" An underlying theme of ""Nixonland"" is how the various cultural and political movements eventually borrow from each other, with varying results. The mass gatherings of youth -- ""be-in,"" ""sit-in"" -- became ""Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in,"" a colorful comedy show hosted by two nightclub comics, with a writing staff that included an old Nixon hand, Paul Keyes. The nightly arguments between parents and children became the sitcom ""All in the Family,"" a show whose central figure -- the bigoted construction worker Archie Bunker -- became a cultural hero. And then there was Nixon, a controlling man who, in trying to stay at least one move ahead of everyone else, ends up consumed by his own power. The result is Watergate, which is just being uncovered as ""Nixonland"" ends. Could it have been different? Countless commentators have tried to replay history from the hinge year of 1968, wondering if a surviving Robert Kennedy could have beaten Nixon and salved an angry culture. Perlstein, whose next book will chronicle the '70s, will have none of it. ""I don't like that magic thinking. I'm very suspicious of it,"" he says. ""Martyrs seem to get 100 extra bonus points in the annals of history, and that's a bias. By the same token, nostalgia systematically cheats the past. ""I think that it pulls around to one of the huge themes of my book and my work, which is that we really want to believe that somehow magically we can transcend our differences in American and as Americans without working hard at it. ""If only this person had lived; if only this event hadn't gone the way it did. But the fact of the matter is, we are a deeply divided nation, and transcending those differences isn't the work of an afternoon or a single person. It's something we all have to fight for.""","""Nixonland"" is Rick Perlstein's history of the '60s and early '70s .

At the beginning of World War II, as the Nazis tightened their grip on Europe, the U.S. government allowed millions of Jews to resettle from their homes in Poland and Russia to southeastern Alaska, along the panhandle.   Two million Jews had died at the hands of the Nazi scourge, but millions more were saved as the Federal District of Sitka, Alaska, became the new Jewish homeland -- all the more important when the fledgling State of Israel went down to defeat in 1948. However, 60 years later, Sitka is about to be returned to local jurisdiction, and the island's Jews -- including a noted detective, Meyer Landsman -- are wondering where to go next. The Jewish people, forever rootless, will have to wander some more. Landsman's got other problems, too. He's rootless himself, biding his time in a seedy hotel. There's the body that turned up in a nearby room, a onetime chess prodigy who appears to have major connections with some big shots -- machers, in the local Yiddish lingo. There's his ex-wife, now his boss -- at least until the department is disbanded -- and his partner, a half-Jewish, half-Tlingit named Berko who's far more responsible than Landsman. And there are a host of old enemies with long memories, particularly when Landsman decides to root around the dead chess player's case. Landsman's world is fiction, of course, a product of Michael Chabon's imagination. Chabon's new book, ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" (HarperCollins), combines Landsman's hard-boiled detective's terrain with the landscape of alternate history, one in which world events take a startling turn. The story is rooted in fact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author Chabon (""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay"") observes. Chabon had written an article about the decline of Yiddish, and the reaction to the piece -- some of it very negative -- ""got me thinking about ... a possible, but nonexistent, imaginary Yiddish-speaking place in the modern world,"" he says in an interview at CNN Center. In the article, he noted an actual plan by Franklin Roosevelt's Interior secretary, Harold Ickes, to create a refuge for European Jews in Alaska, still 20 years from statehood. In reality, the plan was squelched thanks to the opposition of Alaska delegate Anthony Dimond, but in the ""Yiddish Policemen's"" world, Dimond is conveniently killed off and the plan goes forward. Chabon's Federal District of Sitka is a land of tall apartment blocks and grimy streets, as if ""Hong Kong had moved to the other side of the Pacific Ocean,"" he says. The novel is peppered with clever conceits. The book's black hats, as in villains, are actual ""black hats,"" a slang term for ultra-Orthodox Jews. The characters are fond of Filipino doughnuts, a twist on the Jewish taste for Chinese food. The place names of Russian Alaska are an apt companion to the Eastern European surnames of Chabon's Jews, and then there are throwaway bits -- such as in the Sitka of 2001, Orson Welles did release a version of ""Heart of Darkness."" Doing a genre novel -- or several at once, as ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" is part detective story, part alt-history, part modern Jewish folktale -- isn't considered the natural turf for a so-called literary writer like Chabon, but the author -- who has been vocal in support of genre fiction -- makes no apologies for the work. ""I only ever try to write in genres that I love ... I love hard-boiled detective novels, I love fantasy, I love science fiction,"" he says. ""It feels like a natural impulse to want to integrate that passion that I have as a reader into my writing. I didn't see a good reason not to. ... And to say that there's something inherently inferior about the mystery genre is just silly."" In writing ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union,"" Chabon says, the key was re-reading Raymond Chandler, creator of L.A. detective Philip Marlowe and a distinctive tough-guy style, as well as the Russian-Jewish short story writer Isaac Babel, ""whose use of simile and metaphor strangely echoed Chandler,"" he says. Babel also had a ""clear-eyed view of violence. ... There's a kinship there between Chandler and Babel, and that's what helped me kind-of forge the voice for this novel,"" Chabon says. But, he adds, ""the whole novel is itself a simile. It's setting up a series of semblances and mirrorings of the world we live in, so it seemed almost necessary, not just from a stylistic point of view but from a thematic point of view."" Chabon's layered themes include reason's conflict with religious extremism, an idea that comes to the fore as the novel progresses. Holding a mirror to our world is a common theme of alternate histories, and Chabon says he is fond of the type in general. The noted comic-book fan -- he co-wrote ""Spider-Man 2"" -- cites two favorites: the ""what-if"" scenarios often proposed in the Superman comics, and an issue of National Lampoon that celebrated John F. Kennedy's fifth inaugural with the cover line, ""JFK's First 6,000 Days."" ""I read and re-read that a dozen times,"" he says. ""It had an undertone of poignance. ... It was like a perpetual November 21, 1963. America never went through any of the turbulence of the '60s. ... It was the opposite of most counterfactual fiction, which tends to present the catastrophic -- what if the bad things happened. ... This was presenting an 'if only,' not a 'what if.' "" Which is not to say ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" is presenting a better -- or worse -- future. There is a darkness in the book, Chabon observes. But there's also the idea that millions of people were saved from the death camps. ""I'm certainly not presenting the world of this novel as 'it would have been better this way.' It's a dark world, and the Jews of Sitka are on the brink of the abyss,"" he says. ""But there is a certain 'if only' quality."" ""The Yiddish Policeman's Union"" has earned mostly admiring reviews. "" 'The Yiddish Policemen's Union' builds upon the achievement of 'Kavalier & Clay,' "" wrote the notoriously hard-to-please Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times. Reaction from the public has been positive and even put him on The New York Times' hardcover bestseller list, a rarified place for any author. ""I feel like the book has been embraced,"" says Chabon. Perhaps the only people concerned about the book's subject matter are some Jews, who have asked Chabon if the book isn't, well, ""too Jewish."" ""It reminds me of when my first novel, 'The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,' came out ... and everybody in Pittsburgh said, 'Are you crazy? Why would you set a novel in Pittsburgh? Who's going to want to read a novel about Pittsburgh?' "" he laughs. ""The reason we read fiction is know what it would be like to really be someone else. ...

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Listening to writer Brian K. Vaughan summarize the plot of his comic book, ""Y: The Last Man,"" makes it sound like just another pulp title. Brian K. Vaughan says he's ""depressed"" about the end of ""Y: The Last Man,"" but he's got other projects to work on. ""A plague of mysterious origin destroys every male mammal, human being and animal on the planet,"" he says, ""except for one boy and his monkey. And wackiness ensues."" Well, that's the story boiled down to its basics. But the tale of amateur escapist Yorick Brown, the last man alive on an Earth now home to only women, and his monkey, Ampersand, is actually far more complex than Vaughan's description reveals, involving long journeys, the value of memory and the politics of gender roles. The title, which has had a very successful five-year run, is coming to an end this week with the release of issue No. 60. It is a finale that is equally emotional for both fans and its creator. ""I guess I've moved into acceptance but that doesn't mean that I'm not still depressed about it,"" says Vaughan, 31, a soft-spoken Cleveland, Ohio, native who now makes his home in Los Angeles.  Gallery: The worlds of Brian K. Vaughan Â» . ""It's been weird because it's a gradual [form of] saying good-bye,"" he says. ""First, you finish the script, but then it still has to be penciled and inked, and there's so many stages in comics that it's sort of been like the stages of death."" Vaughan's career in comics dates back more than a decade, but his love for the medium stretches back to his adolescence. Already an avid fan of comic books, he discovered Alan Moore's seminal graphic novel ""Watchmen"" on a family vacation. It would be the spark that inspired him to give life to his own stories.  Watch Vaughan pick out some of his influences Â» . When Vaughan first pitched his concept for ""Y: The Last Man"" to Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics, he was focused on a specific ending, without knowing whether the series would last long enough to reach it. ""We had a long-term idea [of doing] five years but realistically, I knew I had just gotten 'Swamp Thing' canceled at Vertigo and most people hadn't heard of Pia [Guerra], the artist,"" he says. ""It's not like we were destined for a long and successful run,"" he adds, smiling. Almost immediately following its debut in 2002, the series found success, earning critical praise as well as five Eisner Awards, the comic-book Oscars, along the way. Yorick's quest to find his girlfriend, lost somewhere in a world forever changed by this mysterious plague, was just as much an international adventure story as it was the tale of the women in his life: his bodyguard, the enigmatic Agent 355; medical researcher Alison Mann; even his sister, Hero, and his mother. Their experiences can be read as parables on humanity in a world where gender has been all but eliminated from the equation. Now, as their stories come to a close, Vaughan likens it to ending a relationship. ""It'll be a drag not to get to spend more time with these characters,"" observes Vaughan. He adds he will also miss his collaborating with Guerra, who has provided the art for the entire series run. ""It's hard to not think about working with Pia, just because I think she is the best 'actor' in comics,"" he says. ""[That's] a weird thing to say, but she captures emotions better than anyone. I'm very hopeful we'll work together again."" Meanwhile, Vaughan's other work in comics, including ""Ex Machina"" (Wildstorm) and ""Runaways"" (Marvel), has captured the attention of Hollywood. Both ""Y"" and ""Ex Machina"" are currently being developed into films. Meanwhile, Vaughan, a one-time film student, has begun a career in television, working as a writer on ABC's ""Lost."" Remaining true to the mysteries of the island, Vaughan says he can share ""just about nothing"" from the upcoming fourth season of the series, which has been cut from 16 episodes to eight as a casualty of the continuing writer's strike. The fourth season premieres Thursday night. ""Everything is still sort of in flux, sadly, but I know I'm disappointed,"" says Vaughan, who was a fan of the show before ""Lost"" producer and fellow ""comic book geek"" Damon Lindelof approached him to write for it. ""I think these eight episodes are eight of the best in the entire series."" As production remains shut down both on ""Lost"" and the film adaptation of ""Y: The Last Man,"" Vaughan considers himself fortunate. Comic books aren't covered by the Writer's Guild of America, allowing him to continue to work while his colleagues cannot. Despite the accolades and opportunities, Vaughan sees his growth, both personally and professionally, as very much a work in progress. ""I was just a kid when I came up with the idea for 'Y' so I like to think that I've evolved as much as Yorick has over the course of the book. But I'm a comic book writer,"" he continues, ""so I'm still a big dumb child, and I think I always will be."" DC Comics is a unit of Time Warner, as is CNN. E-mail to a friend .","Brian K.

"Tim Welch was never the kind of guy who worried about his weight. Tim Welch topped 260 pounds at his heaviest weight, before his cousin convinced him to join Weight Watchers. In fact, the 37-year-old accounts manager from Seattle, Washington, ate a fairly balanced diet and loved participating in sports while growing up. ""I was thin and fit my whole life,"" Welch remembers. ""I was always active in sports such as running cross-country in high school and swimming on the swim team in college."" Things started to change in 1995 after he graduated from college. Welch got a job, moved out of his parents' house and began indulging in late-night meals with his friends. ""I remember specifically in 1995, my waist size went from a 34 [inches] to a 38 in a matter of months,"" Welch said. ""I got a size 36 pants to accommodate my waist size and I had to ask for a bigger size for Christmas because they were too tight."" Welch was in total disbelief when he stepped on the scale and realized he was carrying 200 pounds on his 5-foot-10-inch frame. Despite the initial shock, he continued to gain weight. Even though he fit the medical definition of obese, Welch stayed physically active. He joined a master's swim team, hiked and walked regularly. Because he was physically active, Welch thought he could keep eating whatever he wanted. As his weight crept up, his desire to exercise waned. By the winter of 2005, the extra calories and his now-sedentary lifestyle caught up with him. During a doctor's visit, Welch discovered that his weight had skyrocketed. ""That was pretty depressing to see that 262 [pounds] on the physical. Just knowing that I had become that heavy,"" said Welch. About the same time, Welch started walking with a cousin who had lost 70 to 80 pounds on Weight Watchers. During their walks, she would gently encourage him to give the program a try, he says. She also tried to calm his fears that he'd have to stop eating all of the foods he loved in order to lose weight. ""I kept expressing a really persistent fear I had of restricting my comfort foods. I felt to truly lose weight, I couldn't ever eat the things I loved -- hamburgers, ice cream, chocolate, bacon, cheese [and] cookies,"" said Welch. ""I felt like in order to lose weight I would have to give up those things."" Welch started to become depressed and ashamed of his increasing waist size. Embarrassing moments such as asking for a bigger pants size and having a homeless man yell, ""Hey, big guy!"" on the street -- began to take a toll on him. As a new year approached, Welch reached his breaking point. In January 2006, as part of his New Year's resolution, Welch reluctantly attended his first Weight Watchers meeting, but not before making one last stop for what Welch called his ""last meal."" ""I had a double-cheeseburger, onion rings and milkshake at Johnny Rockets right before the meeting,"" said Welch. ""I weighed 252.6 at my first meeting."" During the first week on Weight Watchers, he dropped 7 pounds. Welch also learned how to enjoy his favorite foods through portion control, eating in moderation and choosing healthier foods first.   Welch, who was already walking 3.5 miles a day roundtrip to work, started taking water aerobics three times a week and swimming again competitively. The weight continued to come off, about 2-3 pounds a week.  CNN iReporters before-and-after weight loss photos Â» . ""When I got to 200 pounds, I decided, well, 'Why don't I go for a weight that's a healthy weight range for my height,'"" said Welch. ""So I did, and by that point the weight had slowed down. It doesn't come off as quickly as you get closer to your goal weight. But it was still coming off."" Eight months later, Welch had lost 87 pounds and reached his goal weight of 174 pounds, which is the maximum weight for someone who is 5 feet 10 inches tall, according to the national guidelines. People were stunned by his dramatic weight loss. ""I literally had people that knew me that didn't recognize me,"" said Welch. So, what's the best advice Welch has for others who want to lose weight? ""Be the best friend you can to yourself while you're going through this weight loss journey. I've always been someone who was very hard on themselves and suffered from low self-esteem."" Welch said he tried to be very forgiving of himself during the whole process and he still is. He said you should congratulate yourself and focus on any accomplishment you make each day or each week, rather than focus on areas were you have failed. For example, Welch says if you have an extra helping of mashed potatoes, don't beat yourself up. Stop yourself and focus on the fact that you chose salmon and peas for dinner and ate two helpings of mashed potatoes -- compared with the cheeseburger and French fries you would have eaten two years ago. Welch also says people shouldn't deny themselves completely. Allow yourself to indulge in some chocolate when you want it. But instead of eating the entire candy bar, break off a few squares, count the calories, and enjoy it. Also, learn to recognize the fats that are better for you. Don't cut out all of the fat. Instead, choose a healthier fat. For example, Welch often allows himself to eat peanut butter or guacamole, which are higher in fat but are a healthier fat than eating something fried. How has the weight loss changed Welch's life? Welch can bend over and tie his shoes without discomfort. He feels much lighter going up a flight of stairs and he can hike much faster. More importantly, he's become more optimistic. ""It made me realize I can, in fact, do anything I set my mind to,"" said Welch. ""It gave me a confidence I desperately needed that I try to apply to other areas of my life.""  iReport.com: Have you lost weight?

"MARTINSBURG, West Virginia (CNN) -- Hardly a day that goes by that you won't find Tracey Wygal working out at the gym. Tracey Wygal weighed 295 pounds before starting a ""clean diet,"" keeping a food journal and exercising. The 30-year-old middle-school teacher does cardio exercise, strength trains and follows what she calls a ""clean diet."" That's quite a change for a woman who tipped the scales eight years ago at 295 pounds. Wygal first started gaining weight in her early teens. A fast-food diet and little to no exercise helped her pack on the pounds, and her weight ballooned to over 200 pounds. ""It was my first year out of college, and that number, along with being diagnosed as morbidly obese, was very frightening,"" remembers Wygal. ""I went to several doctors, trying to get them to prescribe a weight-loss pill."" But none of her doctors would give her the quick fix she was looking for. Instead, a physician handed her a 1,600-calorie-a-day diet and told her to start moving. At first, Wygal was shocked and refused to begin a diet that she thought was too restrictive. Even though her weight was rapidly approaching 300 pounds, she believed she had a pretty good diet and an active lifestyle. As her weight crept up, Wygal grew more frustrated, and eventually she decided it was time to gain control of her life. She started by keeping track of her daily calorie intake in a food diary and soon realized that her eating was worse than she thought.  Watch more from Tracey Wygal on her weight loss success. Â» . ""I was amazed by how many calories I was eating,"" Wygal said. ""The food diary showed me that I really needed to get my food intake under control and helped me maintain my diet realistically."" She also started exercising. At first, Wygal says, she was too embarrassed to go to a gym, so she bought an elliptical machine and started working out 15 minutes a day in her apartment. ""It was all I could do at first. I didn't give up, though,"" she said. ""Gradually, my endurance improved. After losing about 30 pounds, I decided to join a small gym."" Several months later, Wygal was ready to take the next step. She hired a trainer and began a short strength-training program. That's when something clicked. Instead of feeling intimidated, Wygal started to love her workouts and the physical changes taking shape with her body. Ready to take the next step, she joined a larger gym, began researching different workouts and got into weight training. Over the next three years, she lost 120 pounds and dropped seven dress sizes. Wygal, who's 5 feet 10 inches tall, says the fear of gaining weight motivates her to stick to her diet and exercise regimen because she never wants to look like she did at 295 pounds. Now comfortable with her weight, which she says fluctuates between 170 and 180 pounds, Wygal works out at least five to six days a week. She says the key to losing weight and keeping it off is being honest about what you eat, writing it down and staying consistent. She wants people to know they can do it, but there are no quick fixes or easy outs -- just hard work. ""It won't happen overnight,"" Wygal advises. ""Know that it will take time but it is worth it in the end."" iReport.com: Have you lost weight? Send your story, photos and video .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- During the presidential campaign, then-candidate Barack Obama said that he hoped his administration wouldn't get hung up on matters of race. Judge Sonia Sotomayor, center, meets with staffers from the White House Counsel's Office on Monday. But several Republicans have said recently that his nomination of federal Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court has made race an issue. Former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich called Sotomayor a racist. Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh called the president ""the greatest living example of a reverse racist,"" and said that he has picked another for the Supreme Court vacancy of retiring Justice David Souter. Limbaugh later equated Sotomayor to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. At issue is what she said at the UC Berkeley School of Law in about her hope that ""a wise Latina woman would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life."" One top GOP senator said he wants more than an explanation. ""I think she should apologize, but I don't believe any American wants a judge on the bench that's going to use empathy or their background to punish someone,"" South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News. Democrats have said conservative reaction to the pick is over the line. ""She's been called the equivalent of the head of the Ku Klux Klan by Rush Limbaugh; she's been called a bigot by other Republican leaders like Newt Gingrich. I want to give her an opportunity to answer these kind of people,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, who chairs the Judiciary Committee that will conduct Sotomayor's confirmation hearing. The ranking Republican on the committee, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, tried to turn down the heat over the weekend.  Watch range of comments on Sotomayor and race Â» . ""We should not demagogue race. It's an important issue in our culture and our country. We need to handle it with respect that it deserves,"" Sessions said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. GOP leaders have focused on Sotomayor's appellate court decision against a mostly white group of firefighters who say they were discriminated against after a promotion test was thrown out, because critics said it discriminated against minority firefighters. But legal experts have said her full record on race isn't that controversial -- in 96 race-related cases decided by Sotomayor on the court of appeals, she and her fellow judges ruled against discrimination 78 times and agreed with the claims in 10 cases, according to Scotusblog.com. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who will meet with Sotomayor on Tuesday, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" on Sunday that he couldn't predict how long it will take for Republicans to examine her record. But CNN political analyst David Gergen said they risk putting themselves on trial in front of Latino-Americans. ""If they line up uniformly in hostility against the first Hispanic woman to the court, they risk paying a terrible price with the biggest and fastest-growing minority in this country,"" Gergen said.","Some Republicans call Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor a reverse racist .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Kenneth Cole is the first to admit he has a bit of a language problem. Pun-loving Kenneth Cole pays tribute to inspiring people in his new book. ""I need to distort not just leather and fabric, but also words,"" he said. ""It's a disorder I have."" The pun-loving fashion designer has raised plenty of eyebrows with advertising copy that ranges from the provocative and the political to the lighthearted and cutesy. Browse his online store and you can buy a T-shirt that reads ""In war is it who's right, or who's left?"" A canvas tote bag says, ""Use me again and again and again ... (I'm used to it)."" Should you purchase either product, you're assured that all your money will go to Cole's ""Awearness Fund,"" an initiative designed to draw attention to social issues like homelessness and AIDS. To that end, Cole has just released a new book called ""Awearness: Inspiring Stories About How to Make a Difference"" (DK Adult). It's a collection of essays from influential types intended to encourage readers to get involved in service and volunteerism in their communities.  Watch Cole talk about 'Awearness' Â» . Former President Bill Clinton contributes a piece on the global fight against HIV/AIDS. Actress Rosario Dawson writes about empowering young Latinos to vote, and cyclist Lance Armstrong discusses the merits of starting a movement like Livestrong, his effort to energize the fight against cancer. As Cole says: ""No good deed should go unpublished."" Pun intended. The book commemorates 25 years in the fashion business for the New Yorker, as well as a quarter century as an advocate for social activism. Cole spoke to CNN about the book, the belief, his wife and the cover. (OK, so not everyone is brilliantly punny.) The following is an edited transcript of the interview. CNN: What is the big message you're hoping to get across with this book? Kenneth Cole: The message is that these are extraordinary times. They're transformative in so many ways. And America recently expressed the reality that there is an appetite for meaningful, significant, social change like we've never seen before. CNN: In the introduction of your book, you talk about how you've met a lot of people who have inspired you. Is there one person who stands out above the rest? Cole: There are so many people that inspire me, and there are 90 role models in this book, some of whom I've been very close to. I am the closest of all to my wife, who is in and of herself a change agent and has committed to impacting the realities of homelessness -- and making sure I get out of the house every day to do what I have to do. So she's inspired me and she's done great stuff. So I think I'll stay with that answer. CNN: In Robert Redford's essay on freedom of speech, he encourages the use of humor when speaking out about a cause someone feels passionate about. Has humor helped you? Cole: I think it does. I agree with Mr. Redford, and he's been a model of mine. ... And I think we also have these walls around us, and when people disagree, we're inclined not to listen, but to a degree you can break through that wall often with humor. Jon Stewart has shown us how to do that, as have some other people who are in the art of doing it well. CNN: What's your biggest hope for President-elect Barack Obama's presidency? Cole: He has already surpassed my greatest hopes. I think he's created a sense of spirit and energy and opportunity in this country that we've never seen. And I think it has transformed, in a sense, who we are as a nation globally within 24 hours. We saw that happen. CNN: How does a successful fashion designer, who also has a big conscience, feel in a weak economy? Cole: I think it's an extraordinary opportunity. There are only so many things we can do that make us feel better. We pick up the newspapers and we want to cry every day. We turn on the news and we want to jump out the first window, jump in front of the first truck. And there's not a lot you can look forward to right now ... but you can make yourself look better, and if you look better, you'll feel better, and it becomes self-fulfilling. I think fashion can do that to you. You can do it with some older stuff and mix it with newer stuff, or you can just do new cool stuff by a new cool American designer (smiles). And starting from the ankles down, and then up. CNN: Do you think that fashion gets a hard rap? [Are] people too quick to write it off as frivolous and underestimate its power? Cole: I've struggled with that over the years. Is fashion relevant? Is it frivolous? Is it trivial? Because I give so much of my essence to it, as do everybody I work with. I've come to two conclusions. One is that it's as relevant as anything, because most of the people you encounter in a given day don't get to know anything more about you than how you appear. You're making a very thoughtful statement ... so I think fashion is important. And then at the end of the day if someone you know is sick or someone you know can't afford the roof over their head or the food on the plate, then it becomes not so important. So I think it's relevant, and for me it's been an extraordinary resource for me to do so much. And I love fashion. I think it makes us feel good. And if you feel good, we do good.","Kenneth Cole highlights public-spirited people in ""Awearness""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- When Patricia Cornwell began writing thriller novels, she ruled the world of forensic science. ""I'm very interested in what motivates people, why they do what they do, how they do it,"" Patricia Cornwell said. ""I could treat readers in each book to some new aspect that they wouldn't be familiar with,"" Cornwell said. Now the author is bombarded with ""CSI""-like information from every side -- from ""Bones"" to ""Forensic Files"" to, well, ""CSI."" ""It's like you create this monster and find out it's living in the house with you, and it's banished you to a room because it has more power than you,"" she said. Cornwell knew she had to adapt to the changing entertainment climate. ""One of the questions I really did ask myself was, 'What's the one thing I have no one else does?' "" The answer was chief medical examiner Kay Scarpetta, Cornwell's heroine. Scarpetta is independent, feisty and someone Cornwell knows better than she knows herself. To honor that close relationship, Cornwell decided to name her 16th book in the series after its main character, titling it simply ""Scarpetta."" ""I realized, here it is 2008. I finished my first book 20 years ago in 1988. This is a really big anniversary,"" Cornwell said. In the novel, Scarpetta leaves South Carolina for New York, where the NYPD has asked her to examine an injured psychiatric patient. The patient has a graphic tale to tell -- one of paranoia and murder. The novelist said her books all have two things in common: First, of course, is a plot twist that allows Scarpetta to make a Sherlock Holmes-like deduction. The second is intriguing character interaction. ""What's going on with them in this book? What are they doing with or to each other? Who's in love? Who isn't? Who's on the outs with whom? Because I hope, in the end, [my books] are like high-level, crime soap operas."" With two decades of character history, Cornwell has a lot to work with in that area. But her books are also full of intellectual fodder. Scarpetta is a disciplined academic -- a scientist with a law degree. Cornwell spent six years working in a medical examiner's office before writing her first book, and she continues to spend time with professionals to keep up on new forensic technology. In recent weeks she has researched an autopsy in Florida and worked with the National Forensic Academy. If she's going to write about trace evidence, she believes, she's going to go to a trace evidence lab. ""I was never a scientific person,"" Cornwell said. ""When I got interested in science I had to learn it after the fact... and that was good because I had already learned how to describe things, how to ask questions the audience would want answered. I was much better able to translate things into a language someone else could grasp."" Her dedication to understanding her subject translates into other areas as well. Cornwell became a helicopter pilot, a certified scuba diver and qualified for a motorcycle license, all because she was writing about characters who were doing those things. Fans appreciate Cornwell's enthusiasm and writing style, pushing 12 of her novels onto USA Today's best-seller lists. But Cornwell said ""Scarpetta"" is actually more uplifting than her last couple of books, which took on a more twisted aura. ""I'm glad because I think we live in very dark times and no one wants to read a depressing book now."" Still, Cornwell has been delving deeper into her characters' minds with each new book, and ""Scarpetta"" won't alter that trend. ""I'm very interested in what motivates people, why they do what they do, how they do it,"" she said. ""It probably has something to do with where I am in life. I'm 52 years old and I think differently than I did at 42."" Fans have asked if this is Cornwell's last book in the series -- noting that the title ""Scarpetta"" is very ominous-sounding. But she promises to keep writing as long as the characters let her. ""It's certainly not by intention to be the last book,"" she said. ""I wanted to make this a very special book. I decided that early in the writing process. I wanted to make it longer, a richer book, a feast for the fans. So no, this isn't the last book about Scarpetta."" Which sounds, well, ominous.

"(CNN) -- After several delays, NASA said Friday that space shuttle Discovery is scheduled for launch in five days. The space shuttle Discovery, seen here in January, is now scheduled to launch Wednesday. Commander Lee Archambault and his six crewmates are now scheduled to lift off to the International Space Station at 9:20 p.m. ET Wednesday. NASA said its managers had completed a readiness review for Discovery, which will be making the 28th shuttle mission to the ISS. The launch date had been delayed to allow ""additional analysis and particle impact testing associated with a flow-control valve in the shuttle's main engines,"" the agency said. According to NASA, the readiness review was initiated after damage was found in a valve on the shuttle Endeavour during its November 2008 flight. Three valves have been cleared and installed on Discovery, it said. Discovery is to deliver the fourth and final set of ""solar array wings"" to the ISS. With the completed array the station will be able to provide enough electricity when the crew size is doubled to six in May, NASA said. The Discovery also will carry a replacement for a failed unit in a system that converts urine to drinkable water, it said. Discovery's 14-day mission will include four spacewalks, NASA said.","NASA now says that space shuttle Discovery is scheduled for launch Wednesday .

"Editor's note: The author has ridden motorcycles more than 125,000 miles since 1999, including solo trips from Georgia to California and Canada. She takes us inside the world of motorcycle travel. Bikers approach Mount Mitchell, North Carolina, during a road trip through the Blue Ridge Mountains. SHENANDOAH NATIONAL PARK, Virginia (CNN) -- We were parked at a peaceful, shady overlook beside Virginia's Skyline Drive, admiring the green mountains and the river far below, when Keith realized he needed a new rear tire, and he needed it now. A bald tire is a serious problem when you're traveling by motorcycle: We don't carry spare tires, for obvious reasons, and a blowout on two wheels could be life-threatening. Keith decided he could make it 100 miles to the Harley-Davidson dealership in Richmond, Virginia, as long as we kept it slow, so our seven bikes headed that way. It's been said that a great trip in a car is like watching a first-rate movie -- but a great trip on a motorcycle is like living the movie. For our road trip, we had chosen an eight-day itinerary from our homes outside Atlanta, Georgia, through the mountains of North Carolina and Virginia, then east to the Atlantic shoreline and south along the coastal islands of the Outer Banks. The trip offered a spectacular ride up the Blue Ridge Parkway, a winding two-lane that clings to the ridgeline through North Carolina and Virginia. The elevation often reaches 5,000 feet or more, so temperatures were cool despite a heat wave down below.  See map Â» . Our motorcycle motorcade passed panoramas of blue-tinged mountains and rolling meadows set off by split-rail fences. We motored through dense forests whose overhanging branches turned the road into a cool green tunnel. Rhododendrons and mountain laurels in bloom lined the road.  See photos of this Harley road trip Â» . It all looks better from a motorcycle, because you're so immersed in it -- not just looking out from inside a cage of steel and glass. In fact, we call cars cages and the people who drive them -- you guessed it -- cagers.  See how motorcycle travel differs from car travel Â» . The smells were intense: fresh-cut hay, pine trees baking in the sun, honeysuckle -- and sometimes, the not-so-pleasant aroma of ripening roadkill. Songs of determined birds rang out over the rumble of the motors. Riding a motorcycle on a road like this is a physical pleasure, too, as you lean right, then left, then right, to guide the bike smoothly through the parkway's sweeping curves. You swoop, you glide -- it's like dancing, or like those dreams where you're flying. In Virginia, Skyline Drive offered an abundance of wildlife. We saw five deer in 40 miles, including a small fawn with its mother -- none of them close enough to threaten a collision, and all of them smart enough to run the other way when they saw us coming. Finally we arrived at the dealership in Richmond to replace Keith's balding tire. We knew we'd be there for a while -- so we made ourselves at home. We ordered pizza to be delivered and Neil brought in his laptop so everyone could upload their snapshots. It might seem strange for customers to take over a retail establishment, but a Harley dealership always feels like home. There's a strong sense of community among motorcycle riders (and by extension, the stores). Almost all riders wave to other riders on the road, whether they're on Harleys like ours or small, speedy sport bikes or huge, silent Honda Gold Wings. Bikers fall into conversations with other bikers as if we already know each other because -- in a way -- we do. We've all experienced the same joys and aggravations -- but it's mostly joys. One of those pleasures is how people go out of their way to be helpful or to strike up a conversation with a group of bikers. All kinds of folks wave to us on the road -- from Boy Scouts selling doughnuts on a street corner, to a man walking his dog, to shy-but-fascinated kids in a car stopped next to us at a traffic light. A couple of hours (and several hundred dollars) later, Keith's tire was replaced and we headed for Elizabeth City, North Carolina. We hit a huge blanket of smoke from a massive wildfire about 40 miles away. The thick, yellowish smoke made the rural landscape look like another planet, with the late-afternoon sun glowing red through the haze. The next morning, the smoke was gone, and we headed for the Outer Banks and a day of lazy meandering toward Ocracoke, the southernmost town on the string of narrow islands. We stopped at the Currituck Beach Lighthouse, built in 1875. The sight of a long line of other tourists persuaded us not to climb its 214 steps. At the Wright Brothers National Memorial near Kitty Hawk, we checked out the windy dune where aviation began and rode our bikes around a monument to Orville and Wilbur. We spent the next day in Ocracoke investigating artsy-craftsy shops in the village and stores that sell hokey pirate souvenirs, in honor of the fact that Ocracoke was supposedly a hangout of the legendary pirate known as Blackbeard. We watched descendants of the island's wild ponies that now live in a fenced-in pasture to safeguard them from traffic. The final leg of our trip began with a two-hour ferry ride from the island to the mainland. But we came to a standstill the next day in traffic in Marion, South Carolina -- which was cause for some concern. Most Harley engines are air-cooled, so we can't just leave them idling for long periods because they can overheat. We managed to turn off the highway onto a series of small side roads, where we pulled over to figure out our next move. A mini-van pulled up beside us. ""Where are y'all trying to go?"" the passenger asked. ""I-95,"" we said. ""Come on!"" she yelled, signaling us to follow. After a few turns, we were on I-95, waving our thanks to the mini-van. By the time we reached Georgia, it was obvious there was a thunderstorm between us and home. Despite the 10-minute cloudburst, we were too hot to stop and put on rain suits. We did slow down, since it's hard to see with rain running down your face shield or glasses. Soon we went our separate ways toward home. But I would have been ready to leave on another long motorcycle trip the next day, if it weren't for the suitcase full of dirty laundry and the need to deal with real life for a while. The unfiltered sights and smells, the enjoyment of riding, the companionship of other riders, the friendly encounters with strangers -- there's nothing like it.","Bikers: Motorcycle road trips are more exciting than in other vehicles .

"(CNN) -- Remember the worst job you ever had? You know, back when there were jobs to be had? Jesse Eisenberg tries to strike up a relationship with Kristen Stewart in ""Adventureland."" For writer-director Greg Mottola, it was the summer he spent on hiatus between college and the real world, working as a carny at the local carnival. He's turned the experience into the basis for the wonderful ""Adventureland."" Handing out stuffed animals to the lucky customer whose tin horse romps home in first place -- this is not how James (Jesse Eisenberg from ""The Squid and the Whale"") would choose to see himself. The paycheck is dismal, but undeniably commensurate with (as a character puts it) ""the work of pathetic, lazy morons,"" which is what it comes down to. Most jobs have their compensations, though. At Adventureland, for James, the biggest benefit comes in the form of Em (Kristen Stewart), another recent grad with plans to move to New York in the fall, and who isn't entirely disdainful of his company. Last time out of the gate Mottola enjoyed a hit with the spectacularly lewd ""Superbad,"" an angle that Miramax Films is understandably keen to play up in the marketing this time around. At first glance the cap seems to fit. James' sexual experience -- or rather the lack of it -- is a defining element in the story. ""Adventureland"" comes with the usual farcical peccadilloes of teen comedy -- barf gags, car wrecks and inopportune erections -- as well as several familiar supporting players from the Judd Apatow stable. Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig are engagingly upbeat as the mutually besotted park managers, and Martin Starr (from ""Freaks and Geeks"") is James' cerebral, pipe-smoking buddy, Joel. (Mottola directed a couple of episodes of Apatow's short-lived Fox series ""Undeclared."") There's also an extended cameo from Ryan Reynolds, an actor whose faintly supercilious good looks have graced innumerable dumb slacker comedies, including ""Van Wilder,"" ""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" and ""Waiting."" Yet, after an initial flurry of gross guffaws, the movie edges toward something rather different: a nuanced, sensitive coming-of-age story that finds its heart in post-adolescent romantic turmoil. Obviously adept with actors, Mottola respects his characters too much to let first impressions stick. The relationships in ""Adventureland"" are much richer, and stickier, for it. The understanding that James arrives at with his father (Jack Gilpin), for example, is delineated in just a handful of looks and glances between them, but it's enough to imply the older man's resignation at his fate, and his appreciation for James' tacit sympathy. It's in moments like these (and there are a number of them) that we're reminded Mottola made a fine indie movie, ""The Daytrippers,"" more than a decade ago now, another sharp and tender comic distillation of family bonds and fractures. Blessed with comical seriousness, Eisenberg is like a young Woody Allen: fretful, intelligent, naive and deluded. And like Allen, he seems to enjoy more than his fair share of luck with the opposite sex. Still, ""Adventureland"" makes more effort than ""Superbad"" -- not that hard admittedly -- to develop a character for Stewart. Looking wan and pensive (the ""Twilight"" star always looks in need of a good night's sleep), Stewart as Em gives the impression she's living life more acutely than the others. She seems to have more on the line. Set in the mid-'80s, the film suggests the period unobtrusively, but predominantly through pop music. Lou Reed provides sweet relief to repeated bursts of Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus."" Yes, in retrospect, that's exactly what being young in 1987 was like. A mature movie about immature young people, ""Adventureland"" may be too muted to succeed in today's marketplace, too sensitive for its own good. Like an anxious parent, a critic can only send it on its way and hope the world treats it well. ""Adventureland"" is rated R and runs 107 minutes.

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Gregory Maguire absently cleans his glasses with his tie as he talks about pushing someone down the stairs. ""I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers,"" Gregory Maguire says. ""I wonder if you've ever stood at the top of the stairs behind someone who's really annoying and just imagined putting your foot out and planting your boot in somebody's objectionable behind?"" he asks. ""You know, I think that thought is a fairly common human thought."" Maybe for the author of ""Wicked,"" who looks more like a college English professor than someone who spends his days writing about the world of Oz. Maguire often imagines evil, and how those without self-control respond to it. Maguire's ""Wicked"" series puts a spin on the classic ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" tale, bringing in corruption, political prisoners and war. His first book, ""Wicked,"" has sold more than 2.5 million copies, and the musical based on the book reportedly has been seen by more than 3.75 million people in New York alone. National tours have been huge successes. Maguire's newest book in the series, ""A Lion Among Men,"" tells the story of the Cowardly Lion -- the motherless cub defended by Elphaba in ""Wicked.""  Watch Maguire roar about ""Lion"" Â» . CNN talked to Maguire about the book's main character, his life before ""Wicked"" and why he has never written realistic adult fiction. The following is an edited version of that interview: . CNN: To someone who's never read your books before, how would you describe your style? Gregory Maguire: I would describe [my books] as being, not quite allegories, but commentaries on contemporary society -- and indeed politics to some extent -- enshrouded in, and disguised by, the guise of children's stories. In other words, I use children's stories as kind of a snare and temptation and illusion to draw in readers who say this is going to be easy ... and it's going to be fun. And indeed I hope it is fun. But once I get people involved in the plot, I hope to also communicate some of the questions I have about the way we live our lives in the 21st century. CNN: Talk to me about Brrr. What's his personality like? What is he going through? Maguire: Well, Brrr is the name that I've given to the cowardly lion who is the main character -- the protagonist -- in this novel called ""A Lion Among Men."" And I gave him that name for two reasons: One, because it does sound like a shiver, and he is always slightly spooked by the world; and the second reason, because the two letters in it B-r-r-r are both letters from the name of Bert Lahr, who played the Cowardly Lion so famously in the 1939 MGM film. His character arises in the hollow space in our perceptions between that giant roaring lion at the MGM logo ... the ideal lion, and the kind of sad, sacked, out of work, vaudeville performer in lion pajamas that we see when Dorothy actually runs into the lion on the Yellow Brick Road. In other words, there's a huge disconnect between the image we project of ourselves -- the best we might ever hope to possibly be -- and the way we feel about ourselves at our absolute worst -- when we're the most down in the dumps. There's a huge space in between there. So the novel's really in some ways about character and taking control of the destiny of your own character. CNN: Everyone knows of your success with ""Wicked"" -- it's huge. But what was your life like before you wrote that book? Maguire: I had written children's books for 14 years before I published ""Wicked."" And none of them were poorly reviewed, and none of them sold enough for me to be able to buy a bed. I was the traditional artist in the garret, expecting to live that way or maybe to give up writing soon because I would eventually have to get a job that was going to pay me some kind of retirement package. Silly thought, that, these days. CNN: You often take the point of view of the ""wicked"" or ""evil"" characters in your books. How do you get inside their heads? Maguire: Well, I like to think I'm a pretty good-natured guy and pretty civil and probably not ever truly guilty in any serious way of any legal infractions. But I do seem to have an unconscionable, easy time of thinking about how people might do wrong, of what they might feel like and how they might behave if they had less self-control than I do. And then also, how they would have to deal with the weight of being called evil. If everyone was always calling you a bad name, how much of that would you internalize? How much of that would you say, all right, go ahead, I'll be everything that you call me because I have no capacity to change your minds anyway so why bother. By whose standards should I live? In a way, all three of my adult books come down to that question -- by whose standards should I live? Can I find my own standards? Can I recognize them? Can I value them if I can name them? And are they good enough, are they strong enough, standards by which to live? CNN: You talked about writing children's books. How is writing for children different than writing for adults? Maguire: Well, for one thing children are intensely more impatient than adults. So you have to start out active, you have to start out strong and you cannot be, for a moment, self-indulgent. Everything has to be a sound bite or something that the children can visualize as if they're running a little Super 8 projector in their mind. Now I date myself with ancient technology, but you know what I mean ... write the scene that you want Steven Spielberg to film, which means every sentence has to give us something to see. Make it intensely visual and this is, I think, the main rule for writing for children. But in no way do I make it less thoughtful. I just actually have to work harder. Writing for children is like the difference between writing a sonnet and writing a gossip column. I mean you have a lot more restrictions so you have to work a lot harder. I'm not saying that a gossip column can't be intensely rewarding, but I dare say it's easier to write. CNN: Have you ever considered writing anything that's not magical, or more real life? Maguire: I have, but I never seem to get very far. In a way, and I don't mean to talk myself down, but sometimes I look at the mysteries of other people and I think, ""How do I know if they think anything like I think?"" I can only guess who you might be. You might see the world in a whole different range of colors than I do. You might be super sensitive to nuances of body language or music or ... I just don't know. So I always feel when I try to write realistic fiction for adults, that maybe I don't have enough life experience, even though I'm 54. I'm not sure I trust it. But when I write something that has a magic base to it, I put in everything I do know about the infinite varieties and subtleties and ambivalences in adult behavior, but nobody can call me out and say, ""You don't even know who human beings are"" because I've couched it. I suppose it's a kind of safety net for myself, or a security blanket. If I'm writing magic, nobody can say I got it wrong because we all know magic doesn't exist.","Gregory Maguire's new book, ""A Lion Among Men,"" is about the Cowardly Lion .

"TUSKEGEE, Alabama (CNN) -- A trip through sweltering Alabama to experience some of the civil rights movement's most important sites brought history books to life for my family and me. A marker shows the 54-mile route from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, that voting rights marchers took. The road trip, with my wife and 14-year-old son, was an extraordinary experience, and not only because I'm African-American. As an American, it was inspiring to experience the places where people fought and died for equality and the right to vote. Many of the places we visited are maintained by the National Park Service, which has made an extraordinary effort to preserve pivotal places related to the movement. When you think of national parks, great natural attractions like Yellowstone or the Grand Canyon come to mind. But the National Park System has also preserved and restored many living history sites from the civil rights movement. We started our road trip at Moton Field in Tuskegee, the site of one of the early battles in the civil rights movement. In the 1940s, the U.S. government trained the nation's first black military aviators at Moton in what it labeled a military experiment. Before that time, African-Americans ""were believed to be incapable of flying complex combat aircraft,"" Park Ranger John Whitfield said.  Watch more on Moton Field Â» . The aviators were trained in every aspect of their combat aircraft, from flight to maintenance. They made their mark during World War II by not losing a single bomber to enemy fire in more than 200 combat missions -- a record unmatched by any other fighter group. Moton Field was declared a historical site in 1998, and the National Park Service has gone through painstaking efforts to restore and rebuild its hangars and outbuildings, which were used by more than 15,000 men and women from 1942 to 1946.  iReport.com: Share your meaningful road trips . The site now offers only a small visitor's center in a temporary trailer as construction and restoration are completed. The ""Tuskegee experience,"" as park rangers call it, will officially open in October, when Hangar One, and eventually Hangar Two, will be retrofitted to look as they did when the facility was in full operation in the 1940s. Moton field is a little over three miles from Tuskegee University, the only college campus in the country with a national park. The park includes The Oaks, home of university founder Booker T. Washington, and a museum that houses the work of the renowned slave-turned-scientist George Washington Carver. We browsed the various artifacts and exhibits that outline the life and scientific work of Carver, who is well known for the hundreds of uses he found for the peanut. My family and I learned that Carver was an accomplished painter who made his own paints from red Alabama clay. We grabbed lunch at Taliaferro's, just off Tuskegee's main square, which takes its moniker from the middle name of Tuskegee University's founder. The restaurant offers a buffet of Southern favorites like okra, macaroni and cheese, banana pudding and peach cobbler at low prices. The fried chicken and ""mean greens"" are listed in ""Alabama's 100 meals you should eat before you die"" brochure. The chicken certainly lived up to the brochure's claim. It's a 38-mile ride to Montgomery, where we visited Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church, which is the only church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. served as senior pastor. Amazingly, the church literally lies in the shadow of the Alabama State Capitol, the very building where lawmakers passed segregation laws. Entering the church basement, we could visualize protest strategy meetings for the Montgomery bus boycott or the voting rights march that King presided over in this very room. The church is still home to a congregation of about 300 and is very active in Montgomery's community. Driving down U.S. Highway 80, now the historic National Voting Rights Trail, we thought about the 15,000 people who walked the same 54-mile route in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery, protesting Alabama laws that prohibited African-Americans from registering to vote. In between Selma and Montgomery, we discovered the Lowndes County Interpretive Center, which stands where a ""tent city"" once stood to support the marchers in 1965.  Watch more on the center Â» . A 20-minute film about the march, told by people who took the journey, moved us to tears. We toured the interactive exhibits to learn more about the protest, the challenges and the hurdles African-Americans had to conquer for their constitutional right to vote. At the center, and at several museums during our trip, we met volunteers who were participants in the voting rights movement who gave us first-hand accounts of their experiences.  See photos from the trip Â» . Joe Glover, a volunteer at the center, said he was a resident of the tent city as a 15-year-old. He said that in retaliation for participating in the voting rights march, his family was kicked off a plantation where they share-cropped. ""I love sharing my experience with young people by letting them know how important it is to get an education and what their foreparents and other people shed their lives and blood for in order for them to have a right to vote,"" Glover said. We ended our road trip in Selma by crossing the infamous Edmund Pettus Bridge. There, on March 7, 1965,  protesters demanding their right to vote met a wall of state police armed with bully clubs and cattle prods. The protest was the first of three attempts to march to Montgomery and came to be known as Bloody Sunday. We are thankful for the sacrifices of those who crossed the bridge in 1965 and regretful for those who don't take advantage of their right to vote.","First stop provided early peek at Tuskegee Airmen site, which will open in October .

"Editor's note: Peter Bregman is chief executive of Bregman Partners Inc., a global management consulting firm, and the author of ""Point B: A Short Guide to Leading a Big Change"". He writes a weekly column, How We Work, for HarvardBusiness.org. Peter Bregman says good times persuaded people to sacrifice what they loved for money. NEW YORK (CNN) -- I started my consulting business 11 years ago with a laptop computer in a living room. It grew quickly. The first year I made more money than I had in the previous three combined, the second year I doubled that and by the third year I began to fantasize about retiring within the decade. Then everything crashed; the dotcom revolution, the financial services industry and my business. I had a large number of subcontractors and a small number of employees who had become friends. I also had a bad feeling things wouldn't turn around quickly. My wife and I were in a tough spot. We had one child and another on the way, bills that were accumulating and hopes for the future that were moving out of reach. However bad it was then, these days it's worse. Back then the recession hit certain sectors and left other ones alone. Home prices were going up, so people felt protected, and there were loans to help. Today, everything's been hit, nothing's going up and credit is frozen. Many have already lost jobs, homes, self-identities, luxuries and necessities. And there's more to come. That's especially true for many older Americans, who might not have 10 years to recover and who don't have sources of income other than their savings -- which have dwindled dramatically. They don't deserve to live with the fear they now feel. I'm still living in a rental apartment because I didn't want to take out a loan I couldn't pay back. I saved money. Invested it. And now my investments are down 70 percent. But it is what it is. And when we wake up in the morning we are left with the question, ""Now what?"" It's actually a great question, because in a situation in which we've lost control, it gives us a little back. ""Now what?"" means we have a choice, in this moment, to do something. What's it going to be? I think it's a mistake to try to rebuild what we've lost. We have less now and I think we can do better with less. Having less forces choices. And consciously making those choices can bring us closer to the things we care about. Which can make a poorer life richer than a rich one. Because the research is clear. Above a basic threshold, more money doesn't make us happier. But we think it will, so we do all sorts of things that make us unhappy in order to get it. A senior leader in an investment bank called to tell me she was leaving her job. She realized she wouldn't make much money in the next few years and didn't want to miss her children growing up. Did you get that? She was willing to miss her children growing up if the money was good enough. People act in ways they'd rather not in order to make money that doesn't make them happy. Maybe, if we do this downturn right, we can get out of that cycle. So, what makes you happy? Is it spending time with people you love? Working on a pet project? Having the time to exercise? Being part of a community and feeling cared for? Knowing the answer enables you to make decisions that will prioritize those things. Of course, losing money can break people apart; we fight about money, people lose jobs and get depressed; tension rises as mortgage bills sit on the kitchen table unpaid; resentment builds when one person doesn't live up to his own and others' expectations. But I am also seeing the opposite. Losing money can bring you closer to your values; can actually bring people together. It's hard to appreciate in the midst of our loss, but embracing the forced reduction in lifestyle can be positive. I know of a couple whose marriage was saved when they moved from a bigger house into a smaller one and actually began talking to each other again. Last weekend, two people had a beautiful wedding in Central Park surrounded by family and friends, months before they had planned, avoiding thousands of dollars of expenses and all the tension that goes with it. Why? Because she lost her job and needed to get onto his health insurance. Friends of mine held their daughter's bat mitzvah at another friend's house, avoiding tremendous expense while creating the warmest community celebration, filled with gratitude and tears, that I have ever seen. In 2003, after my business crashed, my wife and I decided to move to Savannah, Georgia, where she grew up and life was much cheaper. Had my business continued to grow we could never have afforded to make that choice. When the business crashed, we couldn't afford not to. While there, we spent priceless time with her family, had another child, made lifelong friends and rebuilt my business -- this time very differently. I love consulting and writing and speaking, but the bigger the business became, the less I did those things and the more I managed others doing it. Eventually we returned to New York. Now I'm back to a laptop in a living room and I love it again. It's smaller, more sustainable and a lot more fun. And I have the time to spend with my family and friends. My fantasy is no longer to retire; it's to keep doing what I'm doing for as long as I can. Life is not a linear path of increasing wealth, accumulation and achievement. Don't let the money crisis draw you apart from people you love and things you love to do. Use it to draw you closer.

President Obama joined Britain's Prime Minister Gordon Brown, France's President Nicolas Sarkozy and Canada's Prime Minister Stephen Harper at a ceremony at the American Cemetary in Normandy, close where many died in the World War II offensive. More than 150,000 allied troops, about half of them Americans, took part in D-Day on June 6, 1944, overwhelming German forces in an operation that proved a turning point in driving the Nazis out of France. Allied forces secured the beaches at a cost of about 10,000 casualties in what was the first step in a campaign that would, in a matter of weeks, liberate Paris, which had been under Nazi occupation for more than four years. Brown praised those who fought on that day, saying, ""as long as freedom lives, their deeds will never die."" He said their sacrifices had put obligations on people living today in what he called ""the great covenant of D-Day. ""We must be as if liberators for our day and our generation too,"" he said, citing Burma (renamed Myanmar) and Zimbabwe, as well as the ""mortal threat of poverty, hunger, illiteracy, disease and want."" Obama addressed the 288 veterans said to be attending the ceremony, telling them: ""You are why we keep coming back.""  Watch Obama deliver speech to veterans Â» . ""You remind us that in the end, human destiny is not determined by forces beyond our control. You remind us that our future is not shaped by mere chance or circumstance. ""It has always been up to us,"" he said.  Watch Obama arrive in France Â» . He urged the world to remember what happened at nearby Omaha Beach, one of the main landing points for U.S. troops involved in the operation. ""Friends and veterans, what we cannot forget -- what we must not forget -- is that D-Day was a time and a place where the bravery and selflessness of a few was able to change the course of an entire century."" Sarkozy described the horrors of the battle, where so many died before they were able to land that ""those who did make it ashore waded through the bodies of the dead and wounded that floated in on the tide."" He cited a letter from a U.S. soldier who said the day ""was like a waking nightmare. The ground was so strewn with bodies that you could practically cross the beach without touching the sand."" ""Never, never will France forget,"" he vowed. The speeches were followed by a 21-gun salute, a lone trumpter playing taps and a flyover by American, British and French jets. Among veterans attending Saturday's remembrance ceremonies will be 86-year-old former British soldier Jim Tuckwell, who said the events will help those present to remember fallen comrades lost in the heat of battle. ""There was no time to mourn, you didn't have time to mourn,"" he said, recalling the events of 1944. Read Tuckwell's story . ""And the worst thing about later battles was that when you lost people, you normally had to bury them yourself. You couldn't leave the bodies on the ground, there was nowhere else to put them.""","Dignitaries, World War II veterans pay tribute to D-Day fallen .

"(CNN) -- An ex-convict, a mobster, a serial killer -- after more than two decades in the movie business, Ray Liotta is still perhaps best known for these ""bad guy"" roles in such films as ""Something Wild"" and ""GoodFellas."" Ray Liotta (right) co-stars with Seth Rogen in ""Observe and Report,"" which opened Friday. But in his most recent film, ""Observe and Report"" -- a dark comedy co-starring Seth Rogen as a bipolar mall security guard and Anna Faris as the vapid make-up counter clerk he's in love with -- Liotta inches away from his edgy persona to play a detective investigating a flashing incident at the mall. ""A flasher keeps flashing people at the mall, so they call in the 'real police,' which is me,"" Liotta told the Columbus Dispatch. ""The last thing I want to do is investigate."" The film, which opened in theaters Friday and has earned rave reviews by critics, is not Liotta's first comedic undertaking. The 54-year-old actor also starred in 2007's ""Wild Hogs,"" a comedy co-starring Tim Allen and John Travolta about a group of middle-aged suburban men who decide to become bikers. The film was one of that year's surprise hits, taking in more than $150 million at the domestic box office.  See some of the highlights of Liotta's career Â» . Liotta first made his mark on the film industry by playing a psychotic ex-husband determined to win back his ex-wife in ""Something Wild."" The role propelled Liotta to fame and earned him a Golden Globe nomination for best supporting actor. From there, Liotta starred as mobster Henry Hill in the Martin Scorsese classic ""Goodfellas"" (1990), working alongside renowned actors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. ""Edgy guys stand out in people's minds,"" Liotta said of his famous ""bad guy"" roles, according to the Dispatch. But, to avoid being typecast as the ""bad guy"" forever, Liotta decided to break from the mold in his next role as a caring father in the heartwarming film ""Corrina, Corrina"" (1994), co-starring Whoopi Goldberg. Liotta soon proved that acting was not his only forte. He formed his own production company in 2002 and made his debut as a producer on the film ""Narc,"" in which he also starred as a corrupt cop. He's also earned plaudits for his television work. In 2004, Liotta starred in an episode of the hit NBC drama, ""ER,"" winning an Emmy for his guest appearance. The actor got his start on daytime TV, playing the character Joey Perrini on the soap ""Another World."" With several films currently in production, Liotta shows no signs of stopping. The actor told the Dispatch that he hopes to try his hand at romance in the future, joking that he'd like to ""kiss the girl without having to choke her first.""

"(CNN)  -- Like most stories that end up with a man mowing his friend's lawn in a dress, it started out innocently enough. Craig Harrell takes a quick break for the camera while fulfilling his end of the bargain. Not long after Robert Klein began working on his man cave, his friend Craig Harrell paid Klein a compliment. He noticed Klein was looking trimmer since they'd last met. As Klein continued to slim down, they made a bet: Whoever could get down to 200 pounds first would be the winner, and the loser would have to mow the winner's yard -- in a dress. Klein started building his man cave in Pasadena, Maryland, so he could have the bar of his dreams and a home theater. He worked on his basement for more than a year and ended up losing 65 pounds in the process -- more than enough to win his bet with Harrell. CNN.com and iReport.com got an overwhelming response when we asked readers to send in photos and stories of their man caves: spaces that foster men's hobbies, decorating skills and technological needs. Some of their stories were so outrageous that we decided to profile a few of them. Klein's man cave, however, was the only one to combine dramatic weight loss and cross-dressing, so we had to give him a call to find out more. Klein said his friends wanted to talk about two things while he was building his man cave: how his amazing bar was coming along and how they thought Harrell would lose the bet. The bet was popular with everyone Klein and Harrell knew. Their wives even started a dress committee, to make sure the loser was appropriately attired, and their kids delighted in the prospect of seeing Dad in a dress. To lose weight, Klein said Harrell played golf and cut out chips, while he adopted a balanced, calorie-restricted diet, and spent at least six hours a day on the man cave, which took most of his free time. Klein did all the electric wiring himself, worked on the framing and put three coats of paint on all the walls and ceilings. He attributes his weight loss success to replacing TV-watching with hard work. ""I lost at least 10 pounds on the painting alone,"" he said. ""My neck was sore for weeks."" Klein knew he couldn't build the kind of man cave he wanted all by himself, so he contracted out some of the big jobs, like cutting a hole in the foundation to add 6-foot-tall French doors to the side of the house in place of a window well, and finding someone to do the woodwork on a custom bar he designed. Although he started out with a carefully planned budget, Klein quickly found he needed to spend more money to make his dreams a reality. The hardest part, he said, was finding someone who could build his bar for a price he could afford. After some disheartening estimates (one was $65,000), Klein found Lyle Delfosse, a local furniture maker who had built libraries in the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C., and constructed a chair for a U.S. Supreme Court justice over his long career. Now 76 and retired, Delfosse told Klein, ""I can build anything out of wood."" Klein said Delfosse was true to his word, and they didn't go over the initial estimate of $19,000, although he said Delfosse told him ""if he had it to do all over again, he'd have charged double."" Klein calls the bar ""magnificent,"" and said that when people come over to see it, they feel underdressed. Convinced he'd saved money by doing a lot of the work himself, Klein splurged on a new sprinkler system. The bet he'd made earlier in the year was on his mind, and he wanted to ensure that the grass in his front yard would be nice and green once the weigh-in arrived. At the height of summer, Klein's man cave was finished, and he decided it was time to step on the scales. Harrell was 208 pounds, and Klein was 195. At the party Klein threw to show off his new bar and theater, Harrell was ready. With some help from the dress committee, Harrell became Klein's newly acquired, frock-sporting landscaper. The wives had sewn two pink, strapless dresses together to fit Harrell, and then layered on accessories like a bow-topped headband and a corsage. All decked out, Harrell graciously mowed Klein's front yard, with 80 people cheering him on. Somehow, as Harrell was mowing, Klein's new sprinkler system went off, soaking Harrell and his dress. In a phone interview, Klein was coy about who the perpetrator might have been. These days, Harrell has his own man cave, complete with bar. Klein points out that his bar is nicer, but says he's got his buddy's back: Harrell's wife thinks a dishwasher would be a practical addition to the man cave, but Klein is trying to convince her that the keg refrigerator Harrell wants is a good idea.

"DINGLE, Ireland (CNN) -- Fewer tourists and relatively warm temperatures may be reason enough to put Ireland on your list of winter travel destinations, especially Dingle Peninsula, once ranked by National Geographic Traveler as ""the most beautiful place on Earth."" Winter offers tourists a chance to explore Ireland's west coast  unhindered by bothersome crowds. The peninsula, on Ireland's west coast, includes the oceanside town of Dingle, which boasts more than 1,000 full-time residents. Winter visitors will avoid the area's hundreds of thousands of summertime tourists. Boats crowd Dingle's popular marina, bringing fresh seafood catches of the day. Some of the marina vessels also will ferry visitors to see Fungie, a locally famous dolphin who has lived in the waters outside town since 1984.  See breathtaking photos of Dingle Â» . Outside Dingle, numerous vacation cottages are available to rent, including homes in the village of Dunquin. In winter, rates are drastically cut, and rental period dates may be more flexible. Most shops and restaurants have shorter hours during winter, and traditional music is found in some of the pubs on the weekends. As with most of Ireland, pubs abound, even in the smallest villages. A beer (preferably Guinness) and some hearty pub grub are a perfect way to cap a day of exploring the wintry sights of the peninsula. Because Ireland sits near the warm waters of the Atlantic Gulf Stream, the Emerald Isle has an average temperature of 46 degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius) during December, January and February. But pack smart and bring layers of clothing, including warm sweaters and jackets, because winter weather often means rain on Ireland's western shore.","Dingle, Ireland, called ""most beautiful place on Earth"" by National Geographic .

"OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK, Washington (CNN) -- Taking a road trip by yourself can be good for the soul. The freedom and beauty of the open road on a recent trip in the Pacific Northwest and California brought me back to what is really important in life. Vistas along the California coast near Mendocino can be breathtaking. My road trip started in Seattle, Washington, and ended two weeks later in Sacramento, California, covering 2,277 miles with a stunning backdrop of natural beauty along the way. Living in the moment and charting my own course gave me a sense of self empowerment that extends to my path in life and what I want out of it. For those who wish to set out on their own solo road trip, I recommend research and planning -- while still leaving time to be spontaneous. Hoh Rain Forest, Olympic National Park . As I drove into the Hoh Rain Forest in Washington's Olympic National Park, the only words I could muster were Holy ... Wow! The greenness of it all and the smell of fresh air stimulated a part of my brain that hadn't been stimulated in years, if ever. Here I was in the good, old U.S. of A., driving through a rain forest. Having just left Seattle, where my trip started, this was the first leg of my self-proclaimed big adventure. From the start, Olympic National Park was always a must-see.  See map of my road trip Â» . I mean, who knew you could hike through rain forests, climb glaciers, walk beaches or hit up mineral hot springs all in one place? The Hoh Rain Forest offered enchanting hikes, with plenty of trails to choose from. Huge ferns, endless amounts of beautiful moss, and trees -- some 500 years old -- made up much of the landscape. On my second day, as the rain started to come down hard, I decided to squeeze in a late afternoon visit to Ruby Beach, about 45 minutes east of Hoh. There's something special about walking a beach in a virtual downpour: You've pretty much got it all to yourself.  See photos from my trip Â» . Sol Duc Hot Springs . After two days in the rain, accidentally stepping on a couple of mammoth-sized banana slugs outside my tent, and looking a bit like Chewbacca, I decided to treat myself to the popular Sol Duc Hot Springs Resort, about 30 minutes north of the Hoh Rain Forest in Port Angeles, Washington. Named by American Indians, Sol Duc, which means sparkling water, is also thought to have healing values, something I was in desperate need of by this point. Three pools are heated by the nearby hot springs and there's one freshwater pool if you need to cool off. I threw on my suit, quickly showered and then headed straight for the hot spring. Aaaaaah, this was perfect. The pools were crowded and the smell of the minerals in the water was obvious. With a backdrop of tree-lined hills, it's easy to sit, relax and soothe your bones for hours. Oregon Caves . Oregon is a beautiful state from top to bottom. It seems to have it all, the ocean, rivers, cool towns and caves! Oregon Caves National Monument is located outside Junction Caves, Oregon. To get to the cave's entrance you have to drive 20 miles along a very windy -- but beautiful -- two-lane road, deep in the Siskiyous Mountains. I arrived just in time for the last tour which ran about 90 minutes. Bring a jacket since the temperature inside the cave is around 44 degrees (7 degrees Celsius) year-round. Our group had just started the tour when one woman traveling with her daughter announced she couldn't do it. She wasn't comfortable walking within confined spaces. Our guide was very helpful and mentioned to all of us this was the right time to speak up if you didn't think you could do the tour. Moments later our group, minus two, made its way through the inside of the mountain. This place rocked -- literally and figuratively. In 1907, poet Joaquin Miller coined the cave's nickname, ""The Marble Halls of Oregon."" You'll hear a lot of stories on the tour; from its discovery in 1874 by Elijah Davidson, whose dog chased a bear into the cave, to a couple who got married inside the cave, complete with cavemen outfits and fur. Our guide, Rachel De Nardis, called the cave intimate and personable. Steve Thede, chief of interpretations, says the Oregon Caves offer an opportunity to connect with the inside of Earth. Besides, he adds, this is something you'll remember 10 years from now. The drive to the caves is a little bit off the beaten path, but it's well worth the side trip. Mendocino, California . My day in Mendocino County was completely unplanned. I had a full day between planned stops on my route, so I headed to Mendocino because it's known for its scenery and its art community. Everyone talks about the gorgeous coastline in Northern California, so I thought, we'll see if they're right. The vistas along the way were stunning. It took me longer than I had estimated because it's so easy to constantly stop and snap pictures. Eventually I arrived in Mendocino, found a great spot on some rocks by the Pacific and ate lunch. Eating an avocado sandwich as waves crashed against the rocks was an inspiring moment. How often do you get to find those kinds of spots, I asked myself. Another traveler's gem I found in Mendocino would be of interest to gardening gurus -- or those who just like flowers. The Mendocino County Botanical Garden showcases beautiful gardens and a gift shop. Big Trees of Calaveras County, California . The Big Trees of Calaveras County is home to the giant Sequoias. Located about four miles east of Arnold, California, the trees in the park are the biggest in the world. As soon as I began my stroll in the North Grove portion of the park, I was overtaken by the sheer massiveness, power and age of these trees. Some trees in the park are believed to be up to 2,000 years old. The largest tree in the park is about 25 feet in diameter and 250 feet tall. Pick up the guided tour sheet for 50 cents. It gives you perspective and stories behind the trees. Big Trees State Park is inside the Stanislaus National Forest, a huge forest spanning from just south of Lake Tahoe to the southern reach of Yosemite National Park. I stayed with a friend who lives in an A-frame home along the west boundary of the forest -- a neighborhood which is pretty unusual. Imagine driving out of your neighborhood and, instead of passing houses, you're driving by mammoth trees and clear blue running rivers. Who has that? To me, to live in the heart of Mother Earth like my friend does would be a privilege. Overall, I surprised myself during this solo adventure. I learned that during a trip alone, you find yourself doing things that you didn't plan on -- that you wouldn't put down on paper beforehand. A lot of people are afraid to be by themselves -- to travel by themselves. Some people don't even like to eat by themselves. This trip showed me that going solo can be a valuable experience. It forces you to appreciate yourself, and realize that you are often times your own best company.","Olympic National Park has rain forests, glaciers, beaches, mineral hot springs .

"(CNN)  -- Skier Paul Wampach, a 49-year-old manager from Chicago, Illinois, hardly matches the stereotype of a hostel dweller: an under-30 backpacker from outside the United States who can't afford fancy lodging. Travelers looking to meet new people might consider staying at hostels, say experts. For the fifth time in two years, Wampach plans to head to the Fireside Inn in Breckenridge, Colorado, where he's booked a dorm-style room for less than $40 a night during his ski vacation. ""If I'm traveling by myself, there's no reason to splurge,"" said Wampach, who is single and described himself as neither rich nor poor. ""That $40 or $50 [I save on lodging] goes to food, beer and ski-lift tickets."" And amenities such as Internet access and a hot tub at the hostel add creature comforts to the trip. Wampach's travel habits are consistent with a growing number of travelers called ""flashpackers."" They are usually over 30, in mid-to-late career and can afford higher-end hotels but instead choose budget options -- albeit better-furnished and well-kept ones -- because it fits their lifestyle, said Mark Vidalin, Marketing Director for Hostelling International USA, a nonprofit network of hostels. Flashpackers also tend to stay connected by traveling with gadgets and seeking accommodations with free Wi-Fi, Vidalin said. The term ""flashpacker"" likely originated in Australia, and combines the term ""flash"" -- meaning ""stylish"" -- with ""backpacker,"" according to Vidalin. Flashpackers and regular backpackers are booking hostels at U.S. vacation destinations in full force this year. Attendance at hostels has been consistently rebounding from lows following the September 11, 2001. This year's turbulent economy appears to be fueling demand for hostel space. Heading into ski season, Loree Weisman, the owner of the Crested Butte International Lodge and Hostel in Crested Butte, Colorado, said her hostel bookings are trending ahead of the town's other lodging options -- and up about 25 percent from her bookings by the same time last year. Amid the unsteady economy, she said, people ""don't want to give up a vacation, but they might need to adapt a vacation."" Instead of canceling pricey vacations due to economic fears, many travelers are rejecting accommodations with private bedrooms and bathrooms. They're going for hostels with their dorm-style bunk beds, community bathrooms, and, most importantly for many hostel dwellers, shared living spaces. ""There's a sense of community, and there's a social aspect to it that's pretty significant,"" said Jim Williams, editor of ""The Hostel Handbook"" and a former hostel owner. ""That is the heart of hostelling. You don't go to a hotel and lock the door."" Wampach agreed, saying that hostels offer ""a tremendous way to meet people from different cultures and talk to people you wouldn't normally talk to."" But the communal atmosphere of hostels leaves many travelers skeptical, particularly Americans, Williams said. ""Americans have privacy issues. If you suggested to most people they were going to share a room with five other people, most of them wouldn't want to do it,"" he said. What if a roommate snores or what if he smells or doesn't stop talking? -- these are legitimate questions for travelers considering the hostel option, said Williams. Frequent hostel dweller Mandy Creighton, 30, said she enjoys the overall hostel experience, but it's a ""huge challenge"" to ""walk through the room and to my room without having to talk to 20 people."" Creighton and her partner, Ryan Mlynarczyk, 32, who are documentary filmmakers from Sebastopol, California, are bicycling around the United States for a year and stopping in ecologically sustainable communities along the way. Their choice to stay in hostels is rooted in a desire to maintain a green lifestyle by sharing resources as well as saving money. Mlynarczyk experienced the other side of the privacy issue when he stepped out of a shower in a San Francisco, California, hostel to discover he had a female audience. ""I ... didn't have my towel on -- and some girl walks in and was like, 'Woo!' I'm totally open to that sort of thing, but I think she was a little bit new to it, and she kind of was giggling. But obviously the immediate reaction was, 'Oh my God!' "" Mlynarczyk said. In contrast to Americans who treasure their personal space, the communal environment is more ingrained in European culture, experts said. It's possible to trace that cultural divide to post-World War II, said Williams, when Europe underwent its financial recovery in the 1950s and its culture was more communal. On the other hand, the U.S. economy was booming, and there was no need for Americans to share resources. ""At the same time [Europeans] were creating hostels, American teenagers were focused on getting their own cars,"" Williams said. Nevertheless, Hostelling International reported its hostels in many destination cities saw notable increases in October versus the same time last year: New York overnight guests increased by 9.8 percent, Washington by 9.7 percent and San Diego, California, by 22.1 percent, according to Hostelling International. Despite the rise in many hostel bookings, Williams said hostelling still isn't part of mainstream American culture. ""We do hostelling about as well as we do soccer. We do it, but it's a limited market, and we do it a certain way. Otherwise, most Americans aren't very comfortable [with] it,"" Williams said. Wampach said he believes this represents Americans' ""relatively conservative views and lifestyles."" But people are respectful of each other's space, he said, and they rarely spend time together in the dorm room aside from sleeping anyway. ""You just do your best; everybody understands you are who are,"" Wampach said. ""Sometimes you get a guy who snores but ... that's part of the deal.""","""Flashpackers"" are professionals older than 30 who prefer hostels to hotels .

"(CNN) -- The government is delaying legal action against Pennsylvania landowners who haven't yet agreed to sell their land for a memorial to victims of United Airlines Flight 93 on September 11, 2001, federal officials said Friday. This plot of land is scheduled to house the permanent United Airlines Flight 93 memorial. The government has been negotiating with several landowners since 2003 in an effort to purchase their properties near Shanksville where the hijacked jet crashed into a field, killing everyone aboard. If final efforts at negotiations are unsuccessful, officials intend to use eminent domain to acquire the property. That right allows governments to take private property for public use without an owner's consent, after paying a fair price for the land. The government is seeking to buy 166 acres in western Pennsylvania to complete the area needed to build a memorial on 2,200 acres. ""The (National Park Service) will negotiate with the landowners to reach agreement. If agreement is not reached, eminent domain remains as a backstop to acquire these lands,"" said Kendra Barkoff, spokeswoman for the Department of Interior. See plans for the proposed Flight 93 Memorial . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar and Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pennsylvania, met with landowners and some 9/11 victims' relatives Friday in Somerset County, where the plane crashed into a field. ""The goal remains to finish phase one of the memorial by September 10, 2011,"" Barkoff said. ""We'll try to negotiate with the families, but eminent domain has always been and will continue to be the last resort."" Landowner Randy Musser told CNN he is encouraged that the government is recognizing that the negotiations aren't working. While the threat of eminent domain stills seem to be on the table, ""it finally seems like the lines of communication are open,"" Musser said.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- You haven't experienced Christmas lights until you've seen nearly four miles of them artfully hung in patterns dictated by Tiffany's head designer in Copenhagen's famed historic amusement park, Tivoli Gardens -- and that's not counting the 1,800 strands dramatically draped on the lakeside willows. Salzburg, Austria's Christkindlmarkt is one of Europe's oldest markets. Copenhagen celebrates Jul (as in ""yuletide"") in high style, with its famed Christmas market the centerpiece. Stalls stocked with fine handmade crafts, including traditional figurines of clog-clad elves in pointy red caps, compete for space with vendors selling iced doughnuts slathered with black currant jam and hefty cups of glÃ¸gg, a steaming hot mulled red wine laden with raisins, almonds, cinnamon sticks and cloves -- all of which, for good measure, are steeped in aquavit or schnapps. Christmas in Europe is a time for elaborate pastries straight out of a medieval cookbook, for lyrical midnight masses in Gothic churches and for the upholding of quirky local traditions -- in many countries, Christmas just isn't complete without mischievous pixies, kindly witches (Rome), treacherous demons (Salzburg) or an 8,000-pound fruitcake (Dresden). However else Europeans celebrate the Yuletide season, Christmas still centers around an Advent market that, in most cases, has filled the square before the cathedral each December for hundreds upon hundreds of years. Many markets start on the Friday before Advent, which is four Sundays before Christmas Eve; most end on December 24, especially in Germanic countries, where Christmas Eve is set aside for trimming the tree at home. Others keep celebrating until Epiphany on January 6. Travel+Leisure.com: See Europe's best Christmas markets . These markets are where the romance of the holiday comes alive in grand tradition -- smells of gingerbread and roasting sausages waft through the cold air, handmade ornaments adorn ancient fir trees, master glassblowers and other artisans ply their crafts in wooden stalls, shoppers bustle past Gothic church facades and half-timbered houses, pausing to sip their glÃ¼hwein, heavily spiced and mulled ""glow wine"" -- the piping-hot beverage of choice at any self-respecting Teutonic Christmas market. This is what Christmas should be -- a holiday free of mall Muzak and the frantic need to lay your hands on the superstore's last Tickle Me Xbox. It's an old-world Christmas of heartfelt caroling and wooden toys, where every gift is crafted by hand and Santa hasn't outsourced his workshop to China. For a few precious frost-nipped weeks, these museum-piece cities of Olde World Europe flicker back to the Middle Ages -- not the ossified medieval throwbacks of soot-blackened cathedrals and tourist-bedeviled museums, but the living, breathing yesteryear of a bustling outdoor marketplace. A few practical notes: It's wise to book as far in advance as possible in these Christmas hotspots, especially for trips between December 15 and January 1 and definitely for December 24 and 25. That goes not only for your lodging but also for restaurants, many of which close on Christmas Eve and Day; those that are open usually offer a set-price feast and book up fast with locals.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The White House did not intend to show any disrespect toward Nancy Reagan when it failed to invite the former first lady -- a vigorous supporter of stem-cell research -- to a bill-signing ceremony on the subject, White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Tuesday. Nancy Reagan watches President Obama sign the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act Tuesday. ""I think she speaks in real personal terms about the issue,"" Gibbs told reporters. ""And I think her candor and her courage have been heartening, and we certainly meant no slight to her whatsoever."" On Monday, Vanity Fair published an interview with Nancy Reagan on its Web site in which she suggested the Obama administration missed an opportunity by not inviting her to witness President Obama signing a measure in March expanding federal support for stem-cell research. The former first lady has long promoted such steps despite objections from many in the GOP. She has argued that expanded stem-cell research could have helped her husband, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease. ""I would have gone, and you know I don't like to travel,"" she told the magazine.  Watch more on Gibbs' reaction to the controversy Â» . ""Politically, it would have been a good thing for (Obama) to do. Oh well, nobody's perfect. He called and thanked me for working on it. But he could have gotten more mileage out of it,"" she said. Gibbs' comments also come the same day Mrs. Reagan attended a White House ceremony marking Obama's signing of legislation authorizing a Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission. The 11-member commission will plan activities marking Ronald Reagan's 100th birthday on February 6, 2011.  Watch Obama laud Reagan's optimism Â» . Mrs. Reagan is slated to attend the unveiling of a new statue of President Reagan on Wednesday morning at the Capitol and then share a private White House lunch with first lady Michelle Obama.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- Turn up the music, crack the window -- falling gas prices have flipped on the road-trip ignition switch. The Neptune Pool at Hearst Castle is 104 feet long and 95 feet wide at the alcove. I decided to celebrate the unofficial return of reasonable driving vacations with a venture to the ultimate temple of excess -- Hearst Castle. From Los Angeles, my family and I retraced the journey of Hollywood luminaries who headed north to hang out with publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Clark Gable, Gregory Peck, Carol Lombard and Hearst's mistress Marion Davies all made the trek to what Hearst called ""La Cuesta Encantada,"" or the Enchanted Hill. Winston Churchill and President Calvin Coolidge also rested here amid art and antiquities from around the world. Hearst Castle looks down over golden fields, the glistening Pacific and the town of San Simeon, California, home to less than 500 people. We took a tour bus from the visitors center to the mansion, a long gull's dive from the ocean, 1,610 feet above sea level. Hearst hired San Francisco architect Julia Morgan in 1919 and by 1947 the 165-room estate stretched over 127 acres. It's crystal clear Hearst was a demanding mastermind of his kingdom on the hill, putting Morgan through what must have been agonizing brain twisters. Visitors see that when Hearst wanted European choir chairs wedged into his assembly room, Morgan made it work. When he wanted elaborate ceilings salvaged from Europe, Morgan expanded their reach to fit into the estate's rooms. A massive 95 x 104-foot outdoor swimming pool, made of concrete and Vermont marble, is one of the central jewels of the property. Our guide recounted Hearst house rules. In an effort to control his guests' alcohol consumption, Hearst banned them from bringing their own liquor. The Hollywood types reportedly snuck it in anyway, like frat boys at a football game. Guests stayed in opulent guest houses adorned with religious icons, art and other worldly treasures. Hearst mandated unmarried guests sleep apart, while violating his own edict by sleeping with his beloved actress friend Marion Davies. Though Hearst remained married to Millicent Hearst, with whom he had five children, Davies' ghost is everywhere at Hearst Castle. Images of the actress, along with Charlie Chaplin and others stars, flicker about in a short film shown in the mansion's 50-seat movie theater. Museum-worthy pieces fill the property, including intricate Flemish tapestries in an east-facing sitting room called the Morning Room. Owing to my Belgian roots, I looked at the tapestries and cracked to my kids, ""No wonder my 83-year-old mother can still sew a tiny patch onto a Girl Scout vest."" The castle's grandeur was enough to hold the childrens' attention. We saw them as young as 4 years old, eyes popping while taking in ancient Egyptian statues or towering Christmas trees. ""This guy was rich!"" my friend's 7-year-old-son, Nicolas, exclaimed. Perhaps a headline from Hearst's San Francisco Examiner in another era could best describe our trip: . ""The road to fun is back and affordable!""","William Randolph Hearst entertained Hollywood stars at his estate near San Simeon .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- India's lower house of parliament elected a woman as its speaker Wednesday, a first in the male-dominated chamber's history. Meira Kumar was nominated by the ruling Congress party. Meira Kumar is also a member of the ""untouchable"" Dalit class, the lowest rung in the centuries-old caste system in the country. The speaker conducts the proceedings of the house. She will preside over 543 elected members, of which 58 are women. Kumar, 64, was elected to the position unopposed. She was nominated by the ruling Congress party but also had the backing of the alliance led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Women play a prominent role in the politics of India, the world's largest democracy. The South Asian country of 1.1 billion people has a female president, Pratibha Devisingh Patil. And four of the country's political parties, including the Congress Party, are led by women. Hindus believe there are five main groups of people. The last group is the Dalits. They're considered impure and are often forced to work in menial jobs. They drink from separate wells and use different entry ways to come and go from buildings. Dalits number about 250 million in India, about 25 percent of the population, according to the Colorado, U.S.-based Dalit Freedom Network. India's constitution outlaws caste-based discrimination, and barriers have broken down in large cities. Prejudice, however, persists in some rural areas of the country. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Meira Kumar a member of the Dalit class -- lowest rung in centuries-old caste system .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Do you know your ""futtock"" from your ""baggywrinkle?"" A sailor stands on the ""widow-maker"" -- or bowsprit of his yacht. Don't be concerned if you don't, as they are both relatively obscure terms used in sailing. It is a sport littered with odd words and phrases and MainSail has put together a list of 10 of the weirdest below. They are bound to raise a smile and will certainly make you more knowledgeable on the water -- who knows, you could even impress friends and colleagues with your mastery of obscure nautical terminology. Scuttlebutt The scuttlebutt is a cask on a ship containing the vessel's drinking water. It was named this as the container was traditionally a small barrel, the so-called ""butt,"" which had been ""scuttled"" -- had a hole made in it -- so water could be accessed. As sailors would often gather around the scuttlebutt to chat, the word has also taken on a slang meaning of rumor or gossip. Rollocks A commonly used spelling for ""rowlocks."" These are the spaces cut into the vessel or small clasps raised up from the side of smaller boats that are used to rest oars when the boat is under paddle. Are there any other nautical words you'd like to add? Tell us in the Sound Off box below. Poop deck A poop deck is a deck at the rear of a ship, generally formed by the roof of a cabin. If a wave washes over this deck from behind the vessel, it is said to be ""pooped."" Widow-maker This is a colloquial term for a boat's bowsprit -- the long pole, or ""spar,"" extending from the bow used by sailors to tend to sails. The treacherous bowsprit earned its name and reputation from of the number of sailors who have lost their lives falling from the it. Baggywrinkle This strange-sounding gem is simply a soft covering for ropes aboard yachts that prevent chafing of the sails. Where ropes and lines come into contact with sails there is serious potential for damage to the sail due to the abrasive nature of most rigging. Mainsheet The mainsheet is a rope or line attached to the boom that allows the sailor to control the speed of a boat by adjusting the main sail. Bilge The bilge is the lowest part of the interior of a ship. It marks the spot at the inside-bottom of the hull, below any floorboards, and it sits below the water-line. Futtock Futtocks are the curved timbers used to form the interior ribs on the hulls of wooden ships. Cat-head The cat-head is a large wooden beam that extends from vessels at a 45 degree angle and is used to assist in raising and lowering the anchor. Many cat-heads have had the faces of lions or other large cats carved into them -- however, it's not known if this gave the cat-head its name, or came as a result of the name. Escutcheon The place on the stern of a ship where the boat's name is written is known as the escutcheon.","MainSail lists ten of the strangest and most humorous nautical words .

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- As Britain's Prince Harry neared the end of his second and final day in New York City on Saturday, he described his experiences as ""fantastic."" Prince Harry smiles whilte touring the Harlem Children's Zone on Saturday during a 36-hour visit to New York. The 24-year-old visited the Harlem Children's Zone, a nonprofit organization that offers free programs and classes in a low-income area, then went to Governors Island in New York Harbor to play in the Veuve Clicquot Manhattan Polo Classic. Profits from the match will benefit Sentebale, a charity for orphans in Lesotho, Africa, a cause Harry's mother, Princess Diana, had promoted. The prince was accompanied by Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, who also lost his mother when he was young. The men toured the Children's Zone with founder Geoffrey Canada, and spent time in a classroom where some students were studying for a math test. A 10-year-old girl sitting at a desk covered with drawing paper and colored markers gave Harry a picture. ""Is this for me?"" Harry asked as he accepted it. Pointing to the desk and pens, he then asked, ""You find yourself very lucky to have all this?"" When she nodded, he replied ""Good."" A young boy gave Harry a bowl containing a dish he had prepared, and the prince ate it while the child sounded off the ingredients. Throughout the classroom visit, the prince smiled and chatted easily with students.  Watch Soledad O'Brien's report on the Children's Zone Â» . Cheering people lined the street as Harry entered the building. As he left, reporters shouted questions. Asked how he liked his first official visit overseas and meeting the children, the prince responded, ""It's been fantastic -- really, really worthwhile."" ""It's my first visit to New York. I'm hopeful I'll come back to visit again."" He also was asked whether he thought his appearances would change any image the public might have of him, apparently referring to some of his wild exploits ways when he was younger. Those incidents included a one-day stint in drug rehab in 2002 and accusations of racism in January. ""I don't know what the image is of me. There is always the image that's been given to me, but people have their own opinions, it's the media that likes to stamp on the image which isn't really me."" On Friday, the youngest son of Princess Diana offered his condolences to September 11 victims at the former site of the World Trade Center. The prince met New York Gov. David Paterson and briefly spoke with family members of 9/11 victims. The prince then laid a wreath at the site and bowed his head in a moment of silence.  Watch Prince Harry's visit to Ground Zero Â» . He left a handwritten note tacked to the wreath, citing an ""the courage shown by the people"" of New York on September 11, 2001. Harry later paid tribute to his fellow citizens at Lower Manhattan's British Garden at Hanover Square, where he honored the 67 British victims of the September 11 attacks, officials said. The third in line for the British crown, Harry is active in the British Army. He received a promotion to lieutenant in April 2008 and is currently training for an Army Air Corps pilot position, according to the prince's Web site.","Prince Harry visits a nonprofit that offers free programs and classes in Harlem .

"(CNN) -- Cynde Strand, CNN's Beijing camerawoman during the crisis, had spent night after night in Tiananmen Square, amidst a heap of trash, leaning on her ladder, her head over her camera, just waiting for something to happen. Cynde Strand: ""I just knew this was the day it was going to end."" If she was really exhausted, she'd lay plastic over the trash and cat-nap on that. ""Every night I would stay there,"" she recalled. ""Every night there'd be rumors that the troops were coming, or they weren't coming. And then there were all those kids we had gotten to know,"" she said about the demonstrators. ""Some days I'd start around 5 and just stay the whole night,"" she said. ""The sun would come up and I would just ache. But I knew I wanted to be there when it happened."" She and Mike Chinoy, both based in Beijing and both keen watchers of the Chinese leadership, shared the feeling that the situation was going to end badly. The Chinese had been deeply embarrassed by the demonstrators during the visit of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, they reasoned, and the students were still occupying Tiananmen Square, although their numbers had dwindled.  See photos of the CNN team in Tiananmen Square in 1989 Â» . In their minds, the Chinese leadership just would not stand for that. And Strand had a feeling that whatever was going to happen was going to happen at night, when energy levels were low. ""That Saturday (June 3), I just knew this was the day it was going to end,"" she said. ""That peaceful people-power picnic sit-in was gone. There was anger, rock-throwing behind the Great Hall of the People. The tension was much higher."" And then Strand and her team got word of troops coming towards the giant square. And then kids started running into one side of the square with bodies. ""I got everybody together and said, 'okay, this is it,'"" she recalled. ""'If you don't want to stay, you can go. You don't have to stay here with me, but you have to leave now.'"" She and soundman Kit Swartz stayed in the square for that entire historic night, determined to witness history. ""Bullets were whizzing overhead and then about 3 or 4 in the morning, they turned all the lights off,"" she said. ""Troops started pouring out of Mao's mausoleum, different troops came out from under Mao's portrait. Tanks moved in. By early morning, they had taken over the square and crushed that tent city."" Strand didn't get to film much that overnight of June 4. It was dark, she and Swartz took shelter behind public bathrooms for awhile, and the most dramatic images she had managed to film had gone with producer Donna Liu back to the CNN bureau. Strand had no idea what had happened to the tapes. And no one at CNN knew what had happened to her and Kit. Her walkie-talkie battery was long dead and nobody had cellphones then. From CNN's base at the Beijing Hotel, the square, she knew, ""looked like hell, with buses on fire, APCs [armed personnel carriers] on fire and the Goddess of Democracy statue backlit by the fires burning on the road."" Daytime broke. Chinese troops controlled the square. Strand and Swartz needed to get back to the CNN bureau. They flagged down a flat-bed rickshaw driver, who pedaled them and their gear to the Beijing Hotel. As they arrived, journalists leaned out of the hotel windows, begging to hear what had happened overnight. She walked into the CNN bureau. She and Chinoy looked at each other. She could see the palpable relief on his face. ""It was one of those moments,"" she recalled, ""just a deep connection between us. It said: 'We knew it was coming, and we survived it.'""

"(CNN) -- A man shot and killed his wife and two of their children and then killed himself in central Florida on Sunday night, authorities said. Troy Ryan Bellar shot and killed his wife, Wendy, and two of their children, sheriff's officials say. Troy Ryan Bellar, 34, used a high-powered rifle with a scope to shoot his 31-year-old wife, Wendy, when she tried to leave their home, the Polk County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Two of the couple's children -- 5-month-old Zack and 7-year-old Ryan -- also were killed, but a 13-year-old got away, with the father chasing and firing after him, officials said. ""It is beyond my understanding why a man would shoot and kill his 5-month-old baby boy, his 7-year-old baby boy, try to kill his 13-year-old son, shoot his wife and then turn the gun on himself,"" said Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd. ""There is no explanation for that."" The shootings happened in Lakeland, Florida, just east of Tampa. When the shooting began, the couple's son, Nathan, ran out of the house and down the street -- with his dad chasing him through the garage and firing several shots, authorities said. Nathan was unhurt and will be placed with family members. Investigators do not know what led to the shooting, but believe it was preceded by ""some kind of domestic disturbance,"" a statement from the sheriff's office said. Bellar was arrested twice in Polk County: for aggravated assault in 1994, and for driving under the influence in 1999. His wife was arrested in March for battery domestic violence.","Bodies of gunman, wife, 2 children found at Lakeland, Florida, home, officials say .

"(CNN) -- Two U.S. lawmakers have urged U.S. Army Secretary Peter Geren to recognize 350 American soldiers held as slaves by Nazi Germany during World War II, saying ""these heroes have not received the recognition and honor they deserve."" Bernard ""Jack"" Vogel died in a Nazi slave camp in the arms of a fellow U.S. soldier, Anthony Acevedo, in 1945. ""As Anthony Acevedo, one of the soldiers chosen, recently described to CNN, the Nazis picked those soldiers who looked Jewish, had a Jewish name or were considered 'undesirable,' "" Reps. Joe Baca, D-California, and Spencer Bachus, R-Alabama, said in a letter sent to Geren last week. ""The trials and sacrifices made by those detained have largely gone unrecognized even to this day. As proud Americans, we wish to recognize and honor them for their service."" Both congressmen have pushed for a congressional resolution to honor the 350 soldiers held at Berga an der Elster, a subcamp of Buchenwald where dozens of American soldiers were beaten, starved and killed. Baca and Bachus say they will continue to fight for the resolution.  Listen as Acevedo tells brother of victim: ""I had him in my arms"" Â» . Army spokesman Paul Boyce told CNN that the Army is in the process of responding to the congressional letter. ""The U.S. Army has recognized hundreds of thousands of veterans of World War II and has expressed interest in this group's history to see what could be done,"" he said. Anthony Acevedo was a 20-year-old medic when he was sent to Berga with the other soldiers in February 1945. Acevedo kept a diary that details the day-to-day events inside the camp and lists the names and prisoner numbers of men as they died or were executed.  Open up the pages of Acevedo's diary Â» . The soldiers were put on a forced death march in April 1945 as American troops neared. For much of that march, Acevedo pushed a wooden cart with emaciated men inside. Many of them died. ""More of our men died, so fast that you couldn't keep track of their numbers,"" Acevedo wrote on April 19, 1945, four days before he was liberated by advancing U.S. troops. Asked what it would mean if the U.S. Army officially recognized the soldiers of Berga six decades later, Acevedo, now 84, wept. ""This is for all the fellas,"" he said. Norman Fellman, another Berga survivor, was one of the men on the wooden cart pushed by Acevedo so many years ago. He said that wounded men and corpses were stacked on top of him -- and that he believed he could survive just one more day when he was liberated on April 23, 1945. ""There's a certain amount of pain involved when the country you serve fails to acknowledge the conditions under which you were kept,"" Fellman told CNN. There are only 12 known Berga survivors still living. It is difficult to ascertain exactly how many of the 350 U.S. soldiers died in captivity and on the subsequent death march. CNN has cross-checked a list of the names of 70 dead soldiers provided to the U.S. War Department after the war with the names of the dead listed in Acevedo's diary.  Watch as a soldier's diary sheds light on atrocities Â» . It appears the death toll was well over 100, roughly one in three soldiers. Acevedo says that more than 300 U.S. soldiers were alive at the start of the march, and that about 165 were left by the end. He says he was unable to keep track of the dead in the final days because soldiers were dying too fast. ""At Berga, captured soldiers were forced to endure inhumane conditions and suffer from the Nazi policy of physical destruction through labor,"" Baca and Bachus said in their letter to Geren. ""Over 100 American soldiers either died at Berga or on the death march from the camp -- the highest number of American fatalities at any German camp."" The two Berga commanders -- Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz -- were tried for war crimes and initially sentenced to die by hanging. But the U.S. government commuted their death sentences in 1948, and both men were eventually set free in the 1950s. U.S. soldiers who survived captivity were interviewed by the U.S. Military Intelligence Service in Europe after they were liberated. Before they were sent home, they signed a document that instructed them to never speak about their captivity. ""Some activities of American prisoners of war within German prison camps must remain secret not only for the duration of the war against the present enemies of the United States but in peace-time as well,"" the document says. ""The interests of American prisoners of war in the event of future wars, moreover, demand that the secrets of this war be vigorously safeguarded."" When Acevedo finally returned home, little had prepared him for his own father's reaction. ""My dad told me I was a coward,"" he said. Baca and Bachus said men like Acevedo deserve the respect of the nation: ""We are writing to you to encourage the Department of the Army to acknowledge the heroism and sacrifice of those soldiers held captive at Berga in a manner appropriate for their service. It would be an honor well-deserved for the remaining survivors and the many colleagues that have gone before them.""

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- Tensions eased in the northern Indian state of Punjab on Tuesday, following widespread violence across the region after a Sikh guru was shot to death and another was wounded at an Indian temple in Vienna, Austria. Sikh demonstrators brandish sticks as they shout slogans during a protest in Amritsar. The situation was tense, but under control, Punjab's inspector general of police said Tuesday morning. The army and federal security forces were called in to restore order, added inspector general Parag Jain. Thousands took part in demonstrations across the Doaba region, where protesters attacked public transportation, knocking out train service in some areas. They also blocked a national highway to Jammu, CNN sister network CNN-IBN reported. A number of businesses were ransacked as well. Police reported one death. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, himself a Sikh, appealed for calm, in a statement. ""There is no place for violence in a secular society like India's and certainly no excuse whatsoever for the violation of the sacred premises of a (Sikh temple) for narrow sectarian or other purposes,"" India's Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. Killed in Sunday's attack in Vienna was 57-year-old Sant Rama Nand. A second guru, Sant Niranjan Dass, 68, was seriously injured. His health has improved noticeably, according to the Indian Embassy, the Austria News Agency reported. Fifteen others were also wounded. ""Sant Niranjan Dass is doing well,"" the embassy said. ""He could soon be released from the hospital."" Six people were arrested in connection with the attack, which occurred Sunday afternoon in Vienna's 15th district, police spokesman Schwaig Hofar told CNN. One suspect shot the two gurus, and five other attackers wielding knives assaulted people in the congregation during prayer, Hofar said. Four of the wounded were suspects, two of them in serious condition, he said. About 150 people were in the room when the violence took place, he said. Authorities are investigating what triggered the attacks, but Austrian Interior Minister Maria Fekter said Sikhs have lived ""exceptionally peacefully"" in Austria. CNN's Ben Brumfeld and Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","Tensions ease in Punjab after widespread violence over Sikh guru's death .

"LONDON (England) -- CNN -- When CSKA Moscow lifted the UEFA Cup in 2005, becoming the first Russian team to win a European trophy, manager Valeri Gazzaev described it as ""a landmark victory for Russian football."" Andrei Arshavin has become Russia's first football superstar since the Soviet era. Three years later, Zenit St Petersburg matched the achievement a month before the Russian national team reached the semifinals of Euro 2008. After years on the margins, Russian football was back in the limelight. Jonathan Wilson, author of ""Behind the Curtain, Travels in Eastern European Football,"" told CNN that recent successes mark a renaissance of Russian football. A far-cry from the early years after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when teams previously funded by state bodies -- such as the police force or the army -- were left chronically short of money. Wilson said that under communist rule Spartak Moscow had been funded by a trade union representing catering workers and were less directly dependant on state support than other Russian clubs. Consequently, when the Russian Premier League was formed in 1992, Spartak found themselves in a better position than many of their rivals and stormed on to win nine of the first 10 titles up for grabs. See photos of Russia's post-Soviet football stars. Â» . While Spartak flourished, the rest of the division remained in desperate need of money; that is, until a new source of funding came in the shape of Russia's rising force of oligarchs -- men who had amassed fortunes buying cheap but highly profitable energy companies . These oligarchs and energy corporations now play a vital role in funding the game. Zenit St Petersburg is backed by Gazprom, the world's biggest producer and exporter of natural gas and Spartak Moscow has oil and gas company Lukoil as its primary sponsor. CSKA Moscow's 2005 UEFA Cup triumph was financed by Sibneft, whose majority shareholder at the time was Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich, currently the 51st richest man in the world according to Forbes.com. Abramovich's cash meant the club could afford to sign quality foreign players, including Brazilian internationals Daniel Carvalho and the free-scoring Vagner Love. Other examples of imported talent includes Dynamo Moscow's signing of Champions League winners Maniche and Costinha from FC Porto in 2005, and Zenit St Petersburg capturing Portuguese midfielder Danny for a reported  league record of $40 million. There are so many foreign players in Russia that Premier League regulations now limit clubs to fielding no more than six foreign players at a time. What are your views of Russian football? Sound off below. But the injection of money into the Russian game isn't only useful for buying foreign talent, Wilson says the national game is also having a revival because of the oligarchs' money. Abramovich funds Russia's National Football Academy, which, along with providing plastic pitches and coaches for young footballers, is also responsible for paying the wages of national team coach Guus Hiddink. Dutchman Hiddink led Russia to the semifinals of Euro 2008, with the team having never made it past the first round of international competition prior to his appointment in 2006. Marc Bennetts, author of ""Football Dynamo"", about the state of Russian football, is based in Moscow. He told CNN that Hiddink's arrival was a turning point in the national team's fortunes. ""Hiddink really shook up the national football team. He left out some of the veterans and began picking players who were young and fresh, like Andrei Arshavin and Roman Pavlyuchenko,"" he said. In Arshavin Russia has found its first football superstar since the Soviet era. He signed for English club Arsenal in February 2009 and has made an instant impact in the English Premier League. Bennetts says one cloud on the horizon is that Russian football's dependence on energy companies means the global economic crisis and low oil prices could have a negative impact on the sport. But if the oligarchs keep supplying the Roubles, there's no reason why Russian football won't continue to blossom.","Recent UEFA Cup successes mark a ""new era"" for Russian football .

"ARLINGTON, Virginia (CNN) -- For the past few years, Dan Redmond has been on a mission to change the way his household uses energy. Dan Redmond uses an electric bicycle with a trailer to run errands. As concerns about global warming and rising energy costs grow, many families like the Redmonds are looking for ways to change the way they use energy. Three years ago Redmond began embracing solar energy to power his suburban Washington home. And he's not alone in turning to the sun for energy. The Solar Energy Industries Association estimates there are about 250,000 homes in the United States with some sort of solar power, although not all of them have taken the concept as far as the Redmonds. Last year, 13,000 homes installed solar power. ""We're just making different decisions about how we live our life,"" Redmond said, ""And what's important to us as well, as being able to show our two boys that when they grow up they're going to need to know to be more flexible in most parts of their life and they're going to need to be adaptable."" Redmond's excitement about solar energy has changed his family's daily routine and also saved money -- he paid $28.61 for electricity last month compared with $150 a month last year. The biggest change came when Redmond put solar panels on the roof of his 1925 bungalow, which he shares with his wife, Margaret McGilvray, and the couple's two young sons. The system, which still allows the family to use energy from the traditional power grid when the sun is not shining, uses what is known as net-metering. No electricity is stored in the house. Energy produced in excess of what is needed is fed back to the power grid, effectively making the Redmonds' electric meter run backward. Twelve panels on the roof feed power to a device in the basement called an inverter. The solar power system cost $23,000 after a $2,000 tax credit. Redmond estimates that the system will pay for itself in 10 to 15 years. ""As we know, our power rates are going up."" He said ""So it probably will take less because that number is based on what we're paying right now. ""About 80 percent of our power is used with the solar panels."" Redmond says. To get that kind of benefit, though, the family greatly cut the amount of energy they use. ""We've made a real effort to reduce how much electricity we need to use in the first place, which is much less expensive to do than to produce energy that you're wasting inside of your home."" The biggest lifestyle change is as low-tech as the solar panels are high-tech -- the family uses a clothesline to dry its laundry. ""It's OK just to simply hang your lines ... and not use your dryer,"" says Redmond, who cut his electric bill by 15 to 20 percent by ditching the dryer. ""That to me would be the very first thing anybody should do in terms of conserving electricity for their home."" Redmond cooks using a solar oven, a small appliance that uses four reflectors, to heat food in Redmond's front yard. The device uses only solar power and leaves no carbon footprint. Richmond says he can heat food to about 350 degrees in his solar oven, but the stove's manufacture says it can heat food up to 400 degrees. On the days when the sun is not shining, the family uses their traditional oven powered from electricity provided by the power grid. The family also uses a small array of solar panels to charge iPods and cell phones. Whenever possible, Redmond runs errands on an electric bicycle that pulls a small trailer. Every little bit helps keep their power bill low. Redmond works from home as a photographer, and McGilvray telecommutes as a consultant for IBM. The couple decided that since they spend a lot of time in their 1,400-square-foot home, and not much time on the road, their best option for saving energy was the solar panels. ""We had several years of back and forth consternation. Should we buy the Prius? Should we get the solar panels?"" Redmond said. ""What we decided is, opposed to spending that same amount of money on a hybrid, let's offset what we're using for our home and business from our roof. ... This would make much more difference in how we live."" For Redmond, it's not just about the money. ""It was more about what we thought was important for ourselves and the decisions we're making for our family,"" he said. Yet he does look forward to many years of lower power bills. ""This system that we have on our roof is going to last 30 years, which will put me into my 70s,"" he said. ""That's a lot of free energy.""","Solar power cuts family's monthly electricity bill from $150 to under $30 .

"MBOLA, Tanzania (CNN)  -- Moved by a 2007 trip to Ghana, singer/songwriter John Legend joined the fight to end extreme poverty in his lifetime. And based on his experiences in poor, rural areas of Africa, he says, real change is possible. John Legend says ""Mama"" Mwadawa Ruziga's role in uplifting her community inspired him. ""I don't want people to only see Africa as a bunch of victims,"" Legend says. ""The people that I've come across in these extremely impoverished villages, they want to work. They want to participate in their own development."" To help people lift themselves out of poverty, Legend founded the Show Me Campaign, named after one of his songs. Partnering with economist Jeffrey Sachs' Millennium Promise organization, Legend's group adopted Mbola, a remote village in Tanzania that has little access to drinking water and improved farming techniques, according to Millennium Promise. ""The folks in Mbola are starting at a supreme disadvantage. Most of them are living on less than a dollar a day,"" Legend says. ""It's difficult for them to even survive."" On his 2007 visit to Mbola, Legend met ""Mama"" Mwadawa Ruziga, a single mother of two who was freeing herself from poverty. Her entrepreneurial spirit impressed Legend and solidified his belief that sustainable development at the community level can work in the fight against poverty. Ruziga leads a local business collective that sells products -- like wine, jam and juice -- that it makes out of indigenous fruits. ""I was really inspired by her willingness to not just wait for a handout, but really take an active role in helping to uplift her community,"" he says. Through the Show Me Campaign, Legend has pledged to raise $1.5 million over five years to support programs similar to Ruziga's that are aimed at alleviating poverty in Mbola. But this is not just about cutting a check, he says. ""You can always go in and bring an influx of money and address things temporarily. But if development's not sustainable, then something's wrong,"" Legend says. ""This is about teaching them how to farm better, improving the education system, getting water pumps. The idea is that [the community] will continue to sustain themselves over time."" Before joining her collective, Ruziga, 47, says her life was at an all-time low. For years, she suffered through malaria and droughts. ""The only thing I did was farming, then I would just sit idle with nothing to do. But after joining the group, my life changed for the better, slowly by slowly,"" Ruziga says. In addition to agricultural processing, Ruziga's group focuses on horticulture and tree planting. Ruziga herself has been instrumental to the success of the group, traveling to trade shows in the Tanzanian cities of Tabora and Dar es Salaam to sell their products. ""Our group has spread to other areas of Tanzania, and we've experienced great success because many people have come to know about us,"" Ruziga says.  Watch Legend talk about meeting Ruziga, and see her group making products Â» . Six different villages have adopted the group's successful model. ""I think she's a great example of someone who's given the tools to succeed, having the energy, having the follow-through, having the leadership skills to go ahead and do it,"" Legend says. Not only has Ruziga's group changed her own life, but other members' lives have also improved. This is the first time that some of them have ever earned an income. ""Now they are more educated than before,"" Ruziga says. ""The group provides them with a platform to exchange and explore ideas, and the revenue collected enables the members to cater for their basic needs."" Ruziga believes that the future depends on women taking an active role in their future and says her community is happy with the help and encouragement Legend offers them. For Legend, Ruziga's passion is inspiring and motivating.  Watch Legend visit with Ruziga and her group during his trip to Mbola Â» .

"(CNN) -- The Irrawaddy, one of the world's rarest species of freshwater dolphins, have been found in surprisingly large numbers deep in the waterlogged jungles of Bangladesh. The Irrawaddy is considered to be one of the world's rarest species of freshwater dolphin. Conservationists thought the Irrawaddy had dwindled in number to just a few hundred, but they have now counted almost 6,000 of them in the Sundarban mangrove forests and the adjacent waters of the Bay of Bengal. The forests of the Sundarban -- Bengali for ""beautiful forest"" -- lie at the delta of the Ganges and two other rivers on the Bay of Bengal. Until now, little mammal research had taken place in the area. ""Every time we had done a study to look into the population (elsewhere), they came out critically endangered,"" said Brian Smith of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, who led the study. ""It was a very pleasant surprise and a shock to find that Bangladesh supports such a large number (of dolphins)."" The discovery is noteworthy because scientists do not know how many Irrawaddy dolphins remain. The next step, they say, is to ensure the mammal's survival. One rare dolphin species -- the Yangtze River dolphin, or baiji -- is extinct. Another, the Ganges River dolphin, is critically endangered. Some of the threats affecting the Irrawaddy are man-made. The construction of dams has reduced the flow of fresh water in many parts of Bangladesh. And the population is dwindling because the dolphins sometimes get caught in fishermen's nets. The dolphin, which has a large, rounded head, can grow up to 8 feet in length and is related to the orca, or killer whale. It is found in large rivers, estuaries and freshwater lagoons in south and southeast Asia. In Myanmar, the dolphins help herd schools of fish toward fishermen's boats and nets. In Bangladesh, fishermen hold them in high regard, Smith said. ""There is no market for dolphin products,"" he said. ""In a country like Bangladesh, with protein deficiency and where food is scarce, there is a real cultural prohibition against harming them. It gives us hope because it means fishermen are very receptive to working with us."" The results of the study were shared Wednesday at a conference for marine mammal protected areas in Hawaii, and published in the winter issue of the Journal of Cetacean Research and Management. Conservationists are now working with the Bangladesh government to establish a protected area for the dolphins. ""There are so many bad news (stories) coming out of the conservation community that this is a real sort of positive story,"" Smith said.","Rare species of freshwater dolphins found in Bangladesh's waterlogged jungles .

"(CNN) -- Walking through an Albuquerque park a passerby made a startling discovery -- a tiny black and lime shoe protruding from beneath the playground sand. Police say this shirt was found on the boy, dubbed ""Baby Justice"" or ""Baby Angel."" It led police to the body of a young boy, who had been buried there in a shallow grave less than 48 hours earlier. That was Friday. On Tuesday, police still had no answers as to what happened at Alvarado Park -- or even who the boy was. His name is unknown, though the community has dubbed him ""Baby Justice"" or ""Baby Angel."" Nobody in the area has claimed his body and nobody has reported a child of his age missing. Police said they couldn't even show a photo or give a sketch of the boy because his body was so disfigured by the sand's heat. All they have is a description based on how they found him. Police say the Native American or Hispanic boy was between 3 and 5 years old, 38 pounds, 38 inches in height, with brown eyes and dark quarter-inch hair. When he was found, he was wearing Arizona brand clothing, size 3T -- nylon black running pants with red stripes, a red shirt with a monster truck on it and black, gray and lime green Skechers sneakers. Police aren't sure how he died. Albuquerque Police Department Spokesman John Walsh said a preliminary autopsy didn't reveal a cause of death. Walsh said there were no obvious signs of bruising on the boy.  Watch where boy was found buried Â» . Walsh said the department is working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to create a forensic reconstruction of what the boy may have looked like in hopes that someone will recognize him. ""We have canvassed the entire adjoining neighborhood,"" Walsh said. ""We're knocking on every door. We've been broadcasting and pleading for tips from the community. But still, nobody has come forward.""  Watch authorities discuss boy in the sand case Â» . Though police have received numerous tips from the public, Walsh said nothing has come from them. Albuquerque police are working with other local, state and nationwide law enforcement officials to try to piece together what happened. Until then, members of the community have spent hours at memorials for the boy -- who none of them knew -- praying for him and raising money. French Mortuary, in the town, has offered to pay all funeral costs for the boy. Resident Rachel Lesperance told CNN affiliate KOAT-TV she spent her weekend collecting $3,600 for the boy. Her money, and the donations raised by others, will go toward a plaque at the park in the boy's honor, buying extra lights for the playground and to a fund toward finding out what happened to the little ""Baby Justice."" ""He doesn't have a family,"" Lesperance told KOAT-TV. ""We're his family now and we want him to be taken care of like one of our own.""","Boy found Friday at Alvarado Park buried under sand in playground .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Truly appreciating the beauty of Paris is a pleasure that can't be hurried. Stop, breathe, appreciate and perhaps kiss in the romantic city of Paris. Take time to wander down its wide boulevards, savour every sip of strong, black coffee and resist the temptation to fall into step with the throng of tourists and sightseers. Our advice to anyone who finds themselves with 24 hours to spare in the French capital is to stop, breathe, appreciate and indulge. Start the day with a walk down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. For some, it retains the title of the world's most beautiful avenue. For others, the road's historical charm has been blighted by the arrival of global brands, traffic and tourists. Sunrise offers the history without the hurry. Take a leisurely stroll down its expansive pavements and look up for impressive architecture without fear of bumping into shoppers. Treat yourself to breakfast at one of Paris' oldest tea salons. LadurÃ©e was founded as a family business in 1862 and now appears in luxurious locales in London, Monaco, Switzerland and Japan. The original, LadurÃ©e Royale on Rue Royale, doesn't open until 8:30am (and later on Sundays), so for early morning pastries drop into the Champs-Elysees store which opens at 7:30am every day. The queues at Paris' most famous art gallery, the Louvre, are notorious so impatient visitors are advised to go to the MusÃ©e de l'Orangerie, set in the historic Jardin des Tuileries. You won't see the Mona Lisa, but the gallery does boast a collection of Claude Monet's Water Lilies. The queues are shorter the earlier you go and to really beat the crowds pre-book your time slot online. Head north to have your own images sketched by street artists in Montmartre, a former stomping ground for famous names including Salvador Dali, Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso and Vincent van Gogh. Drop into the Basilique du SacrÃ© Coeur to pray, light a candle or simply enjoy the spectacular views over Paris. From there, visit Rue Lepic where you will find CafÃ© des Deux Moulins, where actress Audrey Tautou waited tables in the 2001 film ""AmÃ©lie."" Note that when you ask for a coffee in France, you'll automatically receive a black espresso. If you'd like something bigger and milkier, ask for a cafÃ© au lait (already popular elsewhere) or cafÃ© Americain (filter coffee) with milk (lait). Further down Rue Lepic you'll find Au Virage Lepic, a quaint bistro dripping in traditional Parisian atmosphere. It's usually crowded with locals so book in advance. Getting around is easy in Paris. Take a bus or the Metro or join the legion of cyclists on hugely popular VÃ©lib rental bikes. Pick up your own bike at one of the service points scattered around the city. You'll need a credit card to register for a one-day subscription, or to speed up the process pre-book a one-day ticket online. It'll cost you one euro and the first 30 minutes of every journey for the next 24 hours is free. After than, any additional time will be charged to your credit card until you return the bike to any stand in the city. In the afternoon, walk -- or cycle -- down Boulevard Saint-Germain on the historic Left Bank. Discover your inner intellectual over a coffee or dinner at Les Deux Magots, a former meeting place for Paris' great literary minds including Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre. From Boulevard Saint-Germain, walk down Rue Saint-Sulpice, past Saint-Sulpice, a striking church founded in the 1646 and brought to a new audience as one of the buildings featured in Dan Brown's best-selling novel (and subsequent film) ""The Da Vinci Code."" Wander further on to Rue de SÃ¨vres where you can batter your credit card with some upmarket shopping at Le Bon MarchÃ© and La Grand Epicerie. In the evening, soak up some Parisian chic at the De La Ville CafÃ© on Boulevard Bonne Nouvelle, or indulge in the opulence of Hotel Costes on Rue Saint-Honore. Both serve food and close at 2am. Treat yourself to a glass of champagne and start planning your next sojourn in Paris!","It's difficult to truly appreciate Paris with one eye on your watch, so slow down!
Wander through its historic areas, still popular with artists and intellectuals .
Treat yourself to breakfast at LadurÃ©e, end the day with champagne ."
