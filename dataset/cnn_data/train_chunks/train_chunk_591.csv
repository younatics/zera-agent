Marijuana in a pill may work ever better as a pain reliever than the smoked form and with fewer harmful side-effects, say experts. New research, carried out by Columbia University in New York, could undermine the burgeoning U.S. medical marijuana market, which is now estimated to be worth $1.3 billion and expected to reach $9billion in the next three years. The drug is commonly used by patients suffering with cancer, multiple sclerosis and other painful conditions. Marijuana in a pill may work ever better as a pain reliever than the smoked form and with fewer harmful side-effect . The findings could undermine the burgeoning U.S. medical marijuana market, which is now estimated to be worth $1.3 billion . In the UK, Sativex, a cannabis-derived mouth spray, has been licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, but it remains difficult for patients to obtain because many NHS trusts refuse to prescribe it due to its cost. In the new trial of 30 men and women, some smoked the drug, . others took the active chemical in a pill called dronabinol and the rest . took a placebo, according to a report in Medical News Today. Dronabinol contains the active ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known as THC. THC helps block signals from nerve endings reaching the brain which in turn inhibits pain. Participants were asked to place their hands in ice cold water and then timed to find out how long it took to feel pain and how long the individual could keep their hands submerged. Results showed that both the smokers and those taking the pill were able to withstand pain for longer. But most surprisingly, those who took dronabinol were able to endure pain longer than smokers taking the drug in the traditional manner. And while smoking the drug decreased pain sensitivity for two and a half hours, the pill continued to provide pain-reducing effects for over four hours. Medical marijuana requires a special card to show that their condition warrants the use of the drug. People who took the dronabinol pill were able to endure pain longer than those who smoked marijuana . However, the analgesic effect of the . pill took much longer to work – dronabinol took an hour compared with . just 15 minutes for smoking the drug. Those who took part in the study also reported that they found the effects of dronabinol less pleasurable, compared with people who smoked cannabis, suggesting that the pill has less potential for abuse. Medical marijuana is legal in 18 . U.S. states, and recent research has suggested that the majority of Americans . believe the drug should be legalised. The research carried out by PewResearch Centre for People and the Press showed . that for the first time in 40 years 52 per cent said it should be . legalised and 72 per cent saying the crackdown on the drug is not worth . the money it costs the government. Marijuana contains the chemical tetrahydrocannabinol which has been clinically proven to reduce pain . The same poll showed that nearly half of Americans admitted to having tried marijuana at some point in their lifetime. The new findings suggest a marijuana pill 'can produce analgesic effects for longer without the health risks that come along with smoking,' said study researcher Ziva Cooper, an assistant professor of clinical neurobiology at Columbia University's Department of Psychiatry. However, she added that more research is needed to confirm the results. Because the study involved healthy  people, it's not clear if those suffering with chronic pain would experience the same effect from the pill. Previous studies have shown that smoking cannabis helps reduce general pain, nerve pain, improve sleep and mood.","The pill dronabinol blocks pain for two hours longer than smoking marijuana .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . UPDATED: . 02:23 EST, 11 October 2011 . This sorry sight is the result of mindless vandalism which police are calling a 'crime against our Armed Forces'. The First World War memorial was knocked over on Friday night, leaving lumps of stone scattered across the grass where people would normally stand to pay their respects. Villagers in Prestbury, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where the structure has stood proudly since 1920, have placed a £1,000 bounty on the heads of those responsible. No respect: The shattered remains of the First World War memorial in Prestbury, Gloucestershire, lay strewn across the grass. The monument carries the names of 41 dead servicemen on six plaques . They are now desperately trying to raise funds to get the structure repaired in time for Remembrance Sunday on November 13. Sergeant Mark Stephens, from Gloucestershire Constabulary, said the cost of the damage could be as much as £5,000. He said: 'This is a crime against the men and women of our Armed Forces who have in the past, and continue in the present day, to pay the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country to ensure the freedom and liberty we all enjoy. 'This will have a significant impact on not only the residents of Prestbury, but also the wider Cheltenham community. 'It is particularly poignant as we are so close to Remembrance Sunday when a great many people attend the Prestbury service held at the memorial to honour those who have fallen in service of our country. 'You can rest assured that I will ensure every possible line of inquiry is fully investigated to determine how this damage occurred and, if it were malicious, to bring those responsible before the courts.' Manhunt: Police gather evidence from the scene. They want to speak to three people seen taking photographs of the memorial around 30 minutes before the vandalism was reported . The memorial carries the names of 41 servicemen killed in the 1914-18 war on six plaques. It was built in April 1920 using donations from villagers in place of a tree used as a gift-giving spot for children. Outraged businessman Terry Croft, 44, has put up a £1,000 reward to catch the vandals. Mr Croft, from Prestbury, said: 'I think I know the sort of person who would have done something as shocking as this and for the circles in which they operate, this sort of offer should have some impact. 'Money always talks and if it brings somebody forward who has information to help catch whoever did this, it will be well spent.' A dog walker reported . seeing a woman and two men taking pictures of the memorial - dedicated . to the parish's war dead - shortly before it was destroyed. Police want to speak to three white people, aged 18 to 25, in connection with the incident. They . were between 5ft 6in and 5ft 9in tall, dressed in jeans and anoraks, at . about 11.20pm - 30 minutes before the vandalism was reported. It is not known whether the memorial can be repaired or replaced for Armistice Day. Poignant: The vandalism comes just weeks before the village marks Remembrance Day in honour of those who have died in conflicts since the First World War . Prestbury Parish Council will debate the matter at a meeting tonight. Malcolm Stennett, parish council chairman, said: 'It's really horrendous. 'It's terrible when you think that our troops are out fighting at the moment, getting killed and injured, and people are going around desecrating a war memorial. 'It must show an extremely low intellect and I hope the police are able to bring the culprits to book.' The Reverend Daniel Papworth, of north Cheltenham team ministry, added: 'It is sad and distressing to see the damage and local people are understandably shocked.'","Vandals strike as village prepares to honour war dead .

An 83-year-old Turkish tailor has inadvertently become a worldwide style phenomenon after capturing the attention of a photographer who has shared his eclectic outfits online. Father of 18, Ali, who has lived in Berlin for 44 years, walks past a cafe in the German capital every morning where Zoe Spawton works. The 29-year-old was captivated by the octogenarian's sense of style. Every morning, he walked past her in a different dapper outfit including double breasted suits in a variety of colours, matching camouflage jacket and trousers and a leather hooded jacket. Dapper Dad: Father of 18 Ali in three of his stylish suits (he claims to own more than 80) Each time he wore a hat befitting his clothing from a woolly beanie to a baseball cap or trilby. Australian-born Zoe explained: 'Ali walks past the cafe I work at in Berlin every morning at 9.05am. I’m not sure where he is going, but we always say hello to each other. He always wears such great clothes. I don’t speak much German and he speaks a little bit of English, but I managed to ask if I could take his photo. He gladly accepted.' Winter in Berlin: The octogenarian knows how to stay stylish in the cold weather . Zoe then created the blog What Ali Wore documenting the father's style and their blossoming friendship. She learnt that Ali (she does not give out his surname) is a retired doctor who now works as a tailor - and is on his way to work when he passes her cafe. He told her he has more than 80 suits and the fashionista in him means he hates Zoe to take a picture of him wearing the same outfit more than once. 'Ali seems to remember if I have already taken a photo of a particular outfit, and doesn’t usually let me do repeats,' she said. Hat and jacket for every occasion: Zoe has been charting Ali's eclectic style since last summer . Down with the kids: The 83 year old can pull off a leather jacket and baseball cap, left, while hooded combat coats and beanie hats also suit him . Since Zoe started the blog last summer, it has received thousands of hits and worldwide media attention. The blog has been publicised in country's including the U.S, Germany and Ali's native Turkey. Zoe said she is overwhelmed by the success of the blog - while she's noted Ali has appeared to have upped the ante with his choice of outfits in her most recent pictures. Fashion conscious: He may be wearing the same hat here but Ali doesn't like to be pictured in the same outfit more than once. Zoe said on the right he was 'working a New York City cop vibe' She commented on a picture of Ali at the end of March where he wears a smart pin stripe suit with a red tie and trilby hat: 'I feel as though Ali might have had an inkling that there would be a few more people seeing his photo today; this is quite the outfit!' She added: 'With the help of Google Translate I tried to explain to Ali today that he might be recognised on the u-bahn…he seemed quite pleased.' Beautiful friendship: After walking past her cafe every morning, Ali and Zoe have now become firm friends after she asked to photograph him for her blog . Aside from the professional recognition the blog has bought her as a photographer, Zoe is delighted by the friendship it has meant she has cultivated with Ali. Despite the generation gap and language barrier, she considers him a firm friend and she even attended a wedding with him this month. 'It feels so simple, just a friendship where we enjoy seeing each other', she told CNN. 'He seems to enjoy having his photographs taken. It must be nice to have it acknowledged that he's a stylish man.' www.zoespawton.com .","Stylish octogenarian captured attention of photographer Zoe Spawton .

Rare: Little Fred James suffers from a genetic condition which means he can't sweat, making hot summer days dangerous for him . When the weather is nice and hot, children like nothing more than running around outside with their friends. But this isn't an option for little Fred James as it could quickly lead to his death. The three-year-old suffers from a rare genetic condition which means he was born without sweat glands and can't sweat. If Fred gets too hot and overheats, he could suffer a fatal fit. Parents Jon James, 39, and Sarah Jones, 33, from Truro, Cornwall, have to ensure their son keeps cool by using fans, water sprays and ice packs. Miss Jones, who is Fred's full time carer, said: 'We do everything possible so he doesn't over heat. It means he has to be watched all the time. 'He's had convulsions when he's overheated. They're horrific. It's extremely scary.' She said she knew something was not right with her son from the moment he was born. Fred had to be resuscitated after having breathing problems and he was kept in intensive care for the first four days of his life. He also had episodes where he went floppy and lifeless. When Fred was ten months old, he suffered his first seizure. Miss Jones said: 'We were at home watching television. I went to check on him and he had threw up everywhere. I shouted for Jon. 'Fred couldn't focus on us. He was really hot so we took all his clothes off. 'Then we realised he was shaking all over. He was having convulsions. We didn't know what to do so we phone for an ambulance.' Precautions: Parents Jon James, 39, and Sarah Jones, 33, have to ensure their son keeps cool by using fans, water sprays and ice packs. They are pictured with Fred, second left, and Alex, right . Chilled: If Fred gets too hot and overheats, he could suffer a fatal fit. He is pictured with his mum Sarah attempting to cool him down . Doctors thought it could be a virus and he was given antibiotics. However, when Fred's teeth came through, his mum noticed they were pointed - a classic symptom of  called Anhidrotic Ectodermal Dysplasia . Her health visitor suggested Miss Jones take him to a dentist who then asked a specialist for a second opinion. The specialist immediately said he thought Fred had Ectodermal Dysplasia and the diagnosis was confirmed by medics at St Michael's Hospital in Bristol shortly after his first birthday. Miss Jones said: 'I was relieved we had finally found out what it was. We knew we could put a name to it. 'I knew something wasn't right but it was still hard to come to terms with it. It was still heartbreaking.' Worries: Fred's mum said she knew something was not right with her son from the moment he was born. He is pictured shortly after his birth . Condition: Fred was diagnosed with Ectodermal Dysplasial shortly after his first birthday . The couple, who also have a 13-month-old son Alex that doesn't have the condition, were then referred to a specialist in Cardiff who told them Fred doesn't have any sweat glands. They have now learnt to spot the tell-tale signs he is overheating and react quickly. Miss Jones said: 'He goes pink and his ears go red. 'Sometimes when he is running around he won't realise he is getting too hot so I get him to stop and have a drink. 'I pretend to accidentally spill some water over him and make it into a game. Planning: Fred's mum says if she knows it's going to be really hot, she plans to do things inside . 'I'll soak his t-shirt in cold water and I keep a sun hat in my bag. 'When I know it's going to be really hot, I plan things to do inside. 'We always have the windows open and we keep the heating off. 'Summer is always a worry. Everyone loves the hot weather but it's hard for us. I dread it in a way.' But Miss Jones says she is determined Fred, who goes to pre-school, doesn't miss out on things. She said: 'He is extremely happy. He loves running and playing. We make sure he does everything like other children. We just have to be really careful.' Mr James, who is a regional development underwriter for an insurance company, and Miss Jones have been supported by the charity, Ectodermal Dysplasia Society. Diana Perry, Chief Executive of the Ectodermal Dysplasia Society, said: 'Overheating is the biggest worry as it will lead to fits and ultimately death if not monitored properly. 'There can also be problems in the winter months in maintaining an adequate body temperature, i.e. they get too cold and have difficulty in warming up. 'The other major symptom is lack of teeth. Some children have no baby teeth at all and maybe a few adult teeth. The teeth they do have are often pointed requiring dentures or implants in the future. 'The hair is often thin and fine also causing a problem with peers. Nails, skin, eyes, ears, respiratory tract and many other areas are often affected. 'We promote that children live a near normal lifestyle, but they can only do this if the correct procedures are put in place to help them.' Just 400 people in the UK have . Ectodermal Dysplasia.

"By . John Stevens . UPDATED: . 05:11 EST, 21 February 2012 . They have penalised British drivers for not carrying a warning triangle or a fluorescent safety vest. Now French police have another weapon to wield against holidaymakers – a law insisting all motorists have a breathalyser kit in their cars. The gadgets, designed so that drivers can test themselves to ensure they are under drink-drive limits, are the latest addition to a list of rules for driving on the other side of the Channel. Bon voyage: Motorists travelling to France after July will be legally required to carry a breathalyser kit in the car . The measure, which will come into force in July, will apply to anyone travelling through France by car. Critics however have cast doubt on the accuracy of the kits in being able to tell if a driver is over the limit. Others said it was simply another attempt to make money out of foreign drivers. Motorists found with between 50mg and . 80mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood can be fined 135 euros (£112) and lose . six out of 12 points on their driving licence. Above that, a driver . risks a fine of 4,500 euros (£3,744), losing their licence and being . sent to prison for up to two years. The French drink-driving limit of 50mg is much lower than in the UK where the limit is 80mg. Motorists are being urged to carry at least two of the single-use breathalysers so that if they have checked themselves with one they can still show police they have a ready-to-use kit if stopped. Police, however, will use their own breathalysers to carry out any roadside test. Those drivers caught without a kit will face a fine of 11 euros (£9) but the French have said there will be a period of grace till November before police start issuing the penalties. The breathalyser kits cost between around £1 and £2 and will be available at ferry and tunnel terminals for crossings to France, but motoring groups have warned that many drivers will still forget to pack them in their car. Andrew Howard, the AA’s head of road safety, explained that it takes time for alcohol to be absorbed into the blood, so early readings could be misleading. He said: ‘After you have had your last swig of alcohol, your reading will continue to rise for the next 40 minutes because it takes time for alcohol to go down into your stomach and be taken into the bloodstream.’ He added: 'Driving requirements in France are now quite complicated and the list of things you need to take is beginning to be quite a substantial extra charge to a holiday.' Keith Peat of the Association of British Drivers said: ‘Some people will take the chance and not buy them, but many will simply not know about this latest requirement or just forget. 'The whole idea of self-testing sounds like nonsense. It seems like another money spinner for the very profitable road safety industry.' Police are expected to carry out random checks on drivers crossing into France via Calais to ensure that they understand the latest drink-driving rules. Anyone driving in France is already required to carry a warning triangle and a fluorescent safety vest to use in an emergency. The drink-drive limit in France is lower than it is in the UK . Additionally British motorists must display a GB plate and have their headlights adjusted to the right. But even if drivers have the full list of equipment they can still be caught out by the complexity of the rules. If a motorist carries the luminous vest in their boot rather than the main section of the car they can still be fined. Drivers are not obliged to carry a spare set of lights, but if one of their bulbs goes and they do not have a replacement ready they can be fined. A fire extinguisher and first aid kit could also be required in the case of an emergency so not to fall foul of a law about assisting in the event of an accident. Last month, the French introduced a new law banning satellite navigation systems that show the location of speed cameras. Those caught can be fined 1,500 euros even if the device is not in use.","Fine for drivers who fail to carry the £2 kit .

Accused: Monsignor Kevin Wallin was allegedly suspended by the Church for having sex in his rectory. He has also been charged by police with distributing crystal meth in a cross-country ring . Friends and colleagues are now saying that they knew something was wrong with the alleged drug-dealing priest when he started to lose a lot of weight and  began acting strangely. Roman Catholic priest Kevin Wallin has plead not guilty to the federal drug charges, but now colleagues are saying that there were a number of warning signs to show something was awry. They first investigated into rumors that Mr Wallin was behaving in inappropriate sexual activities in the Church rectory, and their first concern was whether or not it involved children. When they determined that the homosexual trysts involved only consenting adults, they viewed the incident as a sin, and while it broke the moral code of Catholic priests, it did not break and . 'There's a difference between sin and crime. We don't out people for their sins,' Brian Wallace, spokesman for the Diocese of Bridgeport, said to the Connecticut Post. At that point in June 2011, they asked Wallin to resign- which he did- only to find new clues that the trouble extended further than they thought. Wallin, nicknamed Monsignor Meth, is the former pastor of St. Augustine Parish in Bridgeport publicly said that he was resigning because of health and personal issues, but then he was formally suspended from public ministry last May by the Diocese of Bridgeport. Federal prosecutors say Wallin sold more than $300,000-worth of methamphetamines out of his apartment in Waterbury from August to December and some of the transactions involved an undercover officer. Trusted: Msgr Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . Four other people have been charged in the alleged drug-selling operation that authorities say involved shipments of methamphetamine from California to Connecticut. Cause for resignation: Wallin was found to be having sex in the Church rectory . Church officials also found a bag with 'sex paraphernalia' in his room, according to the CT Post. Wallin, 61, is alleged to have bought an 'adult entertainment store' which investigators believe helped him launder thousands of dollars in weekly profits, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Rectory staff are believed to have notified the local diocese after the priest allegedly 'dressed as a woman and engaged in 'sex acts.' Church officials said they were not aware that the priest was selling drugs when he was pastor of St. Augustine's Cathedral or in St. Peter Parish, according to the Chronicle. He is believed to have continued to receive his stipend - salary - from the Church, until he was arrested on the drugs charges on January 3 this year. Monsignor Wallin left his post as head of St. Augustine's after nine years and was granted a 'sabbatical' by church authorities. 'During . his sabbatical, the Diocese became concerned about his well-being and . have continued to reach out to him,' the Diocese wrote in a statement. 'To date, he has not spoken directly with diocesan officials. Ring: The priest and four others were arrested for allegedly conspiring to distribute crystal meth . 'News of [his] arrest comes with a sense of shock and concern on the part of the Diocese and the many people of Fairfield County who have known him as a gifted, accomplished and compassionate priest.' Monsignor Wallin faces up to 20 years behind bars and a $2million fine if convicted.","Kevin Wallin suspended by church because of alleged sexual activities .

A long-time Boston Marathon volunteer inadvertently snapped dozens of pictures of the two ethnic Chechen brothers near the finish line of last Monday’s ill-fated race, getting clear shots of the two men who are accused of bringing death and chaos to what would have been a day of triumph and celebration. Electrical engineer Bob Leonard, 58, captured 10 to 20 photos a minute with his Nikon camera near the finish line as they finished their grueling 26.2-mile run. After the FBI released images of the two suspects, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, and 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Leonard realized he had clear shots of the two men, seen wearing baseball caps. The images are startling in part because they show the Tsarnaev brothers looking calm, relaxed, and even smug, minutes before the two bombs they allegedly planted exploded, injuring more than 180 and killing three. Scroll down for video . Volunteer Bob Leonard shot a series of photographs last Monday that show Boston bombing suspects Tamerlan Tsarnaev, circled right, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, circled left, as a Boston police officer walks by . Leonard's photographs were taken approximately 10-20 minutes before the blast, according to the time stamps . In the photographs, the brothers, who are U.S. citizens but ethnic Chechans, look relaxed ahead of the two explosions; a black back is also seen below the woman in the green coat . Leonard uploaded the photos with the Tsarnaev brothers to the FBI’s website on Thursday, and by Friday morning, saw his images splashed over the morning news, allowing an important breakthrough in the manhunt. 'That finally gave them a good facial picture,' Leonard told the Associated Press. 'It was a pretty good breakthrough.' The two men were later identified as brothers, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in shootout with police overnight Friday, and 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, distinctive in his backward white baseball cap and dark curly hair poking out from under it. The younger man was captured Friday night after a daylong siege of a Boston suburb, seriously injured following Thursday night’s shootout. Also on Friday, President Barack Obama condemned Monday’s attack as an act of terrorism, saying it was the worst of its kind to occur on American soil since 9/11. After combing the digital images, he was sure he had something the FBI could use. He tried to upload them to an FBI site that it had asked the public to use. On Thursday evening, the FBI showed pictures of the brothers, identifying them as Suspect Number 1 and Suspect Number 2 . The brothers are seen looking on as runners near the finish line, with Tamerlan with his hands shoved in his pockets . Then he called the hotline number and . was on hold for about 40 minutes, the response was so overwhelming. He . finally got an FBI spokesman, who told him to upload them to another . site. Within 20 minutes, someone from the Department of Homeland . Security called him back. 'They . were on the news ... clear pictures of the two subjects and those were . the pictures that I sent in,' said Leonard, who started photography as a . hobby when his sons played high school sports.He was not the only picture-taker to help with images of the suspects. Seconds . after the bombs exploded, David Green pulled out his smartphone and . took a photo of the chaos developing a couple hundred yards in front of . him - the smoke, the people running in panic.

It wasn't until Thursday, when officials released . surveillance video of the two suspects, that Green realized what he had - . a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walking away from the scene. Leonard, from Taunton, Massachusetts, said that the two suspects stood in a specific corner for ‘quite a bit of time.’ Government officials have said that . the brothers had not been under surveillance as possible terrorists. The . FBI said Friday, however, that they had interviewed Tamerlan two years . ago at the request of an unspecified foreign government. The . brothers spent their early years in a small community of Chechens in . the central Asian country of Kyrgyzstan, a mainly Muslim nation of 5.5 . million. The family moved to Dagestan in in 2001, a southern Russian . province that lies at the heart of a violent Islamist insurgency and . where their parents now live.

Mr . Cook, a welder, believes he was picked after presenting Savile with a . gift – a tie his mother had bought. Savile allegedly pounced when he saw how the schoolboy was crestfallen that a badge with a giant ribbon was handed to the entire pack. ‘I must have looked disappointed because Jimmy said “Would you like one of your own?” I said yes please,’ he said. ‘He took me to a small dressing room. I don’t think it was his because it was really shabby, a dingy little room. ‘He said “Do you want to earn your badge?” and he sat me on a chair in the middle of the room. ‘He put his hand on my knee and then tried to put his fingers up the bottom of my shorts before he unzipped them and touched me.

He said “Don’t even tell your mates. We know where you live. Nobody would believe you anyway – I’m King Jimmy”.’ Mr Cook, who lives in an Essex coastal town, said he felt sick as he watched the programme with his parents and was no longer a ‘popular, outgoing kid’ after his ordeal. Mr Cook came forward when he recently read about the allegations surfacing against the former Top of the Pops presenter and his wife noticed he was acting strangely . He only came forward when he recently read about the allegations surfacing against the former Top of the Pops presenter and his wife noticed he was acting strangely. After hearing what had happened, she telephoned Essex Police and made him speak to them. Details have now been passed to the Metropolitan Police. Mr Cook said: ‘All I feel is hatred for that man. I wish he was still alive to face up to what he’s done.’ A source at the Metropolitan Police said Mr Cook’s allegations were one of the lines of enquiry being looked into. A spokesman said: ‘We’re not discussing individual cases.’ Mr Cook is one of several alleged male victims of the star to have come forward. One man said he was abused at the age of 10 at the Haut de la Garenne children's home in Jersey. And John Gibbin, now 49, claims Savile fondled him in his Rolls-Royce at a Stoke Mandeville hospital fundraiser when he was nine. Another hospital where Savile allegedly abused patients was Broadmoor, a high-security psychiatric hospital in Berkshire. Scotland Yard detectives are due to visit the hospital to gather new evidence about the claims. The news comes as BBC Radio Two presenter Jeremy Vine has said he believes Savile will become known as 'one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history.' BBC Radio Two presenter Jeremy Vine has said he believes Savile will become known as 'one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history' Speaking at Cheltenham Literature Festival, Jeremy said that as a dad of two young daughters he finds Savile's actions 'completely disgusting.' The veteran presenter, who has worked on the Newsnight programme had been asked by one of the audience: 'If you had been in charge of Newsnight last year what would you have done with the Jimmy Savile story? Jeremy replied: 'This is a complete and utter nightmare. 'The fact that a person was using his BBC prestige and maybe even BBC dressing rooms to attack young children I find completely disgusting as a father of two young daughters. 'I cannot believe that it happened for such a sustained period that we may be looking at one of the most serious predatory paedophiles in criminal history - and he was on our doorstep. I find it disgusting.' Culture Secretary Maria Miller will answer an urgent question in the Commons this afternoon about the BBC’s investigation into Savile, officials confirmed. Meanwhile, a Tory MP has called for the removal of all references to Savile in public places and for him to be moved to an anonymous grave. Alec Shelbrooke, MP for Elmet and Rothwell, said in a series of posts on Twitter that anyone 'found wanting' by a full, independent investigation should be prosecuted 'no matter how famous' they are. The calls come amid fresh allegations Savile paid to cover up alleged sex attacks on underage girls while manager of a dance hall in the 1950s. Former doorman Dennis Lemmon, 80, who was a door supervisor at the Mecca Locarno Ballroom in Leeds during the late 1950s while Savile was manager, said he was told he 'paid off' families to escape criminal charges of interfering with young girls. Mr Lemmon, who was regularly requested to accompany Savile on his walkabouts around the dance hall, said he would always take an interest in chatting to young girls. He said: 'The first inkling I got of it was when I was told he was going to be up in court. 'After that I got told he paid them off. I assumed it was the families. Before that there had been no rumours about him.' An NSPCC spokesman said: 'It’s vital for all victims of sexual abuse to come forward to offer information or seek help, no matter when the offence was committed or who the offender was.'

Jimmy Savile's best friend and his personal assistant for nearly 30 years has suggested numerous alleged child abuse victims are making the claims up. Janet Cope, 70, refused to accept the former DJ was guilty of any of the sexual abuse claims and suggested alleged victims were motivated by money. Speaking at her home in Aylesbury, Bucks, she told The Daily Star: 'Why have all these people shut up for 40 years? I . just think they are jumping on the bandwagon. I think they know what . money is.' Mrs Cope, who was given away by Savile at her wedding in 1990, added: 'You know people suddenly become fanciful when something like this happens. 'They think, ""Oh, I'll have a little bit of this, I'll say I was groped . or something"", when all that happened was he put his arm around you and . had a photograph taken.' She met Savile while doing charity work at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 1971, the hospital where it is claimed Savile abused young children. She suggested to the newspaper that the reason Savile was often pictured with young women was because he thought it would help preserve his youthful image. She added: 'These kids thrown themselves at celebrities, the celebrities don't go looking for it.'","Kevin Cook was lured into Savile's dressing room with the promise of being given a coveted Jim'll Fix It badge .

The pair performed a wall ride - cycling out from the grassy bank horizontally across the Lawers Dam on Lochan na Lairige before turning down the near vertical drop. Ben and Adam pull out of the drop at the last minute and head off to the side to avoid crashing at the bottom. Adam, 27, who runs a bike shop, said: 'It is called a wall ride - you approach from the side and cycle out across the dam and is common in cycling. 'To pull it off successfully you have got to have great balance. It is certainly not a ride for beginners.' They carried out the stunt for the Highland Perthshire Cycling event which promotes cycling in the area. Drop: The two cyclists ride out across the wall before pointing their bikes downwards. The picture was taken by the photographer's 11-year-old son Euan .

'It's hard to say how fast they were going but it was really quick. It is their skill - but is is not something that I could do! 'As they got to the bottom they pulled out at the last minute.

Grant Thompson, the self-styled King of Random, has made two YouTube videos which show how the screens of old rear-projection TVs can be used to condense sunlight into point capable of melting coins. The incredible films show him using such a screen mounted on to a wooden frame to burns holes through concrete, boil water in seconds and incinerate planks of wood. Solar powered death ray: This image shows how coins can easily be melted with a lens harvested from an old television and used to focus the Sun's rays . Hot: The beam of concentrated solar power is so strong it can not only boil water in seconds but also burn its way through the glass bottle in which the liquid is contained . Mr Thompson scoured the 'free' section of local classified ads to find an old rear-projection television with the right kind of screen to hack out for his project. Prior to the roll out of large LED and plasma displays, cathode ray tube rear-projection TVs were the first to exceed 40in screen size. They used three CRTs - one red, one green and one blue - aligned so the colours mix correctly on to a screen incorporating a Fresnel lens - the same type of lens used in lighthouses.

'The particular screen I found was a crystal clear acrylic lens that focused to a point. 'It may have been luck that I found it . on my first try, because 3 TV's after that all had lesser grade lenses, . but still produced enough heat to melt zinc.' In his YouTube films, Mr Thompson shows how the lens is powerful to melt or burn a range of different objects, including U.S. pennies, glass beer bottles and even concrete. Sounding a note of caution, he added: 'This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training.

A BBC boss who believed its TV channels became too obsessed with middle class people has landed one of the Corporation's top jobs. Oxford graduate Danny Cohen, 38, has today been appointed director of television and will receive a total package of £327,800 from May 7. Cohen spent three years in charge of BBC Three before moving to BBC One, . where he has commissioned shows including Call The Midwife and The . Voice. Famously two years ago he vowed to order more ‘blue collar’ programmes to cater for working class viewers, believing the BBC was relying too heavily on middle class stereotypes and losing touch with people outside that group. Mr Cohen will now oversee the BBC's four main channels, the iPlayer and departments including drama and films. He said today he was 'honoured' to take the job, adding: 'Our ambition is to be the finest broadcaster and producer in the world and our values will be based on talent, creativity, storytelling and innovation. 'I've had a wonderful time at BBC One and am grateful for the work of all the talented people who have made the channel the most popular in the UK in recent years.' New BBC director-general Tony Hall said: 'Danny Cohen has been the driving force behind an extremely successful period in BBC One's history. Key to his success has been an ability to provide viewers with a mixture of high quality programmes they enjoy whilst also introducing them to new subjects they might not have considered before.'

The 505-foot guided-missile destroyer carries the U.S. Navy's advanced Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System, a sophisticated radar system designed to target enemy missiles and launch precision rockets to intercept and destroy them.

Pyongyang is estimated to have enough fissile material to build up to eight nuclear bombs, although estimates vary. According to estimates from the . Institute for Science and International Security from late 2012, North . could have enough weapons grade uranium for 21-32 nuclear weapons by . 2016 if it used one centrifuge at its Yongbyon nuclear plant to enrich . uranium to weapons-grade. 'The General Department of Atomic . Energy...decided to adjust and alter the uses of the existing nuclear . facilities, to begin with,' KCNA reported. It said the nuclear facilities would be used for both electricity and military uses. It was not clear how long it would . take to restart the reactor, whose cooling tower was blown up in a . made-for-TV event in 2008 under an agreement to suspend the atomic . complex. North Korea, led by Kim Jong-un, has stepped up its fighting talk with a series of warnings and threats in recent weeks . There have been reports of . construction work near where the tower once stood but it was not clear . whether the North was rebuilding it. On Saturday, North Korea said it was . entering a 'state of war' with South Korea but the statement was played . down by Seoul and the US as the latest piece of 'tough talk' from . Pyongyang.

'Peace in Asia, above all on the . Korean peninsula: may disagreements be overcome and a renewed spirit of . reconciliation grow,' he said. After the North's young leader Kim Jong-un chaired his first plenary meeting of the ruling Worker's Party central committee yesterday, a statement to the official KCNA news agency said the country's nuclear weapons 'are neither a political . bargaining chip nor a thing for economic dealings to be presented to . the place of dialogue or be put on the table of negotiations aimed at . forcing [Pyongyang] to disarm itself'. Pope Francis called for a diplomatic solution to tensions in the Korean peninsula in his Easter Sunday address yesterday . An unknown number of radar-evading F-22 Raptors were deployed to Osan Air Base, the main US Air Force base in South Korea, from Japan to take part in the annual joint Foal Eagle military drills, which prepare the allies to defend the South from a North Korean attack. On Thursday, the United States performed a rare show of force aimed at the North by dropping dummy munitions from two B-2 Spirit stealth bombers on practice runs over South Korea, which led to Kim putting the North's missile units on standby to attack American military bases in the South and the Pacific. The two Koreas have been in a state of war since the truce that ended their 1950-53 conflict. Despite the threats from the North, few believe Pyongyang will risk near-certain defeat by restarting a full-scale war. On Saturday, North Korea declared it was entering a 'state of war' with the South . Analysts say the threats are more likely to be efforts . to provoke softer policies toward Pyongyang from a new government in . Seoul, to win diplomatic talks with Washington that could get more aid for the North . and to strengthen the young North Korean leader's image and . military credentials at home. Japan's top government spokesman Yoshihide Suga condemned North Korea for 'aggressive provocation' after Kim's ruling party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, identified US military bases in Japan as targets for attack.

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 20:08 EST, 5 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:08 EST, 5 April 2013 . Golden goodbye: Baroness Ashton . Baroness Ashton, the EU’s foreign policy chief, is in line to rake in £400,000 over three years from European taxpayers – without having to do any work. Her job ends next year and her generous golden goodbye will amount to £133,500 a year – the equivalent of 55 per cent of her £287,543 salary – until the end of 2017. On leaving office, the high representative of foreign affairs will immediately get one month’s salary, or £23,962. She will then receive more than half her annual salary for the next three years. When she reaches retirement age in 2021, she will become eligible for her EU pension which will be worth £61,000 a year. Her pay-off was immediately attacked by MPs, with one claiming that she should actually be paying taxpayers back based on her performance. Baroness Ashton has been heavily criticised by the Government over what ministers have described as her ‘ludicrous’ demands for massive budget increases at a time of austerity. Her running of the EU’s diplomatic service has also been questioned by MEPs from across Europe, who have been unimpressed with the high rates of absenteeism and the hefty rates of pay for officials that are now commonplace in Brussels. Bureaucrats stepped in to defend her ‘transitional allowance’, saying it was ‘the price for the total independence’ of all the senior officials working in Europe. One even claimed the pay-off was ‘important’ because it stopped commissioners from looking for a new job during the last months of their mandate. Last month, Baroness Ashton said she found the role of high representative ‘exhausting’ because it involved ‘a lot of travel and a lot of sitting on planes’. When she steps down, the Labour peer will have to ask for permission to take any new job for up to 18 months after leaving the post. But she will only lose some of her taxpayer-funded deal if she lands work that pays her more than £134,000 a year. Her new allowance will be taxed at a lower EU community tax rate of just 13.5 per cent. And she will also be able to immediately attend the House of Lords. Outspoken: Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, said that Ashton just goes to prove the Brussels pay formula . This means she will receive a daily rate of £300 simply for clocking in and attending debates. A European Commission spokesman defended her bumper pay-off. saying: ‘It’s important that commissioners don’t start looking for a new job during the last months of their mandate.’ He added: ‘They should take their time over finding appropriate new employment. ‘That way, they can continue to give 100 per cent to the job that taxpayers are paying them to do. Complaints: Douglas Carswell said that if the Baroness's pay was performance related she would be writing out a cheque to HM Revenue and Customs . ‘And there is much less risk of a conflict of interest.’ Douglas Carswell, the Conservative MP for Clacton, said: ‘The system is run by, and for the benefit of those troughing officials who work in Brussels. ‘If Baroness Ashton got proper performance-related pay, she would be writing a cheque out to HM Revenue and Customs.’ Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, said: ‘Ashton just goes to prove the Brussels pay formula. ‘Eurocrats are paid huge amounts of money inversely to the amount of work they do or the little good that they achieve.’ The former Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament vice chair was elevated to the House of Lords as Baroness Ashton of Upholland by the Labour government in 1999. She was briefly Leader of the Lords in 2007, before being dispatched to Brussels the following year. She started by taking over from Peter Mandelson as the EU’s trade commissioner. Baroness Ashton then became the first person to take on the role of the EU’s high representative of the union for foreign affairs and security policy in 2009. After her first year in the post, Baroness Ashton was voted the least useful of all the EU commissioners in a survey of more than 320 European policymakers.","Baroness Ashton will rake in £400,000 over three years from Euro taxpayers .

Labour frontbencher Chuka Umunna has been dogged by claims he has pushed the idea that he is the UK's answer to Barack Obama . Labour rising star Chuka Umunna last night said he had ‘no recollection’ of doctoring his Wikipedia page to include flattering comparisons with Barack Obama. The shadow business secretary has always said he dislikes the comparisons with the US President that have punctuated his political career. When it was reported at the weekend that his Wikipedia entry had been doctored in 2008 to include a link to a flattering profile of him that made the Obama association, his spokesman said it may have been done by a campaign supporter. But last night it emerged the change had been made from a computer at the law firm where Mr Umunna worked before entering Parliament in 2010. Tory MPs said he appeared to have given himself an ‘internet facelift’, and urged him to come clean. Mr Umunna’s spokesman said the Labour frontbencher had ‘no recollection’ of changing his Wikipedia page, but offered no explanation of how it had come to be changed from his former place of work. Tory MP Keith Simpson said: ‘The trouble with changing one’s own profile page on Wikipedia is that it’s rather like an internet facelift – you can always see the stretch marks.’ A public relations expert said Mr Umunna’s response was a ‘PR crime’. Stuart Bell, co-founder of the PR firm DawBell, said: ‘A quote including “no recollection” for this particular situation is a PR crime. Phrases such as “I can’t say for certain” almost scream out “yes, it was me, I did it”.’ In public the MP for Streatham has played down the comparison with Obama, claiming ‘it annoys me a bit’. Shortly . after being elected he said: ‘You get lazy journalists and the odd . blogger who’ll suggest that I fancy myself as “Britain’s Obama”, and . that I seek to encourage the comparison. Under fire: Labour's Chuka Umunna is facing a new internet row, amid allegations he doctored his own Wikipedia page to include flattering comparisons with Barack Obama . ‘It’s never been something I’ve . encouraged. I want people to look at me as me, not through the prism of . someone else’s personality.’ ‘Socialdemocrat’ created Mr Umunna’s Wikipedia page on October 27, 2007, and appeared to have a highly detailed knowledge of his career. That user has only edited two other Wikipedia pages, one of which belongs to Compass, a left-wing pressure group. Mr Umunna was on its management committee. Leadership: The MP for Streatham, pictured with current Labour leader Ed Miliband, has been tipped to lead the party one day . The other was the entry for columnist Kelvin Mackenzie, who had a robust exchange with Mr Umunna on the BBC’s Question Time. Mr Umunna has used the term ‘social democrat’ to describe himself several times, and once told the Black Socialist Society that it was time to change its name as ‘the Labour Party today is not socialist but social democratic’. Mr Umunna, a former lawyer and DJ, was forced to apologise last week after it emerged that he had described patrons of London’s nightclubs as ‘trash’ and ‘C-list wannabes’. He made the remarks as a member of ASmallWorld, an invitation-only social networking site which has been described as MySpace for millionaires. Conservative MP Nigel Adams said: ‘Comrade Chuka’s not doing his credibility much good this week. Like most champagne socialists, they talk a good game about standing up for the working man but are as transparent as a Gucci shop window.’ A Tory source said: ‘The only thing Chuka Umunna seems interested in is shameless self-promotion. It’s laughable for him to compare himself to Obama. ‘He says one thing in public and does another behind closed doors. Who is ever going to believe a word he says ever again?’ Mr Umunna told the Telegraph: ‘I don’t have any recollection of that log in or any of the changes. But I can’t say for certain that someone with my campaign did not set up that log in.’ He added that while he does not edit his own Wikipedia page, ‘my staff have had to correct it when it has been vandalised by racists and people of that type’.

"By . Gerri Peev . PUBLISHED: . 11:13 EST, 28 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:32 EST, 28 March 2013 . Former Labour Chancellor Denis Healey, photographed by Kalpesh Lathrigra for the New Statesman, still has strident views about today's political leaders . The famously bushy eyebrows have faded to grey and Denis Healey’s 95 years seem to be weighing heavily on him. But the old political bruiser’s capability for withering putdowns and candid comment has clearly not diminished, as a remarkable interview reveals. Ed Miliband ‘lacks his brother’s charisma’, Ukip are ‘b******s’ and Margaret Thatcher was thought to be ‘brilliant and good-looking’, he said yesterday. The former Labour chancellor and deputy leader – who turns 96 this year – delivered a blistering assessment of the current class of politicians. Lord Healey of Riddlesden as he is now known, was broadly complimentary about the current Labour leader. But he added: ‘His only disadvantage is that he doesn’t have the charisma of his brother, David. But he doesn’t upset people.’ Lord Healey’s political career spanned more than six decades, from the immediate aftermath of the Second World War during which he had served in the Army, to the fall of Communism. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1974 and 1979, before being ousted by a Tory party led to victory by Margaret Thatcher. He revealed that an MP friend had told him in the 1970s to watch out for an up-and-coming politician, Margaret Thatcher. He said the friend had told him, ‘“She’s good-looking but she’s also politically brilliant.” He was right.’ Lord Healey told the New Statesman, which also carried this  extraordinary portrait of the peer, with his famously bushy eyebrows now bleached with age, that he was not a fan of Ukip. But he said the party had the power to change British politics. Lord Healey insisted he does not follow British politics closely, but said Ed Miliband lacked the charm of his brother David and warned of the rise of the UK Independence Party . Lord Healey reveals how a friend told him to keep an eye out for a 'good looking' Tory called Margaret Tatcher, who went on to force him out of his job as Chancellor in the 1979 election . Famous for his bushy eyebrows, wit and a love of photography, Denis Healey remains one of the most well-known figures in Labour's history. Born in 1917, he attended Bradford Grammar School before studying at Balliol College, Oxford. He joined the army in 1940, serving in North Africa and Italy during World War Two. Elected an MP for Leeds East in at a by-election in 1952, Under Harold Wilson he served as Defence Secretary from 1964-70, until Labour lost power. When Roy Jenkins quit as shadow chancellor, Healey was promoted to the role and when Wilson narrowly won the 1974 election he became Chancellor during a period of relentless political and economic crisis. During his time at the Treasury he was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout, something still used against the Labour party today. For three years was also deputy leader after defeating Tony Benn in a dramatic battle over the direction of the party. He supported Tony Blair as Labour leader but later called on him to stand aside for Gordon Brown. He was married for more than 60 years to Edna, who died in 2010 aged 92. They had three children. Healey is credited with creating the First Law Of Holes: 'If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.' ‘I think they’re b******s but like . the fascists did at one time, they can start to shift politics,’ he . said, adding that leader Nigel Farage seems to have ‘a very effective . personality which will hurt the Tories’. Despite his criticism of Ukip, the . former chancellor was sceptical about the future of the EU and said a . division running along the ‘olive line’ made federation ‘impossible’. ‘North of the line where olives grow, people pay their taxes and control . their spending; south of it, they don’t and they get very heavily into . debt,’ he said. In contrast to some Tory . backbenchers, Lord Healey praised David Cameron as ‘the first real Tory . leader since Thatcher’. The only politicians who impressed him from the . rest of the  government, however, were Vince Cable and Nick Clegg, both . of whom he described as ‘very able’. But ahead of the next election, the Liberal Democrats would have to quit the Coalition, he said. He added that few of today’s politicians had ‘hinterland’ – a depth of character to give substance to their policies. ‘In my time, people didn’t start earning money until well into their . life in politics. Now … they don’t have experience of the real world.’ He spoke of his own bruising time with the hard Labour left, when he was . deputy to Michael Foot, saying: ‘In those days, the unions had far too . much influence. ‘They could really veto anything they didn’t like. And that time  has gone.’ During the interview, the peer and amateur photographer jokingly suggested he could take his clothes off for his photos.

Carnival Corp may be grateful that the U.S. Coast Guard rushed to the aid of its crippled and malodorous Triumph cruise ship in February, but as it turns out, it has no intention of footing the bill for the rescue operation. The company says all maritime . interests must assist without question those in trouble at sea, a duty . that would not include reimbursing the U.S. government nearly $780,000 . for costs associated with the Triumph incident. Carnival released letters Friday replying to an inquiry by U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a West Virginia Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, about the Triumph stranding and the cruise line's overall safety record. Taxpayers stiffed: Carnival Corp said it has no plans to reimburse the US governed nearly $780,000 for rescuing the stranded Triumph liner in February . Rescued at last: Carnival Triumph is docked after being towed to the Alabama Cruise Terminal on February 15, 2013 in Mobile, Alabama . Among Rockefeller's questions was . whether Carnival would repay the government for Coast Guard costs in the . Triumph case as well as $3.4million to the Coast Guard and Navy from . the 2010 stranding of the Carnival Splendor in the Pacific Ocean. ‘These costs must ultimately be borne by federal taxpayers,’ Rockefeller said in his March letter, adding that Carnival appears to pay little or no federal income taxes. In response, Carnival said its policy is to ‘honor maritime tradition that holds that the duty to render assistance at sea to those in need is a universal obligation of the entire maritime community.’ The cruise line noted that its ships frequently participate in rescues at the Coast Guard's request, including 11 times in the past year in Florida and Caribbean waters. It did not make direct reference to repaying any money. In a statement, Rockefeller called the response ‘shameful’ and that he is considering ‘all options to hold the industry to higher passenger safety standards.’ Those options could include a congressional hearing and legislation, perhaps even a closer look at taxation. Rockefeller's letter asked Carnival whether the money it pays in taxes covers the costs of various federal benefits it receives, a question the cruise line again did not directly answer. It did mention port taxes and fees and other payments and said it paid $16.5billion in wages to U.S. workers in 2011. Convenient excuse: Carnival said its policy is to ¿honor maritime tradition that holds that the duty to render assistance at sea to those in need is a universal obligation of the entire maritime community' ‘Every state where our ships call or home port benefits from the dollars spent by cruise lines to buy products and retain services from local businesses,’ Carnival added. The exchange marked the latest chapter in the saga of the Triumph, which was disabled by an engine fire during a cruise in February in the Gulf of Mexico. Thousands of passengers and crew had to endure five days at sea with no power and under squalid conditions while the 900-foot vessel was towed to Mobile, Alabama, where it continues to undergo repairs. Rockefeller had asked Carnival for details about 90 incidents aboard its ships that were filed with the Coast Guard in the past five years. Nightmare vacation: Passengers revealed gruesome details of their ordeal after enduring five days of overflowing toilets, mushy floors, food shortages and stomach-churning odor . Inhumane conditions: Passengers were reduced to going to the . bathroom in biohazard bags and placing excrement outside their cabins in . the hallways . Traveling in squalor: Passengers aboard the luxury $420million vessel had to abandon their overheated, filthy cabins in favor of a shanty town of tents on deck . Carnival responded that 83 were not considered serious under federal regulations. Three were the Triumph and Splendor mishaps and the capsizing of the Costa Concordia off Italy's coast, which killed 32 people in January 2012. The others were more minor ship collisions, an illness and one passenger who jumped off a ship.The cruise line said it takes each incident ‘very seriously’ and undergoes reviews and corrective measures when needed, such as a review of safety and emergency response practices across all of Carnival's brands following the Concordia accident. In a separate letter, Carnival Chairman and CEO Micky Arison said the company takes the issues raised by Rockefeller very seriously. ‘We remain committed to the safety and comfort of our guests and we are proud of our ability to provide millions of people with safe, fun and memorable vacation experiences,’ Arison wrote. Triumph ship set sail from Galveston, Texas on February 7 and was due to return from Mexico on February 11. Happy ending: Passengers from the crippled Carnival Triumph wait to board buses at the Alabama Cruise Terminal after finally leaving the filthy ship . A fire in the engine room changed everything and turned this cruise – a honeymoon for at least one couple – into an unforgettable journey for all the wrong reasons . For five days the Triumph had been dragged towards land by tugboats hauling her 102,000 tonnes.Triumph is the so-called pride of the Carnival fleet -  a $420million vessel which became a 'floating petri dish' of dysfunctional bathrooms, overflowing toilets, urine soaked carpets, idle air-conditioning units and luxury cabins abandoned in favor of a shanty town of tents on deck or cooler hallways.","Carnival Corp cited maritime tradition that everyone are expected to help vessels in trouble without expecting to get paid .

British support for membership of the EU is now ‘wafer-thin’, David Cameron has warned ahead of talks with European leaders. The Prime Minister will travel to Madrid, Paris and Berlin this week to demand the EU stop meddling and pay more attention to ‘democratic consent’. Mr Cameron affirmed his commitment to reform and said he was ‘convinced’ that there would be changes to Europe’s rulebook. Clawing back powers: David Cameron is heading to Madrid, Paris and Berlin this week to discuss the EU . Before his visit to Spain today, the Prime Minister said: ‘We need to recognise that consent for Britain’s membership of the European Union, and all the ways that it has changed, has become wafer-thin in Britain. ‘And politicians, if they do their job properly, have to recognise this fact rather than try to brush it under the carpet.’ The Prime Minister also accused the institution of ‘over-reaching itself’ with directives and interferences. He is determined to claw back powers from Europe over certain areas such as human rights and law and order. Mr Cameron, who will speak at a joint press conference with Spain’s prime minister Mariano Rajoy in Madrid, said he wants to challenge the central tenet of the EU, namely the commitment in the founding Treaty of Rome in 1957 to create ‘ever closer union’. He said Europe would be stronger if . it was more flexible, ‘where we don’t all have to do the same things in . the same way at the same time’. In . remarks to newspapers in France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Poland, Mr . Cameron said: ‘I think the best outcome for Britain is our membership of . a reformed European Union.’ Burning issue: A protester in London sets fire to an EU flag in 2011 as British support for Europe has collapsed . British governments and political parties had reneged on promises to hold a referendum on the EU, he said, saying that this has ‘damaged consent for Britain’s membership of the European Union’. He added: ‘There’s no good wishing that away. It exists; it’s a fact. And the best thing to do when you have a problem is to confront that problem, deal with it.’ Warning that treaty change was inevitable, he continued:  ‘I’m absolutely convinced that there will be the need to reopen at some stage these treaties, not least to solve the problem of the Eurozone. ‘Just as Eurozone countries will argue that it’s necessary to have treaty change, I think it’s perfectly legitimate to argue that non-Eurozone countries might need to have treaty changes.’ Mr Cameron hit back at critics accusing him of creating uncertainty in the EU with his threat to hold a vote on Britain’s membership if the institution did not reform. He said: ‘The greatest uncertainty would be to have this problem and to wish it didn’t exist. ‘Much better to have a plan for how we make changes to the European Union, how we make changes to Britain’s membership, how we secure Britain’s membership of a reformed EU and we settle this issue. I have a plan.’ He cited the financial transaction tax as one EU move that Britain opposed, adding: ‘We are a major European power, a major European player. But do we think that the European Union has sometimes overreached itself with directives and interventions and interferences? Yes, it has. And that needs to change.’ After his first official trip to Madrid as Prime Minister, Mr Cameron will travel to Paris for talks with French president Francois Hollande. He will meet German chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin at the end of the week to discuss his reform agenda. But both Germany and France have warned there is little chance they will agree to overhaul the treaty to reflect his demands before 2017 – when he pledged to hold an ‘in/out’ referendum. Mr Cameron has been urged to bring forward the poll to 2015 to prove he is serious about changing Britain’s relationship with Europe. More than 100 backbench Tory MPs have said he has not gone far enough and want a timetable and details of the referendum now.","Prime Minister will demand EU pay more attention to 'democratic consent'

An ex-soldier who accidentally punched a girl he had a crush on in the face died after jumping from the taxi in which they were travelling. Former Welsh guardsman, Anthony Kelly, 18, became angry with childhood friend Damien Wrigley following a night out and went to hit him in the back of the minibus in Rhyl, North Wales. However he struck Amy Butler, 18, in the face instead. An inquest heard Mr Kelly was so . mortified at what he had done he opened the sliding door of the moving . taxi and leapt out - smashing his skull on the road. Tragedy: Former soldier Anthony Kelly, 18, died after he jumped out of a moving taxi and hit his head on the road . 'Such a waste': Anthony Kelly never regained consciousness and died two days later at Glan Clwyd Hospital in North Wales (pictured) He died two days later from his head injuries at Glan Clwyd hospital in North Wales. The tragedy occurred in March after Anthony had been out in Rhyl, North Wales, drinking lager and shots with friends. The inquest in Prestatyn was told the teenager's mood was was 'happy to begin with' but as the night went on he started to act 'different' after Miss Butler began kissing Mr Wrigley. The group decided to get a taxi home but an argument broke out between Mr Kelly and his friend Mr Wrigley inside the six-seater vehicle. Miss Butler said: 'Anthony started going a bit mad and Damien restrained him. Anthony leant forward to swing for Damien but instead he hit me. 'He said: ""Did I just hit you?"" and I said: ""Yes"". He had a look on his face as if to say: ""Oh my God"" and that’s when he jumped out of the taxi.' Inquest: Friends told a hearing in Prestatyn that Anthony Kelly jumped out of the moving taxi just moments after he accidentally punched a girl he liked during a drunken row in the back seat . Another member of the group, Lee-Anna Shires, said Mr Kelly and Mr Wrigley both 'had a thing' for Miss Butler and that it 'all kicked off' after Mr Wrigley and Miss Butler had kissed that night. In a statement read out at the inquest, Mr Wrigley said: 'When Anthony realised that he’d hit Amy, his face just went blank. He just flopped out of the door and disappeared really quickly.' He added: 'I can’t help feeling that Anthony’s death could’ve been my fault, that if I hadn’t have gone out that night, it wouldn’t have happened. 'I don’t know why Anthony did what he did - I can’t explain it at all.' Pathologist Dr Andrew Dalton found that 6ft 6ins Anthony had suffered a fracture to his skull and there was bleeding on his brain. He was three times over the legal drink drive limit at the time of the incident. Collision investigators found that the taxi did not contribute in any way to Mr Kelly’s death. The teenager’s mother Becky Kelly said her son never regained consciousness before he passed away. 'Happy teenager': Anthony Kelly had been out drinking with friends in Rhyl, North Wales, pictured, before getting a taxi home . She described him as a 'great lad with loads of personality' and said he was 'lovely, friendly, honest and sincere'. The teenager had spent five months on the front line before leaving the Army and was preparing to join the Traders Guild. Ms Kelly said what her son did was 'really stupid' but she has since taken comfort in donating his organs to help other people. She said: 'Anthony’s wish was that if anything happened to him that as many of his organs as possible should go to help other people - no matter how painful or difficult the decision was. 'If there is a small crumb of comfort at this difficult time it is that his wish has been granted.' After leaving high school, Mr Kelly from Prestatyn, spent five months at Bangor Military Preparation College. He served briefly with the Welsh Guards and was said to be a 'popular and fun-loving young man'. Recording a verdict of accidental death, acting coroner for North East Wales, John Gittins said: 'I accept that Anthony did what he did deliberately, but I do not believe his intention was to bring his life to an end. 'This was a spur of the moment act on his part and I believe Mrs Kelly hit the nail on the head when she said it was a stupid act. He acted spontaneously with very tragic consequences, it is such a waste.'","Former Welsh guardsman Anthony Kelly, 18, hit his head on the road when he jumped out of a moving taxi near Rhyl, North Wales .

She gamely took part in the Olympics Opening Ceremony, pretending to leap out of a plane and land in the middle of the festivities. He praised her for her wonderful sense of humour and down to earth attitude. But it would appear that despite this, director Danny Boyle still thinks the Queen should not head of state - and calls for an elected figure instead. The Oscar winner says Queen Elizabeth was 'fantastic' at the Olympics, but says the royal family is under 'impossible pressure' The Oscar-winning director and creator of the dazzling ceremony suggested that JK Rowling would be a successor, the Guardian reported. In an interview he calls for a republic, saying that a US-style elected head is inevitable and he thinks that the royal family will be abolished in his lifetime. He says the royal family has 'utterly impossible' pressure put on them. He told the Guardian: 'It's a ludicrous spotlight they're under. 'You can still have a royal family if you like ... but actually have an elected head of state.' He says that the system used in America to elect a head of state is 'healthy' and hopes it will be introduced in the UK. But it's clear he admired the Queen for her approach to the Olympics. The Queen and Daniel Craig joined in the joke for London's Olympic Opening Ceremony - and her Majesty was praised by Danny Boyle for being 'very sharp' Despite her starring role, Boyle says that a republic is 'inevitable' and that the American system seems 'healthy' She performed in a short film alongside Daniel Craig as James Bond, greeting him at Buckingham Palace before pretending to go with him into a helicopter, push him out and then sky dive herself. Boyle told the Guardian that he had only asked permission from the royal family for the joke, band was stunned when her Majesty asked to take part. He said she nailed the cameo in one shot, was down to earth and was patient. Praising her, the 56-year-old said: 'She's very sharp, she was fantastic.' Previously, he described the Queen as having the 'instincts of a performer', and she clearly appreciated the paramount need for secrecy – even with the rest of the Royals. A performer played the role of Queen Elizabeth parachuting - and Boyle praised the monarch for being 'fantastic' 'She showed great instinct again when she decided that no one in her family should know about the film, so that it was as much a surprise and delight for them as for the nation.' But even his good impression of the Queen and his patriotic display at the London Games cannot persuade Boyle to change his republican roots. For Boyle, it was a more a case of wanting to be an equal citizen. 'People fought many battles to make everybody free, equal citizens. 'I have no reason to believe that being a preferred subject would have any value that could improve the pride I feel in being an equal citizen. 'I'm lucky because I've made money and people like the work I've done but it doesn’t make me feel I'm better than anyone. 'You've got to be careful because it sounds like you're criticising other people who have accepted knighthoods, which I'm not doing at all. 'It's a very personal choice.'","Says pressure on royal family is 'utterly impossible'

To personalise your man, de Keijzer's custom-made pillows come with accessories such as knitted ties, moustaches, glasses and even tattoos for those who prefer a rock n' roll type of guy. 'I created Arthur for the same reason I . created the accessories: we do not all have the same taste in men,' explains de Keijzer.

He has also been charged by police with distributing crystal meth in a cross-country ring . A Connecticut priest at the centre of a meth drug-dealing gang has been suspended over allegations he had sex in his rectory. Monsignor Kevin Wallin was relieved of his duties in May last year after complaints were made by staff at his residence in Bridgeport. The news will embarrass the Church as the priest also faces charges of helping run a cross-country methamphetamine . distribution ring. Msgr Wallin allegedly received . the drug  shipments from suppliers in California and then sold them to . undercover officers at least six different times between last September . and the beginning of this month. According to his indictment he was selling around $9,000 of meth a week at one stage. Msgr Wallin, 61, is alleged to have bought an 'adult entertainment store' which investigators believe helped him launder thousands of dollars in weekly profits, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. Rectory staff are believed to have notified the local diocese after the priest allegedly 'dressed as a woman and engaged in 'sex acts.' Diocese officials are understood to have consulted lawyers who said that none of Wallin's behavior appeared to be illegal. The priest had resigned from his role as pastor of St. Augustine's in Bridgeport in June 2011, citing health concerns and personal problems. Msgr Wallin, who previously served as secretary to bishops Walter Curtis and Edward Egan in Bridgeport, was arrested and charged with six counts of possession with intent to distribute crystal meth, NBC Connecticut reported. He has been detained until an arraignment hearing next week. Church officials said they were not aware that the priest was selling drugs when he was pastor of St. Augustine's Cathedral or in St. Peter Parish, according to the Chronicle. Trusted: Msgr Wallin served as the pastor at St. Augustine's in Bridgeport for nine years before taking a sabbatical in 2011 for health and personal reasons . He is believed to have continued to . receive his stipend - salary - from the Church, until he was arrested on . the drugs charges on January 3 this year. Msgr Wallin left his post as head of St. Augustine's after nine years and was granted a 'sabbatical' by church authorities. 'During his sabbatical, the Diocese became concerned about his well-being and have continued to reach out to him,' the Diocese . wrote in a statement. 'To date, he has not spoken directly with . diocesan officials. 'News of [his] arrest comes with a sense of shock and . concern on the part of the Diocese and the many people of Fairfield .

The majority of U.S. women - 53per cent - will be following Kim Kardashian's lead by wearing one-piece bathing suits this summer, with most admitting that this option is better for their body shape. Of the 2,321 women polled by money-saving website CouponCodes4u, only 18per cent planned on emulating celebrities like Rihanna and Hayden Panettiere by sporting a bikini on the beach. The remaining 29per cent said they would choose a tankini as their swimsuit of choice. Body conscious: More than half of women in America are opting to cover up in a one-piece bathing suit on the beach instead - like voluptuous beauties Sofia Vergara, 40 (left) and Kim Kardashian, 32 (right) Of the respondents who planned on . wearing a one-piece to the beach, 57per cent said it was because this . conservative choice was better suited to their body shape. A third of the women who wanted to wear a one-piece explained it was the 'more comfortable' option. According to the study, it would appear that women choose their swimwear based on how flattering it is more than any other reason. 63per cent of the women polled said that they purchased a particular bathing suit only if it enhanced their body shape. The . study was intended to determine whether or not American women have become more . self-conscious about their beach bodies, and to see if their insecurities have affected their choice of beachwear. Indeed, when the women were asked if they thought they had the perfect beach body, an overwhelming 82per cent said they did not. Mark Pearson, chairman of CouponCodes4u, . said of the findings: 'While bikinis were once the most popular choice . of swimwear, it seems that some American women no longer feel that this . fashion piece is right for them or their body shape.' On the out: Less than 18per cent of U.S. women plan on wearing bikinis to the beach this summer in the style of 25-year-old Rihanna (left) and Hayden Panettiere, 23 (right) He added: 'More consumers seem to be . flocking back to the one-piece or even the tankini, citing comfort and . body shape as their top purchasing factors.' Not only have women apparently become more self-conscious of their bodies, but they also are increasingly fretting over the pressures of beach season. A third of respondents - 34per cent - said they planned on dieting in the lead-up to bikini season. 'More women seem to be flocking back to the one-piece or even the tankini' The study also discovered that while women may be increasingly insecure about exposing their bodies on the beach, that hasn't stopped them from buying swimwear altogether. The average amount spent on bathing suits each year was $54.79, with each woman buying an average of 2.5 new pieces of swimwear per year. Mr Pearson remarked on the study: 'What is important to mention is when picking the right option for your swimsuit, make sure you choose one that can last more than one season as otherwise you will be wasting your money.' He added that finding the right bathing suit can be difficult, but worth it: 'Choosing the right swimsuit is a bit like choosing the right suit - it can be expensive but get it right and it will last for many seasons to come, and you will look and feel your best while on vacation or at the beach.'","Fans of the one-piece include Sofia Vergara and Kim Kardashian .

Hate preacher: Abu Hamza may strike a deal with U.S. authorities and plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence . Hate preacher Abu Hamza may strike a deal with U.S. authorities and plead guilty in return for a lighter sentence, it emerged today. The radical Islamist cleric is facing terrorism charges in the U.S. after he was last month finally extradited from Britain following an eight-year legal battle. His lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, yesterday said there is now a possibility of a 'plea bargain', although Hamza currently denies all charges. He told The Sun: 'If they offer something agreeable to the defendant and myself, we would accept it.' Hamza, known for his signature metal hooks, appeared in court without prosthetics on October 26, his arms visibly red. The white-haired and white-bearded cleric, who has asked to be referred to in court by his birth name, Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, pleaded not guilty to 11 criminal charges at an earlier hearing last month. He is being held in the maximum security section, known as South 10, of the Metropolitan Correctional Center next door to the courthouse in lower Manhattan. Hamza was accused in 2004 of participating in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. A trial date has been set for August 26, 2013. He is also charged with providing material support to the Al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organize support for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

"By . Daniel Martin . UPDATED: . 03:06 EST, 6 January 2012 . Focus on care: David Cameron will say nurses need to check up on patients at least every hour . David Cameron is urging nurses to speak to patients at least once an hour. As he pledges to reverse the declining standard of NHS care in a major speech today, the Prime Minister will say too few nurses understand that caring is their main job, and that everything else comes second. He will proclaim: ‘Nursing needs to be about patients, not paperwork.’ Health service campaigners said the fact that Mr Cameron felt it necessary to remind nurses to talk to patients was an indictment of the ‘dreadful’ standard of care in many hospitals. Mr Cameron’s intervention follows growing concerns about frail and vulnerable patients, particularly the elderly, being left hungry and thirsty in soiled bedclothes because some nurses no longer see their profession as a vocation. The Daily Mail has highlighted the failure of many nurses to care for patients effectively as part of its Dignity for the Elderly campaign. On a visit to an NHS hospital, Mr Cameron will say he wants to see the whole approach to caring reset. He will tell nurses that at least every hour they should check whether patients need help with eating and drinking, being taken to the lavatory, or whether they need to be moved to make them more comfortable. Then they should ask: ‘Is there anything more I can do for you now?’ The Prime Minister will say: ‘There’s something really fundamental that needs to be put right fast. We need an NHS which ensures that every patient is cared for with compassion and dignity in a clean environment. ‘We know the vast majority of patients are very happy with the care provided by the NHS. I’ve seen the NHS at its very best – the incredible people for whom nursing is a true vocation, who go beyond the call of duty and combine great medical knowledge with great care. Care: A nurse talks to a patient in a wheelchair. Today Mr Cameron will say NHS workers spend too little time on the needs of patients because they face a mountain of paperwork . Good old-fashioned care: An NHS nurse feeds a patient in 1983. Mr Cameron will say proper care has become lost in bureaucracy . ‘But I also know we’ve got a real problem in some of our hospitals with patients not being fed and watered regularly or treated with the respect they deserve. I am absolutely appalled by this, and we are going to put this right.’ He will add: ‘If we want dignity and respect, we need to focus on nurses and the care they deliver. Somewhere in the last decade the health system has conspired to undermine one of this country’s greatest professions. ‘It’s not one problem in particular. It’s the stifling bureaucracy. The lack of consequence for failing to treat people with dignity. Even, at times . . . the pursuit of cost-cutting or management targets without sufficient regard for quality of care.’ Bureaucracy: Mr Cameron, pictured yesterday, will blame paperwork for nurses not paying enough attention to patients' four basic needs . Mr Cameron plans to get rid of paperwork which keeps nurses from spending time with patients and establish a national forum to spread best practice across the NHS. Hospitals which perform well on providing the ‘four basics of care’ – preventing bedsores, falls, blood clots and hospital-acquired infections – will receive financial bonuses. And a new ‘friends and family’ test will ask patients, carers and staff whether they would recommend the hospital to their loved ones. Joyce Robins, from Patient Concern, said: ‘It is dreadful that the Prime Minister is having to remind members of the caring profession to talk to patients.’ Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association said: ‘Something has gone wrong in the NHS. ‘It’s all been about targets and saving money.’ Peter . Carter, general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘The . profession will welcome the moves to free nurses to put care first, and . to focus all their energies on the needs of their patients.’ Shadow . Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘If the Prime Minister really wants . to help nurses focus on patient care, he should listen to what they are . saying and drop his unnecessary Health Bill. ‘His . reckless decision to reorganise the NHS at this time of financial . challenge threatens to throw the entire system into chaos.’","Nurses should check whether patients need help at least once an hour .

North Korea is allowing foreigners to take mobile phones into the country for the first time - as long as you don’t call a local. For years, Pyongyang has told visitors to relinquish their phones at the border until their departure, leaving many tourists without an easy way to communicate with the outside world. The ritual of handing over phones was part of an exhaustive security check that most visitors face at immigration in North Korea. Good call: Foreigners will now be able to take their mobile phones into North Korea, but will not be able to use them to phone locals . Now, foreigners can bring mobiles into the country or rent a local handset at the airport, and purchase a local SIM card for use in North Korea. The SIM card allows them to call most foreign countries, foreign embassies in Pyongyang and international hotels in the North Korean capital. Mobiles can be rented for around £2 a day and SIM cards cost about £40. However, foreigners will not have access to the Internet using locally provided SIM cards and they cannot phone South Korea. Mobile phone use has multiplied in North Korea since Egyptian telecommunications firm Orascom built a 3G network there four years ago. More than a million people are using mobiles in the country, according to Orascom Telecom Media and Technology, which runs Koryolink as part of a joint venture with North Korea's telecommunications ministry called CHEO Technology JV Co.

He said that it would be 'very easy' for North Korea to offer Internet on the 3G cellphone network. 'As the world becomes increasingly connected, the North Korean decision to be virtually isolated is very much going to affect their physical world and their economic growth. It will make it harder for them to catch up economically,' he wrote in a Google blog entry posted Sunday. 'It is their choice now, and in my view, it's time for them to start, or they will remain behind.'

Machines with the ability to attack targets without any human intervention must be banned before they are developed for use on the battlefield, campaigners against 'killer robots' have urged. The weapons, which could be ready for use within the next 20 years, would breach a moral and ethical boundary that should never be crossed, said Nobel Laureate Jody Williams, of the 'Campaign To Stop Killer Robots'. 'If war is reduced to weapons attacking without human beings in control, it is going to be civilians who are going to bear the brunt of warfare,' said Williams, who won the 1997 peace prize for her work on banning landmines. They're here! A robot in Parliament Square at the launch of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Lethal armed robots which could target and kill humans autonomously should be banned before they are used in warfare, campaigners have said. Weapons such as remotely piloted drones are already used by some armed forces and companies are working on developing systems with a greater level of autonomy in flight and operation. 'We already have a certain amount of autonomy,' said Noel Sharkey, professor of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at the University of Sheffield. 'I think we are already there. 'If you asked me to go and make an autonomous killer robot today, I could do it. 'I could have you one here in a few days,' he told reporters. But the technology is a long way off being able to distinguish between a soldier and a civilian. 'The idea of a robot being asked to exercise human judgment seems ridiculous to me,' Sharkey told Reuters. 'The whole idea of robots in the battlefield muddies the waters of accountability from my perspective as a roboticist,' he added.

The weapons, which could be ready for use within the next 20 years, would breach a moral and ethical boundary that should never be crossed, said Nobel Laureate Jody Williams, of the 'Campaign To Stop Killer Robots'. The British government has always said it has no intention of developing such technology. 'There are no plans to replace skilled military personnel with fully autonomous systems,' a Ministry of Defense spokesman told Reuters. 'Although the Royal Navy does have defensive systems, such as Phalanx, which can be used in an automatic mode to protect personnel and ships from enemy threats like missiles, a human operator oversees the entire engagement,' the spokesman added. But the organizers of the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots say Britain's rejection of fully autonomous weapons is not yet watertight. 'We're concerned that there is a slide towards greater autonomy on the battlefield and unless we draw a clear line in the sand now, we may end up walking into acceptance of fully autonomous weapons,' said Thomas Nash, director of non-governmental organization Article 36. Rapid advancements in technology have allowed countries such as the United States, China, Russia, Israel and Germany to move towards systems that will soon give full combat autonomy to machines, according to a report by Human Rights Watch.

A woman suffered horrific internal burns after scalding water burst from a medical balloon while it was still inside her. Jo Partridge, 36, from Christchurch, New Zealand, spent seven weeks in the burns unit of the Christchurch Hospital after the medical accident. In May last year, Mrs Partridge underwent a procedure called thermal ablation - an internal gynecological procedure. Painful: Scott Partridge (left) has lost his job and his wife Jo (right) remains in pain after the botched procedure . But four minutes into the procedure, the intrauterine balloon containing a saline solution, heated to 86C, burst inside her, The New Zealand Herald reported. There are different types of endometrial ablation but the two most common are microwave endometrial ablation and thermal balloon ablation. Both are used to get rid of the lining of the womb. Most commonly this is because of extremely heavy, painful periods or fibroids, non-cancerous tumours that grow on the uterus wall. Microwave endometrial ablation uses a probe that emits microwave energy to heat up and destroy the womb lining. The two most common forms of ablation are microwave endometrial . ablation and thermal balloon ablation. Both are used to get rid of the . lining of the uterus. Most commonly this is because of heavy periods or fibroids (non-cancerous tumours that grow on the . uterus wall). Microwave endometrial ablation emits microwave energy to heat up and destroy the lining. Thermal balloon ablation involves a water-filled balloon being heated to destroy the lining. The procedures are quick to perform, . taking around 20 minutes in total. It can be carried out under general . or local anaesthetic. Most patients can go home the same . day. Some patients may experience tummy cramps for a few days after the procedure, but this can be treated with painkillers. Thermal balloon ablation – the type that Mrs partridge had -  involves a balloon being inserted into the womb and being inflated and heated to destroy the lining. The procedures are common and quick to perform, taking around 20 minutes in total. It can be carried out under general or local anaesthetic. Most patients can go home on the same day. Some patients may experience stomach cramps, similar to period pains, for a few days but this can be treated with painkillers. Mrs Partridge underwent the procedure at Grey Base Hospital and was under general anaesthetic during the ablation. She said she felt the pain as soon as she regained consciousness. She also said she was left for five days with no internal treatment. And 11 months after Mrs Partridge’s ordeal, she says she is still unable to allow her children to sit on her lap, due to pressure on her pelvis. She has undergone surgery over 35 times and says she is unable to lead a normal life. Mr Partridge has lost his job due to having to take time off work to look after their young children and his wife. A hospital report said the surgical method had been used on the West Coast of New Zealand since 2004 without incident. The staff were properly trained, and testing of the machine found no faults. However, the report also recommended the thermal ablation system be permanently removed from the hospital. The West Coast District Health Board has apologised for a ‘catastrophic equipment failure’ but maintains its hospital staff are ‘competent and capable’. The District health Board's own root cause analysis report said 'immediate cooling measures were not undertaken'. Mrs Partridge and her husband Scott took legal advice before going public about her experience, and are limited in what they can say. But, they say they have one message that do want to make heard: 'Staff should be stood down while the Health and Disability Commissioner is investigating.'","Jo Partridge, 36, visited hospital for the routine procedure thermal ablation .

The actor, a figurehead for the Hacked Off campaign group, appeared on television to warn that the Government’s entire legislative programme would be held to ransom if it did not back down. Hacked Off has been closely involved in amendments already tabled to Bills in the House of Lords implementing some form of ‘Leveson law’ – meaning Mr Cameron would be unable to allow them to proceed in the Commons for fear of statutory regulation of the Press being passed thanks to Labour and Liberal Democrat votes. ‘This will keep happening and the Government’s legislative agenda will be completely screwed because no one will give up on this,’ Mr Grant, a victim of phone hacking, told the BBC. ‘This is the will of the people and it is not right that a tiny rump of Conservatives who happen to be in the executive are doing the will of the Press.’ Sources close to the talks claimed Hacked Off had warned it would attack Labour – and media spokesman and deputy leader Harriet Harman in particular – as ‘traitors’ if they backed Mr Cameron’s proposed Royal Charter. One said that ‘at least four’ members of the Shadow Cabinet had received calls from Mr Grant. And a Tory source said Labour appeared to be ‘acting as the political wing of Hacked Off’. After Mr Cameron abandoned cross-party talks yesterday, Mr Grant wrote on Twitter: ‘Rumour in Westminster that editor of Times instructed Cameron to call off talks. And our PM did as he was told. Murdoch rules. Still.’ A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Grant’s suggestion that Mr Cameron had been told what to do by Times editor John Witherow was ‘complete nonsense’. Hacked Off denied that Mr Grant had called members of the Shadow Cabinet, or that it had prepared a draft press release attacking Labour if it had backed a deal. Executive director Professor Brian Cathcart said: ‘The Prime Minister has walked away from talks in which other parties were trying desperately to accommodate his views on a Royal Charter. ‘Instead he has chosen to throw his lot in with powerful national newspaper groups, whose actions were condemned in the Leveson report. His version of the Royal Charter would have paved the way for a regulatory system little different from the discredited Press Complaints Commission.’ David Hass, spokesman for Hacked Off, said later of the claims Mr Grant had been telephoning shadow Cabinet ministers: 'We keep in close contact with senior members of all parties to help explain the urgent need for reform. 'Victims feel betrayed by David Cameron, not Nick Clegg or Ed Miliband as they have kept their word.' Pulled the plug: Prime Minister David Cameron, has abandoned cross-party talks over the Leveson proposals . ■ Chris Huhne spent his last night of freedom attending a wedding reception with other Hacked Off campaigners. The disgraced Liberal Democrat was at the party to mark the marriage to financier James Burr of lawyer Charlotte Harris, a partner with the firm Mishcon de Reya, who represented phone-hacking victims at the Leveson Inquiry. Miss Harris also represented Huhne’s lover Carina Trimingham in her unsuccessful attempt to sue the Daily Mail. Labour MP Tom Watson, one of the main champions of tighter Press regulation was also there. He was also seen deep in conversation with PR guru Max Clifford at the Inner Temple in central London.","Campaign group involved in amendments tabled to Bills in House of Lords .

A project to use the walls of city buildings to grow edible crops in vertical kitchen gardens is being launched in York today. The owners of El Piano, a restaurant in the historic city, hope to grow herbs and vegetables on the building's exterior, fulfilling their sustainable aim of using locally grown food. Green walls have been in existence for centuries, traditionally training plants to grow up from the ground to cover a wall. How the restaurant might look with its vertical kitchen garden: York restaurant El Piano is today holding a public consultation for an ambitious project aimed at using the walls of urban buildings to grow herbs and vegetables . But new systems developed over the last . couple of years allow planting within containers directly fixed to . walls, allowing more complex schemes to be considered, including edible . crops. Liz Chadwick, a spokesman for El Piano, said the restaurant plans to make a variety of different dishes with . all kinds of vegetables grown from the wall. 'We can grow all kinds of herbs and small crops to compliment our dishes and add that extra twist to them,' she said. Green walls have existed for centuries, with gardeners traditionally training plants to grow up from the ground to cover a wall. But new systems developed over the last couple of years allow planting within containers directly fixed to walls, allowing more complex schemes to be considered, including edible crops. Modular planted panels filled with compost are fixed directly to the exterior of the building, with a void between them and the brickwork to create a drainage layer. Careful research led the team behind the project to choose a non-hydroponic system, since that avoids any risk of water-borne bacteria, like lysteria, from entering the food chain. A remote-controlled care system maintains the crops all year round. Ornamental plants will planted at the top of the garden, with perrenial herbs and aromatics throughout, and seasonal crops interspersed at the lower level. 'The wall is self-watering and would . be continually refreshed with new crops to grow over the relevant . seasons. It's a really exciting project. 'All . of our food is freshly made on the premises, and all of our dishes are . gluten-free and all dietary requirements are catered for. 'We're all about planning for the future and the sustainability of the restaurant, and we're thinking outside the box as to how we can do that. 'It has been a lengthy process but we're all set to go once the final boxes are ticked. It will be worth the wait.' Ms Chadwick explained that getting permission to plant the restaurant's exterior wall has not been as easy as they expected. 'We first came up with the idea about two years ago and thought ""great it's going to be up in six months"" but here we are still planning it today,' she said. 'The response from the public has been fantastic and we've noticed the restaurant has been a lot busier since we announced the plans. 'The biggest challenge is getting the boxes ticked so we can get the wall up and running. We've taken lots into consideration and now we're in the final stages of public consultation.' Elena Jackson of El Piano with some parsley, mint and coriander: Green walls have been around for centuries but new systems developed over the past couple of years allow the planting of walls with food crops . The restaurant is part of an award-winning family-run chain, with two other eateries based in Malaga and Granada, both in Spain. Owner and founding director Magdalena Chavez, a mother of four who moved to York 15 years ago, set up the first El Piano restaurant and oversees the business. Her youngest son Bob, his wife Elena and his mother-in-law Elaina are taking charge of the York site. Ms Chavez splits her time in between taking charge of the Granada site in Spain and the UK, with her daughter Florence and Florence's husband managing the Malaga restaurant. She said the Incredible Edible Walls (IEW) project was a positive attempt to overcome the issues of growing food in an urban environment by using vertical systems for food production. 'It's challenging but fabulously exciting,' she said. 'We see it as a natural progression for both our business and the city of York, embracing sustainable thinking and education alongside food growth, community involvement and national profile.' Although the project still needs planning permission, a spokesman said the concept had been gaining momentum over the last few years in both the UK and Europe. It was based on the concept that individuals should try to grow their own food as locally as possible, she added. Most such schemes in the UK were rural, using existing open areas, but this was difficult to achieve in urban areas, given the restrictions on available space.","York's El Piano at the forefront of project for vertical kitchen gardens .

The U.S. and Russia have named the two men who will spend a year aboard the International Space Station to gather more data on the impact of outer space on humans to help prepare for future interplanetary missions. NASA's Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko of Russia's space agency Roscosmo will take part in the mission set to start in spring 2015. Kelly is the twin brother of Mark Kelly, a fellow astronaut who is also the husband of former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.

The couple has been in the spotlight since Giffords was targeted in a 2011 assassination attempt. Mark Kelly went on to become the skipper of Space Shuttle Endeavour on its last mission later that year. He then retired. A key goal of the Space Station mission is to help reduce health risks for planned NASA missions around the moon, an asteroid and ultimately Mars. Bill Gerstenmaier, NASA's associate administrator, said the year spent on the Space Station 'will increase our knowledge regarding the effects of microgravity on humans as we prepare for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit.'

The one-year increment will expand the bounds of how we . live and work in space and will increase our knowledge regarding the . effects of microgravity on humans as we prepare for future missions . beyond low-Earth orbit.' Scott Kelly, a veteran of several space missions who has logged more than 180 days in space, and Kornienko, who traveled to the station in 2010, will start training for the mission early next year. International crews so far have done only six-month stints on the International Space Station, although many Russian cosmonauts spent longer stints on the Soviet-built Mir space station before it was discarded in 2001.

Boris Morukov, the head of the Moscow-based Institute for Medical and Biological Problems, Russia's main space medicine research center, said on Interfax news agency that the forthcoming mission by Kelly and Kornienko may include tighter controls of their food rations and the limiting of communications to simulate an interplanetary travel, among other things. Kelly is a 48-year-old, divorced Navy captain with two daughters. Kornienko, 52, a rocket engineer, is married with a daughter. 'We have chosen the most responsible, skilled and enthusiastic crew members to expand space exploration, and we have full confidence in them,' Russian Space Agency chief Vladimir Popovkin said in the announcement.","Scott Kelly, the twin of Mark Kelly, will take part in the yearlong mission with Russian Mikhail Kornienko in 2015 .

Amid increasingly combative rhetoric from Pyongyang, Adm. Samuel Locklear, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, said North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles represents a clear threat to the United States and its allies in the region.

He made clear that any U.S. decision would be contingent on where the missile is headed, information that the U.S. could ascertain fairly quickly. He said North Korea is keeping a large percentage of its combat forces along the demilitarized zone with South Korea, a position that allows the North to threaten U.S. and South Korean civilian and military personnel.

An Oklahoma man has pleaded guilty in the strangling deaths of his ex-girlfriend and her four young children. Joshua Durcho, 29, avoided the death penalty by his guilty plea on five counts of first-degree murder, entered on Friday in El Reno, Oklahoma, for the brutal slayings of his 25-year-old former lover and her family. Durcho had strangled Rust and then killed her children because he feared they could testify against him. He then stacked the children's bodies in a bathtub partially filled with water in Rust's apartment. Brutal: Summer Rust and her children - 3-year-old Evynn Garas, 4-year-old Teagin Rust and 7-year-old daughters Kirsten and Autumn Rust - were killed in the family's El Reno, Oklahoma apartment in January 2009 . Durcho was charged with first-degree . murder for the January 2009 strangling deaths of Rust, 25, and her children - 3-year-old Evynn Garas, 4-year-old Teagin Rust and . 7-year-old daughters Kirsten and Autumn Rust. Prosecutors said Durcho also sexually abused the 7-year-old girls. Rust was killed after an argument with Durcho because she threatened to call . police on him when he refused to leave her apartment. After he killed the mom, he feared the children could serve as witnesses against him, so he methodically killed the little ones and left their bodies in the apartment, where they were discovered on January 12, 2009. Guilty: Joshua Durcho (pictured in July) has pleaded guilty to killing his girlfriend and her four children . The victims' family appeared in court on Friday to hear the plea and offer their forgiveness to Durcho. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole, a deal that family members agreed to. 'The death penalty wouldn't have made . me feel any better than him being locked up forever,' said Rhonda Rust, . stepmother of Summer Rust, the woman who was killed.

'I never got to hear what she wanted . to be when she grew up,' the grieving grandmother added. In court, Franklin . spoke directly to Durcho, who was weeping and had trouble standing at . times. 'I do forgive you and may God be with you,' she said. One of Durcho's defense attorneys, . John Echols, said Durcho met with family members privately before the . hearing. Cut short: Rust and her four children in an undated photo . He said Durcho apologized to them, but said he does not . remember much of what happened the day of the killings. He told police that on that fateful January night in 2009, he had blacked out with his hands around Rust's neck. 'Everyone in the victims' families felt this was a better resolution,' Echols said. Jury selection for Durcho's trial had been set to begin Monday and prosecutors had sought the death penalty. Last month, Dr. Shawn Roberson, a . forensic psychologist with the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and . Substance Abuse Services, testified that Durcho's mental functioning was . 'at the low borderline range.' Nonetheless, a judge rejected claims that Durcho is mentally disabled and ineligible for the death penalty.

A 27-year-old Oregon man who allegedly gunned down his wife and three children before taking his own life is now suspected of having killed a stranger whose body was found just blocks away from the slain family's home. According to the Marion County District Attorney's Office, investigators determined that Nikolay 'Nick' Lazukin beat 21-year-old Devin Matlock to death as he was walking home from a friend's apartment at around 2am on May 22. After Lazukin returned to his Salem home, police say he killed his 26-year-old wife, Natalya, and their daughters, three-year-old Angelica, one-year-old Zoe and Sulamia, who was four months old. Tragedy: Investigators say Nikolay Lazukin, right, gunned down his wife, Natalya, left, and their three daughters, two of whom are pictured in this undated photo . Mystery: Lazukin, left, was not intoxicated the night of the murders, and police were not able to determine the motive behind the crimes . Lazukin then allegedly set their house on fire before turning the gun on himself. Bystander: Police said 21-year-old Devin Matlock was walking home from friends' apartment when he ran into Lazukin, who beat him to death with a baseball bat . An autopsy determiner that the father of three young children died from a single gunshot wound to the head. Natalya Lazukin was shot twice in the . head. The oldest daughter was struck once in the head and Zoe was shot twice in the head. Baby Sulamia died of traumatic asphyxiation . in her crib in the master bedroom. The medical examiner also found that . Lazukin was not intoxicated during the four-hour killing spree. No . motive was identified behind the murders. Marion County sheriff's investigators said that Matlock had never crossed paths with the Salem family prior to his murder, Oregon Live reported. Matlock's loved ones were told that he was simply at the wrong place, at the wrong time, according to his sister, Shalee Hernandez. ‘We have to relive the heartache and the pain,’ she told Oregon Live. ‘It's just too much.’ Matlock's friends told investigators . that he had dinner with them and watched a video at the apartment in the . 2400 block of Coral Avenue Northeast before walking home before 2am. They said his usual route included . Fisher Road, where surveillance video spotted Lazukin’s Jeep twice the . night of the murders. That is where a deliveryman discovered the . 21-year-old’s body. Fateful encounter: Matlock's family were told that the young man never crossed paths with his killer and was just in the wrong place at the wrong time . Investigators search in the front yard of a home where the bodies of the woman and children were discovered . Grim discovery: A man in this red car was found in Cottage Grove, 80 miles away from the burned home . Matlock's blood was found on a . baseball bat in Lazukin's Jeep and on his shoes. An autopsy found . imprints from the shoe soles on Matlock's jaw, suggesting that the . 27-year-old stomped on his victim's face. Dr . Larry Newman, with Oregon Medical Examiner’s Office, said Matlock died . of blunt force head injuries and suffered a broken nose, jaw and . cranium. A short time later, investigators . said Lazukin drove to a Super 8 Motel in Salem, where he called out to a . 27-year-old woman. She asked him for a ride, and video showed the two . leaving the motel's parking lot together in the Jeep at around 2.50am. The woman, identified by police as Christine Lowe, later told investigators that Lazukin said . that he lived with his ex-wife and three children and that he was . looking to score some cocaine. He also asked her to go to Hawaii or Mexico with . him. After driving around, the woman said . that Lazukin drove her to his home and parked. He told her he was going . to get some money, and she thought she saw him take ammunition out of . the glove compartment, she told investigators. He then went inside and left her in the Jeep, she said. That is when Lazukin killed his wife and daughters, investigators said. Bullet-riddled loaves of bread were . found throughout the house after Lazukin apparently used them to muffle . the shots from a .380 handgun that a family member had given him, . according to police. Investigators search a car in the front yard of a home where the bodies were found . After murdering his family, Lazukin . poured gasoline from large canisters in the attic stairway, the entry to . the older girls' bedroom and the master bedroom, and set them all . ablaze.

Happier times: The Lazukins' family told police they had no history of domestic abuse, and neighbors described the 27-year-old man as a good father . At one point, investigators said, . Lazukin asked the woman whether she would remember him if police . contacted her, and she said that she would. Lowe said Lazukin gave her $25 to buy a . cell phone and drove her to a local Wal-Mart, but did not wait for her . to come out of the store. Lazukin circled around the area and . apparently saw the delivery truck driver discover Matlock's body along . Fisher Road Northeast shortly before 4.30am, police said. About an hour later, a neighbor saw . smoke rising from the Lazukin home and called firefighters, who found . the bodies of the mother and her children. Lazukin drove onto Interstate 5 and . headed south, investigators said. He stopped in a motel parking lot near . Exit 174 in Cottage Grove, where he sent a disturbing text message to . his father-in-law shortly after 6am which read: . ‘Please forgive me. They took control of my body and did it.

As one of the most secretive nations North Korea remains something of an enigma to the outside world. But one teenage girl, who happens to be the daughter of Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, has been able to capture a rare glimpse of what life is like in the communist state and posted a revealing account along with pictures on her blog. Sophie Schmidt, 19, was allowed to visit the country earlier this month with her father to promote the use of the internet. Scroll down for video . Strange travels: Sophie Schmidt, the daughter of Google chief executive Eric Schmidt travelled with her father to North Korea earlier this month and recently wrote a lengthy blog post of her observations, including photos of the secretive country . Real or make-believe? While university students also have carefully-monitored Internet access and are under strict instructions to access only educational materials, most North Koreans have never surfed the web . Despite her dad remaining tight-lipped . over the exact reasons why they were there, his daughter's musings have . become something of an internet hit with people living in the . outside world clicking onto her blog. She describes how the group of nine, . led by former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson, were told to leave their phones and . laptops behind in China because they were warned they would be . confiscated when they arrived in North Korea. She added: 'It's impossible to know how much we can extrapolate from what we saw in Pyongyang to what the DPRK is really like. 'Our trip was a mixture of highly staged encounters, tightly-orchestrated viewings and what seemed like genuine human moments.' Cold: She described her trip as very strange and very cold; here, the frozen capital of Pyongyang . Warm reception: Despite the secretive nature of the culture and the pre-arranged photo-ops, Ms Schmidt observed that the delegates all felt welcomed . Government state: They entered the country having left their laptops and cell phones in China because they were warned the North Korean government would confiscate them . Learning experience: Ms Schmidt said ordinary North Koreans live in a near-total information bubble, without any true frame of reference; she likened it to 'The Truman Show,' but on a national scale . The blog seems to suggest that a . number of events they attended were staged, likening the country to . The Truman Show, a film starring Jim Carrey.

In past years arriving students would have to make do with some money off vouchers and maybe a notebook if they were lucky. However, Brunel undergraduate Computer Sciences students are set to get something far better when they arrive - their very own robot. The School of Information Systems, Computing and Mathematics (SISCM) has provided 200 robots for first year students to take home, look after and experiment with throughout the year. Students arriving at Brunel University will each be given a robot when they arrive. Lecturers hope it will help them become more engaged with their computing coursework . It is hoped that as well as giving them a chance to work on their practical skills outside the lab, the robots will enable students to compete with one another through tasks such as navigating obstacle courses. This will culminate in a robot Olympics, to be held during the Spring Term. Apart from moving in different directions, the robots (known as finches) have a beak that can change colour, an accelerometer so the orientation is known, IR sensors to detect obstacles, a light sensor, a thermocouple to determine temperature and a buzzer. Professor Martin Shepperd, Undergraduate Programmes Director at SISCM, said: 'Teaching programming to novices is traditionally challenging so we came up with the novel idea of giving each student their own robot to help with their learning. 'The bonus of these finches is that they provide instant feedback - the student can see whether they respond as intended. 'If you write some code for the robot to turn left and it turns right then it's immediately apparent there's a problem. Write caption here . 'We also hope that because they are fun to work with, they will arouse students’ curiosity and help them to gain a better understanding of the subject area.' This is the first time such a large number robots have been given out to students in such a way. The Finches, specifically designed by Carnegie Mellon University to support the teaching of computer science, have the advantage of being robust and affordable. Although the idea is at the development stage SISCM also plan to take the robots into local schools, alongside first and second year students, to help support learning and encourage more children to think about taking up computer sciences.

A teenage girl was allegedly beaten and strangled to death by her mother's former boyfriend before being thrown into a dumpster. The body of Jessica Tetter, 16, was found in Hammond, Indiana, the day after disappearing from her Illinois home last Wednesday. Detectives yesterday charged 27-year-old John Hurt with first-degree murder and concealment of a homicide. 'Battered': The body of 16-year-old Jessica Tetter (pictured) was found in a dumpster in Hammond, Indiana, after allegedly being strangled and beaten to death by her mother's former boyfriend . Assistant Police Chief Dante Zorzi said Hurt was the ex-boyfriend of Tetter’s mother, although the Assistant State's Attorney Sylvie Manaster claimed he was her husband. Tetter's mother said her daughter had stepped in during a row between the couple, who were said to have an 'on again, off again' relationship, last Wednesday, it was reported by The Chicago Tribune. When Tetter's mother returned later that day, Hurt said her daughter had left the house and not come back and refused to help look for the teenager, Manaster said. On Friday, it is claimed he walked into the Calumet City Police Department and told 'a witness... that his daughter tried to fight him and he had killed her'. 'Admits killing': John Hurt (pictured) has been charged with first-degree murder and concealment of a homicide over Miss Tetter's death . Manaster said he admitted to choking her and hauling her body to Hammond. An autopsy by the Lake County Coroner’s Office ruled that she had died of trauma to the head and body. Hurt's bond was set at $1million by Judge Israel Desierto when he appeared at Cook County Bond Court yesterday. Around 200 classmates, friends and teachers gathered at Thornton Fractional North High School in Calumet City on Saturday for a vigil to honour Miss Tetter, it was reported on CBS 2. Track coach Moses Hulbert said: 'I believe that Jessica now is an angel above in heaven, smiling on us.' Her friend Kathryne Sneed said Miss Tetter had taken up boxing for six years and was on the track team. 'She would use that to her advantage and people thought was so funny because she was so small,' she added.

Gonce was arrested outside the cousin's home on August 7, after initially bolting from police and hiding in a rubbish bin. The man was also wanted for a home invasion, where he tied up the owner of the apartment he broke into with electrical cord and threatened him as he searched for cash. Baltimore County police charged Gonce with three counts of second-degree rape and three of second-degree sexual assault. 'He raped and sexually assaulted this girl on three separate occasions,' police spokesman Elise Armacost told The Philadelphia Inquirer. He is being held without bail at the Baltimore County Detention Center in Towson. Behind bars: Gonce is being held without bail at the Baltimore County Detention Center in Towson, pictured . 'The current plan is for him to stand trial on the rape charges here before extradition to Pennsylvania (to face the murder charges),' Armacost said.

After the arrest, he fled Philadelphia, seeking refuge with his cousin on July 28. While in Baltimore, he allegedly raped the young girl on July 31, August 2 and August 6. According to records submitted to Maryland District Court, Gonce admitted the assaults but claimed the child consented to the sex acts. This isn't the first time the 28-year-old has been behind bars. He was released in January after a stint in a Pennsylvania prison for burglary and drug charges. 'He is someone we are glad to get off the street,' Armacost told The Baltimore Sun.","John J.

A mother awoke to find her toddler daughter dead beside her after the child had climbed under the duvet to be close to her, an inquest heard. Sienna-Louise Burns-Hainesborough, aged 15 months, died from sudden childhood death syndrome, the coroner said. The child's mother Kirsty Hainesborough, 24, got the whole family to sleep downstairs in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, because she was worried about some trouble in the street earlier in the day. Happy family: Kirsty Hainesborough (right) holding her daughter Sienna Louise who died after after getting under the duvet as she slept. Her fiance Christopher Burns is holding their other child, Lily . Kirsty put Sienna and her sister Lily to sleep on one sofa with their father Christopher Burns, 30, while she slept on another, the inquest in Cleethorpes Town Hall was told. But in the morning the distraught mother found Sienna's lifeless body at her feet under the duvet after the young child snuggled in with her during the night. The child's father Christopher said the family decided to sleep downstairs in the living room on January 5 last year after some troublemakers had come to the door. He said he had fallen asleep on one sofa, with Sienna-Louise and her sister Lily sleeping at either end. Kirsty was asleep under a duvet on the other sofa. Mother and child: Kirsty holds her daughter Sienna-Louise who died on January 6 last year . In the early hours of January 6, Christopher awoke and could not see Sienna-Louise at his side. On checking the other sofa, he found her under a duvet at her mother's feet. Emergency services were called to the home but they were unable to revive the infant. Both parents told the inquest they were aware of advice, given by health visitors, about the dangers of co-sleeping with children. A post-mortem examination concluded the young girl died from sudden childhood death syndrome. Detective Sergeant John Shepherd said the infant had made her own way from one sofa onto the sofa occupied by her mum. Grimsby and North Lincolnshire Coroner Paul Kelly said: 'She made her own way to the sofa on which her mother was sleeping and burrowed her way under the bedclothes.' He concluded the infant died from unexpected death in childhood in which accidental co-sleeping was a contributory factor. Sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) is less common than sudden infant death. It's estimated to occur in 1.5 deaths per 100,000 live births. By definition, the cause(s) of death in these children is unknown. SUDC generally occurs in children aged one to three, and more often in boys. Factors that may increase the risk include a family history of seizures, a recent minor head trauma and/or a family history of sudden infant death syndrome or SUDC. Most are found prone, often with their face straight down into the sleep surface. The diagnosis of SUDC can be made only after thorough review of the medical history of the child and its family, microscopic evaluation of the scene where the child was found lifeless, and post-mortem examination.

A team of astronomers led by the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR) have produced an astonishing image of their observation of Supernova 1987A. It shows radio emissions and a Hubble image of the supernova first spotted in 1987. The death of a star: Contours of different wavelengths of radio emissions and a Hubble space telescope image of Supernova 1987A combined to provide a unique view of its death throes . In February of 1987 astronomers . observing the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy, noticed the . sudden appearance of what looked like a new star.

In the two and a half decades since . then, the remnant of Supernova 1987A has continued to be a focus for . researchers around the world, providing a wealth of information about . one of the Universe’s most extreme events. In research published in the Astrophysical Journal today, a team of astronomers in Australia and Hong Kong have succeeded in using the Australia Telescope Compact Array,  CSIRO radio telescope in northern New South Wales, to make the highest resolution radio images of the expanding supernova remnant at millimetre wavelengths. 'Imaging distant astronomical objects like this at wavelengths less than 1 centimetre demands the most stable atmospheric conditions,' said lead author, Dr Giovanna Zanardo of . ICRAR, a joint venture of Curtin University and The University of . Western Australia in Perth. 'For this telescope these are usually only possible during cooler winter conditions but even then, the humidity and low elevation of the site makes things very challenging.' Unlike optical telescopes, a radio telescope can operate in the daytime and can peer through gas and dust allowing astronomers to see the inner workings of objects like supernova remnants, radio galaxies and black holes. 'Supernova remnants are like natural particle accelerators, the radio emission we observe comes from electrons spiralling along the magnetic field lines and emitting photons every time they turn. 'The higher the resolution of the images the more we can learn about the structure of this object,' said Professor Lister Staveley-Smith, Deputy Director of ICRAR and CAASTRO, the Centre for All-sky Astrophysics. Scientists study the evolution of supernovae into supernova remnants to gain an insight into the dynamics of these massive explosions and the interaction of the blast wave with the surrounding medium. 'Not only have we been able to analyse the morphology of Supernova 1987A through our high resolution imaging, we have compared it to X-ray and optical data in order to model its likely history,' said Professor Bryan Gaensler, Director of CAASTRO at the University of Sydney. Image of the remnants of 1987A as seen at optical wavelengths with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2011 . The team suspects a compact source or pulsar wind nebula to be sitting in the centre of the radio emission, implying that the supernova explosion did not make the star collapse into a black hole. They will now attempt to observe further into the core and see what’s there. The mysterious body first baffled researchers.

A Chinese mathematician claims to have come up with a new 'third way' to board a plane which could end the unseemly scrum of eager holidaymakers desperate to reach their destination. Dr Tie-Qiao Tang of Beihang University in Beijing said while previous research had offered solutions to luggage congestion, routing and runway scheduling, his was the first to look at boarding. He said that while the number of passengers travelling by air has leapt up, the increase in supply of airline transportation has not kept pace with demand. Easy boarding: A Chinese mathematician claims to have modelled the perfect 'third way' for boarding an aircraft, which he claims could help save airlines money . 'Thus, in practice, certain conflicts between supply and demand often occur, leading to airline congestions, passenger-luggage congestions and mixed traffic problems,' he said. Dr Tang and team from Beihang University and Curtin University in Sydney created mathematical models to compare three styles of boarding strategy. These included boarding completely at random, the current system of assigned seating, and a new way taking into account passengers' individual characteristics like maximum speed and luggage. 'Each passenger has their own individual properties,' Dr Tang told Science Network Western Australia. 'For example, each passenger’s luggage has a different attribution and thus has different influences on boarding behaviour; the time that the passenger’s ticket is checked at the gate is different; the time that the passenger deals with his or her carried luggage is different; seat conflicts have different effects on the passenger. Each passenger has a different optimal speed, maximum speed and safe distance.' Fear of maths can activate regions of the brain linked with the experience of physical pain, a study has found. The higher a person’s anxiety of a maths task, the more it increases activity in regions of their brain associated with visceral threat detection, and often the experience of pain itself, according to researchers Ian Lyons and Sian Beilock, from the University of Chicago, in the journal Plos One. The authors say that previous research has shown that other forms of psychological stress, such as social rejection or a traumatic break-up, can also elicit feelings of physical pain. Findings showed, unsurprisingly, that allowing passengers to board at random was the most inefficient method, leading to naughty travellers queue jumping, congestion in the aisles and jams before the gate and between the gate and the plane. The currently used method - boarding by assigned seating - was better. However it was still inefficient since only passengers in the front of the queue could reach their seats at 'maximum speed' and seat conflicts occurred. Dr Tang's new way was proved to be optimal. This included assigning seat numbers based on passengers' optimal speed, the properties of their hand luggage and tickets checked automatically with electronic equipment at the gate. When passengers boarded the plane this way, according to the model, there was no congestion, jams, overtaking, queue jumping, seat conflict or wasted time. However, questions remain as to how effective such a method would be in practice. Jamie Condliffe, a writer for Gizmodo, notes: 'Airlines could easily work out how carry-on luggage correlates with boarding speed and just add an extra weigh-in to factor how it affects seat allocation, for instance, while walking speed could be guesstimated as a function of age. How well that would work, though, is another question entirely. 'Add to the mix that it would mean that airlines would have to actively profile their customers—something many people wouldn’t be too happy with.' Dr Tang is yet to find an airline to put the theory into practice but said he is open to collaborations to make his 'third way' a travel reality. Findings were published in the journal Transport Research Part C.","Chinese mathematician claims to be the first to model different boarding strategies .

When astronaut Chris Hadfield blasts off to take his role as commander of the ISS space station at the end of the year, many eyes will be watching. For Cmdr Hadfield is building up a legion of fans on Twitter, as he relays all the details - from the mundane to the magical - about life as an astronaut. The 52-year-old Canadian, who served with the Canadian Forces before moving to NASA in 1992, fills his followers in on all the details as he prepares for a trip - his second to the ISS. Sometimes he is sharing pictures from his training, sometimes he is telling wannabe astronauts what they need to do if they ever want to space-walk. Other times he is answering questions on the role of robots in space, or whether you can listen to music as you float above the atmosphere. Sometimes he is explaining how to deal with the delicate situation when you need to take a call of nature in a place where Mother Nature has yet to venture. Asked his opinion on the shuttle Soyuz, which has just delivered another batch of astronauts to the ISS, Christ tells us, in the typical Twitter short-form, that the ship is: 'Rugged, built on experience, it is not delicate. I trust it with my life. One user asks why astronauts carry pencils, to which Chris replies: 'pencils work in all attitudes and pressures, good in the cockpit.' Even astronauts need a haircut: Cmdr Hadfield gets a 'Level-2' chop as he prepares for underwater dives . Chris tweeted this picture of the Soyuz being prepared for launch: The next time it flies into space, he will be onboard . Suited and booted: Cmdr Hadfield gets ready to strap on his kit before an underwater dive . One user asks Chris: 'Dumb pilot question: do you do anything that resembles a ""DI"", and sign out the ""logbook"" before you get in to go?' Chris replied: 'we do 2 full checks of the cockpit and interior. The rocket you just have to trust.' Despite all the preparations, Chris still gets some time off though: Twitter user Phil Reilly ‏ asked: 'Hi Cmdr. Did you watch Astro Mike on The Big Bang Theory?' Chris replied: 'Not yet, but we recorded it to watch later. I went to see The Avengers with friends instead :)' Chris also shares pictures, such as 'my first flight suit' - an Air Cadet glider pilot uniform from around 1975 - in Chris's 'pre-moustache' days. On to important questions. One users asks: 'How do you scratch an itch in a spacesuit? Drive you crazy?'.

A bus driver murdered his 12-year-old stepdaughter after becoming frustrated at not being able to get out of an arranged marriage with her mother. David Hang, 43, was yesterday convicted of stabbing Jessica Nguyen more than 40 times with a machete at the family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in May last year. He had married her Vietnamese mother, Kim Vu, so that she could get U.S. citizenship, the prosecution told Montgomery County Circuit Court. Guilty: David Hang (left) was convicted of stabbing Jessica Nguyen (right) 43 times with a machete at the family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland, in May last year . But he met another woman and wanted to end his sham marriage, a request that Vu and her relatives refused. State attorney John McCarthy said: . 'The family would not let him out of the marriage as soon as he wanted. He let it be known he would get revenge.' Hang took out his anger and frustration on Jessica, stabbing her 43 times with a small sword on May 31, 2011. A knife case with his DNA on it was . found beside her body in the basement of the family home. The knife was . never found, reports MyFoxDC.com. Mr McCarthy said: 'This was clearly . premeditated. We'll be seeking a sentence of life without parole. We . think he should die in prison for this crime.' Hang had wanted to get medical insurance for his new partner but was unable to do so while married to Vu. Replica murder weapon: A knife case with Hang's DNA on it was found beside the body. The knife was never found . His lawyer told the court that he was at a doctor's appointment in Virginia with his girlfriend at the time of the murder. Brian Shefferman suggested Jessica could have been killed by a burglar or a pervert. He said: 'David Hang is not the right . person. He did not commit the crime. He had no reason to harm Jessica . Nguyen. He did not harm Jessica Nguyen.' But the court was shown mobile phone records that indicated Hang was near the murder scene at the time. During his closing argument, prosecutor Stephen Chaikin showed the jury photographs of Jessica's mutilated body. He told the jury: 'This was personal. Hold this monster accountable.' Speaking outside court, Jessica's . relative Hoa Dinh said: 'Even though it won't bring Jessica back to us, . we are grateful to know David Hang will never get out of prison, and he . can't hurt the community.' Hang will be sentenced on October 29.","David Hang, 43, stabbed Jessica Nguyen 43 times with a machete at family home in Gaithersburg, Maryland ."

Chelsea Thornton, 23, faces two counts of first-degree murder after police said she confessed to the killings at her apartment in New Orleans, Louisiana, where she had moved just a week ago. The children's grandmother found the bodies of Chelsea Adams, 4, and Kendall Adams, 3, in the bathtub of the home around 5.30pm on Wednesday and immediately called police. Scroll down for video . 'Killer': Chelsea Thornton, 23, admitted to shooting her son, 3, and drowning her daughter, 4, police said. She left their bodies and took a bus to hospital as she had a headache and stomach pains . Her son - the father of the children - had told her to check on the children after Thornton had asked him to meet her at hospital as she was feeling sick, The Times-Picayune reported. When the man, 29, arrived at the hospital to meet Thornton, he asked where the children were, and she responded they were at day care, so he sent his mother to check the home. The grandmother arrived at the apartment to find the bodies. No one else was there, police said. Police arrived on the scene after 5.30pm and carried out the children's bodies behind white sheets to the coroner's van as weeping friends, relatives and neighbours swarmed around the house. Discovery: Police arrived at the home at 5.30pm on Wednesday after the children's grandmother found them . Murdered: The children's bodies were carried out behind a white sheet to the coroner's van . 'It's a terrible, terrible tragedy,' Police Superintendent Ronal Serpas said. 'It's a . very, very sad case.' Officers swooped on the mother and she confessed to the killings in a taped interview with investigators, they said. She was arrested at 11pm. The investigation continues as authorities try to unearth what led the mother to kill the children. A cousin of the children's father, who does not live with Thornton, spoke to reporters outside the apartment on Wednesday and said the couple had had an on-off relationship for five years. 'He tried to help her and help their kids, and other family members also tried to help her,' Nicole Hammons told WDSU. 'You can only go so far.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:20 EST, 22 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 18:23 EST, 22 May 2012 . A Florida mother shot dead her four children at point-blank range and reloaded her revolver three times, according to a chilling new report. The medical examiner’s report shows that her four teenaged children were shot a total of 18 times with hollow-point bullets. The last shot was a self-inflicted gunshot wound to 33-year-old mother Tonya Thomas’ heart, the medical report shows. Thomas fatally shot her children Pebbles, 17,Jaxs, 15, Jazzlin, 13, and Joel, 12, before turning the gun on herself on May 15, shocking the quiet neighbourhood. Scroll Down for Video and to Hear the 911 Call . Victims: Tonya Thomas' four children are seen here in school pictures, clockwise from top left: Pebbles 17, Jaxs, 15, Joel, 12 and Jazlin, 13; the autopsy report shows they were shot a total of 18 times . Farewell: People attend a funeral service for mother Tonya Thomas and her children yesterday at the Temple Baptist church in Titusville, Florida; five white caskets sat in front of the church . Medical examiner Dr Sajid Qaiser said in his report that Jaxs was shot point blank in the chest three times, and was discovered in the family room of her Port St John, Florida home. Suicide: Tonya Thomas, seen in a a 2002 mug, shot her children a total of 18 times, an autopsy report shows . Pebbles, who was found in the front lawn, died from three gunshots fired more than three feet away, Florida Today said. Their sister Jazzlyn was shot seven times, two of which were shot directly into her chest. The teenager was discovered in the home’s foyer. Florida authorities said that Thomas’ revolver held only six clips, meaning she had to reload her gun four times. They estimate that it took her around 20 seconds each time to reload the .38-calibre revolver. Hollow-point bullets are the most dangerous, as they cause the most tissue damage and blood loss. Neighbours of Thomas made a 911 call as they responded to hearing gunfire coming from the property next door and went downstairs after their front door was knocked. 'I knew this was gonna happen you guys,' the crying female caller told the dispatcher as the deaths of the teenagers unfolded in front of their eyes. 'The boy's in our front yard - get him a towel - he's got blood on his right side.' During the chaotic phone call to dispatchers, the husband tells them that he is armed and willing to defend his house from the injured children trying to flee their murderous mother. 'I grabbed my gun and ran outside and one's laying there bleeding at the front door,' the man is heard to say. Tragic: Pebbles Johnson, 17, (pictured) was found having been shot in the front yard. She was taken by police car to an ambulance but later died from her injuries . Young: Jazlin Johnson, 13, (left), and her brother Jaxs Johnson, 15, (right) were both killed in the shootings and Jaxs tried to gain entry into his neighbours house before he was killed but was refused entry . 'I don't know who has the gun, so I'm not walking out there. I'm armed, but not going out there and putting myself in danger.' After asking the husband where the bleeding child had gone, the caller responded that 'he went back to the residence.' Soon after this the police arrived at 7245 Bright Avenue in Brevard County to see Thomas standing in the doorway of her front door holding a gun, before she went back inside. Then the deputies discovered Pebbles lying fatally injured in the front yard of her house. Shots were heard to ring out and as the deputies entered they discovered Jaxs, Jazzlyn, Joel and Tonya's bodies shot to death. Authorities said they have no motive for the killings and are not sure why the children followed the mother's orders to return back to their house. Dispatch records released on Tuesday show that authorities responded to Thomas' house on three successive days in April. Evidence: Brevard County Crime Scene Investigators look for clues at the scene of the shooting in Port St. John . Unable to speculate: Police said they don't know what the mother's motive was for killing her four children . In the first visit, on Easter Sunday, Thomas reported that her son had thrown a bicycle through a window at the house. The next day, . Thomas called to report that her son had kicked and punched her when she tried to wake him up for school. The following day, child welfare investigators visited the house to look into allegations of inadequate supervision of the children. Records also showed that Thomas was arrested in 2002 on a misdemeanor battery charge for striking the father of her children. The charge was later dropped. Two years earlier, she filed a domestic violence complaint against Joe Johnson, but that was dismissed after a hearing. Neighbour Travis St. Peter, told Florida Today that the family was known in the area for being disruptive, with police often being called to the house. 'They were just known for being hoodlums,' he said of the children, adding that they were often seen running around late at night, 'terrorizing our dogs and setting off firecrackers'. Standoff: Police were called to the Port St John scene at around 5am last Tuesday . Calm before the storm: The Port St John neighbourhood where the family lived . Jamie Hudson, whose mother lives two doors down from the family, told the Miami Herald that the boys in the family were known to shoot BB guns at a home across the street and had threatened to set it on fire. A friend of Thomas told the Sentinel that he had woken to a text message sent by the woman at around 3am to say that she wished to be cremated along with her children. He did not see the message until he woke up this morning, hours after the killings. Former Orange County Sheriff's Department officer James Copenhaver told CFNews13.com that deputies would be analysing Thomas’ phone activity in the days leading up to the shooting. ‘This may also give some insight as to why she did this,’ he said. More would be known, he said, after the 911 tapes were released, including how many emergency calls were made and potentially how many shots were fired. He said that toxicology tests would be run on her to determine whether or not she was taking drugs and added that domestic violence would likely have been involved, based on past experience of similar cases. On a live chat with the former officer someone who identified themselves only as 'G' wrote that Thomas was a 'private, independent character', adding that there were 'so many components in her life'. At least three of the children killed went to Space Coast Junior-Senior High School, according toCFNews13.com. Brevard Public Schools said grief counselors have been sent to the victims' schools. Brevard County Sheriff's spokesman Tom Goodyear said that he was having a hard time trying to understand how a mother could commit such a grisly act. 'I cannot comprehend as a parent doing this to their children ... calling them back in and shooting them,' he said.","Mother Tonya Thomas fatally shot her four children, ages 12-17, last week .

Bet Google can't even eat cheese: Computers - while helping direct and organise our lives - are still 'dumb boxes' for the moment . Google has spent the last 15 years becoming smarter and smarter, learning how to power our lives - from our homes, our cars, our phones. But - and with apologies to founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin - all of that work is still no match to the intelligence of a common rat. Or taking it further, even a gnat. The point was made by artificial intelligence researchers Yann LeCun and Josh Tenenbaum, who were not criticising the search engine, just pointing out how much further we have to go until we can create computers which contain - or at least, perfectly mimic - intelligent life. The researchers, speaking at the World Science Festival, pointed out that for all of Google's intelligence, it is still simply learning by rote - just recalling and matching patterns in the information pumped into it. LeCun, a professor of computer and neural science at New York University, said: 'It's rote learning; there's no understanding.' He said that even the most powerful computers in the world are, in terms of ability, at best approaching that of an insect - and he added: 'I would be happy in my lifetime to build a machine as intelligent as a rat.' While many of us benefit from the ease and simplicity of programs like Google Maps for navigation, Tenenbaum, a professor of computational computer science at MIT, said: 'That's very easy. 'It's not even called it AI anymore. It's just called Google. 'That whole context of communication intelligence, of getting inside . another person just by the data of what they say and you say back, . that's the heart of human intelligence.' Clever - but still learning: Google Navigation, pictured here on an Android phone, is a clever, intelligent-seeming system - but it is still just code, following instructions . To give a comparison for the monumental task ahead of AI researchers, LeCun described the mechanics of the human brain - how our brains power 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 connections every single second, all working together to provide us with our continuous self-awareness, learning and curiosity. But LeCun was optimistic about our chances, saying: 'The power of supercomputers increases exponentially [and we will reach that ability] somewhere between 30 and 100 years. 'Then we wait another 10 or 20 years, and it fits in your smartphone. So then your smartphone is smarter than you.'","Clever technology such as Google is still powered by rote-learning and pattern-matching, say AI researchers...

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:42 EST, 23 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:17 EST, 23 April 2013 . A couple serving probation for the 2009 death of their toddler after they turned to prayer instead of a doctor could face new charges now that another of their children has died. Herbert and Catherine Schaible belong to a fundamentalist Christian church that believes in faith healing over traditional medicine. Philadelphia Judge Benjamin Lerner said at a hearing they violated the most important condition of their probation: to seek medical care for their remaining children. Facing new charges: Herbert and Catherine Schaible, from Philadelphia, have lost a second son after the 2009 death of their toddler . The Schaibles have yet to be charged in the death of the eight-month-old boy last week. He suffered from diarrhea and breathing problems for days. Authorities are awaiting autopsy results. Catherine Schaible's lawyer says the couple are good parents and that they are deeply distraught over the loss of another child. In 2009, the couple prayed instead of calling a doctor while their two-year-old son Kent was left to die of pneumonia. Herbert and Catherine Schaible told homicide detectives at the time: ‘We tried to fight the devil, but in the end the devil won.' The parents are members of the controversial First Century Gospel Church which tells members it is a sin to use medicine. Faith-healing: First Century Gospel Church, where the parents are members, says using medicine is a sin . Beliefs: Pastor Nelson Clark of the First Century Gospel Church tells followers to shun 21-century medicine for the power of prayer . They were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment in December 2010 after their son Kent died from bacterial pneumonia. A judge spared them jail, but said they must take their remaining seven children for regular check-ups with a doctor. It is estimated that around a dozen U.S. children die in faith-healing cases each year, a handful of which spawn criminal charges, according to experts. The First Century Gospel Church of Philadelphia’s teachings has clashed with authorities in the past. In 1991, eight children died in a measles epidemic. All the parents were members of either First Century Gospel Church or the nearby Faith Tabernacle of Nicetown which also preaches faith-healing. The tragedies are not isolated to Pennsylvania. In Oregon, Jeff and Marci Beagley, were sentenced to 16 months in 2010 for the death of their 16-year-old son. The couple refused to use medicine for their son Neil, who was suffering from a preventable urinary tract blockage. Instead, they prayed and used anointing oils in the hope of divine intervention. 'Too many children have died unnecessarily - a graveyard full,' Judge Steven Maurer said at their sentencing. 'This has to stop.' They were also sentenced to ten years probation. The Philadelphia court heard that in January 2009 the couple refused to call a doctor during the two weeks their son was sick with a cold, which eventually led to pneumonia. His symptoms included coughing, congestion, fatigue and a loss of appetite, although his parents claimed he was eating and drinking until his final day. The 42-year-old father teaches at a school affiliated with the church. His wife, 41, previously taught there, but now stays at home with the couple's children. They both grew up in the church and have never received medical care, apart from help from an 84-year-old lay midwife who attends home births, according to pastor Nelson A. Clark. Clarke explained that the church did not shun members who seek medical care, but prayed that they make a different choice next time. Using medicine is considered a sin by the church. Following the guilty verdict Clark said: ‘The legal community is trying to force our church group to put them in the hands of this flawed medical system, when they have chosen to put them in the hands of a perfect God, who does not make mistakes.’ Jeff Beagley and his wife Marci were sentenced last year to 16 months in 2010 after using oils and prayer instead of medicine to treat their son, Neil, who then died from a preventable urinary tract blockage .",Herbert and Catherine Schaibles have yet to be charged in death of eight-month-old boy last week as authorities await autopsy results .

An American woman who was kidnapped in Yemen is expected to stand up in court against the Islamic hate preacher who orchestrated her terrifying ordeal. Mary Quin was abducted along with 15 other tourists in 1998 by militants who were instructed by hate preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri. During the tour group's rescue, she was used as a human shield and four other hostages were killed. Scroll down to watch the video . Facing evil: Mary Quin (left) who was taken hostage in Yemen in 1998 could prove a valuable witness against Cleric Abu Hamza who is charged with orchestrating the attack . In this courtroom sketch, radical Islamist . preacher Abu Hamza al-Masri (R) appears before before U.S. Magistrate . Judge Frank Maas (L) in Federal Court in New York . Hamza appeared at federal court in New York on Saturday after being extradited from Britain. Hamza faces 11 counts of criminal conduct related to the taking . of 16 hostages in Yemen in 1998, advocating violent jihad in . Afghanistan in 2001 and conspiring to establish a jihad training camp in . Bly, Oregon, between June 2000 and December 2001. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara called the extraditions 'a watershed moment in our nation's efforts to eradicate terrorism.' He . added: 'As is charged, these are men who were at the nerve centers of . Al Qaeda's acts of terror, and they caused blood to be shed, lives to be . lost, and families to be shattered.' If found guilty, 54-year-old Hamza is likely to die behind bars. Ms Quin could be a crucial witness to the trial. After her ordeal in Yemen, she investigated the reasons why her tour group was attacked and discovered that radicals wanted to swop tourists for terror suspects who had been arrested including the son and stepson of Hamza. The Federal Court in New York, left, where Hamza, sketched right in court, appeared this morning . She traveled to London when she . tracked down Hamza at his mosque and demanded he answer her questions to . which he agreed. He admitted helping the militants in Yemen carry out . the attack. Ms Quin, 59, who wrote a book about her experiences in 2005, now lives in Anchorage and runs a boutique. While at court on Saturday, Hamza demanded the return of his notorious hooks. The . hate preacher, who lost his hands in an explosion, did not enter a plea . during the brief hearing and was remanded in custody ahead of his next . appearance on Tuesday. Ordeal: Ms Quin wrote a book about being kidnapped by militants in the Yemeni desert . The . former imam, who had his hooks removed for . 'security reasons', has demanded they are returned so 'he can use his . arms'. Also in New York, Adel Abdul Bary and . Khaled al-Fawwaz pleaded not guilty while earlier in the day Babar Ahmad . and Talha Ahsan pleaded not guilty in a court in Connecticut. He entered no plea in the Manhattan court, while four other alleged jihadists - Syed Talha Ahsan, Babar Ahmad, Khaled . al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul Bary - all pleaded not guilty to a series of terrorist offences. Hamza came into . court without his recognizable hooks, and with both arms exposed through . his short-sleeved blue prison shirt. His court-appointed lawyer, . Sabrina Shroff, asked that his prosthetics be immediately returned 'so . he can use his arms'. The . Islamist fanatic lost the last of his countless appeals in a legal . farce that has seen him thwart extradition from Britain for more than eight years. An armoured police van collected the hate preacher from HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 7.30pm on Friday, just a few hours after the decision was made. The van, heavily flanked by a . number of other police vehicles with their emergency lights on, drove more than 130 miles to the U.S Air Force base RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk. Two planes carrying the suspects took off shortly before midnight. The convoy of vehicles with blue . flashing lights earlier entered the military base through a side . entrance at 10.10pm after completing the journey in just under three . hours. Paperwork was . then completed and after years of fighting against it, the group were . successfully handed over to U.S. marshals, who were waiting to escort . them on the 3,700-mile flight to the United States. 'Deteriorating health': Abu Hamza asked the High Court to grant him time for an MRI scan as he renewed a long-running legal battle to halt his extradition from the UK to the US . Last week, Hamza’s lawyers – in a move . condemned as a blatant delaying tactic – had gone back to court again . to claim he was unfit to stand trial. They . said the ‘harsh’ conditions in his cell at HMP Belmarsh had left him . unwell, sleep-deprived and depressed – and demanded an MRI scan. After . a three-day hearing, a judge at the High Court in London said . he was ‘wholly unpersuaded’ by their claims, adding: ‘The sooner he is . put on trial, the better.’ Making . clear no further appeals would be allowed in the case, Sir John Thomas, . President of the Queen’s Bench Division, rejected the idea that Hamza . was unfit to plead. If depressed, he said, Hamza could get anti-depressants in the U.S. He also criticised delays in the . extradition process, saying it was ‘unacceptable’ that the case should . have taken so long, and warning of ‘real dangers’ of a system that . allows repeated appeals on issues that had already been decided. The judges also rejected legal . challenges by Babar Ahmad, Syed Ahsan, Khaled Al-Fawwaz and Adel Abdul . Bary, who were part of the convoy to arrive at the airbase. Justice: Hamza is set to face trial over charges he set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon . A . 20-seater Gulfstream V jet owned by the US Department of Justice and a . privately-owned Dassault Falcon 900 jet were visible from the airfield . perimeter. The two . white aircraft were in stark contrast to the base's fleet of United . States Air Force KC-135 fuel tanker jets and C-130 transport planes. Official . flight records reveal that the twin-engine Gulfstream jet arrived at RAF . Mildenhall on Tuesday night after a six hour and 27 minute flight from . Reagan National airport in Washington DC. A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said: 'These . extraditions mark the end of a lengthy process of litigation through . the UK courts and the ECHR. 'The U.S. government agrees with the . ECHR's findings that the conditions of confinement in U.S. prisons - . including in maximum security facilities - do not violate European . standards. The Gulfstream aircraft believed to contain Cleric Abu Hamza takes off from RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk just hours after he lost his final legal fight to remain in Britain . The plane shortly before it took off from the American air base, where it had been waiting for a number of days . 'The law enforcement relationship . between the United States and United Kingdom is predicated on trust, . respect, and the common goals of protecting our nations and eliminating . safe havens for criminals, including terrorists.' Hamza, who is missing his right . hand and an eye, has celebrated the September 11 terror attacks . and preached jihad to a young congregation. Hamza, who was jailed for seven years . for soliciting to murder and inciting racial hatred in 2006, first . faced an extradition request from America in 2004. All five cases returned to the High . Court after judges at the European Court of Human Rights refused to . intervene and stop the Home Secretary extraditing them. Between 1999 and 2006, the men were indicted on various terrorism charges in America. Ahmad, . a computer expert from south London, and Ahsan are accused of offences . including using a website to provide support to terrorists and . conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim or injure persons or damage property in . a foreign country. A cavalcade of police vehicles carrying Hamza leaving HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire . They . wanted their removal stopped so that they could challenge a decision by . the Director of Public Prosecutions not to allow British businessman . Karl Watkin, a campaigner against the UK’s extradition arrangements with . the United States, to bring prosecutions against them in the UK. Bary and Al-Fawwaz were indicted - . with Osama bin Laden and 20 others - for their alleged involvement in, . or support for, the bombing of US embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam . in 1998.Al-Fawwaz faces more than 269 counts of murder. Hamza once appeared to embrace Western society and worked as a bouncer in a Soho nightclub. He had a reputation for socializing and heavy drinking when he first came to Britain from Egypt 30 years ago. Born in Alexandria, he studied civil engineering and in 1984 married a British woman, Valerie Fleming. But throughout the 1980s he slowly began to turn towards a fundamentalist interpretation of the Koran. In 1990 he divorced his wife and returned to Egypt where he reinvented himself as a Muslim 'holy man' or sheikh. He traveled to Pakistan and then on to Afghanistan which was at the time gripped by civil war as differing factions fought to fill the power vacuum left by the retreat of Russian troops. It is unclear if he fought there but when he returned to the UK with his British passport in the early 1990s he was missing his right hand and an eye. He claims he lost the hand fighting jihad in Afghanistan. In 1996 he re-emerged at Finsbury Park Mosque in north London preaching jihad to a young congregation. Then in January 1999 three British . tourists were killed in Yemen, drawing public attention to the civil war . between fundamentalists and the secular government there, which accused . Abu Hamza of using his mosque to recruit Islamic warriors to the . fundamentalist cause. He . was alleged to have been the leader of a cell called Supporters of . Sharia. Yemen said that it wanted him extradited. But Hamza continued to court controversy. Following the September 11 attacks in the US, he said: 'Many people will be happy, jumping up and down at this moment'.

Husband and wife: Christopher Vaughn, left, was arrested five years ago . in the shooting deaths of his wife Kimberly, right, and three children . Vaughn, 37, was arrested at a funeral home in suburban St. Louis hours before a memorial service for his wife and children. He pleaded not guilty and insists the killings were at the hands of his wife. In custody: Vaughn told cops in 2007 that his wife shot him before killing the children and committing suicide . 'It's a case of murder-suicide,' said . Vaughn's defence attorney, George Lenard. 'Christopher Vaughn is not . responsible for the deaths.'Opening statements are slated for August 20 and the trial is expected to last four to six weeks, according to attorneys. It is the second high-profile trial at the Will County courthouse and will be held in the courtroom next to the Drew Peterson murder trial. The Vaughn deaths made headlines in . 2007 partly because the family recently had been featured in a Chicago . Sun-Times real estate article. They had moved from Washington state to the Chicago area and bought a spacious home. The article was accompanied by a . photo of the couple sitting at a dining table, their three smiling . children standing behind them. After Christopher Vaughn's arrest, prosecutors had vowed to seek the death penalty, which Illinois abolished last year. Chuck . Pelkie, a spokesman for the Will County State's Attorney's office, . declined to discuss specifics of prosecutors' approach to the case . before trial. Victims: Christopher Vaughn is accused of killing his wife and three children - (from left) Abigayle, 12, Cassandra, 11, Blake, 8 . Murder or suicide? Christopher Vaughn's said his wife was the one who fired the fatal shots before killing herself . 'It's a case that the office is ready and eager to move forward with,' he said. 'It's been a long time.' Evidence may include a magazine article that court records say police found at Vaughn's home about staging crime scenes and 'making the death appear to be a suicide.' Court records also show that Vaughn spent time at a shooting range the night before the deaths and fired at targets with a gun that police later found near Kimberly Vaughn in the car. Neighbours: Vaughn's trial is slated to take place next to the trial of Drew Peterson, who's accused of killing his third wife . Legal proceedings also revealed that Christopher Vaughn was the beneficiary of his wife's $1million life insurance policy. In 2009, her family filed a wrongful death suit to keep him from claiming any assets. Among those could testify are an exotic dancer who Vaughn visited days before the killings. Prosecutors have said that Vaughn had lied to her about his identity and talked of the future. Vaughn's defence is expected to delve into Kimberly Vaughn's life and health, and likely will include that she was taking an anti-seizure drug at the time of her death that federal health officials have said can increase the risk of suicidal behaviour. Vaughn, a computer security consultant, told police in 2007 that his wife shot him in the leg before killing the children and committing suicide. Vaughn had superficial gunshot wounds to the leg and arm. Court records show the children were each shot twice and Kimberly Vaughn was shot once under the chin. According to Christopher Vaughn's account, the family had been headed on a trip and Vaughn said that he had stopped to secure luggage on the roof of the vehicle. His wife allegedly started shooting shortly after that and he told police he fled the scene to escape.Vaughn has been held without bond in Will County. 'He's ready for trial, he's been waiting for a long time,' Lenard said.","Cops say Christopher Vaughn gunned down his wife and three children .

NASA has unveiled a new project to create tiny, cheap satellites by using the innards of a mobile phone. Called PhoneSat, it will use a specially modified Nexus S handset running Google's Android software. Scroll down for video . High-flying: The PhoneSat, pictured during a test flight, will be the cheapest and easiest-to-construct satellite to go into orbit . PhoneSat is designed to send the . cheapest and easiest-to-construct satellites into orbit while running on . Google's Android operating system. 'Out of the box smartphones already offer a wealth of capabilities needed for satellite systems, including fast processors, versatile operating systems, multiple miniature sensors, high-resolution cameras, GPS receivers, and several radios,' said NASA. Under the program, the space agency will launch three smartphones into space, and take photos of the earth with its camera. It will also publish the plans to allow anyone to create their own satellites. Wired.com reported that the initial test - PhoneSat 1.0 - cost about $3,500 to construct and used a Nexus One smartphone. PhoneSat 2.0 will involve a Nexus S phone. Boxed: NASA plans to launch a smartphone into space in this box, designed to protect it as it flies through space . NASA issued a challenge in April to find the person who can deliver the most effective application for the PhoneSat to use. While the app’s design will be mostly up to its creator, NASA insists that the app include a star tracker, fire locator, altitude determination app and a radiation monitor. Also important to the agency is a 'single event upset (SEU) detector’ app, which would increase the PhoneSat’s reliability. Three PhoneSat systems, will be sent into space by the Orbital Sciences Corporation’s Antares rocket later this year, according to NASA. Each phone will be contained in CubeSat, a four-inch metal box that will protect the smartphone as it orbits in space. However, the agency is also publishing the plans, and has already begun world on PhoneSat 3.0, which uses a foldable design and can link together dozens of satellites. NASA has opted to use Google's software as it is more open and easier to customise. The news came as Google attempted to . ease the concerns of shareholders who fear that Apple may now target . them after the success of a patent lawsuit against Samsung. The . search engine giant issued a statement in the wake of the $1billion . victory that Apple won from a California court, saying that the portions . of Samsung's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to . their software. If that is the case, then Apple will have no case against Google. Small wonder: The CubeSat is a four-inch metal box, about the size of a coffee cup . 'The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the U.S. Patent Office,' Google officials said in a statement on Monday. Google provided their Android operating system to companies like Samsung for free, and allowed the companies themselves to make their own tweaks to the software.

Ali-Mohamed Mohamud was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder for beating to death his 10-year-old stepson. Homicide detectives and prosecutors in Buffalo, New York, said the case was one of the worst they had ever seen. After . duct-taping a sock in the boy’s mouth and binding his hands with . electrical cord, the stepfather savagely beat the boy so bad he . separated the his head from the spinal cord, crushing the back . of his head and exposing his brain, according to court testimony. Scroll down for video . Tragic: Abdifatah Mohamud, ten, called 911 several times to report abuse at the hands of his stepfather Ali Mohamed Mohamud, who is now accused of beating him to death . 'Justice has been done,' prosecutor Thomas M. Finnerty said after the verdict, reached after three hours of jury deliberations. Mohamud could face 25 years to life in prison when sentenced November 15, reports the The Buffalo News. The death could have been avoided after it was revealed the boy called 911 twice in the past year to report abuse. Abdifatah Mohamud, from Buffalo, New York, was found beaten to death in his family's basement last week. He was bound, gagged and struck repeatedly with a rolling pin. Though the Buffalo Police Department is investigating how officers handled the calls, they did confirm they reported the allegations to Erie County Child Protective Services - who are accused of not doing enough to help the boy or remove him from the home. They are refusing to comment on the case. A police department spokesman says the police commissioner ordered the investigation into 911 calls made in April 2011, when Abdifatah told authorities his stepfather Ali-Mohamad Mohamud was abusing him. Ali-Mohamed Mohamud listens as his defense attorney makes closing arguments in his murder trial. Officers responding to a missing child report last week found the boy's body. The 40-year-old security guard has pleaded not guilty to a second-degree murder charge. The Buffalo News said that the officers who responded to the 911 calls immediately reported the allegations to Erie County Child Protective Services and made a domestic incident report, which they also passed on to CPS. The agency failed to remove Abdifatah from the home after this report. Peter Anderson, spokesman for Erie County Executive Mark C. Poloncarz, told the Buffalo News that confidentiality laws prevent him from commenting on any response by the county's Child Protective Services Division regarding Abdifatah. He said: 'Personally speaking, I have children of my own, and as a father, this tears at my heart. However, because of state law, we can't comment on this case.' Prosecutor Thomas M. Finnerty holds the rolling pin Ali-Mohamed Mohamud used to bludgeon to death his 10-year-old stepson. Principal at International . Preparatory School, where the ten-year-old was a fifth-grade student, . said there were troubling warning signs, but the family did a good job . of covering it up. Kathy . Jamil said in June 2011 he came to school badly beaten up with a swollen . forehead and two swollen, black eyes. His father told his teacher he . had been in a fight on the bus with another boy. He had that day been 'horsing around' with another student but no one actually witnessed the alleged fight. Principal . Jamil said: 'It was very suspicious. But because the student had . admitted to wrestling with him and pushing him, it was very possible . that he had just got hit the wrong way on the window. 'I tried to stress in him that he would be safe with me, and he said, ""I just had a fight on the bus.''CPS . officials were also said to have investigated after the boy showed up . severely bruised at school but never saw fit to remove him from the . home. Principal Jamil also . revealed to WIVB 4 that Abdifatah would say alarming things like: 'I'm . going to get killed, I'm going to be in so much trouble', but then would . follow it by laughing so no one was really sure if he was telling the . truth. She said: 'The . students, they've been saying, ""Maybe we should have said this"" or . ""Maybe we should have been asking more."" The staff also wonders what . they could have done differently.' According . to the police report filed last April with CPS, Somalia-born Mohamud . explained to the investigating officers that his stepson was accusing . him of child abuse because of issues over the boy doing his homework. Ali-Mohamed Mohamud enters the courtroom where he is on trial for murdering his 10-year-old stepson. Scene: Police sealed off the Buffalo home after they found Abdifatah tied to a chair, gagged and beaten to death by a rolling pin after his mother reported him missing . When . he confessed to killing his son on April 17, he again said he was . attempting to discipline his son, who he claimed was kicking him. The . 40-year-old admitted tying up his son's hands, tying him to a chair, . sticking a sock in his mouth before duct-taping it shut and then beating . him with a rolling pin. He said it was the first time he ever harmed . the boy. An autopsy found he had been struck 70 times. Accused: Ali-Mohamed Mohamud, a Somalia native, admitted killing his stepson because he was trying to discipline him over falling behind in his homework . Police investigators were shocked over the viciousness of the beating, according to Buffalo Police Commissioner Daniel Derenda. 'Every . homicide is bad, but it is particularly hard to deal with for first . responders, police and others, when it is a ten-year-old child,' he said . during a press conference. 'In talking to investigators, I was told it . was one of the most grisly crime scenes that they can remember, and some . have been here 40 years.' It was spring break and Abdifatah had just returned from staying at a relative's house for a week when he was killed. A . neighbor, who did not want to be named, told officers she had seen him . running for his life down the street. When she stopped to help him he . told her: 'I don't want to go back with him.' The . stepfather caught up with them and told her he had fallen behind in his . homework and was running away before asking if she could give them a . ride home. She agreed, . telling Abdifatah: 'Your daddy says everything will be OK. If something . happens come back and tell me tomorrow morning.' 'I may have been the last person to see him alive,' she admitted to police.

Officers . reported they did not see any physical signs of abuse on the child when . they arrived on April 18, 2011, though they did not ask him to take his . clothes off for a closer examination.

A Chinese food lover has eaten at 6,300 different restaurants and travelled across America feeding his obsession with Oriental cuisine. But despite eating Chinese food all his life, David Chan still cannot use chopsticks. Mr Chan's quest began in earnest after college when he tried to eat at every Chinese restaurant in his home city of Los Angeles. His passion for the cuisine has since taken him to 50 states. The 64-year-old accountant has charted every meal on an Excel spreadsheet and over the past 58 years, Mr Chan has tried a new Chinese restaurant on average every three days. His incredible feat is even more remarkable as Mr Chan hated Chinese food when he was a child. The third-generation Asian-American preferred spaghetti or meatloaf until he discovered the joys of Chinese food when he was at college. Such is Mr Chan’s expertise on Chinese food that restaurant critics often ask him for suggestions on good places to try and he has also written about the country’s cuisine and history. He said that he discovered Chinese food as a way of connecting with his culture. When he got his first job, Mr Chan befriended a group of colleagues from Hong Kong and they set out on trying every restaurant they could find. Mr Chan told The Los Angeles Times: 'I've always been a collector. I collected stamps and records.' However, his love of Chinese food did not stem from childhood. Koi Palace topped topped the list as Mr Chan praised it for its continuing excellence . Mr Chan has travelled around the U.S. sampling traditional and American-Chinese fusion food (file picture) 1) Koi Palace, Daly City, California: Mr Chan praised it for continuing excellence . 2) Sea Harbour, Rosemead, California: He said it brought 'high quality dim sum' to the area . 3) Elite Restaurant, Montery Park, California: Praised for its interesting range of dim sum . 4) King Hua, Alhambra, California: Mr Chan said it has similar dim sum to Sea Harbour . 5) Lunasia, Alhambra, California: The expert said it has an 'innovative' menu such as foie gras dim sum . 6) Din Tai Fung, Arcadia, California: The only Shanghai style restaurant in the top 10 . 7) Yank Sing, San Francisco, California: Mr Chan praised the dim sum specialist for 'evolving' 8) Seafood Village, Monterey Park, California: The Hong Kong-style restaurant is 'highly regarded' 9) 101 Noodle Express, Alhambra, California: Mr Chan said the restaurant's star dish the Shandong beef roll has given it prominence . 10) Jai Yun, San Francisco, California: Mr Chan said it is one of the 'quirkiest' Chinese restaurants in the U.S. He said he was brought up as an American by his parents who wanted to ‘protect’ him from discrimination. When . he was younger the only Chinese restaurants were in Chinatown and in . 1950 he was one of just 8,067 Chinese people living in Los Angeles. Mr Chan told the Los Angeles Times: ‘Unless you lived in San Francisco, you were an oddity.’ Chinese . immigration became more prevalent when he was studying at UCLA after . the government relaxed laws that had only allowed 105 people each year . to move from China to the U.S. It . was during his college years that Mr Chan began to connect with . Chinese culture and took a course called Orientals in America. Mr Chan said he one of the favorite parts of his hobby is seeing how the cuisine has evolved over the decades. He says he finds American-Chinese fusions - such as the Chow Mein sandwich served with gravy that he found in New England - as interesting and enjoyable as traditional Chinese food. While there is only one restaurant that he returns to, ABC Seafood, Mr Chan said the current number one Chinese restaurant is Koi Palace in Daly City, California, where they specialise in dim sum at lunch and Hong Kong-style seafood at dinner. Mr Chan's son Eric believes his father's obsessions stems from him being a natural collector. He said: 'If you collect enough of something, you can capture its essence. Maybe that's what he's trying to do with food.'","David Chan, 64, has tried almost every Chinese restaurant in Los Angeles .

Adrift in the vast Pacific Ocean for four weeks, two fishermen began to drink sea water when the rains stopped and their small supply of fresh water ran out. The salt water would have killed them from severe dehydration within three days - but just as all hope was running out the desperate men were seen by a US fishing boat. As 40-year-old Elirito Tataua and Teikauea Tegiaa, 20, recovered from their ordeal on board the Pacific Princess today, the ship's captain, Alfred Canepa, told how he found the men by chance. Survivors: Eiirito Tataua, 40, left, and 20 year old Teikauea Tegiaa, right, survived four weeks adrift by drinking rain water and eating raw fish . 'They had drifted 420 miles from Bahaba Island, in Kiribati's Gilbert Islands, where they'd been fishing,' said Captain Canepa. 'They were surviving on raw fish and rain water, but when the rains stopped and there was no fresh water they were in a lot of trouble. 'They were extremely weak and malnourished, but, surprisingly, they are in a lot better shape than I would have been, put it that way - it's a hell of an ordeal, believe me.' Captain Canepa told Radio Australia that he was lucky to find the men. 'We were searching for fish and 16 miles away on my bird radar I spotted a small flock of birds. 'As fish attract birds, I went to go and check it out and luckily I did turn that way to check because we found this small boat with two men adrift at sea, lost. We found them in the nick of time.' The pair were fishing off the coast of the Gilbert Islands in Kiribati when their engine broke down and they drifted 420 miles west towards the Solomon Islands before they could be saved and taken to American Samoa . Captain Canepa said the men were on a 14ft boat when the engine broke down and strong winds began pushing them towards the Solomon Islands. 'Once they were taken on board I gave them water straight away, just small amounts at a time. 'It was a dry spell and they weren't getting much rain and what happened was they started drinking salt water - and that's lethal. 'They wouldn't have last another three days doing that.' After rehydrating themselves the men spent an hour in a small chapel on the Pacific Princess giving thanks for their rescue. The men's board was hauled onto the Pacific Princess, which is based at American Samoa,  and Captain Canepda promised them that he and his crew would repair the engine and return it to their island home when his vessel passes by that way. The plan was to take the men to the Solomon Islands where arrangements would be made to return them to Kiribati. 'They've spoken to their families and it's turned out to be a very happy ending,' said Captain Canepa.","Two men spent a month at sea after drifting 420 miles away from their home .

Police have arrested at least 31 people across three countries as part of their investigation into a spectacular £31million diamond heist. Heavily armed robbers dressed as policeman made off with the huge haul after the audacious theft from Brussels Airport in February. There had been no news of any leads on the robbery, believed to be one of the largest ever recorded, until today's surprise announcement. Authorities said a Frenchman has been arrested in France while six to eight have been detained in Geneva, Switzerland, and a further 24 people in and around Brussels. Among those arrested were a prominent businessman and a lawyer. Police also believe they have recovered some of the diamonds taken in the robbery. The precious gems . had been loaded onto a plane bound for Zurich when the gang drove through a hole they had cut in the Brussels Airport fence in two black cars with blue police lights flashing. They . drove onto the tarmac, approached the plane, brandished machine guns, . offloaded at least 120 packages containing diamonds, then made their getaway in an operation that . barely took five minutes. Later that night, investigators found the . charred remains of a van most likely used in the heist, but little else. The stolen parcels contained both rough and polished stones. Suspects in France and Switzerland were detained on Tuesday, and today Belgian police carried out a massive operation, with 250 police involved in 40 house searches. 'In Switzerland, we have found diamonds that we can already say are coming from the heist, and in Belgium large amounts of money have been found. And the investigation is still ongoing,' said Jean-Marc Meilleur, a spokesman for the Brussels prosecutor's office. He said police had also found luxury cars.

Sneaky: Roger Moore, who attempted to fake CCTV images to avoid a speeding fine, has to now pay £2,000 . A driver who faked CCTV images to avoid a speeding fine but was caught after police examined the shadows in his forged footage has narrowly avoided jail. Roger Moore, 44, was snapped doing 51mph in a 40mph zone as he returned a courtesy car to a garage in Plymouth, Devon, at 12pm on February, 22, 2011. But in July 2011 as legal proceedings against him were underway he produced CCTV of his own car outside his house - apparently taken at 10.37am on the day of the offence. He then claimed the film proved he had already taken the Peugeot 206 loan car back when it was filmed speeding - and said a garage worker must have been the guilty driver. Father-of-three Moore submitted the false footage on a DVD to a court and an investigating police officer in a bid to clear his name. But police who were suspicious of the footage then waited and revisited Moore’s house a year to the date of the offence in February 2012. They took their own images of how his house would have looked at the time of year - and then went back again and got more footage in July 2012. Their photos showed the shadows on Moore’s CCTV were in the wrong place meaning his film was actually shot in summer 2011 and not February 2011 as he claimed. They also found a log which suggested the date stamp had been altered. Prosecuting, David Gittins said police experts spent time analysing CCTV footage from Moore’s home, submitted by the defendant at court. But the experts found inconsistencies. Mr Gittins told Plymouth Crown Court the shadows on Moore’s footage were far too long to be February, suggesting the CCTV was actually from later in the year. The experts also recreated their own mocked-up footage in an effort to show how it was possible to change the date imprinted in the corner of the film. The prosecutor added: '(Moore) said one of the garage staff ""must have been pinning it (the speeding offence)"" on him because he had previously made a complaint about their work.' Roger Moore submitted CCTV footage to police to support his alibi that he wasn't driving the car . This still from the fake CCTV shows shadow on the drive at allegedly 10.37am on February 22, 2011 . But sharp eyed police officers went back to the scene and took their own pictures and spotted the length of the shadows did not match with the time of the year . But defence counsel Ali Rafati said Moore was the sole earner in his family, taking home £325 a week. He said Moore, who pleaded guilty to . perverting the course of justice a few days before he was due to stand . trial, was a family man of no previous convictions, adding: 'He got . himself in an act which snowballed out of control. 'He simply couldn’t face up to that so he buried his head in the sand and let the months roll by.' Moore, of Plymstock, Devon, was given a sixteen week jail term suspended for two years and ordered to pay £2,000 at Plymouth Crown Court. Roger Moore arrives back at his home to the drive where the fake CCTV footage was made . Judge . Paul Darlow told him: 'You went to extraordinary lengths to try and lie . and cheat your way out of a speeding conviction which would have . followed a light fine. 'You were happy to allege against others who were simply doing their job. 'I read their witness statements and understand what it is like for them thinking they would have to have a court appearance where they would be challenged as liars and cheats but all the way along it was you.' The judge also suggested he sell his personalised number plate in order to raise the £2,000 fine. Speaking outside the court, a Safety Camera Partnership spokeswoman expressed disappointment at the sentence. She said: 'I think that Mr Moore ought to consider himself extremely fortunate to not be spending tonight (in jail) at the beginning of a custodial sentence.'","Roger Moore produced fake footage apparently taken on the day of the offence claiming he wasn't driving the car .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:23 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:02 EST, 9 May 2013 . A producer for Michael Jackson’s doomed comeback tour testified Wednesday that the singer’s frail physique and confused ramblings about speaking to God had her convinced  he was at death’s door days before he died. Alif Sankey, an associate producer for the tour’s London concerts, told the court that Jackson was extremely thin and telling people he was talking to God and she was fearful he would soon die but that she felt helpless. Sankey told the Los Angeles Times that her fears drove her to reach out to the director of the This Is It tour Kenny Ortega. Sad: Drawing shows Alif Sankey, who testified Wednesday in the suit pitting the Jackson's against AEG that Jackson was gaunt and said he was speaking to God days before overdose . ‘”I said, 'He needs to be put in the hospital now,”’ Sankey said she told Ortega on June 20, 2009. ‘I kept saying, “Michael's dying, he's dying.”’ On June 25, just five days later, Sankey’s fears would come true when Jackson was found dead from an overdose of the anesthetic propofol. The court heard that when propofol is administered to a patient, a number of staff should be on hand equipped with sophisticated medical devices to intervene if the patient stops breathing. A toxicologist witness described the singer's use of the drug propofol as 'very problematic' in previous testimony. Frail: Sankey said Jackson was abnormally thin and that she reached out to concert promoter AEG with fears he was dying . The crux of the case comes in the form of shamed physician Dr. Conrad Murray. The doctor administered the drug that killed Jackson and was subsequently tried and convicted of involuntary manslaughter for his role in the pop legend’s death. Jackson's mother Katherine and Jackson’s three children are suing concert promotion company AEG Live for millions, claiming it should have vetted Murray before allowing the singer to employ him as his personal physician. AEG claims it was Jackson who wanted Murray brough on as part of the tour.However, Sankey’s testimony painted a different picture, one that showed AEG to be Murray’s employer. The LA Times points to an email between AEG executive Paul Gongaware and Ortega concerning the physician, on which Sankey was copied. Suit: Katherine Jackson, left, and family assert in the suit against concert promoters AEG that the company aided in Jackson's death by improperly vetting Dr. Conrad Murray, right, who administered the drugs that killed him . ‘We want to remind him it is AEG, not Michael Jackson who is paying his salary,’ Gongaware wrote. ‘We want him to understand what is expected of him.’ Sankey testified that Ortega had planned a 'tough love' meeting with Jackson and that she and Ortega were very concerned after Jackson told Ortega he'd been speaking to god. '[Michael] didn't understand why God was speaking to him. We were both crying. We were crying because he seemed — he was not speaking normally to Kenny,' she said. Sankey, who also cried during her testimony, was the fifth witness to take the stand in the trial. Millions: The worth of Jackson's estate, which included Neverland Ranch, pictured, has soared since the singer's death and the suit could also be worth millions to the family . Karen Faye, a makeup artist who worked with Jackson for some 30 years, also testified for the Jacksons. Faye said that during the ‘Dangerous’ tour of the early 1990s, promoters asked that she give Jackson injections of pain medications, but she refused. She says a tour manager who later became a top AEG executive then enlisted a doctor to treat Jackson. Sankey, who first met Jackson as a dancer on the set of 1987’s ‘Smooth Criminal’ went on to describe in her testimony Jackson’s relationship with his children. ‘They loved their daddy,’ she said.","Alif Sankey told the court Wednesday that Jackson was far skinnier than normal and was telling her and other concert producers that he could speak to God .

Jailed: Marlena Mints, 31, a teacher at Bessie Coleman Middle School, is charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child and two counts of improper relationship with students is being held on $300,000 bond . She has been charged with one count of Aggravated Sexual Assault of a Child and two counts of Improper Relationship With Students. The school district place Mints on administrative leave and contacted the police last week after learning of her alleged inappropriate conduct with one of her students. She is now held up in Dallas County Jail. According to the police documents, Mints exchanged text messages with a 13 year old about a problem he told her he was having with his penis. Mints told him she would 'need to see it' and asked him to meet her at school to show it to her. History: Marlena Mints, 31, had worked at the Bessie Coleman Middle School for the last seven years without incident . The student told investigators he thought it would be okay because she was his sex education and health teacher. He says when he exposed himself to her, she performed oral sex on him. The student referred to Mints as a 'cougar' who 'likes younger men' and claimed that as one of her 'favorite students,' he was allowed to touch her breasts and buttocks while spending time in her classroom. Other students were apparently allowed to do the same. Whilst police were looking into the allegations, the name of a second high school student was mentioned. Surprised: Eighth grader Lidia Vizueta (left), described Ms Mints as a coach who encouraged her students and often made them laugh. Her aunt, Maggie Roberts (right), was equally surprised . The second victim also exchanged messages with Mint in which she asked if he wanted to 'hang out' and if he liked 'white girls.' According to the arrest warrant, Mints picked up him and drove him to her home where she also performed oral sex on him. His phone also contained the messages the two had exchanged between one another. The school has confirmed that 31-year-old had Mints had passed all background checks before being hired and had no previous incidents. Parents have since received letters notifying them about the alleged 'inappropriate conduct of a teacher'. 'For the last five years, I have been teaching Health,' Mints wrote on her page at the Bessie Coleman website. 'I love teaching Health because the information is applicable to everyday life.' Maggie Roberts whose niece goes to the school told CBS 11 that she was disappointed and surprised: 'That’s not who I was expecting. She’s a great teacher.  Always friendly, smiling, willing to help.' Eighth grader Lidia Vizueta described Mints as a coach who encouraged her students and often made them laugh.

Shocking new data has found that suicide rates in several states have increased dramatically in the past decade, with Wyoming and North Dakota showing the most troubling rise. Wyoming reported an increase of just under 78.8 per cent over the last 10 years. Closely behind was North Dakota, with 70.5 per cent. Following those states were Rhode Island, Hawaii and Vermont. North Dakota's neighbor to the south was also represented on the list, rounding out the top 10. Troubling information: Shocking new data has found that suicide rates in several states have increased dramatically in the past decade . The findings were reported by The Atlantic Cities, based on data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . In terms of regions, the Midwest saw the greatest climb in suicide with a 35.6 per cent increase. The Northeast was just behind with 32.7 per cent. The new CDC report is being called the . first to show how the trend is playing out nationally and to look in . depth at the racial and geographic breakdown. The suicide rate registered a statistically significant increase in 39 out of 50 states. The West and the South had the highest . suicide rates. It's not clear why, but one factor may be cultural . differences in willingness to seek help during tough times, said Thomas . Simon, one of the authors of the CDC report. Also, it may be more difficult to find counseling and mental health services in certain places, he added. The state rankings come a week after a government report revealed that the suicide rate among middle-aged Americans leaped an astonishing 28 per cent over the course of just a decade. Even more shocking is the rate among . middle aged white men and women. Suicides in that group increased an . astounding 40 per cent between 1999 and 2010. Not surprisingly, those years saw the worst recession in recent memory and the accompanying mortgage crisis, which proved catastrophic for many. Meanwhile, rates in younger and older people held steady. And there was little change among middle-aged blacks, Hispanics and most other racial and ethnic groups. One theory suggests the recession . caused more emotional trauma in whites, who tend not to have the same . kind of church support and extended families that blacks and Hispanics . do. The economy was in recession from the end of 2007 until mid-2009. Even well afterward, polls showed most . Americans remained worried about weak hiring, a depressed housing . market and other problems. During the 1999-2010 period, suicide went . from the eighth leading cause of death among middle-aged Americans to . the fourth, behind cancer, heart disease and accidents. 'Some of us think we're facing an upsurge . as this generation moves into later life,' said Dr Eric Caine, a . suicide researcher at the University of Rochester. The CDC findings were based on information from death certificates. People ages 35 to 64 account for about 57 per cent of suicides in the U.S. Sad: Over the course of a decade, suicide rates in middle aged Americans soared by 28 percent . Color lines: The rate was even higher, 40 percent, when only white middle aged people were considered . The report contained surprising information about how middle-aged people . kill themselves: During the period studied, hangings overtook drug . overdoses in that age group, becoming the No. 2 manner of suicide. But . guns remained far in the lead and were the instrument of death in nearly . half of all suicides among the middle-aged in 2010. For the entire U.S. population, there were 38,350 suicides in 2010, making it the nation's 10th leading cause of death, the CDC said. The overall national suicide rate climbed from 12 suicides per 100,000 people in 1999 to 14 per 100,000 in 2010, a 15 percent increase. For the middle-aged, the rate jumped from about 14 per 100,000 to nearly 18 — a 28 percent increase. Among whites in that age group, it spiked from about 16 to 22. Suicide prevention efforts have tended to concentrate on teenagers and the elderly, but research over the past several years has begun to focus on the middle-aged. Age: Younger and older age group statistics were unchanged.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 23:29 EST, 14 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 23:29 EST, 14 August 2012 . On the run: Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last 11 years after escaping from a Mexico prison . In an effort to catch one of the world’s most notorious drug kingpins, the U.S. may use the same daring methods that took down Osama bin Laden. More than a year after the terror leader’s demise in Abottabad, Pakistan, Seal Team Six raid, the highly-trained commandos may be dispatched to Mexico to kill or capture Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. Like the 9/11 Mastermind, Guzman has been the subject of a vast manhunt for the last ten years after he escaped from a Mexican high security prison in a complex breakout that reportedly cost him nearly $4million. Mexico’s Procesor magazine (English translation) reported that a new plan to get Guzman was hatched by Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who felt the only way to catch him was through a military raid. But when Calderon was turned down by Mexico’s army and naval forces, he turned to the U.S. government, which has made catching or killing Guzman a priority. Sources told Procesor that the U.S. has grown increasingly more frustrated with Mexico’s failure to bring Guzman to justice - especially after a joint effort by U.S. agencies provided the information needed to catch him. Guzman presides over a $1billion drug empire and is accused of firing the first shot in a bloody cartel war that has so far killed nearly 50,000 people. The death of Osama Bin Laden pushed the notorious drug baron to the top of a list of international criminals compiled by international law enforcement officials and Forbes. Brutality: Guzman is wanted for allegedly firing the first shots in grisly drug cartel war which has gripped Mexico for years and has claimed about 50,000 lives . Since then the drug lord known as 'El Chapo' because of his 5ft 2in height has eluded capture, protected by his vast Sinaloa drugs cartel and no doubt a legion of corrupt officials paid from his vast wealth. He has attained almost mythical status in Mexico vast drugs operation that runs shipments of tons at a time from Columbia into Mexico and on to the U.S. But such a lucrative operation will always attract competition and Loera is arguably responsible for more deaths than Bin Laden as his henchmen fight other cartels for control of lucrative transportation corridors into the U.S. He is accused of starting Mexico's cartel wars when his hitmen assassinated the leader of the Juarez cartel and his wife in 2004 in a bid to take control of the city of Cidudad Juarez, breaking the pact of non-aggression that had previously existed. Target: A member of Seal Team Six shot and killed Osama bin Laden during the elite squad's daring raid of his compound in Abbotabad, Pakistan . In the Situation Room: President Obama watched the bin Laden raid with Vice President Biden and his closest advisers . As tit-for-tat fighting escalated, government troops were sent into drug strongholds in 2006 marking the start of a conflict that has ravaged Mexico. Guzman has been the number one drugs kingpin since the arrest of Osiel Cárdenas, head of the Gulf cartel in 2010. He first rose to prominence as the head of logistics for the Sinaloa cartel Salazar in the 1980s, coordinating flights boat shipments and truck journeys from Colombia into Mexico. Once his mentor was captured he took control of the entire cartel, before he himself was captured in 1993. Gripped by violence: Police tape surrounds the perimeter of the Matehuala Men's Club in Monterrey, Mexico, after a shooting inside . But he escaped from prison in 2001 when a guard opened his cell door and wheeled him out of the maximum security La Palma prison in a laundry basket. More than 70 people were arrested over the bold escape plan that may have involved local police, who allegedly gave him 24 hours to get away before the military moved in. He has evaded capture since, despite a series of narrow misses when the authorities were hours or minutes from catching him. Law and order: Government troops have been fighting drug violence in Mexico, but Guzman has never been re-captured . One of the most chilling incidents was in 2009, when an Archbishop in the state of Durango said that the fugitive was 'living nearby and everyone knows it except the authorities, who just don't happen to see him for some reason.' Days later two undercover military officers were shot dead in their car, their bodies left with a note that read: 'You'll never get 'El Chapo', not the priests, not the government.' Now El Chapo is said to have infiltrated the highest level of Mexico's government as President Felipe Calderon fights to keep control of his country amid claims that it is drug lords such as El Chapo who are really in charge.","Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman is one of Mexico's most wanted drug cartel kingpins .

One morning four years ago, London businessman Lloyd Chamberlain woke up to find he could not walk. His back had seized up and when he tried to put weight on his right leg, the pain was indescribable. Any movement could mean agony. It was a level of pain that meant he could not do anything else, and as the days went by there was little sign that it would disappear. Only after he had lain flat on his back for two weeks did things start marginally to improve.Lloyd, 36, had suffered back trouble periodically since he was 19, when he slipped a disc. But this time the pain was so intense, the immobility so crippling, that for the first time he was forced to consider surgery, with the attendant risk of paralysis. Today, in contrast, his outlook could not be more different. His life has been transformed — not by going under the knife, however. He has benefited from a revolutionary new treatment for serious back pain which involves nothing more than a simple and inexpensive course of antibiotics. ‘It’s been transformational,’ says the sports-mad businessman. ‘I’ve done a lot of things I wouldn’t be able to do at any point in the past ten years. I’ve been skiing in the Arctic, cycled 200km over a weekend in Ibiza and I’m going to enter my first triathlon in the summer.’ Lloyd is one of the first back pain patients in the world to receive antibiotic treatment — a pioneering approach which, say doctors, has the potential to cure hundreds of thousands of Britons from a lifetime of crippling pain. The treatment was first recommended by scientists in Denmark who discovered that many cases of severe, long-term back pain are caused by bacteria that respond to courses of drugs, which means surgery is not necessary. The breakthrough is so important that Peter Hamlyn, consultant neurological spinal surgeon at London’s University College hospital, who has successfully used the treatment on  his patients, has described it as ‘the stuff of Nobel prizes’. It was at the recommendation of his physiotherapist that Lloyd went to see Mr Hamlyn and was given a choice after an MRI scan: he could still consider the surgical option which involved fusing vertebrae together, as well as the risk of paralysis and a year-long rehabilitation; or he could take 100 days of common antibiotic tablets at a cost of £114. Mr Hamlyn had been introduced to the idea of using antibiotics in 2010 when he was invited to Denmark to witness the work being done by Dr Hanne Albert, a physiotherapist based at the University of Southern Denmark. He admits he was sceptical at first — ‘a cure for back pain is a bit like the cure for cancer,’ he explains — and went without great enthusiasm. But by the end of Dr Albert’s presentation, he thought: ‘Actually, that’s pretty startling.’Now, he says: ‘Having treated a number of patients myself, I think it’s extraordinary. Dr Albert discovered not only that a particular type of infection was the cause of these patients’ pain, but also devised the test to prove it, the pathology and the cure. It’s the work of a Nobel Prize-winner.’ Agony: Four years ago Mr Chamberlain's back pain was so crippling he was considering surgery . ‘Even so, I was extraordinarily cautious at the start. To give patients a big dose of antibiotics for 100 days is pretty unheard of, and I was imagining myself being hauled up in front of the medical council.’When Mr Hamlyn put the antibiotic option to his patient, Lloyd, he was keen. ‘Although the prospect of taking three months’ worth was pretty unappealing it seemed like a very low risk alternative,’ he says. ‘What shocked me about the surgical route was that things could go wrong, and at that point my disc had degraded so much fusion was the only option.’ Lloyd looked online for guidance. ‘There were some fairly conflicting reports. But I didn’t think Peter was a madman. I relied on what he told me and didn’t mind becoming what was essentially one of the guinea pigs. ‘There was very little effect for the first two months and then a very noticeable one which continued for six months after I stopped taking the treatment.’ And now, of course, he is able to take part in the sports he so loves. Lloyd had been managing his back problem ever since he tried to lift a double oven while installing a kitchen during his gap year. ‘I immediately felt something give in my back,’ he says. ‘I couldn’t carry my own tool bag home and it wasn’t heavy. The revolutionary treatment consists of little more than a simple course of antibiotics . ‘I went to Cambridge University about a month later and I basically couldn’t do any sport at all in my first year. It was an ongoing problem. ‘I’d hang from the big iron gates of Jesus College and my girlfriend would hang from my feet to try to give my back some traction. I’m not sure that’s medically recommended, but it seemed to help at the time. ‘No one told me I’d got a slipped disc until I had my first MRI scan four years later.’ At last he had an explanation for why he regularly suffered muscle spasms and vibrations in the leg. Why he sometimes couldn’t even stand. But as far as he could see there was no real cure. It was his agonising case history along with that telling MRI scan taken by Peter Hamlyn which suggested Lloyd was suitable for the treatment. Mr Hamlyn had become used to seeing a group of patients at his clinic whose back pain was both excruciating and notoriously difficult to fix. ‘The pain takes over their life,’ he explains. ‘It gets worse if they exercise. If they go for a walk, sit down for a meal, try to concentrate on their work, it’s with them all the time. Painkillers gradually become less and less effective. It then pursues them into the night, so they can’t sleep. ‘It’s completely unbiddable, completely dominating and absolutely relentless.’ The chronic nature of the pain is not surprising given the discovery that the culprit is a bacteria known as proprioni acne, which has been found in high numbers in herniated discs and not at all in healthy discs. ‘The bacteria secrete acid which is wickedly painful. It corrodes the bone and the pain comes from the little micro-fractures of the bone next to the disc,’ says Mr Hamlyn. ‘These patients are suffering mini-fractures every time they move. So sending them to Pilates — as has been the traditional response —  had hardly been ideal.’ The clue is in the MRI scan. All of the patients in greatest pain seemed to have a tell-tale whitening of their bone next to the troublesome disc. The medical profession’s traditional response had been to ignore it, dismissing it as irrelevant and certainly not painful. ‘I would see these patients and say: “That MRI scan looks really angry,” but I still had no idea what to do with them,’ says Mr Hamlyn. ‘We could try an injection of steroids, which made the pain go away for a while, and then they would come back and say: “It’s terrible,” so they would have a big operation and go back to being OK. That big operation involved taking out the disc and fusing the bones together, getting rid of the infection coincidentally. It worked. But now it is clear that the infected disc can also be treated with antibiotics. There remain two big concerns for the . proponents of this new treatment regime. One is the indiscriminate use . of antibiotics for lower back pain when only a certain group should be . targeted. While . four of five of us in Britain will experience back pain at some point . in our lives, only 20 per cent of those suffer from what is known as . ‘chronic lower back pain’. Of that number, approximately 40  per cent are estimated to suffer from this bacterial disease of the discs. The treatment has the potential to cure hundreds of thousands of Britons from a lifetime of crippling pain . The treatment could prove highly controversial at a time when the chief medical officer has been warning that new ‘superbugs’ could pose a ‘dire’ threat to health following the over-prescription of antibiotics. Given that sufferers make seven million GP visits annually to discuss their back pain, and the NHS spends a staggering £1 billion a year treating it, the pressure on local surgeries to dispense antibiotics to all-comers will have to be resisted. ‘You just have to do it properly,’ says Mr Hamlyn. ‘You need a specialist’s confirmation that your patient does indeed have the disease, you have to have the right scan which has to be looked at by a radiologist who knows what they’re doing, and you have to ensure the patient takes the full-course of antibiotics rather than just a little bit. The answer to this is education. ‘The second risk is that the medical community has a fantastic ability to ignore advances,’ he adds. ‘The trial does need to be repeated in more than one country and we need more research into the dose of antibiotic and how long it should be taken to make the treatment even more effective. ‘But I have absolutely no doubt of the importance of this discovery.’Lloyd, for one, will testify to that, . ‘Before the treatment I had to make choices all the time  about what I could and couldn’t do,’ he says. ‘I had to carry my back around like a burden. Now I don’t have to compromise at all. ‘It’s eliminated the worry for the first time in my adult life.’ And the extraordinary truth is that so many sufferers of crippling back pain could well be endorsing that view in the future.

The Statue of Liberty is due to reopen for Fourth of July after Superstorm Sandy flooded the island where it stands. The statue has been closed since Sandy struck the region on October 29 and damaged much of Liberty Island's infrastructure. The statue is on higher ground and was not damaged. Ferry tickets to visit the island on July 4 or later may be purchased online or by phone. Tickets to the statue's crown are only available by reservation. Beacon of hope: The Statue of Liberty has been closed since Sandy hit in October, but the iconic attraction is due to reopen on July 4 . However, the Ellis Island Immigration Museum is not expected to reopen to the public this year. The museum sits on Ellis Island, next to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. New York Senator Charles E. Schumer said: 'July Fourth is the perfect day to reopen a symbol of our nation's freedom, and speaks volumes about New York's resilience.' He added: 'Lady Liberty was hit hard by Superstorm Sandy, but just like New York, she will be back – and stronger than ever.' Sandy brought water levels up to 8ft to the island, destroying boilers and electrical systems. The Independence Day opening of the . statue, which was presented to the U.S. by the French in 1886 and stands . as a symbol of freedom and democracy, will be a beacon of hope to the . recovery process. More than six months after Sandy devastated New York City . and the Jersey shore, and pounded coastal areas of New England, the . region is dealing with a slow recovery. Weather the storm: The statue was able to withstand the full force of Sandy but Liberty Island was damaged . Tens of thousands of people remain homeless. Housing, business, . tourism and coastal protection all remain major issues with the summer . vacation - and hurricane - seasons almost here again. Although the statue is more than 125 years old, its iron framework was able to withstand the full force of Sandy, as it swept into New York last year. However, the passenger docks, sidewalks, generator and power systems were all in need of repair. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said: 'We're going to get this done as soon as we possibly can because [the Statue of Liberty is] such an important icon for New York and America.' Mr Salazar, who visited the damaged island in December, estimated that repairs to Ellis Island and Liberty Island may cost up to $59 million. The statue, which is a National Monument, and Liberty Island, are important assets to the City's tourism economy. In 2011, the National Park Service said that 3.7 million people visited the attraction, bringing in $174 million and supporting 2,218 jobs.","Liberty Island ready to open for Independence Day .

But far from being some terrible disaster, the dramatic scene was actually a carefully orchestrated stunt by artistic collective Carabosse Company. The French group, which specialises in creating 'fire gardens', lit more than 6,000 small fires contained in buckets which were fixed to giant sculptures around the city's Old Harbour. The display was part of Marseille's cultural celebrations as it is the 2013 European Capital of Culture. The French city of Marseille is lit up by fire displays as it celebrates being the European Capital of Culture . The city's Old Harbour is illuminated by more than 6,000 pots of fire beneath the imposing figure of the Notre-Dame de la Garde Basilica . The event was put on as part of the Marseille-Provence 2013 cultural celebrations . The two-day display started last night and will take place again tonight, but with a different arrangement of sculptures. Carabosse named the event Le Vieux Port: entre flammes et flots - meaning The Old Harbour: between flames and waves. Marseille is France's second-largest city after Paris and is thought to be the country's oldest, with remains showing humans settled in the region around 30,000 years ago. The Old Harbour area has been recently redeveloped, but architectural remains show it may date back to Ancient Greek times. Fires were lit in pots fixed to specially-built sculptures around the city's Old Harbour . Crowds flocked to the see display, which was organised by artistic collective Carabosse Company . Carabosse Company ignited several dramatic sculptures for the display, named 'The Old Harbour, between flames and waves' The free event was open to families and there appeared to be little restrictions stopping members of the public from getting up close to the flames. Thousands of buckets containing small fires were fixed to metal sculptures, set floating in the quays and hung from bridges. One sculpture was a series of arches of flame, which created a 300m-long tunnel visitors could walk through. The largest sculpture reached 35m into the air. Pedestrians were able to walk freely through the installation in Marseille's streets . A walkway of rings of fire stretched for 300m along the city's streets . Visitors were excited about being able to get up close to the fiery art installation . Marseille, in the south of France, came alive with light during the evening . Local media estimated between 180,000 and 200,000 people came to view the display last night. Jean-Francois Chougnet, director . general of Marseille Provence 2013, said crowds enjoyed a 'friendly . atmosphere' and that there were no incidents like injuries or arrests. The flames were lit at 8.30pm by 60 members of the company dubbed 'flame lighters'. Carabosse Company are known for their dramatic 'fire gardens' The artistic collective has previously put on displays in the UK, including at Brighton, Milton Keynes and Stonehenge . Marseille is twinned with the Slovakian city of Košice as European Capital of Culture 2013. The two cities replace Guimarães, in Portugal, and Maribor, in Slovenia, which were the culture capitals in 2012. The accolade was initiated in 1985 with the aim of bringing Europeans closer together by celebrating culture. It provides cities with the opportunity to spend a year focusing on a high-profile arts and culture programme, which brings knock-on economic boosts to the region. Athens was the first capital of culture. Since 2000, more than one city has been able to hold the title at once. Marseille and Kosice in Slovakia are the 2013 European Capitals of Culture, replacing 2012 cities Guimarães in Portugal and Maribor, Slovenia .","Artistic collective Carabosse Company lit 6,000 buckets of fire for display .

Shamed: Army sergeant Naida Hosan is Catholic but says she was taunted by felow servicemen because her named sounded Islamic . Army Sergeant 1st Class Naida Hosan is Catholic, but that didn’t stop some of her fellow U.S. soldiers in Iraq from taunting her about what they believed was her Islamic-sounding last name. In fact, Hosan got so fed up with her nickname of ‘Sgt. Hussein’ and being quizzed about which god she prayed to, that the New York native changed her name. Before she deployed for a second war tour, Hosan legally became Naida Christian Nova. This did not solve her problems. Instead, matters escalated. Nova . complained to her superiors about constant anti-Muslim slurs and jokes. She says they responded with a series of reprisals intended to drive her . out of the Army, leading her to consider suicide. ‘My complaints fell on deaf ears . every time,’ said Nova, 41, a member of the Army's 82nd Airborne . Division based at Fort Bragg, N.C. ‘Any time I would say something about . it I was treated like I didn't know what I was talking about or that . I'm an idiot or that I was a Muslim sympathizer. It was just a very . lonely feeling.’ Determined to remain in the service for at least eight years, until she is eligible for retirement, Nova recently re-enlisted. But she agreed to tell her story to The Associated Press because ‘I don't want this to happen to anyone else if I can help it. It's a horrible to feel like people are against you when you are supposed to be on the same team.’ Fort Bragg spokeswoman Sheri L. Crowe said the Army would not comment on the case, and referred questions to the U.S. Department of Justice. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of North Carolina, assigned to defend the Army, also declined comment. But her account is supported by an affidavit filed by an old friend, Sharon Deborah Sheetz, who said that Nova had confided in her about the harassment she had suffered, telling Sheetz that she was so unhappy that she no longer wanted to live. A Farsi linguist who works in military . intelligence, Nova's multicultural background exemplifies the kind of . soldier Army recruiters prize — U.S. citizens with ethnic ties to a part . of the world many Americans can't find on a map. Nova's father, Roy Hosein, was born . into a Muslim family on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, where his . parents had emigrated from India. He converted to Christianity after . meeting Nova's mother, a Catholic from the Philippines, and became a . U.S. citizen shortly after his daughter was born in New York. He changed . the spelling of his family name to . Taunted: Sergeant 1st Class Hosan transferred from a post in England to one in North Carolina, but says nicknames like 'Sgt. Hussein' followed her . Hosan in the hope his children would avoid discrimination. ‘He Americanized it,’ his daughter explained. ‘He got Hosan from Hosanna. He kept hearing it in church.’ She reported for basic training two months after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. ‘Before 9-11, my last name never raised an eyebrow,’ she said. ‘But after 9-11, I felt compelled to tell people I am a . Christian and felt I had to prove I was loyal to the United States.’ Her first deployment was to Iraq in 2005. She said other soldiers, including her supervisors, mocked her family name and made crude jokes. ‘I was called Sgt. Hussein, as in Saddam Hussein,’ she said. ‘Even when I would correct them on the pronunciation of my name, I was still called Sgt. Hussein. I was asked what God I pray to. And there were a lot of references to hajjis, used as a derogatory term.’ Hajiis, in fact, are Muslims who have made the pilgrimage to the Saudi Arabian birthplace of the prophet Muhammad. But Nova said she regularly heard U.S. troops use the word as racist slang for enemy, terrorist or suicide bomber. ‘My uncle is a hajji, because he made . the pilgrimage to Mecca in 2005,’ Nova said. ‘I would stand up for what I . thought was right and say, 'Not all terrorists are Muslims and not all . Muslims are terrorists.' That just opened the door for more harassment.’ Extremes: Hosan went so far as to change her name . Mikey Weinstein, a former U.S. Air Force officer who founded Military Religious Freedom Foundation, said Nova's experience is not uncommon. Military personnel who are Muslim or perceived to be of Middle Eastern descent are often targets for discrimination, he said. ‘When a Muslim soldier, sailor or airman stands up for themselves, they are the subject of vicious reprisal and retribution,’ said Weinstein, who is Jewish. ‘What (Sgt. Nova) has gone through is horrible, but it is typical.’ In 2007, while serving in Harrogate, England, Nova said co-worker told her and others a racist joke about Muslims. When she objected, Nova said, a supervisor warned her to stop making trouble. Instead, she filed a formal complaint with the Army's Equal Opportunity Branch, the program charged with ensuring the military provides an environment ‘free of unlawful discrimination and offensive behavior.’ Within days, Nova said she was removed from her job and ordered to take a ‘command directed’ mental health evaluation. ‘In writing, the referral said my . values were not in line with mission,’ she said. ‘They considered me a . 'Muslim sympathizer,' that I was too loyal to Muslims.’ Rather than address her complaint, . Nova said, the Army transferred her to the 82nd Airborne at Fort Bragg. Though she hoped to make a fresh start with her new unit, word of her . complaint followed her to North Carolina. That treatment worsened after a . November 2009 shooting rampage at Fort Hood in Texas. Maj. Nidal Hasan, a . Muslim, is charged with killing 13 people. His name sounded a lot like . hers. Nova changed her name shortly before . deploying to Afghanistan last year. She arrived just after worn copies . of the Quran were found to have been burned with trash from a U.S.-run . prison outside the capital of Kabul, a widely reported incident that . triggered violent protests. New: Just prior to shipping out to a second tour, this time to Afghanistan, Hosan officially became Naida Christian Nova . The Army responded by initiating a new training program on the proper handling and disposal of Islamic materials. But Nova said she discovered that her unit trashed and burned documents collected through intelligence gathering that contained what could be considered sacred writings. Nova conferred with an on-base military chaplain, and suggested designating a special box for Islamic materials so they could be disposed of in a more appropriate manner. ‘When I brought this up, I was told 'Sgt. Nova, you can't bring your religion to work ...,'‘ she recalled. ‘I changed my name, but that didn't change other people's ignorance.’ After just two months in Afghanistan, she said her commanders removed her from her job and ordered her back to Fort Bragg. With the help of a Fayetteville lawyer, Mark Waple, she filed a formal complaint with the Army's Inspector General in October seeking a voluntary discharge due to being subjected to ‘adverse treatment and negative, prejudicial remarks ... concerning the Muslim faith.’ Nova said she grew so depressed that she considered suicide. She checked herself into an on-base hospital for treatment, staying for about a week before returning to duty. After learning of her IG complaint and hospitalization, Nova's commanders at Fort Bragg responded by filing paperwork to involuntarily end her military career and bar her from reenlistment for ‘ineffective leadership.’ No change: Hosan says even her new name didn't stop the bullying and after she complained she was nearly given a forced discharge . Typical: Mikey Weinstein, pictured, founder of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation, called Hosan's experience common . Nova's Army performance review from a few months earlier, a copy of which she provided to AP, shows her as meeting expectations in all categories, with her senior commander rating her potential for promotion and increased responsibility as ‘superior.’ The forced discharge could have imperiled Nova's ability to get a civilian job, denied her Veterans Affairs medical care and educational benefits. After exhausting her administrative options for fighting her case, Waple helped Nova file a complaint in federal court alleging discriminatory treatment and asking a judge to prevent her discharge. Rather than fight the case in court, the Army retreated. Shortly before a key hearing before the judge, Waple says he got a call from Army lawyers informing him that the disciplinary action against Nova was ‘completely off the table.’ She, in turn, agreed to drop the lawsuit. Nova re-enlisted in the Army on April 8. She recently married, and is preparing to ship out next month to attend a senior leadership course and then report to a new assignment in Germany. ‘I want to put all this behind me. I want to move on to my next duty assignment ...,’ said Nova. ‘My beliefs aren't any different from what the Army states as its beliefs and values. I would like to be treated fairly.’ Relief: Her record otherwise spotless, Hosan has since sought representation and disciplinary action has been 'taken off the table'","Sergeant 1st Class Naida Hosan says she was nicknamed 'Sgt.

A body that has just washed up on the shore of the Hudson River is suspected to be hers . Somerset County Prosecutor's Office who is handling the case of the missing senior was notified of the discovery yesterday made by New York Police Department at around 1.15pm. On initial examination there was no reason to suspect foul play, a spokesman for NYPD told reporters. Shortly after her disappearance, Aiello's distraught father choked back the tears as he pleaded for her to come home. 'Please get a phone,' Christopher . Aiello said in a message to his daughter, Paige Aiello, as he grew . emotional. 'Call because we need you and want to see you again.'

Fears: Her father, Christopher Aiello, choked back tears as he pleaded for his daughter to come home . No sign: She was last seen at the family's home in Hillsborough, pictured, on the afternoon of April 9th . Desperate search: Police scoured the Hudson River under the George Washington Bridge, but failed to find anything to lead them to Aiello's whereabouts . 'With her birthday coming and with . the fact that she was distraught, [maybe] she just wanted to be missing . and not celebrate during this time,' Mr Aiello told NBC.

On Wednesday, authorities found the missing car at a parking garage in New Brunswick, next to the train station. Mr Aiello said it was believed she took the train to New York. He told WCBS that his daughter, a co-captain of the school tennis team who also worked several jobs, had done ‘incredibly well’ in high school and college and was accepted to nine law schools. Under stress: Aiello, a communications major, . has been working two jobs, struggling with a heavy workload at school . and preparing to attend law school in the fall. Her family described her as a 'perfectionist' Top student: Paige's father worried that the fact that it was her 22nd birthday on Thursday may have something to do with her disappearance on Tuesday . But he added that she was feeling under a great deal of stress and was living at home for added support. ‘She . had hit almost like a wall where she felt she was not maybe either . worthy of all this or she just couldn't handle it,’ he said. He said his message all day had been: ‘Not only do we have to be watching our children that are not doing well and getting in trouble, but we have to see and watch the kids that are the overachievers. ‘They have a self-imposed stress. You don't need a parent to be constantly on their back if their stress is internalized.’ Aiello said he was encouraged that no . one reported witnessing anyone jumping from the bridge. He said he was . worried that without a cell phone, she could just be wandering around. Miss . Aiello was last seen by her father at around 1pm at home. About two . hours later, her mother came home and noticed that her car, a 2006 grey . Audi A4, was gone, along with her daughter.

One ancient little girl: The skull of Selam, whose remains have now revealed that human ancestors remained tree-climbers for longer than thought . Analysis of the bones of a girl who died 3.3million years ago in East Africa suggests our ancestors came down from the trees later than many scientists thought. The fossilised shoulder blades of Selam, a three-year-old unearthed in Dikika, Ethiopia, show features that suggest she and her family were able climbers - despite also being adapted for walking on the ground. Selam is a remarkably well-preserved example of Australopithecus afarensis, thought to be an important forerunner of modern human beings. She is the same species as Lucy, the famous 3.2million-year-old skeleton discovered in 1974. Although A. afarensis was an upright walking species, the question of whether it also spent much of its time in trees has been hotly debated, partly because a complete set of shoulder blades has never before been available for investigation. Lead researcher Professor David Green, from Midwestern University, Illinois, said: 'These remarkable fossils provide strong evidence that these individuals were still climbing at this stage in human evolution.' It took 11 years to painstakingly extract the paper-thin shoulder blades from the rest of Selam's skeleton, which was encased in sandstone in 2000 by Zeresenay Alemseged, a co-author of the study published in Science. Dr Alemseged, Curator of Anthropology at the California Academy of Sciences, said finding shoulder blades intact and attached to a skeleton was 'like hitting the jackpot'. 'Because shoulder blades are paper-thin, they rarely fossilise - and when they do, they are almost always fragmentary,' he said. 'This study moves us a step closer toward answering the question ""When did our ancestors abandon climbing behaviour?"",' he added. 'It appears that this happened much later than many researchers had previously suggested.' Rare find: It took 11 years to painstakingly extract the paper-thin shoulder blades from the rest of Selam's skeleton, which was found encased in sandstone in 2000 by Zeresenay Alemseged . Selam was a three-year-old A. afarensis girl whose skeleton is the most complete of her kind yet discovered. After freeing her shoulder blades from the surrounding rock, the researchers digitised then and took detailed measurements which they compared with other early human relatives as well as modern great apes and humans. Analysis of the shape and function of the bones revealed a partially tree-living lifestyle. At the same time, the hip, lower leg and foot were human-like and adapted for upright walking. Field work: Dr Zeray Alemseged (right) working in the field in Dikika, Ethiopia, where Selam's skeleton was uncovered . 'Human scapulae change shape throughout ontogeny in a significantly different manner than closely related apes,"" said Dr Green. 'When we compared Selam's scapula with adult members of Australopithecus afarensis, it was clear that the pattern of growth was more consistent with that of apes than humans.' Dr Alemseged added: 'This new find confirms the pivotal place that Lucy and Selam's species occupies in human evolution. 'While bipedal like humans, A. afarensis was still a capable climber. Though not fully human, A. afarensis was clearly on its way.'","Fossilised shoulder blades of three-year-old Australopithecus afarensis from Ethiopia show her kind were still adapted for tree climbing .

Andy Bellis (pictured), himself a singer in a band, was among those who were refused entry to a Vaccines gig for not knowing the lead singer's name . Music fans were refused entry to a concert by police if they could not name the lead singer of the band they were seeing, it emerged yesterday. Ticketholders queuing to see indie rockers The Vaccines were quizzed by private security staff and a police officer after a tip-off that pickpockets were preparing to target the show. Fans were asked to name the band, the lead singer and titles of their albums, before being allowed into the venue in Llandudno, north Wales. But six people were unable to answer some of the questions, so had their £18.50 tickets confiscated and were refused admission. Another two were ejected once inside the building. Among them was Andy Bellis, who accused the police and venue bosses of being ‘heavy-handed’. Mr Bellis, a university student from Wrexham who went to the gig with friends, said: ‘You can’t just go ejecting random people from queues just for not knowing information on band discography. 'I haven’t even had an apology.’ Mr Bellis, who is the lead singer of local band The Uninvited, said: ‘I got to the door with my tickets and we were pulled aside by security who asked us, “Do you know the name of the band you’re seeing tonight?”. ‘We said “The Vaccines”, and he asked us if we could name their lead singer. 'I couldn’t think of his name off the top of my head and then he asked us to name their albums and I didn’t know them either. 'I felt a bit intimidated and under pressure. That’s when he said, “You’re not allowed in then”. Fans were asked to name the band, the lead singer and titles of their albums, before being allowed into the venue in Llandudno, north Wales. The Vaccines are pictured above, including frontman Justin Young (far right) Mr Bellis, 32, said he had contacted Venue Cymru for an explanation and refund but was yet to receive a reply . Come Of Age is one of the albums by the indie rockers, which police expected fans to know . ‘I thought they were joking at first as I’ve never heard of anything like this in my life.’ The band’s lead singer is Justin Young and their albums are What Did You Expect From The Vaccines? and Come Of Age.

Authorities on Wednesday identified two men and a woman found slain on an eastern Kansas farm and continued searching for the woman's missing18-month-old daughter. Franklin County Sheriff Jeffrey Richards said at a news conference that law enforcement officials were questioning a person of interest they located in Emporia, about 50 miles southwest of the Ottawa farm where the bodies were found earlier this week. Richards said no charges had been filed in the case. According to the sheriff, authorities also found a vehicle related to the investigation late Tuesday in Emporia, but would not say if the man they were questioning had been driving it. Slain: Kaylie Bailey, pictured left with her daughter Lana, was discovered murdered on a farm in Ottawa, Kansas, along with her boyfriend and his roommate, Steven White (right). The toddler is still missing . Murder investigation: Crime scene investigators continue to look for evidence at a house in a rural area west of Ottawa, Kan., after three bodies were discovered at the location . Horrific discovery: The bodies of two man and a woman were found inside a farmhouse in the 3100 block of Georgia Road in rural Kansas . The victims were identified as Kaylie Bailey, 21, of Olathe; Andrew A. Stout, 30, of Ottawa, and Steven E. White, 31, of Ottawa. Richards didn't say how the victims were killed. Meanwhile, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a release Wednesday that a suspect was in custody, but did not identify the person or say if it was the same person Franklin County authorities had been questioning Wednesday. The KBI also said it is seeking the public's help in locating Bailey's 18-month-old daughter, Lana Leigh Bailey, who was reported missing with her mother on Friday. Richards said the mother and baby were both last seen at the Ottawa farm, but did not say when. The first body was found in the farm's garage Monday by friends of Stout's, who had gone to check on his pets because they had not heard from him for several days. They called police after finding Bailey's body in the garage under a tarp. Authorities then launched a full search with the help of several neighboring law enforcement agencies and found the other two bodies. Desperate search: Officials in Kansas are on the hunt for 18-month-old Lana Bailey, whose mother was discovered dead Monday . Last sighting: Lana was last seen leaving home with her mother on their way to visit Kaylie Bailey's boyfriend, Andrew Stout, on the farm . Cadaver dogs were also brought in Tuesday to search the vast rural property, but no other bodies were found. Kaylie Bailey's grandmother, Wilma Pettijohn, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday that Kaylie and Lana Bailey lived with her and her husband, Andy Pettijohn, in Olathe. She said when authorities told the family Wednesday they had identified Kaylie Bailey's body, they also said they had no information about the missing baby. Possible suspect: It was initially reported that the slain men's convicted felon roommate, Kyle Flack, was taken into custody, but officials later said that no arrest has been made . ‘We don't know if the man who took the car took her with him or where she is now. ... But they didn't find Lana,’ Pettijohn said. She said the family has been ‘kind of preparing for the last day or two’ for the news that Kaylie Bailey was among the three killed at the farm. Friends of Bailey's have said she and Stout had a relationship and that on the day she disappeared, she had planned to drop her daughter off with Stout for the day. Pettijohn described Lana as ‘cheerful and playful, strong-minded’ and said the child's mother was a ‘very sweet girl,’ though she could be ‘somewhat naive maybe in the people she associated with sometimes.’ ‘She liked for people around her to get along, not fuss or say hateful things,’ Pettijohn said of Bailey. ‘Just really loving and caring that way. She thought the world of her baby. She loved her dearly.’ Pettijohn said the family has a variety of nicknames for the missing baby, from ‘sunshine’ to ‘sweetheart or darling or lovely little adjectives.’ She said the family is hopeful the baby will be returned to them. ‘Everything in the house reminds us of her,’ Pettijohn said. ‘It's just a lot of pain between here and OK.’ Like her parents, Bailey got certified as a nursing assistant, but later decided that she was too small to lift heavy patients, so she found a job as a security officer, the Kansas City Star reported. Ray of hope: Franklin County Sheriff Jeff Richards, left, said in a news conference that officials have no reason to believe that little Lana Bailey is dead . Her relatives have described the 21-year-old as a hard-working single mother who believed in helping people. Her ex-husband and Lana's father, Shawn Bailey, has been jailed in Missouri since late February. The couple had been together since Kaylie was 16 years old. In November, the young mother left her husband and moved to Olathe. In February, she filed for divorce and had a final court date scheduled or next week, according to her family. Sheriff Jeffrey Richards said investigators have no reason to believe that Lana was dead, adding that they are going to continue searching for the toddler. Lana and her mother were last seen at around noon May 1 on their way to visit Bailey's co-worker and boyfriend living on the farm at 3197 Georgia Road. The boyfriend, Andrew Stout, lived on the farm with his roommate Steven White. The two men had not been seen since late April. Both were reported missing by concerned relatives. Three of Stout's friends came upon the crime scene Monday, a day after going to the farm to check up on the 30-year-old man. The friends smelled a terrible odor coming from the house and garage, leading them to call the authorities. Failed search: Deputies were first called to the farmhouse by the victims' friends, who reported smelled a horrible odor on the property, but officials were unable to find anything suspicious . Working the case: Investigators remove evidence from a home west of Ottawa, Kan., and carry it to a command trailer . Responding deputies searched the house and garage, but found nothing suspicious, concluding that the stench was coming from the garbage. But Stout's friends were unsatisfied with the results of the search, so they returned the next day and found Bailey's body under a tarp in the garage. Once again they called deputies, who arrived and discovered Stout and White's remains inside the farmhouse. Troubled family: Kaylie Bailey had been raising Lana on her own after splitting from her husband, who has a criminal record, and filing for divorce . Stout had been living on the property with several roommates, some of whom had criminal backgrounds, including convictions for attempted murder. In recent months, the 30-year-old had asked a few of the men he was living with to move out because they were not helping with the bills. On Tuesday, an attempt to locate bulletin was issued Tuesday for Kyle Flack, 27, in connection with the homicides. According to officials, Flack had lived with Stout and White on the farm. In 2005, the 27-year-old was convicted of attempted intentional aggravated murder stemming from a shooting in Ottawa, The Topeka Capital-Journal reported. He was released on parole in July 2009. An early press release stated that Flack was taken into custody at around 2.30am in Emporia, where police also recovered a black 2007 Toyota Corolla believed to be Bailey’s car, which Flack was allegedly driving, according to the Ottawa Herald. On Wednesday afternoon, however, Richards said that no one was in custody in connection with the case, but that there was a person of interest cooperating with the investigation.","Victims identified as Kaylie Bailey, 21; Andrew A.

The drive to tear up planning laws is not working and the government is actually introducing even more red tape, a report claims. Ministers have repeatedly promised to relax the rules around new homes, extensions and larger developments to boost economic growth. But a right-leaning think tank say the Coalition have brought in nearly twice as many new regulations as Tony Blair's government. The Centre for Policy Studies said the Coalition have brought in nearly twice as many new planning regulations as Tony Blair's government . The authors say this failure to speed up planning explains persistently high house prices in Britain, slow construction of much-needed new homes and delays to major infrastructure projects. In a damning analysis, the Centre for Policy Studies conclude: 'The result is an unnecessarily lengthy and costly planning procedure which enables vested interests to prosper, creates commercial uncertainty and restricts new development.' When they analysed planning laws over a six month period in 1997, the first year under the new Labour government, there were 150 new regulations introduced. But in the first half of 2011, after the Coalition pledged to get to grips with a bonfire of planning rules, the government introduced 278. The authors say no other sector of the UK economy is as shackled by regulation as the property and construction sector, which has traditionally been highly centralised. However they say despite the 'localism' agenda pursued by the Coalition to give councils greater control over development in their area, progress is still too sluggish. The authors say this failure to speed up planning explains persistently high house prices in Britain . They say the agenda is dominated by 'special interest groups' who oppose development on the green belt such as the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the RSPB and National Trust. Many local authorities also 'resist development whether of an economic or residential character', the report says, although they concede the government is cracking down on those not building enough homes. At last year's Conservative party conference, the Prime Minister said: 'There's something else we need to do – and that's accept we need to build more houses in Britain'. He added: 'For a business to expand, it needs places to build. If it takes too long, they'll just build elsewhere.' The report calls for 'sunset clauses' on planning regulation – automatically reviewing them after five years; and more to be torn up, to end the 'lawyer's banquet' of regulations. They add that the planning system needs to operate on a more 'market based' approach looking at economic gains, like other countries, from France to China, where planning permission for development is far quicker.

Tim Knox, Director of the Centre for Policy Studies said: 'The Coalition is right to have identified the complexity of the current planning system as a major obstacle to growth. 'It should learn from the historic success of Milton Keynes and the plans for a new Garden City at Old Hatfield to see how implementing real reform can free up the planning process to the great benefit of both would-be homeowners and the wider economy.'","Damning analysis comes from right-leaning Centre for Policy Studies .

A craze in which people swallow a spoonful of cinnamon without water could choke participants, doctors have warned. The so-called Cinnamon Challenge has resulted in some people being admitted to hospital. However, this has not stopped an army of young people taking part in the craze - and even a host of adults, including the Governor of Illinois and two NBA basketball players. The 'challenge' has been around for years but - somewhat inexplicably - has suddenly spiked in popularity again with a surge of videos being uploaded to YouTube. Scroll down for videos . Easy does it: The most popular Cinnamon Challenge YouTube video shows a woman spooning a ladle of the finely-ground spice into her mouth . Hard to swallow: Almost immediately after eating the spice, she coughs up a cloud of cinnamon . Adverse reaction: This participant's amusing response to the challenge has earned her almost 9 millions views . About 30,000 clips tagged with the words 'cinnamon challenge' have been uploaded to the video sharing website. Participants are seen pouring the finely-ground spice into their mouths and trying to swallow it without water. The challenge is that because the . spice is slow to break down it gets stuck in the throat - and as people . try to swallow it they cough, gag and vomit. Videos show people coughing up clouds of cinnamon, to raucous laughter in the background. The Cinnamon Challenge involves swallowing a spoonful of ground cinnamon without drinking any liquids. It is incredibly difficult as the spice dries the mouth out too quickly. The challenge went viral on social networking sites last year and developed a celebrity following after Big Brother featured it as a 'house' task in 2011. NBA stars Nick Young and JaVale McGee also posted a YouTube clip of themselves doing the Cinnamon Challenge. However, doctors say the prank is dangerous as it could . result in particles of the spice being inhaled through the windpipe and . into the lungs, which could cause inflammation - and even choking. A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration told the Wall Street Journal: 'It is an . obvious choking hazard and there is a risk of inhaling the dust. This . certainly is not advisable.' One . video alone has been viewed almost 9 million times since it was . uploaded last month. It shows a woman filling a ladle with cinnamon and . carefully pouring the powdered spice into her mouth. Moments later, she spits out the powder and a coughing fit ensues. Eventually she downs water to try to get rid of the cinnamon. Other videos show teenagers coughing up clouds of powder and vomiting. Parents are being warned to educate . their children of the dangers after a student was admitted to hospital . last month with lung problems. And . some schools in the U.S. have banned students from bringing the spice . on campus in a bid to stop them from taking part in the Cinnamon . Challenge. According to the . Wall Street Journal, one high school principal was forced to email . parents after the students spent four days in hospital after attempting . the challenge. Arthur . Williams, principal at Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said: . 'The kids all know about this from the Internet but the parents have no . idea.' However, the Cinnamon Challenge is not just the preserve of the young. Adults are getting in on the action too. Illinois . Governor Pat Quinn was asked to attempt the Cinnamon Challenge live on . air while being interviewed on a Chicago radio show last month. Governor Quinn was given a spoon of . the powdered spice while he appeared on WGN-AM radio and was unflinching . as he put it in his mouth and took a swig of water.

Comedienne Colleen Ballinger also filmed herself attempting the challenge in a bid to get more hits on her YouTube page. She said she was urged to do it by her fans, but was warned off it by many others. She told the Wall Street Journal: 'I thought everyone was being dramatic.

A plot of land which was once a reservoir is set to be transformed into a Hobbit-style underground home and has gone on the market for £45,000. East Riding Council granted planning permission for the quirky design last year which could pave the way for more subterranean studios. The revolutionary plans were given the go-ahead because they will cause little impact on the landscape around it. But to get into your new home you will have to climb down a hole in the field with the help of a ladder. Cosy: Estate agent Oliver Hudson has been tasked with selling the unusual planned Hobbit-style home . Mr Ettridge, of Ettridge Architecture in Hessle, East Yorkshire, designed the studio. He said: ''If you were walking by, you would have no idea that there was a house underground. 'It will look just like a field with a little hill in the middle. 'We will have to dig further underground so there's space for the kitchen but this is minimal and it will will not change the look of the landscape at all.' Camouflaged: The design means the field will look exactly as it did when it was a working reservoir . No need for a key: To get into the home the owner will have to lift up this lid and climb down into the hole . 'There just wasn't room to build a big house but it certainly makes it quirky and its size and shape means it resembles a Hobbit house.' Mr Ettridge was approached by a private client, who bought the plot from the Yorkshire Water Board at auction three years ago and was asked to design a property. 'I couldn't say no to such a great opportunity. This really is a one-off project and I jumped at the chance to design something on the land,' he said. 'It took around three months to design and it's very compact but it has everything someone might need for a holiday let, including a kitchen and a toilet. 'The application for planning permission was previously turned down four times because it's such an unusual build but I think it was eventually accepted because it doesn't change the landscape at all.' The studio, which is designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible, will rely on the natural temperature of the earth to heat the home. Not for the faint-hearted: If you are scared of heights this may not be the property for you . East Riding Council granted planning permission for the design last year and the plot is now on the market . Chris Whitelock, a renewable energy specialist at Pure Renewables, said: 'The studio will be heated by the Earth's natural temperature. 'As it is underground, it will be very well insulated by the ground and there will be very little difference in temperature in the home between summer and winter. 'The most we'll need to install is a heat pump, which will extract heat from warm areas and recirculate it, but this might not be necessary. 'There will be no windows, which will help to keep the heat in but a small tunnel connected to the ground above will transmit some natural light into the property.' The home will have electricity produced by solar panels or micro wind turbines. Plans: This image shows the design for the Hobbit style studio in East Riding . Clever idea: The revolutionary plans could pave the way for more Hobbit-style homes . There will also be some form of running water and a toilet but it is still being decided how waste will be recycled. Oliver Hudson, managing director at Hudson Property in Hessle, East Yorkshire, is now trying to sell the land, which is on the market at a guide price of £45,000, and it is estimated the cost of building the project will be around £35,000. 'It will be a very unusual property and we have had a lot of interest in it. Since the plot went on the market six weeks ago, we have had around ten viewings of the reservoir and three offers on the land, but the offers haven't been quite high enough. 'It has created a lot of local interest because it's such a quirky project. 'There is a strict clause in the planning permission which states that the plot has to be used as a holiday letting because the council is keen to attract tourism to the area. 'I think people looking for a trip away will just love it and the surrounding countryside is perfect for people wanting a getaway. 'The studio will be built on a plot of land which is surrounded by a field and rolling hills, so you can't get much more idyllic than that. 'It's so unusual and so we predict it will be in high demand. It's like a quirky alternative to camping. 'This means that it is a very lucrative investment for the right buyer. You could rent a property like this for more than £400 a week so you'd get a great return. 'We're looking for someone who will come along and give it a go.'","East Riding Council granted permission for the design last year .

The father of Australian tennis star Bernard Tomic broke the nose of his son's training partner after headbutting him in the face, a court has heard. John Tomic, a former taxi driver who now . coaches his son, is accused of inflicting causing bodily harm to his son practice partner Thomas Drouet during a row on Saturday. Both men appeared at court in Madrid today where Mr Drouet was seen with a large . dressing fixed to his nose with white surgical tape and a neck support. Accused: John Tomic, pictured left, is accused of breaking the nose of his tennis player son's training partner Thomas Drouet, pictured right leaving court . Knocked out: Bernard Tomic was defeated in the first round of the Mutua Madrid Open by Czech Radek Stepanek . Tomic, who claims he was acting in self-defence, appeared unscathed apart from a small cut above his right . eye. The pair sat about 15 metres apart outside the courtroom before Tomic insisted he acted in self-defence during a brief hearing. A further court appearance has been scheduled for May 14. The incident, which the Association . of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Tennis Australia (TA) are . investigating, took place on Madrid's central Paseo de la Castellana . street on Saturday and Tomic was later taken into custody at his hotel, . police said. He . was ordered to appear in court and could be handed a prison sentence of . up to three years and  fined if found guilty. 'I don't feel guilty, I didn't do anything wrong,' a weary-looking Tomic, whose light blue shirt had sweat circles under the armpits, told reporters after the hearing. Returning home: Drouet will now return to his home in France before the next hearing on May 14 . Asked if he was worried about being thrown off the Tour, he said: 'No I just said I didn't do anything wrong.' He . declined to comment further and left the court by a side entrance to . avoid the reporters and television cameras waiting in the street. A subdued Drouet, who will return to his home in France before coming back for the May 14 hearing, was reluctant to discuss the details of the incident as he left the court. He said he would consider maintaining his working relationship with world No 53 Bernard Tomic as long as the father was not on the team. Australia's Herald Sun newspaper quoted Drouet as saying that Tomic had treated him like a 'dog' for years and that he had punched his son in the mouth at a training session last week, leaving him in tears. Coach: Tomic (left) coached his son Bernard to a career-high ranking of No 27 in June 2012 . Shortly before the headbutting incident, John Tomic had told him he was sacked and would not be getting paid. 'I thought he was going to say sorry for the verbal abuse, but no,' Drouet told the paper. 'He spat in my face, then walked away, and said he wouldn't pay me any more. 'I said, ""OK, John, you are a real man. That's fine. Bernard will pay me"". And he head-butted me.' Tomic's Spanish lawyer, Carmen Dieguez, told reporters that while Tomic did not dispute that he had caused Drouet's injuries he had had no other choice to butt him as Drouet had grabbed him by the arms. Tension between the pair had been rising for some weeks and it was not the first time they had clashed, she added. Bernard Tomic, who lost 6-3 6-2 in the first round of the Mutua Madrid Open to Czech Radek Stepanek on Sunday, has long been the great young hope of Australian men's tennis. Controversial: Tomic has been the great Australian hope for years but has enjoyed his fair share of controversy . However, a lack of consistency over . the season has kept the 20-year-old's world ranking relatively low . despite strong showings in grand slam events. He has also enjoyed his fair share of controversy in his short career, frequently clashing with Australian tennis officialdom. One of the earliest incidents came . when his father ordered the then 16-year-old to walk off court at a . development event in protest at inaction against what he alleged was . repeated foot-faulting by his opponent. During . a late-season slump last year, a string of Australian tennis coaches . suggested Tomic dump his father as coach and work with someone new. Reacting . to initial reports about the incident, tennis Australia official Todd . Woodbridge, a former Australian Davis Cup player, said: 'What's . important for us at Tennis Australia is that this allegation is thrown . toward John, his dad, and not to Bernard. 'I just want to make sure that everyone . understands that this is nothing to do with Bernard and his behaviour,' Woodbridge, TA's head of men's tennis, told 3AW radio.TA later released a statement. 'Obviously media reports regarding an incident in Madrid are very concerning,' it read. 'We are working closely with ATP officials who are investigating the incident and are unable to comment further until the full facts are known.'

The actor who voiced Charlie Brown in classic cartoon Peanuts has been sentenced to jail for stalking and making death threats to a former girlfriend and her plastic surgeon. Peter Robbins, 56, was handed a 12-month jail term and five years on probation followed by a stern Peanuts-related warning from the judge to ‘not be a blockhead’. The former voice actor was arrested in January for stalking his former partner, allegedly calling her as many as 37 times in 24 hours, telling her he would kill her and her son. Scroll down for video . You're jailed, Charlie Brown: Peter Robbins was sentenced to a year in jail for threatening his former girlfriend and stalking her plastic surgeon . Robbins, who famously gave voice to Charlie Brown’s screams of frustration in the 1960s television show, also stalked his former girlfriend’s plastic surgeon, blaming the breast enlargement she performed on his ex for their breakup. Sentencing him to one year in county jail and five years on probation, a San Diego judge borrowed a line from Peanuts to warn Robbins of the consequences of violating his terms. ‘If I can borrow a line from 'Peanuts,' sir, I'm going to grant probation. If you adhere to those terms, you won’t go to prison. So, don’t be a blockhead.’ Robbins was arrested on the Mexican border in January, accused of threatening and stalking Shawna Kern following their breakup. Ms Kern said Robbins would constantly call her and make threats to kill her and her child if she did not return Robbins’ car and dog. Not exactly Peanuts: As well as the one year sentence, the former Charlie Brown voice actor was given five years on probation and was told by the judge 'not to be a blockhead' to avoid further jailtime . Tears: The 56-year-old former voice actor breaks down in court as his sentence is handed down in San Diego . During his April trial, prosecutors . said Robbins threatened plastic surgeon Lori Saltz after she performed a . breast enhancement surgery on Ms Kern, paid for by Robbins. Robbins and Ms Kern broke up after the surgery and Robbins began stalking Ms Saltz, demanding a refund. Prosecutors . said Robbins was calling Ms Saltz’s Carlsbad clinic so many times she . moved to a hotel temporarily out of fear for her life and hired an armed . guard outside her clinic. The . court also heard Robbins confronted his former girlfriend in a hotel . room on New Year’s Eve, beating his dog and telling her he would not . stop hurting the animal and would kill her if she did not get a refund . for the surgery. He then grabbed his ex-girlfriend by the neck and shoved her against the door before fleeing. I'm sorry: Peter Robbins reads out a statement where he expressed regret and apologised for the pain caused to his two victims . Robbins pleaded guilty to  two counts of stalking and ten counts of making criminal threats in April, and openly cried in court as his sentence was handed down. Robbins, famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark 'AAUGH!' screams of frustration in the 1960s, managed a smile through the tears as the judge delivered the Peanuts jibe. The San Diego judge warned him not to be a ‘blockhead’ – a reference to the cheeky insult often thrown at his character Charlie Brown. Prior to his arrest Robbins had spoken out against the forthcoming Peanuts movie, calling it pointless and a 'horrible idea'. He accused 20th Century Fox of . lacking creativity and trying to steal the thunder of the original . televised version of the popular cartoon. Former glory: Peter Robbins, 56, pictured with Charlie Brown in 2008, is famous for voicing the Peanuts character's trademark 'AAUGH!' screams of frustration in the 1960s . As a child actor, Robbins became famous for voicing Charlie Brown's trademark screams of frustration in A Charlie Brown Christmas (above) and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown . Speaking in October last year, Robbins said: 'What's the point? 'If it's to reintroduce the character . of Charlie Brown to a new generation, it's been passed on successfully . for 46 years. That's the beauty of it.' The comic strip ran from October 2, 1950 to February 13, 2000, and in its prime reached 355 million people in 75 countries. Following yesterday's sentencing, .

Abe Astur has spastic diplegia which tightened his leg muscles, restricted his movement and, until recently, forced him to use a walking frame. His family raised £50,000 to pay for him to have a selective dorsal rhizotomy operation, in the U.S. because the procedure is not widely available in the UK. Abe Astur, 2, (pictured with his sister, Thea, 4, and parents Leigh and Gavin) was born with spastic diplegia which tightened his leg muscles and restricted his movement . The operation involves severing the nerves in the spine that send messages to paralyse the leg muscles. With the tensed muscles free to resume normal movement, the patient is then able to walk. Abe's mother Leigh, 35, from Winchester, Hampshire, said: ‘We are thrilled it went well. ‘It's now a case of building up Abe's muscles he has never used before and we are pleased we went through with the operation in America. ‘His surgeon says Abe will walk independently within six months of the procedure. ‘This is the best prognosis we could have wished for and Abe has been amazing. ‘The surgery was tough and we spent a week in the hospital in St Louis, Missouri, as part of a month out there. His parents raised £50,000 to allow him to have surgery in America - the procedure involved cutting the nerves that told his leg muscles to contract . ‘But because he is so young he didn't fully understand what was going on and he accepted everything and handled it very well.’ Ms Astur added that the surgeons believed Abe will even be able to play sports in the future. She said: ‘This procedure should be more accessible and medical people should be more knowledgeable in the UK. ‘It's an operation which parents in England should be aware of but it's just so difficult to get funding. He is now learning to walk again and his surgeon believes that he will eventually be able to take part in sports . ‘We have been talking to Steve Brine, Winchester MP, about taking this issue to Parliament and he has been a fantastic help. ‘It makes my blood boil to think children have grown up with difficulty when they could have had this operation. ‘Hopefully between us we can change another child's life by alerting people to this procedure.’ The family, including Abe's father Gavin, 38, and sister Thea, four, held a party to thank people who donated towards the cost of the operation. Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs. The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system. These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body. Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves. This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut. Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic. Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs. Source: SCOPE .","Abe Astur was born with spastic dipledia - a form of cerebral palsy .

Anger: Deborah Parrott is unable to get her dog back because a council near her home in Norwich, Norfolk, had already rehomed him when she got in touch . When mother-of-five Deborah Parrott was told her lost dog had been sent to a council kennels she thought she would swiftly be reunited with her lost pet. But the local authority said her beloved six-year-old German Shepherd and Rottweiler cross had been rehomed with a new family so she couldn't have him back. Although only six weeks had passed since Rocko slipped out of Ms Parrot's garden, officials refused to even contact the new owner on her behalf to see if a deal could be done. The pet, which had been with the family since it was a puppy, had not been microchipped. Rocko vanished from the family's garden in Norwich, Norfolk, on March 14 and Ms Parrot's son Lee, 16, contacted Norwich City Council. Over the following six weeks the family searched the streets around her home for any sign of her dog. She had almost given up hope when the girlfriend of her oldest son Dillon, 21, put an advert on Gumtree along with a photograph of Rocko to ask if anyone had found her pet. Ms Parrott was delighted to hear a few days later from a woman who recognised the picture and phoned to say that she had found the dog on March 18 on a street in Norwich. She had taken the dog to the Broadland District Council officers who put him in kennels and re-homed him seven days later. A council official told Ms Parrot that they could not reveal the name of the new owner or the private kennels where he was looked after on behalf of the council. She said: 'All I wanted was to speak to the person who had been given Rocko so I could tell them that he was my much-loved pet and I was desperate to get him home. 'I am sure that the new owner would be more than happy to give Rocko back to me - but I have no way of knowing who they are unless they hear about me and make contact. 'When I explained all this to the bloke from the council, he just told me, ""It's not your dog any more"". I replied, ""Yes it is my dog - I just want him back"". Family pet: Rocko vanished from the family's garden in Norwich, Norfolk, on March 14 . Owner's fury: Broadland District Council said ownership of the dog had already passed so there was nothing they could do . 'I said, ""Can I speak to the people who have got him"", and he said, ""We can't do that"". 'I just couldn't understand his attitude. I guess it was just because of their confidentiality rules. But there is nothing to stop them getting hold of the person who has Rocko and asking them to call me.' Family pet: Rocko is a six-year-old German Shepherd and Rottweiler cross . Ms Parrott said she had initially only reported Rocko was missing to Norwich City Council as it is her local authority. Three weeks later, she contacted neighbouring councils in case her pet had been found in their areas. When she first made contact with Broadland District Council, officials failed to tell her that Rocko had already been handed in and re-homed. Ms Parrott said: 'The problem is a lack of communication. I feel I have been treated in a disgusting way. 'It would have been much easier if Rocko had been microchipped, but I did not really see the need of it before now because he had never gone off before. 'I have owned Rocko for six years since he was a puppy. He is such a clever dog and I miss him every day. The house just isn't the same without him. 'I'm not angry with the new owners, I just want them to know the whole situation so we can get something sorted so that Rocko can come home.' John Fisher, the Broadland District Council portfolio holder for environmental excellence, said: 'If this dog had a tag and/or chip, it could have been identified straight away by either the person who found it or Pets at Home and returned to its owner. 'We are very sorry to hear that this resident could not be reunited with her dog, and would urge all owners to bear in mind the heartache and expense which can be saved by a simple chip or tag for your dog's collar.' A council spokesman added: 'If anyone calls Broadland District Council reporting a lost dog, we always recommend they call all local councils in the area.'","Deborah Parrott had owned six-year-old Rocko since he was a puppy .

'There was a time when she put it to me that I could have Eddy Shah's baby,' the alleged victim, who is now 34, told the court. 'She said that she could come up with the readies.' Asked if she wanted to have the child, the woman said: 'No. I ignored it. I never, never tried to get any financial gain out of having sex with him.' She said she suspected that Shah had subsequently fathered a daughter with Davies. 'She looks the spitting image of him,' she said. 'You only have to look at a photo.' Davies also has a child by Tony Pallant, who is also on trial as the woman says he repeatedly raped her around the same time. The court heard Shah wanted to have sex with the girl on his own, but Davies always insisted on being there and even on taking part. Defendants: Prostitute Susan Davies and her former lover Anthony Pallant have also been charged with rape . 'She told me that Eddy Shah wanted to see me on my own but Davies was not going to let me see him on my own,' said the woman. 'I felt very guilty because it happened with more than one man. The secret became a more dreadful secret.' The court heard yesterday that Davies had 'sold' the teenager to Shah for £650 in order to pay off her credit card debts. She says he attacked her at least eight times in his suites at five-star hotels such as the Dorchester. Tycoon: Shah pictured with Margaret Thatcher at an awards ceremony in 1984 . Shah, who is charged under his real name Selim Shah, ran the now-defunct Today newspaper and was best known for bringing in new technology and colour printing. He, Davies and Pallant are charged with 13 separate sex attacks on the girl between 1991 and 1995, all of which they deny. The trial continues.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 09:06 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:54 EST, 7 May 2013 . Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today, has rejected suggestions from Beijing that he should not meet the Dalai Lama . David Cameron has warned China it cannot use its economic might to dictate which leaders and countries Britain can deal with. The Prime Minister plans to visit China before the end of this year, despite a growing diplomatic row over his talks 12 months ago with the Dalai Lama. Downing Street sought to play down fears the dispute with Beijing could cost Britain billions in lost investment. Huge building projects, including High Speed Rail and new nuclear power stations, could struggle to raise funding if China’s sovereign wealth fund refuses to invest. Mr Cameron met the Dalai Lama with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in May last year. But China has always warned foreign governments from holding talks with the Tibetan spiritual leader, who wants his homeland to enjoy self-rule free from Chinese control. A visit by Mr Cameron to China last autumn was called off and a trade trip planned for last month was also cancelled. But the Prime Minister has refused to bow to pressure from Beijing, despite warnings that investment in the UK could be put on hold until the crisis is resolved. In strident remarks, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman insisted Britain would not be bullied by Cina. ‘The Chinese government always lobbies hard against any meetings between foreign governments and the Dalai Lama,’ he told reporters. ‘We have made clear in advance to the Chinese government that British minister will decide who they meet and where they meet them. ‘It is entirely reasonable for the Prime Minister to decide who he meets and I think it reflects our approach of dialogue, discussion and gathering a wide range of viewpoints on an issue of importance.’ Mr Cameron, and deputy Nick Clegg, met Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama in May last year, triggering a diplomatic row with China . Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg met the Dalai Lama at St Paul's Cathedral in May 2012 . Downing Street denied that Mr Cameron felt under ‘pressure’ to apologise to China, and rejected the idea that the PM has effectively been barred from visiting the Far Eastern superpower. Mr Cameron hopes to lead a visit to China in the next seven months, although Number 10 would not give more details on when it might happen. Government aides note that Mr Cameron recently met both the Chinese Communist Party secretary and premier. Since the controversial Dalai Lama meeting in May last year, British ministers have had around 14 meetings with their Chinese counterparts. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today said the need to secure investment from China did not mean Britain could drop concerns about human rights . Six British ministers have visited China and four Chinese ministers have visited the UK in that period. A spokesman added: ‘The figures speak for themselves. Chinese investment in the UK was $8 billion in 2012. That's four times more than the previous total. ‘Meanwhile, UK exports to China grew by 13.4 per cent last year, which is more growth than any of our European partners. ‘We want to establish a stronger relationship with China, recognising that it is in the interests of both countries to manage our differences with respect and co-operate as much as possible.’ The meeting between Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and the Dalai Lama was part of the Government's approach of seeking ‘dialogue and discussion and gathering a wide range of viewpoints on issues of importance’, said the spokesman. It is thought that the venue for last year's meeting at St Paul's Cathedral was designed to stress that the Dalai Lama was being dealt with as a spiritual leader and not a politician. But Number 10 refused to say whether religious issues were discussed, saying only that it was a private meeting. Mr Clegg insisted he was not willing to put concerns over human rights to one side because of China's growing economic power . The Deputy Prime Minister told Sky News: ‘We have a very important relationship with the Chinese authorities. It's, self-evidently, one of the great economic superpowers of today and particularly the future. We have a very important economic relationship with them. ‘But that doesn't mean we should somehow give up on what we believe in when it comes to human rights and freedoms which we will continue to express in a respectful but nonetheless firm way.’","Prime Minister refuses to bow to Beijing demands for apology .

"By . Oliver Wadeson . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 4 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:15 EST, 4 May 2013 . Margaret Thatcher inspired love and loathing, but even her greatest detractors could never dispute her work ethic – the Iron Lady survived on four hours’ sleep at night and was known to see holidays as something that got in the way of toil. As a result, little light has been shed on how she spent her time away from the coalface at No 10 and the House of Commons. But Dr David Barnardo and his wife Ann, owners of Church Cottage in Great Witcombe, Gloucestershire, can offer some insight into how she liked to spend her rare weekends away from the pressures of office, because the Thatchers were regular visitors to Church Cottage in the Eighties. Happy union: The exterior of Church Cottage - an amalgamation of three workers' dwelling . Retired gastroenterologist David, 75, a great-great-nephew of Dr Thomas Barnardo, founder of the children’s charity, and Ann, 73, a retired bereavement counsellor, were prospective buyers of Church Cottage in 1998 when they noticed photographs on the walls of Mrs Thatcher and her husband Denis relaxing in the garden of this grand country abode. It transpires that the Thatchers had been weekend guests of the man who sold Church Cottage to the Barnardos, Sir Christopher Lawson, who lived there with his wife Marjorie. Sir Christopher enjoyed a high-flying career with the Mars confectionary group before working with the Conservative Party in the Eighties as a marketing adviser. Along with Cecil Parkinson and Norman Tebbit, he masterminded the Tory Election victories of 1983 and 1987. He was among the Iron Lady’s most trusted confidants – she described him in her memoirs as ‘that rare and useful animal, a businessman with acute political instincts’. But the Thatchers’ invitations to Church Cottage may well have come through Denis, as he and Sir Christopher were golfing partners. Sir Christopher died in 2007, aged 84. Tasteful: The dining room at five-bedroom property in Great Whitcombe, on the market for £1.5million . One can see why the Thatchers enjoyed coming here. It is difficult to imagine a setting more removed from the hurly burly of Westminster. Situated at the foot of one of the most spectacular wooded escarpments in the Cotswolds, and in striking distance of Cheltenham and Cirencester, Church Cottage stands in nearly one-and-a-half acres of landscaped grounds in the peaceful hamlet of Great Witcombe in the shadow of the village church – hence the house name. The Barnardos are now selling the property for £1.5 million to return to Surrey, where they lived before moving to the Cotswolds and where their children and grandchildren continue to live. Church Cottage, which has five bedrooms . and an attic room devoted to a model railway, originated from a group of . three farm labourers’ dwellings, the first being built in the late . 1600s. Iron bolthole: Baroness Thatcher visited Church Cottage in her political heyday . These were remodelled as one house in the 19th Century, which explains why the property has three staircases. The house has been evolving ever since. An extension was added at the back in Edwardian times, and with one owner buying a section of the road running into Great Witcombe, turning it into the property’s rather grand private drive. ‘We feel we have the best of both worlds,’ says David. ‘There’s the cosiness you get with the low ceilings and old beams of the 17th Century rooms in the front and the larger Edwardian dimensions at the back.’ The Barnardos have also played their role in Church Cottage’s evolution, adding a large conservatory and indulging their love of gardening to transform its outside space into a magnificent plot with a French-style ‘potager’ vegetable and fruit garden. They have also restored a water feature at the front. Despite Church Cottage’s location deep in the Cotswolds countryside, David was attracted to the property because of its convenience for London, Birmingham and Bristol, which he would visit when he was chairman of the trustees of Barnardos from 2001 to 2006. He remains a vice-president and now serves in an ambassadorial role. He is the first family member since his great-grandfather’s brother – Dr Thomas, who lived from 1845 to 1905 – to play a major role in the running of the charity. ‘When Dr Thomas Barnardo died, the family were kept at a distance from the running of the charity but I always felt a connection with the founder because I, like him, trained at The London Hospital in East London,’ he says. David and Ann are part of the last surviving branch of the family bearing the Barnardo name and are proud that three of their five children are trained doctors, ensuring there will be more Dr Barnardos in years to come. Guy Tabony, manager of Hamptons International in Painswick, which is handling the sale, says: ‘Church Cottage is ideal for growing families or for those with teenagers requiring their own space. It is also well suited for young retirees and for those looking to escape the city.’ Hamptons International, 01452 812354, hamptons.co.uk .","Baroness Thatcher often visited Church Cottage as PM in the Eighties .

Scam: Anne Manger, 55, carried out the fraud so she did not have to lay off her staff in Oakham, Leicestershire . An 'exemplary' postmistress who stole £114,000 to keep her struggling branch afloat after a lifetime working for the Royal Mail has been jailed. Anne Manger, 55, whose father was a postmaster, was a well-respected member of the community but turned to fraud when money worries hit in January 2010. She struggled to pay her daily bills and rather than lay staff off or admit the business was struggling she began to generate false cash credits and pocketed more than £100,000. She covered her tracks by sharing the debt she created out between a number of the branch's outreach services. A court heard that she even kept her crime secret from her husband because she wanted to protect his reputation. But her scam was foiled when a routine audit found £113,872 missing from the accounts. Manger, who ran the post office in Oakham, Leicestershire, admitted fraud and was jailed for 16 months at Leicester Crown Court. Judge Robert Brown told her she had committed a 'significant breach of trust'. He said: 'Many in the community speak well of you and your family, who support you through this. 'It's such a large sum, over a long period of time, it's too serious not to mark it with a custodial sentence.' Michael Garvey, mitigating, said: 'She's been employed by the Post Office all her working life, and her father before her. 'She's previously run post offices in various locations in an exemplary fashion. 'Oakham Post Office needed building up when she and her husband first moved there and she started an outreach branch, going to villages so those who had lost their post offices would have some service. 'They were hit, as every business in the country was, by the recession. Fraud: The post office in Oakham got into financial difficulties in 2010 and the respected boss Anne Manger turned to crime to cover their losses . Guilty plea: Manger and her husband have sold their home to pay back the money which was taken . 'Extremely difficult circumstances arose and over a three-year period, the money went purely on living expenses and making sure the premises could stay open. 'She didn't want to lay off any staff and she was working more than 60 hours a week. 'They didn't have a lavish lifestyle and hadn't been taking holidays or buying cars beyond their means. 'She knew from the outset she would be found out and it was a weight off her shoulders.' The Mangers, who ran the post office together for six years, have now been forced to sell their £150,000 home to pay back the stolen money. A Post Office spokesman said: 'We believe that all sub-postmasters hold a unique position of trust. 'The overwhelming majority of people who work in our branch network are professional, honest and provide the highest standards of service possible and so it is always disappointing when that trust is breached.'","Anne Manger, 55, generated false cash credits to cover businesses' costs .

Case: 'Broken woman' Caroline Woollen stole nearly £160,00 from her employers to bankroll a series of expensive holidays for her boyfriend . A manager of a global offshore company who stole almost £160,000 from her employers spent nearly all the cash on taking her boyfriend on luxury holidays to stop him from leaving her. Caroline Woollen tricked her Danish employer, Nordic Offshore, into believing she had secured lucrative contracts for them with Shell and Siemens. Company bosses paid her £159,000 to hand . to workers to complete the contracts - but she instead spent the money . on a campervan, skiing holidays and a £10,000 luxury trip to Canada. Woollen, 33, has now been ordered to pay back just £10,000 - after the court heard that she had spent all of the cash. Hull Crown Court heard that her partner had left her after her deception was uncovered. Now, although Judge David Tremberg has ruled Woollen, 33, made £158,634 from her crimes, she has only been ordered to repay £9,240 because she has spent all the stolen money and has no other assets. The court has ordered she pays the money directly to Nordic Offshore as compensation within 28 days or face six months in prison under the Proceeds of Crime Act. Woollen, from Brough, East Yorks, pleaded guilty to fraud between April 2011 and May last year. She was charged with stealing £387,609.13 but pleaded guilty to stealing £159,000. Hull Crown Court heard Woollen, who had been drinking up to three bottles of wine a night, was a fantasist who led a 'Walter Mitty existence'. Her barrister, Anil Murray, said: 'She wanted to be loved by her partner. She wanted to please him. 'Once this offending was uncovered, her partner left her. 'She is a broken woman.' Deceptive: Woollen managed to convince her bosses at Nordic Offshore Marine - which specialises in providing offshore personnel - said she had secured lucrative deals to get them to authorise payments . The court heard Woollen even lied to her family about her accomplishments, claiming she was at drama school and college when both were untrue. Woollen had previously defrauded a different company in 2010 and had been convicted of writing a false invoice. Nordic Offshore, which supplies skilled personnel to the offshore industry, was unaware of her previous convictions when she secured a job with them after pretending she had excellent contacts with Siemens and Shell. Her first task was to apply to the UK Border Agency for a licence allowing the firm's employees to work in the UK, but she failed to make the approach. She lied to her employers, creating fictitious emails pretending she had. Hearing: Hull Crown Cour was told Woollen, who had been drinking up to three bottles of wine a night, was a fantasist who led a 'Walter Mitty existence' Woollen then said she had obtained contracts with major firms, requesting thousands of pounds, which she claimed she needed to pay contractors. Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'She admitted all of this offending and said she was trying to impress her boyfriend and her family. 'She went on skiing holidays, funded a £10,000 holiday to Canada with her boyfriend and talked about all the parties she had attended using company money.' Woollen was sentenced to two years' imprisonment, suspended for two years, was ordered to attend an alcohol treatment course and carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Judge Simon Jack told her: 'You are a victim of your own personality and your need to please those around you.'","Caroline Woollen told bosses she had contracts with Shell and Siemans .

A man was left stunned after discovering a postcard, which fell out of a book he bought from a charity shop, had originally been sent from his brother to his late mother 25 years ago. Grandfather-of-five Peter Dodds, 70, bought a biography of Winston Churchill from Ashgate Croft charity shop in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, for 50p - but it wasn't  until he got it home and started reading it that the postcard fluttered to the floor. He read the note with general musings about a holiday in Washington DC - and only realised the incredible coincidence when he looked at the address it had been sent to was his mother's. Incredible coincidence: Peter Dodds (right) with the Winston Churchill Biography and postcard sen by his brother Ian McCollum (left) to their late mother 25 years ago . The card had been sent by his brother, Ian McCollum, 65, to his mother Nellie in 1988 - and Mr Dodds believes Nellie had used it as a bookmark inside his late father's book. Mr Dodds, a retired salesman who lives in Chesterfield with wife Lorna, 70, a retired home care worker, said: 'I just couldn't believe it. What are the odds of something like that happening? Recipient:The postcard was originally sent to Nellie McCollum by hers son Ian McCollum when he was visiting Washington DC in 1988 . 'I was astonished. I got goosebumps - it's unbelievable.' He explained: 'I often go in to the charity shop to look through the books. 'Like my father, I'm interested in Winston Churchill so that's why I got the book about two weeks ago. 'It wasn't until I was home later that I opened the book to have a read. 'I think the postcard might have been tucked inside the back cover because as I flicked through, it fluttered to the floor. 'I picked it up and I suppose I was just being a bit nosy reading it. 'The postcard had a picture of a statue in Washington, and on the back it said how good the weather was, how Washington was, and joked about how somebody had tried to sell him the statue which was pictured - typical tourist stuff. 'I didn't recognise the names at the bottom because they weren't very clear - but as I looked at the address I couldn't believe it - it was addressed to my mother. 'It was then I realised it was sent to her by Ian and his wife Diane when they were on holiday in 1988. 'I told my wife straight away - she didn't believe me, and I had to show it to her before she would listen properly. 'And as soon as I could, I phoned Ian, and said I've had a postcard from you, from Washington. 'He couldn't understand what I was on about because obviously he hasn't been to America for years. 'As I explained it, he was gobsmacked and said something I couldn't really repeat.' The postcard is 'immaculate', and Mr . Dodds believes it must have been used as a bookmark to keep it in such . good condition. He's given it back to his brother to keep. Chance find: Mr Dodds discovered the postcard in a biography of Winston Churchill he bought from a charity shop in Chesterfield, Derbyshire . Sender: Ian McCollum holds the postcard he wrote to his mother all those years ago . His mother lived in Chesterfield until she died in 1999, and after her death the brothers donated some of her books to the home's library and somehow the book has made its way to the charity shop. Mr Dodds believes he gave the book, which was published in 1979, to his father as a present. 'I'd love to know who donated the book and where it's been on its travels. I normally donate my books back to charity but I think I'll be hanging on to this one,' he added.","Grandfather Peter Dodds, 70, discovered card addressed to his late mother .

And the Association of Former Members of Parliament (AFMP) also wants a return to the famous green benches to hold a debate in the Commons chamber once a year. The former MPs want to hold a debate in the Commons chamber once a year to relive old glories . The call comes from the same group which last year announced it wanted to award ex-MPs with a gold-plated gong, which has now gone on sale for £199. Representatives of the group of around 500 former MPs have approached the House of Commons Commission, which Mr Bercow chairs, about securing public funds to pay for their work. They have been told to submit an application in the next bidding round this autumn. They want to base the group on the U.S. Association of Former Members of Congress, which receives a large chunk of its funding from a body founded with $7million of public money. But the extraordinary demand for former politicians to have state backing after leaving office has been condemned at a time when the government is imposing deep spending cuts on public services. Eric Moonman, Labour MP for nine years in the 1960s and 70s, said the money was needed to allow ex-politicians to travel the country and give talks at colleges and universities. But he admitted it could be ‘seen to be trivial given all the pressures that people have’ at a time of austerity. Ex-MPs can now buy a gold-plated medal for £199 from the AFMP, which comes 'in a beautifully crafted box bound in soft Italian green leather with a cushion/silk inlay' The AFMP has 500 members, including Tony Blair, Sir John Major and Boris Johnson. It was set up to help MPs ejected from the Commons at elections to cope with 'becoming suddenly unemployed' and the 'real blow' of losing touch with friends in Westminster. It runs an 'outreach programme' where former ministers and backbenchers give talks to students and voluntary groups. But Mr Moonman says public money is needed to pay for it. ‘I don’t think we are talking about . big money. One step would be to have specific levels to cover the . outreach programme to go into areas and pick up expenses,’ Mr Moonman . told MailOnline. ‘The second step having fully . justified out worth and value would be to have a conference or seminar, . something along the lines the Americans do. That could be low key and . low budget. ‘My target and ambition is what they have done in the US Congress and Canada.’ Former Labour MP Eric Moonman said time should be found for ex-politicians to debate in the Commons, but Tory MP Philip Davies (right) said the famous green benches should not be used by 'all and sundry' He suggested that ‘towards the end of a session’ in parliament when the government is ‘looking for items to debate’ an hour-long session should be set aside for former MPs to hold a debate in the Commons chamber on ‘the issues that they see’. ‘It could be an enormous lift to the whole idea that when a member is no longer in the House he can still play an important role.’ Ex-MPs won a battle with Commons authorities over the design of a gold-plated medal they wanted to award themselves. Licenced by the Queen, the crowned portcullis emblem was blocked from being used on the ex-MPs’ gong. A House of Commons spokesman said the crowned portcullis was a royal badge and its use was had to be formally authorised and licensed by the Queen. He added: ‘It must not be used where there is a risk that its use may be wrongly represented as having the authority of the House.' But the latest edition of the association’s quarterly magazine reveals they ex-MPs won the battle. The ‘gold plated lapel badge’ is on sale for £199. The advert states: ‘A stylish Gold Plated hand polished badge/brooch depicting the wording Former Member of Parliament, Crown and Portcullis. ‘Personalised with your initials and individually numbered on reverse, it is a ﬁtting way to display your involvement in British Politics. ‘Your badge/brooch will be placed in a beautifully crafted box bound in soft Italian green leather with a cushion/silk inlay, a brass plaque engraved with your name plus years of service will be attached to the box.’ But the ideas were rejected as an attempt to use public money for a 'reunion tour' for failed politicians. Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘I will be a former MP at some point. If people then want me to speak at a university I can either say yes or no. ‘I would like to think I would say yes but I don’t think the public should pay for that.’ He said he feared after the Youth Parliament was allowed to hold debates in the Commons chamber that other groups would also demand access. ‘It would appear that my fears are being realised. I think the chamber should be for MPs. 'Those people had an opportunity to have their say. 'They have now moved on and I think debates in the chamber should be for MPs and not all and sundry.’ Robert Oxley, Campaign Manager of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: ‘Only a small number of MPs could think that taxpayers should pay for them to play ex-politicians, even after they have been booted out of office. ‘We already have the House of Lords without devoting time and money to bring back formers members of the House of Commons for one last hurrah. ‘It’s MPs jobs to reach out to communities when they’re in office, just because some miss it after they’re done does not mean taxpayers should foot the bill for a reunion tour.’ The AFMP wants to copy the USA  Association of Former members of Congress which maintains a . major sponsor through John C Stennis Centre for Public Service, which . was founded in 1988 by Congress with $7.5 million held in a trust fund . in U.S. Treasury securities. Mr Moonman admitted it would be ‘hard’ for an . ex-MP to publicly call for public money. He suggested it would ‘take a . strong, existing member who is not necessarily troubled by the ballot . box to say this is what ought to happen’. ‘The important thing is to recognise . that individuals have got experience, have got some views, has been . disciplined and what a terrible waste,’ he added. Mr Moonman, who was Labour MP for . Billericay from 1966-1970 and Basildon from 1974-1979, said ex-MPs were . ‘like footballers’ who retire without earning a lot of money.","Association of Former Members of Parliament wants taxpayer support .

For 40 years, Patricia Bennetts has been seeking justice for her brother who was tortured to death by the Chilean regime of General Pinochet. Former British public school pupil Michael Woodward, a Roman Catholic priest, was seized soon after the dictator seized power in 1973. He was tortured and beaten for ten days and eventually died on the Chilean navy ship Esmeralda – where many of the regime's opponents were systematically brutalised. His body was never found. Finally this week, two men were found guilty of kidnapping Father Woodward and the Chilean government was ordered to pay compensation to his sister. Chilean press reports state the government was ordered to pay £35million to Mrs Bennetts, but she said it was only £70,000. The 75-year-old says she feels bitterly let down as the men, retired Chilean naval officers of low rank, were sentenced to just three years under house arrest. She said: 'Someone, somewhere, knows where his body is and I will keep on trying to find it so that he can have the Christian burial he deserves. 'The two retired officers who have been convicted were not the ones in charge – the real culprits, those who gave the orders to torture and murder Michael, have not been prosecuted. The whole thing is a farce.' She added: 'My brother died for his faith, the noblest of ideals, and I will not rest until there is justice.' Father Woodward was born in South America in 1932 to a British father and Chilean mother, but went to Downside boarding school in Somerset before studying engineering at King's College, London. In 1953 he returned to Chile to become a priest and, a world away from his privileged upbringing, went to live in a poor area of the coastal city of Valparaiso. Mystery: Mr Woodward disappeared days after General Augusto Pinochet, pictured left in September 1973 in Santiago, took power in a military coup . Victory: Patricia Bennetts has spent the last 40 years fighting for justice for her brother Michael . Ten days after the 1973 coup in which . the elected President Salvador Allende was deposed by General Pinochet, . Father Woodward was arrested and taken to a detention centre where he . was tortured in a swimming pool.

There are also reports that his arms were . broken with hammers. He was eventually taken to the . Esmeralda – a training vessel  which became a floating jail –where his . ordeal continued until he died. Mrs Bennetts, who lives with her husband in Madrid, has repeatedly returned to Chile to piece together the evidence.

The First World War's last surviving battleship is on course to be transformed into a floating museum after provisionally securing a £12 million lottery funding boost. The National Museum of the Royal Navy is now confident HMS Caroline will be opened as a 'world class' visitor attraction ahead of the centenary of its most famous wartime engagement - the 1916 Battle of Jutland off the coast of Denmark. The derelict vessel, which is currently docked in the same Belfast shipyards where the Titanic was built, was in danger of rusting away before moves to restore it started to build up steam last year. Leviathan: HMS Caroline is the First World War's last surviving battleship and is on course to be transformed into a floating museum after provisionally securing a £12million lottery funding boost . An historic image of HMS Caroline. It fought in the Battle of Jutland, where 14 British and 11 German ships were sunk, with great loss of life . The Heritage Lottery Fund today gave initial approval to a £12.2 million funding application to finance the restoration - the largest ever commitment made by the HLF in Northern Ireland. It has pledged £845,000 in first stage development funding and, if that work is completed as envisaged, the remainder of the money will then be released. The museum would complement a variety of maritime attractions in Belfast's old shipyards, including the £97million Titanic Belfast visitor attraction. A light cruiser, weighing 3,750 tons and measuring 446 feet, HMS Caroline was part of the screening force that sailed out ahead of the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet during the Battle of Jutland to establish the position of the German battleships. Sentinel: During World War Two it was used as an operations HQ for the efforts to protect the Atlantic convoys . History: HMS Caroline is moored at the Alexandra Dock in Belfast, where the Titanic was built . Mess: An original oven on the ship's galley . Tiller flats on HMS Caroline. It was the last WW1 Royal Navy Battleship to manually turn the rudder . Both sides sustained heavy casualties in what was the most significant clash between battleships during WWI. Britain and Germany both claimed victory. Six years after the war ended HMS Caroline was moved from Portsmouth to Belfast to become a training vessel for local Royal Navy Reserves. Most of the rest of the fleet was decommissioned and broken up. The HMS Caroline performed its function as a drill ship up until 2011, apart from during World War Two when it was used as an operations headquarters for the efforts to protect the Atlantic convoys from German U-Boats. Captain John Rees, chief of staff at the National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN), said the significance of the ship could not be overstated. 'She is a one of a kind, an iconic ship,"" he said. 'The only floating survivor of all the fleets - both German and British - that fought in the First World War and the Battle of Jutland.' Ship-shape: Captain John Rees, Chief of Staff at the National Museum of the Royal Navy inspects a porthole . Inspection: Captain John Rees (left) with Paul Mullan, Head of the Heritage Lottery Fund, on the ship . Captain Rees said he was confident the museum would be open ahead of the 100th anniversary in May 2016. 'The National Museum has a view, along with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, that there is the opportunity here to create a world class visitor attraction for Belfast and for Northern Ireland with a number of hugely interesting and important naval and maritime attractions. 'Not only that, it's an opportunity I think to involve all of the community of Northern Ireland in something that is uniquely Belfast and Northern Ireland. 'It's been here for the majority of its life - 80 plus years. It is something that all the community can share in and enjoy - it's something very special for them.' There had been fears in Belfast that the NMRN was going to bring the ship back to Portsmouth, but those were allayed last year when an agreement was struck to keep the vessel in its current home in the Alexandra Dock. The ship will undergo basic repairs and will then receive a £12 million lottery fund . Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment Arlene Foster takes a look around the ship . A £1million grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund was then secured for urgent repairs. That was seen as the first stage in a two part rescue mission - the second element being the lottery application. Paul Mullan, head of HLF Northern Ireland, said the funding reflected the importance of the ship. 'At £12 million, that's twice the size of the next largest grant that has ever been given to Northern Ireland,' he said. 'It's very timely. We are now in the decade of anniversaries and the First World War is one of those key anniversaries. We've 1916 with the (Battle of the) Somme, the 1916 Easter Rising (in Dublin). The Battle of Jutland is another particular story which is of tremendous importance. 'We see it very much in that context of a number of anniversaries that are going on and this is a great way of showing Belfast's link into the First World War.' Battle: 250 ships were involved in the huge battle, which took place in the North Sea near Jutland, Denmark . Northern Ireland Tourism Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the funding boost. 'Over the last year, there has been a significant effort, from myself and others to find a solution to keeping HMS Caroline here,"" she said. 'We have developed a strong partnership with the National Museum of the Royal Navy. This partnership will continue as we restore the ship. 'HMS Caroline has become part of the city's rich maritime heritage.' She added: 'Our ultimate aim is to transform the ship into a world-class floating museum in time for the Battle of Jutland centenary in 2016, as I believe HMS Caroline has huge potential as a visitor experience.'","HMS Caroline will undergo massive revamp thanks to cash .

Andrew Dawick was neither hungry nor homeless and lived at his home in Blackpool with his family, the court heard. But he would take to the streets of the seaside town with the sign and sit cross-legged with a pottery cup in front of him, begging for money. Andrew Dawick (left) took to the street of Blackpool with a 'homeless and hungry' sign while claiming nearly £370 in benefits and living in this terraced home (right) Dawick was targeted by the local authority and police who wanted to remove 'professional' beggars from the seaside resort. He admitted six offences of begging in a public place when he appeared at Blackpool Magistrates Court. Lynda Bennett, prosecuting for Blackpool Council, said he was approached by police after he was seen holding his cup up towards passers-by. He told officers: 'I need to do it to feed my kids - its better than robbing.' On another day he told police: 'Get a real job'. The prosecutor said Dawick, who also uses the name Dowick, would try and keep one step ahead of the authorities. She said: 'He would wear a sign round his neck stating homeless and hungry. 'However . he does have a house and receives a series of benefits - council tax . benefit, child tax credit, child allowance, housing benefit and . Jobseekers Allowance.' Dawick was targeted by the local authority and police who wanted to remove 'professional' beggars from the seaside resort (file picture) The court heard each time he was charged with illegal begging he had a potful of change in front of him. Once he told an officer: 'I can’t get a job its not that easy. I have got to make money somehow.' He would start to shout loudly at police and that caught the attention of passers-by. Sue Mugford, defending, said: 'My client turned to begging at the time he had a localised problem with his Jobseekers’ Allowance.' She said there had been a period where his Jobseekers benefits stopped. She said: 'That was because it was a joint claim with his partner and she had failed to keep an appointment at the Jobcentre. It has now been restored.' Dawick was given a 12 month conditional discharge and ordered to pay £115 costs. Judge Edward Barr told him he was restricted in how he could sentence him. 'If I fine you, the money will have to be deducted from your benefits and that could affect the welfare of your children. 'So, I am giving you a conditional discharge but there will be a small financial penalty - the costs.'","Andrew Dawick went begging in Blackpool while claiming benefits .

Robert Curtis, 47, threw himself in front of a southbound Jubilee Line train at Kingsbury station in north west London after taking cocaine and painkillers . A property tycoon jumped to his death in front of a tube train after losing his fortune, an inquest heard today. Robert Curtis, 47, threw himself in front of a southbound Jubilee Line train at Kingsbury station in north west London after taking cocaine and painkillers, the hearing was told. Father-of-one Mr Curtis - who it is said once dated supermodel Caprice - made millions of pounds in the early 2000s after launching a luxury property lettings business. At its peak Mr Curtis ran the firm from his office in upmarket St John's Wood, near Lord's cricket ground in north west London, and owned a chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce with a personalised number plate. He was once registered as a director of 15 firms and jetted around the world to do business, and was even said by one friend to have dated model Caprice Bourret. However, by the time of his death last November his business empire had crumbled and he was reduced to living in a Travelodge motel, the hearing was told. The tycoon fell on hard times as the recession saw all but one of his companies fold, with friends claiming he was suffering from depression at the time of his death. He was also reported to have been devastated by the suicide of his friend Paul Castle, a polo-playing pal of Prince Charles who threw himself under a tube train at Bond Street station in central London two years earlier. Mr Curtis had been reduced to living in a budget Travelodge hotel in Whetstone, north west London, at the time of his death, today's hearing was told. A jury at North London Coroner's Court heard the former millionaire was carrying just over £25 cash when he killed himself and that traces of cocaine were found in his urine. Tube train driver Adam Giles told the inquest of the moment Mr Curtis stepped in front of his train. He said: 'I remember pulling into the southbound platform, seeing a gentleman walking down the platform. He was said to be devastated at the loss of his wealth and of the death of his friend Paul Castle, a polo-playing pal of Prince Charles . 'He stopped, looked into the cab of the train and stepped off the edge of the platform. 'There . was no-one around. I pulled the emergency brake on the train which . stopped about two-and-a-half carriages into the platform. I opened my . cabin door - I was really shocked. 'I . was approached by a passenger on the platform who said 'I think someone . has just gone under your train - that confirmed what I had seen.' He was once registered as a director of 15 firms and jetted around the world to do business, and was even said by one friend to have dated model Caprice Bourret . A post mortem carried out by Dr Simon Poole after Mr Curtis' death revealed he had died of multiple injuries. Summarising the findings of Dr Poole's report, Coroner Andrew Walker said: 'It gives a cause of death as multiple injuries consistent with a high energy collision with a moving train.' And toxicology report revealed Mr Curtis had taken painkiller codeine prior to his death, although his alcohol levels were normal. Traces of cocaine were also found in his urine, but not bloodstream, meaning that he would not have been experiencing its stimulant effects when he died, the court heard. Summarising toxicologist Rebecca Andrew's findings to jurors, Mr Walker said: 'In effect it was negative, there was nothing in there that played a part in Mr Curtis' death. 'The report showed cocaine had been taken more than two to three hours before death, but no cocaine was present in the blood. The deceased would not have been experiencing the stimulant effects of the drug.' However, Mr Walker said Mr Curtis may potentially have been feeling depressive after-effects associated with cocaine use, including drowsiness. Jurors at the inquest heard how a suicide note was discovered on Mr Curtis' body, saying simply 'I love you mum and dad'  with his father's phone number written on the back. A colour photograph of Mr Curtis and his young daughter was also discovered by police, bearing the words 'I love you baby xxx' on the back. Asked about the note, Mr Curtis' father, Monty, told jurors: 'It was something he had torn off another piece of paper. 'It was maybe three inches long by one inch wide and he had just written on it ""Love you mum and dad.""'And when quizzed about the photograph by a juror, Mr Curtis answered: 'It was him and his daughter.' Returning a verdict, the jury foreman told the court: 'The conclusion as to the cause of the death of Mr Curtis was that he killed himself.'","Robert Curtis, 47, threw himself in front of a train at Kingsbury station .

While the stories of missing Cleveland girls Gina DeJesus and Amanda Berry have remained high-profile cases over the last decade, little is known of third captive Michelle. As yet, no picture has been published of Michelle, either from the time she went missing or since her discovery.

Her mother Barbara Knight now lives in Florida and said she never believed her daughter would have disappeared without a trace - despite police and social workers telling the family she must have left of her own accord. Mrs Knight said she would often put up fliers around Cleveland's West Side and even after moving away, returning to continue the search on her own. Michelle Knight's grandmother, Deborah Knight, said the family, after speaking with police and social workers, had accepted that she likely left on her own free will. Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight were found at this house in Cleveland, Ohio . They believed she was angry that her son had been taken into custody. Michelle was never registered as missing on the Ohio Missing Persons website. Neither Deborah or Barbara Knight have heard from police as yet, and both are gathering what details they can from . watching the news. But Barbara Knight said she hopes her daughter has been correctly identified. She added that she would be heartbroken to return to Cleveland only to find that Michelle was still among the missing.

After 10 years being held against their will, the women were finally freed after neighbour Charles Ramsey, heard screaming from the house.

Women with faulty PIP breast implants are at risk of chemical exposure that causes damage to unborn babies, experts have warned. Their report disputes previous warnings by the NHS that material inside the implants was ‘not toxic or carcinogenic’. The scientists are now calling  for an inquiry into the potential side effects of PIPs. Up to 47,000 British women could have received the French implants which were fraudulently filled with an industrial-grade silicone designed for mattresses. Testing has previously revealed that PIP implants were up to six times as likely to rupture as other brands. Writing in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine, the group of experts called for women to be given ‘full information’ by British authorities. The consumer protection group Antidote Europe said it disagreed with a report by the British Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulation Authority (MHRA)  that suggested the implants did not contain hazardous materials. The body identified dangerous levels of chemicals in the implants, with one known as D4 being deemed of ‘high concern’ by European health officials. Antidote Europe director and co-author of the report, Andre Menache, said: ‘Considering these known risks and the fact that most women receiving breast implants were of reproductive age, we would expect the MHRA and the Department of Health to fulfil its duty of care and thoroughly investigate these risks as well as provide full information to patients.’ The report says that thorough analysis of the gel within the PIP implants has yet to be carried out and also points towards possible contamination with lead, platinum and zinc during production. Faulty: A nurse holds defective breast implants manufactured by French company Poly Implant Prothese (PIP) The implants, made by the French company Poly Implant Prothese, were banned in March 2010 after a health scare in France. Yesterday Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, said: ‘We reiterate our call for analysis to be conducted on collected samples taken “in vivo” rather than off-the-shelf, as it would also be advantageous to examine what impact body temperature and conditions have on them.’ ‘Women who had or still have PIPs and the surgeons removing them know that more research is needed to explain what they are seeing and experiencing.’","Faulty PIP implants may pose pregnancy risk, according to experts .

But at the same time she promised not to ‘throw the baby out with the bath water’ and to keep the organisation’s traditional activities, from making chocolate to building a campfire. Miss Bentley said ‘I would have probably had the perception that Girl Guides was for middle-class girls when I was growing up, seeing as I am very working class and I was never a Brownie or a Guide. ‘However, the units do reﬂect the places they are in - in terms of social class, diversity and ethnicity.’ The head of Girl Guiding UK added the organisation has an image problem that she was intent on improving. ‘I haven’t made Guides cool. I’ve just shown everyone how cool it is’, she told the Daily Telegraph. 'But there is a real schism between what the organisation is and what people think. ‘I am working hard to shine a light on Girl Guiding UK so people can see what it’s really like — and that it is for everyone.’ Girl Guides is working with charities and youth workers to engage more girls in deprived communities and establish units in places where they have never previously existed.

She added: 'The number of new girls joining Girl Guides has been growing over the last eight years. 'However, we already have waiting lists of girls in many areas and if we are to serve more young women, we need more volunteers, from a variety of backgrounds to lead a programme in their local community.' Miss Bentley one described Girl Guiding as the 'ultimate feminist organisation' as it teaches girls confidence and valuable life skills.

Chris Ling is one of a number of teachers being investigated over allegations of abuse at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester . A violin teacher accused of sexually abusing pupils at one of the country’s top music schools could be ordered back to Britain. Chris Ling is one of a number of teachers being investigated over allegations of abuse at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester. Children have told how Ling would instruct girls as young as 15 to strip naked during lessons or spank their bare bottoms when he was a young teacher at Chetham’s in the 1980s. Ling, now 55, moved to California after a previous police inquiry in 1991 resulted in no action. Yesterday detectives at Greater Manchester Police said they had been speaking to US authorities with a view to extraditing him. More than 30 female former pupils have reported historic sexual abuse at Chetham’s and the Royal Northern College of Music – also in Manchester – since the conviction in February of former Chetham’s director of music Michael Brewer for sexually assaulting a pupil more than 30 years ago. His victim, mother-of-four Frances Andrade, committed suicide during the trial at the  age of 48 following a torrid cross-examination. The publicity surrounding the trial and her suicide has led to other ex-pupils coming forward. Former pupils have named a number of ex-teachers in connection with the alleged abuse, of whom five have subsequently died – including renowned Chopin specialist Professor Ryszard Bakst. Mr Ling is married to former pupil Pippa Clarke, who is now a concert violinist. Ling has repeatedly declined to comment on the claims. But contemporaries have described how his pupils were known as ‘Ling’s strings’ and that he bragged about taking nude pictures of them. A police spokesman said: ‘We are supporting each and every person who has come forward and made a complaint to us as best we can.’ Former pupils have named a number of ex-teachers in connection with the alleged abuse at Chetham's School of Music .

One of the star witnesses at Michael Jackson's 2005 trial who adamantly denied that he had ever been molested by the singer has now changed his story as he fights for money from Jackson's estate. Wade Robson, 30, a top music choreographer who has worked with Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake, knew Jackson decades ago when he went for sleepovers at the Neverland Ranch. On May 1, Robson filed legal requests for financial compensation from the singer's estate for 'childhood sexual abuse.' Then on Wednesday his lawyer told TMZ that Jackson was a 'monster' who sexually abused Wade for seven years, and even threatening him if he ever went public. Scroll down for video . Fanboy: Wade Robson, seen here at age 7, grew close to Jackson when he was a child and frequently slept over the star's infamous Neverland Ranch . Attorney Henry Gradstein told TMZ, 'Last year, on a career trajectory that was off the charts, [Wade] collapsed under the stress and sexual trauma of what had happened to him for seven years as a child.' Gradstein continued: 'He [Wade] lived with the brain washing by a sexual predator until the burden of it all crushed him.' New story: Wade Robson, seen here in 2008, reportedly filed legal papers on May 1 claiming that Jackson's estate should pay him money for childhood sexual abuse . The lawyer also claimed that Jackson threatened the younger man, saying: 'If anyone ever finds out about what we did we will go to jail for the rest of our lives.' Gradstein told TMZ that Wade was . silenced as a result: 'This kind of intimidation of a child by a sexual . predator is tragically characteristic and effective, keeping them quiet . about the abuse - often for a lifetime.' He concludes with: 'Michael Jackson was a monster and in their hearts every normal person knows it.' Robson's legal motion, which has been . filed under seal so it is not available to the public, comes years . after he made repeated public statements defending Jackson and denying . any wrongdoing. The two met when Robson was five years old and Jackson was in his late 20s or early 30s. They bonded over a love of music and he repeatedly slept over his house and spent nights in the same bed as the much-older singer. Robson played a pivotal role in the 2005 trial, when Jackson faced 14 counts relating to child molestation and conspiracy to molest minors. He was found not guilty on all of the charges, and Robson was one of the star witnesses who defended Jackson, saying that he was never inappropriately touched or molested. Synched stories: Though Robson testified at Jackson's 2005 trial that he was never molested by the singer (both seen outside of the courtroom), the papers his legal team just filed suggest otherwise . A similar defense was given by their . mutual friend Macaulay Culkin, who also slept over the singer's ranch . over a long period of time. In . the past eight years, Robson has made a name for himself in the . entertainment world, becoming one of the most sought-after . choreographers. He has . worked with Usher, Britney Spears, and NSYNC. His name hit the gossip . columns in 2002 when Britney Spears' relationship with Justin Timberlake . ended after she allegedly cheated on the NSYNC star with the . choreographer. Since then, Robson has worked on the show So You Think You Can Dance, and is currently in charge of Demi Lovato's choreography. New gig: Robson has made frequent appearances on So You Think You Can Dance as a guest judge . But on May 5, TMZ . reported that they heard from unidentified legal sources that Robson's . legal team filed papers asking for an undisclosed sum from the Jackson . estate on May 1. No other details about the filing have been released, . but they reportedly give an explicit detail of the alleged assault. News of the filing came on the same day that the late singer's autopsy report revealed that Michael Jackson tattooed his lips pink, permanently inked his eyebrows and relied on a dark tattoo to blend his hairline into his wig. As the high profile trial of the singer's tour promoter, AEG, continues, a disturbing photograph of the fallen pop star's corpse was shown to the court on Monday by Dr Christopher Rogers. His coroner's report described a man . whose struggle to hide a skin pigmentation disease forced him to mask . his true features but who would have lived a long life had he not . overdosed on propofol. The revelation of Jackson's permanent . make-up comes during the trial brought by the singer's mother . and children who claim AEG shares blame in his death for neglecting to . vet and supervise Mr Jackon's doctor, Dr Conrad Murray.

Bush and his former Secretary of State Colin Powell has a new victim but this time from the other side of the aisle. A close confidante of both former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been added as the latest victim of a hacker who goes by the name 'Guccifer'. Sidney Blumenthal's email was allegedly hacked sometime this week and Guccifer was able to obtain email correspondence between Blumenthal and Mrs Clinton. Close connections: Sidney Blumenthal (right) was an aide to Bill Clinton when he was President, and now Blumenthal was the latest victim in a series of politically-targeted hacks . The other Clinton: The hacker may have been targeting emails Blumenthal exchanged with Hillary Clinton when she served as Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year . It is unclear what exactly the hacker was looking for or how many emails he was able to obtain, but the data in Mr Blumenthal's breached AOL account dates back to 2005. The timeline means that it is unlikely that any memos that Blumenthal sent to Clinton when he worked as a close advisor in the late 1990s and early 2000s were part of the hacked data. Though Mr Clinton was out of the White House by 2000, he stayed in touch with the powerful couple up to present day. Mr Blumenthal told The Smoking Gun that he only realized something was awry with his account when he could not log in Thursday morning. Other targets: Former Secretary of State Colin Powell (left) had his Facebook account hacked and emails sent by former President George Bush's relatives (right) were also breached . To outside observers, Mr Blumenthal seems like an odd target because his theorettical political heyday occurred when Mr Clinton was in the White House. In that wake it appears the hacker was looking for information exchanged with Mrs Clinton while she was in the post of Secretary of State from 2009 to earlier this year. That theory also fits the trend that the hacker's interest stem from a possible conspiracy theory or issue stemming to foreign relations. Other targets have included Senator Lisa Murkowski, former United Nations ambassador John Negroponte and unidentified members of the famed Rockefeller family. Republican General Powell had his Facebook page broken into and created several posts. Offensive: One of the bizarre posts made by the hacker included this one which read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!' Bizarre: The hacker posted a series of rants on General Powell's page as well as a series of photos which are believed to have been taken from former President George W Bush's hacked email account . Apology: General Powell described the hacker's posts as 'stupid' and 'obscene' on his page yesterday . One post read: 'You will burn in hell, Bush!' In another bizarre post, the hacker ranted: 'Kill the illuminati! Tomorrow’s world will be a world free of illuminati or will be no more!' As well as the offensive posts, some of which insulted Powell himself, pictures were uploaded to Powell's Facebook page showing screen grabs of the hacker's previous access to email accounts of Mr Bush and his siblings Neil and Dorothy.","Sidney Blumenthal was an aide to President Clinton in the late 1990s .

A woman who has travelled the world without a scratch has finally found a destination which scares her - a beauty spot in her home town. Sarah Bowker has come across hundreds of wild animals on her travels in Asia, Africa and even the Amazon rainforest, but came away unscathed from her encounters. However, while walking her dog in Lancashire, she was bitten by a poisonous snake and had to spend a week in hospital. Her arm tripled in size and she struggled to breathe, and she was only healed when doctors requested anti-venom from a specialist clinic. Victim: Sarah Bowker spent a week in hospital after being bitten by an adder in Lancashire . Injury: The 29-year-old was left with a horrible bruise after the encounter with a snake . Hospital: Miss Bowker's arm swelled up to three times its normal size thanks to the bite . Miss Bowker, 29, has been to Peru, Mozambique and Thailand, where she let a boa constrictor coil around her neck, but is now recovering at home in Haslingden. 'I still can't get over that after all the dangerous places I have been in the world it was a snake in Haslingden that nearly killed me,' she said today. 'I've held lion cubs and even had a boa constrictor around my neck in the past, so I guess it's pretty ironic that I get bit by a poisonous snake here in the UK.' The adventurous young woman was walking around Calf Hey reservoir with her German shepherd Arwen when she was attacked last Thursday. Danger: Miss Bowker filmed the adder on her mobile phone after it bit her at Calf Hey reservoir . Bizarre: The patient's arms were radically different sizes after she was bitten . Anger: Miss Bowker says the company that owns the site should be more careful about warning people . 'I let Arwen have a run around like I usually do and I sat down,' she said. 'The grass was reedy and all different lengths. I put my hand out and from nowhere I felt a sharp sting on my arm just like when you have an injection at the doctors. 'I looked down and there was an adder sliding off through the grass. I was pretty shocked but decided to take some photos and a film in case it wasn't a grass snake and I'd need to identify it. 'Within minutes my arm started to swell and I knew it wasn't a grass snake so I rang the ambulance. By the time it arrived my arm was massive - about three times the size. 'Then my throat and face puffed up and I had trouble breathing. I knew then that it was serious.' Explorer: Miss Bowker posed with a boa constrictor wrapped around her neck in Thailand in 2007 . Brave: She also posed for a picture holding a tiger cub during the same holiday . At Royal Blackburn Hospital, doctors were unable to treat her until they were sent anti-venom by reptile experts at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, and she went into anaphylactic shock. 'I just remember sitting on a chair then all of a sudden being on the bed with doctors and nurses all around me,' she said. 'The anti-venom came within the hour and as soon as I had that I started to breathe properly again which was a massive relief. 'I had to stay there for six days on IV antibiotics and I think I became a bit of a celebrity on the ward because no one had ever had a patient who'd be bitten by a poisonous snake before.' Miss Bowker came face-to-face with plenty of venomous beasts during her holiday in the Amazon, but was not injured by them. Traveller: Now Miss Bowker has vowed to stay away from her local reservoir after her ordeal . Danger: But it was not until she returned to Lancashire that the traveller was hurt by an animal . 'There were capybara, which are the largest rodents in the world, various insects such as katydid, as well as monkeys, bird eating spiders which are really big,' she said. 'There were tarantulas and poison frogs too.' She has vowed never to return to the reservoir, and criticised the facility's owner United Utilities for not putting up warning signs. A spokesman for the company said: 'We are very sorry to hear that this lady has been injured while enjoying our land. 'Thankfully, attacks like these are extremely rare but we do wish her a speedy recovery.' Adders, the only poisonous snake native to Britain, bite up to 100 people each year, but there have been just 14 snake-related deaths in the past century. Dr Robert Harrison, from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: 'The lady who has been bitten did the exact right thing by staying as calm as possible.'","Sarah Bowker, 29, has come face-to-face with wild animals on world travels .

The detective wife of the first British chief constable to be sacked in 35 years has resigned herself after being held on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. Detective Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood had faced an Police Complaints Commission's hearing following an allegation she had failed to inform her superiors of the arrest two years ago. Ms Eastwood's husband, Sean Price, served as Cleveland's Chief Constable from 2003 until last October when he was dismissed for gross misconduct. His wife will no longer face any disciplinary action now she has quit her job at the same force. The former officer, who married Mr Price last year, was arrested at Northallerton railway station in 2011. She was questioned and later released with no further action taken. Following an investigation, the alleged incident was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission by Cleveland Police and Cleveland Police Authority in May last year. A force spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that a Chief Inspector who was due to face a misconduct hearing has now resigned from the Force. 'As the individual is no longer a serving police officer they are no longer subject to disciplinary proceedings.' It is not clear yet if she will keep her pension, but in most cases an officer who resigns will. Disgraced: Her husband Sean Price, former chief constable of Cleveland Police, pictured accepting the Queen's Police medal at Buckingham Palace, was sacked last year . A spokesman for the IPCC confirmed that details of its investigation would be released as soon as possible. Avoided: Heather Eastwood's decision to resign means that she escapes disciplinary action . He said: 'As the force has accepted the resignation of the officer there was no need for the hearing to proceed. However, we will publish the findings of the investigation once we are legally able to do so.' Ms Eastwood's husband, Mr Price, served as Cleveland's Chief Constable from 2003 until last October when he was dismissed for gross misconduct. He was found guilty of asking a . colleague to inquire about a job for the former police authority . chairman's daughter and subsequently lying about it. He was arrested in August 2011 and later dismissed from his £191,905 job, where he had been suspended on full pay. His sacking also meant he escaped a . further inquiry into claims that he abused his force credit card and . concealed the arrest of his wife. In March, Cleveland's former Deputy Chief Constable Derek Bonnard was dismissed for gross misconduct on six counts. Mr Bonnard denied any wrongdoing and planned to appeal against the ruling, however, earlier this week it emerged he had reached a settlement with the  force over disputed wages paid during his suspension and dropped the challenge.

Brighton Bomber Patrick Magee is pictured strolling in Belfast city centre this week . The man who came within inches of murdering Margaret Thatcher was back in England yesterday – just two days after her funeral. Brighton bomber Patrick Magee, 61, who was given eight life sentences for killing five prominent Tories, now  travels around the world lecturing on peace and reconciliation. Yesterday he made a speech on the  subject at the University of Huddersfield where, remarkably, he insisted he was ‘not a violent person’. Magee was freed from jail in 1999 as part of the Good Friday Agreement after serving just 14 years behind bars. But he has never apologised for trying to wipe out Mrs Thatcher and her Cabinet during the Tory party conference in 1984. Following her death, he has declined to answer any questions about his role in one of Britain’s worst terrorist outrages. A close friend said he did not wish to speak on the subject. He was pictured in Belfast on Thursday, where he spends much of his time in pubs doing crosswords and sudoku puzzles. In the city, where Magee enjoys hero status among hardline republicans, sources advised the Daily Mail not to approach him directly as this could ‘upset’ some of his supporters. In 1986 Magee was described by an Old Bailey judge as being ‘a man of exceptional cruelty and inhumanity’, and told he must serve a minimum of 35 years in jail. Following his release from the Maze Prison, he fathered two boys with an American novelist whom he married in 1997. They have since divorced and his ex-wife,  Barbara Byar, 50, now lives in Tralee, County Kerry, with a Croatian half her age. Miss Byar, who has remarried and has a new surname, refused to comment when approached by the Mail. Magee’s refusal to talk about Baroness Thatcher’s death is likely to enrage Tory activists. He provoked fury in October 2009 when he used a reception at the House of Commons to parade his lack of remorse at the atrocity. The former terrorist claimed the actions of the paramilitary group were no different from those of the British Army. The man once regarded as the IRA’s top bomb-maker insisted he had no option but to pursue a path of violence. Asked whether he had sought forgiveness for his crimes, Magee said: ‘Why would I ask for forgiveness? I did what I did in full conscience.’ Magee spoke alongside Jo Berry, daughter of MP Sir Anthony Berry, one of those killed by the bombing of the Grand Hotel. Shocked: Margaret Thatcher and husband Dennis Thatcher are pictured on the night of the Brighton Grand Hotel bombing during the Conservative Party Conference . The pair have forged a close bond and she accompanied him to the University of Huddersfield for yesterday’s conference on using linguistics to solve conflict. At one point, Magee told the audience: ‘I’m no pacifist, I’ve witnessed too much back in Belfast to be a pacifist – but I wouldn’t consider myself to be a violent person.’ Wrecked: This image shows the aftermath of the IRA attack in Brighton . On Thursday, he was seen walking unobtrusively around Belfast city centre, enjoying a quiet cup of tea as he read newspapers which had blanket coverage of Lady Thatcher’s funeral. Efforts to talk to the man at the centre of one of the IRA’s most audacious operations were to prove fruitless. But his ex-wife’s brother, John Byar, was more forthcoming. Speaking from his home in Connecticut, he revealed how his sister was living in San Francisco when she met one of Magee’s friends who had escaped from prison and moved to California. Mr Byar said: ‘He said he had a buddy in jail who would love to be writing back and forth. The next thing you know they got married. Blows my mind that she marries some guy in jail who is serving life. ‘They got married in jail and when he came out he was like a hero. We went over there afterwards. ‘Everywhere we went drinking  we drank for free. If you were with Pat then you were a king because he’s a king. They treated him like  a god. ‘I knew nothing about it, but over there in Tralee he was like a hero to them, but killing people is not heroic to me.’ Jo Berry, whose father was the only MP to die in the Brighton bombing, said she was ‘looking  forward not back’ in her working partnership with Magee. The unlikely pair have toured the world together addressing audiences in Rwanda, Palestine and Israel on the importance of forgiveness and understanding conflict. She said she never had a personal relationship with Lady Thatcher but remembered being invited to the Commons for a moment of silence in honour of her father. Attacker: Patrick Magee is pictured in his younger days. He has never apologised for trying to wipe out Mrs Thatcher and her Cabinet during the Tory party conference in 1984 . She told the Mail: ‘It does bring it all back. But I don’t believe in demonising anyone. ‘He [Magee] has refused to comment on her death and I think he’s right.  I think he thinks it would be an insensitive thing to do and I respect him for that. ‘He doesn’t want to make it any worse for her family – what could he say? He’s really aware of not wanting to cause any more harm.’","Patrick Magee, 61, .

A prolific conman has been jailed after selling three vehicles he pretended to own for £9,000 - his 158th offence. David Aves had only been out of prison a matter of days when he sold a Kubota KX 71, a Mercedes Vito and a JCB to Mindaugas Virketis. Despite Mr Virketis paying £9,000 into Aves's bank account, he never recieved the vehicles - because Aves didn't actually own them. Aves, 54, of Bradfield St George, near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was jailed after he admitted one count of fraud at Ipswich Crown Court. The court heard that Aves, who was once freed after forging release papers, had only been released from jail on September 27 last year. In total he had a string of 157 previous convictions which date back to 1976, most of which were for dishonesty. Katherine Moore, defending, said that Aves had spent most of his adult life in and out of prison. In mitigation she said that the defendant's mother had recently died and that his own health was failing. But he was sentenced to 13 months in jail. Sentencing Aves, Judge John Devaux said: 'You have proved yourself ingenious and resourceful in the past and your present offending shows little sign there has been any diminution in your behaviour.' Aves was released from Norwich Prison in 1995 after he faxed forged released papers but later recaptured. He also went on the run from Hollesley Prison in 2008. The conman gained such notoriety from the sale of fraudulent farming vehicles and equipment that his photo has previously been circulated in industry publications urging farmers not to do business with him.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 08:17 EST, 9 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:13 EST, 9 May 2013 . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, pictured earlier this year on a visit to Pentonville Prison, wants ex-inmates to mentor other criminals . Former prisoners are to be paid to persuade other convicts to not to reoffend, it emerged today. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling today defended the decision to use ‘old lags’ to stop criminals returning to jail again and again. He claimed the policy is part of a major overhaul of offender rehabilitation and would give the taxpayer value for money. Every prisoner leaving jail will now be monitored for a year after release under changes announced in yesterday’s Queen’s Speech. The probation service will be opened up to private firms who will be paid on their success at stopping criminals reoffending. The Offender Rehabilitation Bill clears the way for companies and charities to reverse the trend which last year saw 200,000 offences committed by someone who had already served lengthy terms in jail. There will be a new licence period and the supervision order last for a year for offenders who spend less than 12 months in prison. For those jailed for one to two years, they will be subject to a licence period for 12 months instead of six. Drug addict offenders will be forced to attend treatment appointments, with testing covering Class B as well as Class A drugs. Mr Grayling insisted pilot schemes had proved paying ex-inmates to mentor other offenders helped to cut crime. He told MPs: ‘You need to go and look, not in the world of big business but in the voluntary sector, where some of our first-rate charities have got living examples today of former offenders who have gone straight and are now helping turn the lives around of a next generation of offenders. ‘I want to capture those skills in helping bring down reoffending.’ He also wants to see prisoners who can read teaching those who cannot. Mr Grayling defended paying ex-offenders to work on rehabilitation schemes, and argued prisoners who cannot read could help to teach those who cannot . For the first time every inmate will be monitored for a year after leaving prison, under plans announced in the Queen's Speech . The Justice Secretary said the coalition did not believe all problems would be solved by ‘throwing money"" at them. Will paying former prisoners to help rehabilitate other convicts reduce reoffending rates? ‘Are we actually saying it is not possible to run the system more efficiently and deliver support where it is needed to the offenders most likely to reoffend when they leave prison?’ he said. He attacked Labour MPs who called for more funding for probation schemes. ’They think it is just a question of spending more taxpayers' money, higher taxes. We want to get better value for the taxes we already raise.’ But Mr Grayling was accused of sacking professional probation officers and paying former prisoners to take their place. Labour's shadow justice minister Andy Slaughter criticised the plan to cut the rate of reoffending . Shadow justice minister Andy Slaughter questioned the costs and merits of the Government's new prisoner rehabilitation plans. He said: ‘Professional probation officers sacked and replaced by ex-offenders. Is this your brave new world? ‘Unfortunately, it's a programme based on fewer resources, untried and untested methods, and putting faith in exactly those private sector organisations that have failed to deliver other major public sector contracts,’ he said. Ministers say all offenders who enter prison, even for just a few days, will be subject to new supervision and will be given support through housing, employment, training and substance abuse programmes. The reforms, to be rolled out across England and Wales by 2015, will see around 65,000 offenders serving sentences of up to two years receive extended rehabilitation. Tory MP Philip Davies said there should be longer prison sentences as figures suggest these reduce rates of re-offending. He said: ‘The longer people spend in prison the less likely they are to re-offend, largely because it gives them the time to do things like teach people to read whilst they are in prison before they are released.’ Mr Grayling said the length of time people had been spending in prison was increasing and he agreed they needed to take the opportunity to turn around the lives of people in jail.","Every prisoner leaving jail to be monitored for a year under reforms .

A surrogate father who spent ten years in jail for shaking his baby son to death has been freed after new evidence revealed the boy died of poor health. Drayton Witt, who was convicted in 2002 of second-degree murder in the death of his four-month-old son Steven. But this week, an Arizona Superior Court judge dismissed all charges against Mr Witt and he is now reunited with his wife, Maria. Free: Drayton Witt stands with his wife Maria Witt. He was convicted in 2002 for second degree murder but an Arizona judge has dismissed the charges . The 31-year-old was not Steven's biological father, but helped Maria raise him and had given the child his last name, according to Slate. Mr Witt said Wednesday that he was overcome with joy knowing the case was finally closed for good. 'I can start my life over again,' he told the Arizona Republic. Steven was born a 'blue baby' with his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. Court records showed that Steven had suffered from severe health problems and had been in and out of the hospital during his short life span. Steven died of a major seizure, which stopped his heart. Police and hospital officials originally decided upon Steven's death in 2000 that the infant's eye and brain injuries were caused by violent shaking and the medical examiner ruled the death a homicide. Since Mr Witt was the last person to be with his son, he was held responsible and later convicted of murder in a dramatic trial where prosecutors likened his actions to those of a gorilla. After spending ten years behind bars Mr Witt was released from prison in May after a judge set aside his 2002 murder conviction. A local nonprofit organization, the Arizona Justice Project, filed a motion in February stating that scientific evidence no longer supported the conclusion that Mr Witt shook his son to death. Not the first time: Armando Castillo (pictured) also had his murder charge overturned . An autopsy photo showed an obstructed vein leading to Steven's brain - an important detail the medical examiner did not include in his 2000 report ruling the death a homicide by shaking. The medical examiner, in a sworn statement given in February, said that if he were to testify in court again, he would conclude that the baby had died of disease, not physical abuse. Last week, the Maricopa County Attorney's Office filed a motion to drop the case, stating its 'expert' could not testify as to the original theory about the case and the Arizona Superior Court judge, Robert Gottsfield, dismissed the charges with prejudice. That ensures Mr Witt will never go back to jail for his son's death and prosecutors will not be allowed to retry him. Christina Rubalcava, an attorney for Witt, told the Arizona Republic that if the charges had only been dropped, Witt would have faced the risk of them being brought up again, since murder charges have no statute of limitations. 'We wanted to push forward and not have him and (his wife) Maria deal with that for the rest of their lives,' Rubalcava said on Wednesday. This is the second time Maricopa County prosecutors were proven wrong in a shaken baby syndrome homicide case. In 2011, the 1998 murder conviction of Armando Castillo for the death of his girlfriend's child was overturned, according to the Phoenix New Times.","Drayton Witt, 31, was charged in 2002 with murdering his son Steven .

Police investigating the disappearance of Jessica Heeringa, the Michigan woman abducted in late April during her shift at a gas station, have said that the suspicious substance found at the scene where she vanished is her blood. 'The substance has been confirmed as blood,' police said in a statement released today. 'Based on a subsequent DNA analysis, the blood has been confirmed to be from Jessica Lynn Heeringa.' Police said that there was only a small amount of blood located at the Norton Shores, Mich., Exxon gas station where Heeringa was working on a late shift. The 25-year-old mother of one was within moments of closing the station when she vanished. Police have revealed that Jessica Heeringa's blood was found at the gas station where she disappeared . Heeringa's family has been notified that her blood was found at the scene, police said. Last Tuesday police released a second video . in the hope that it will help lead to a breakthrough in the mystery of a mother . who went missing on April 26. The video, police say, more . clearly shows traffic in the area, including a silver minivan that . police have been in search of as they've continued trying to unravel . this mystery. A $15,000 reward has been pledged by Exxon Mobil to go toward a reward fund for Heeringa, who was working at an Exxon Mobil station when she disappeared. The . footage comes from a business a mile from the Exxon station, which had . no cameras, and show's the silver van passing around 11:04pm. Police believe Heeringa disappeared between 10:50 and 11:15 that night. New footage: Police say this latest video evidence released in the disappearnce case of Jessica Heeringa shows a suspect silver minivan . Clue: Christian Van Antwerpen, pictured, says he heard the van's driver flirting with Heeringa 'suspiciously' hours before she vanished April 26 . Do you know this man? Police have released this sketch, left, of a man seen driving away from the gas station in Michigan where young mother Jessica Heeringa, right, was last seen last month . Antwerpen said he did not see the man, but only heard his voice. The . tip is yet another among the hundreds police say have come in since . Heeringa vanished and will be added to the evidence . investigators have thus far been able to gather. The sketch of a wavy-haired man was released April 30, . based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from . the gas station - and police hoped it would reinvigorate . their investigation. 'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton . Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some . of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the . sketch.

Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area . around the same time that Heeringa went missing. Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence, . but hoped releasing it, too, could help unlock the . mystery. Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV: . 'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it . up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesn’t exist for me.' He . told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town & . Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's . disappearance. Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old. Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor. 'There . is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who . the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews. Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm. Vigil: A friend hugs Shelly Heeringa, Jessica's mother, during a vigil at Pointes Mall in Norton Shores . That . customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he . normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there. After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police. Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend. In the call, he tells the dispatcher: . 'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just . walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car . out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.' Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm. The missing woman's family made a . heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her . disappearance as an abduction. Plea: Shelly Heeringa attended the vigil for her daughter on Tuesday as police released the sketch . In . a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were . treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene. No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter. Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes. Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.' With no surveillance footage from the gas station, police are relying on public information for help in the investigation. 'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.' The . anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved . by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing . his mom and wants her back.' Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident. 'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.' Missed: Heeringa was allegedly abducted at about 11pm on Friday from the gas station .

A drug dealer has admitted killing a new bride and her unborn child when he smashed into her car during a high-speed police chase. Javad Malik was trying to escape police in his Renault Megane which was full of class A and B drugs when he crashed into 28-year-old Ahtia Tabisim's Ford Fiesta in Birmingham in January. Newlywed Ahtia, who was three months pregnant, suffered horrific injuries and died in hospital. The crash happened just yards from her home. Malik, 25, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, not being insured or having a licence and one count each of possessing heroin and cocaine with intent to supply at Birmingham Crown Court today. He also pleaded guilty to possessing cannabis. Judge William Davis QC warned Malik to expect a lengthy prison term. He said: 'It hardly needs me to tell you the offences you have pleaded guilty to, singularly and cumulatively, are very serious and you will be bound to be sentenced to a very significant term of imprisonment.' Mother-to-be Ahtia - known as Asha to friends and family - had wed husband Bahdar Zahman, 42, just five months before her death. Although Ahtia, who worked with disabled people in a care home, was taken to hospital following the crash, she died from multiple injuries. Speaking shortly after her death, her friends and family paid tribute to 'beautiful' Ahtia who 'spent her life caring for others.' Her sister-in-law Nahila Mahmood, 24, said: 'We are absolutely shattered by her death. 'It’s just devastated us all more than words can convey.

In the field of paid video content online, YouTube is playing catch up to services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon, all of which have millions of paying customers. Netflix shares soared in April after the runaway success of its original series House of Cards and expects similar returns from their release of new episodes of Arrested Development, a comedy that once aired on Fox.

The grandmother had been on the run for over 12 years, having been convicted in 2000 at Bristol Crown Court of possessing cocaine with intent to supply. Big Brother star Josie Gibson arrives at Bristol Crown Court for the case of her grandmother Diane Gibson, who is set to sentenced on drug charges after 12 years on the run . Diane Gibson disappeared in 2000 after she was found guilty of possessing with intent to supply 3kg of cocaine worth £240,000 . She fled after being caught with 3kg of the drug worth £240,000. Detectives feared the woman - dubbed 'Britain's most wanted grandmother' - may have changed her appearance and fled to Spain. But police finally caught up with her and she was arrested last month at the home of a relative in Yate, south Gloucestershire. Yesterday she returned to court to be sentenced. Gibson waved to family members in the public gallery, including the Big Brother star, as she was brought up from the cells. The case was adjourned at the request of Gibson’s barrister Giles Nelson for five weeks to allow medical reports to be compiled, which may affect sentencing. He told Judge Michael Longman that Gibson suffers from heart problems and is seeing specialists at hospitals in Bristol. 'The upshot is that she is using a wheelchair because of heart problems and blood pressure which has affected her mobility,' Mr Nelson said.

Unfair dismissal: Dental receptionist Rachel Carr has successfully sued her old bosses after she was threatened with the sack for eating an apple at her desk . A dental surgery receptionist has sued her former boss after she was threatened with the sack - for eating an apple at her desk. Rachel Carr, 28, was disciplined by managers at the Smile By Smile dental surgery in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, for snacking on the fruit while she worked. She claimed that she was hounded out of her job, leaving last September after her health deteriorated as a result of 'double standards' at the practice where she said that her manager would snack on chocolate nearby. She received a written warning for her eating habits and was accused of hiding in the equipment sterilisation room at the surgery and packing her bag to leave too early before the end of her shift. But Ms Carr is now likely to be paid thousands of pounds in compensation after she successfully claimed constructive and unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal in Birmingham. Rachel, who now works at another practice and represented herself in court, said: 'It was ridiculous. 'The apple was cut into slices and in a beaker and I just took a bite now and then. 'I wouldn't mind, but one of the partners used to eat Cadbury mini-eggs in reception. 'I'm just glad the system works. I represented myself, was not sure how it worked, but went in there and told the truth. 'They were gunning for me, hopefully, I've shown others they don't have to sit there and take it. They can do something about it. Miss Carr said that she rarely left on time and that the allegations that she packed her backs too early were untrue. Claim: Ms Carr sued the Smile By Smile dental clinic in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, where she had worked for five years . She says that the situation eventually forced her to quit her job when she became ill and collapsed. 'I walked out because the situation was making me feel ill and I could not take it anymore,' she said. 'I was on medication from my doctor, I was on sleeping tablets. I just collapsed in the doctors. Day job: Ms Carr, pictured in her role as a dental receptionist, has since started work at another practice . 'I don't want to bad-mouth anybody because I'm a private person and worried about my career. 'But I could not stand by and watch them get away with this. She added: 'It has made my life hell and I just want it to blow over now so I can concentrate on my new job. 'Most people would think dentists would approve of eating apples, after all as the saying goes 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away' but in my case it cost me my job.' Rachel told the tribunal that she had never received any complaints about her conduct in the five years she had worked at Smile By Smile. But she said that the situation changed when new bosses came in and brought their own rules with them. The private dental surgery claimed that they had concerns about Ms Carr's ability to 'follow procedure', and gave her a final warning for misconduct after they alleged that she was taking personal calls on her mobile and looking at Facebook during working hours as well as eating an apple. It was also claimed that Ms Carr had forgotten to turn off the X-ray machine. Smile for Smile are appealing the decision. Smile to Smile dental surgery last night said they were planning to appeal the tribunal decision. Spokesman Dr Peter Patel said: 'Smile by Smile puts patient's needs and clinical excellence at the heart of the service they provide. 'The partners have read the judgment and are taking legal advice for an appeal. 'At this stage it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the judgement and issues regarding employment and conduct of Rachel Carr at Smile by Smile in view of the fact that the case may go back to the Tribunal for an appeal.'","Rachel Carr had worked at the Smile By Smile surgery for five years .

The Lib Dem leader spent five agonising days in talks with Labour and the Tories following the 2010 election – before striking a deal to govern with David Cameron. But Lord Adonis, a former Labour minister who was present during the final days of Gordon Brown’s government, reveals Mr Clegg was willing to leave the country in limbo for far longer because that was what happened ‘in other democracies’. Tipping the balance: Nick Clegg spent five agonising days in talks with Labour and the Tories following the 2010 election ¿ before striking a deal to govern with David Cameron . In extracts from a book detailing the fraught period after the election, he tells of turmoil after Labour and the Tories failed to achieve an overall majority. This left the Lib Dems with the power to forge an alliance. Extraordinary scenes followed as Mr Brown and Mr Cameron’s teams tried to strike a deal. Mr Brown had already made Mr Clegg an offer, promising he would stand down within 18 months, Lord Adonis said. But he claims Mr Clegg kept playing for time and often failed to telephone Mr Brown at  agreed times. Claims: Lord Adonis's new book details the fraught period after the 2010 election . This is despite the fact other Lib Dem grandees, including Vince Cable and Ming Campbell, had already told senior Labour party figures the game was up and a coalition was being forged with the Tories. When Mr Clegg received a call late on May 11 from Mr Brown saying they had to make a deal immediately or he would have to resign, Mr Clegg said: ‘No Gordon. Today is Tuesday. We have only just started the talks.’ Mr Clegg revealed he was seeking to ‘push the Conservatives on Europe’, hinting he was unhappy with their insistence that Britain needed to rethink its relationship with the EU. ‘We need some sanity on Europe. We can’t seek to renegotiate,’ said Mr Clegg. When Mr Brown insisted he could not be seen ‘clinging on to power’ any longer, Mr Clegg said: ‘We have not rejected you. We are trying to play our role, to find a stable coalition. In other democracies trying to do this takes weeks. It’s quite right for us to do it methodically.’ Mr Brown gave him five more minutes to make up his mind before Mr Clegg rang back wanting more discussions, urging him ‘please, please don’t resign’. Lord Adonis said Mr Clegg’s key concern ‘remained Europe’ and he begged Mr Brown for more time, saying: ‘You are holding me hostage.’ But Mr Brown insisted: ‘I can’t delay. I’ve got to resign now. Nick I need to go to the Palace. ‘You’re a good man, Nick. I’ve got to go now.’ The Five Days in May book reveals Mr Brown was so keen to cut a deal he wanted 30 would-be Labour MPs to stand down before the election in seats Lib Dems might win. Mr Clegg allegedly kept playing for time and often failed to telephone Mr Brown at agreed times . And his account also details the surreal moment Mr Brown’s hairdresser arrived to give him his weekly trim just as the talks were collapsing. ‘It’s turning into rather a big day,’ Mr Brown told her. Lord Adonis accuses former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown of poisoning coalition talks by telling the press Mr Brown’s first phone call with Nick Clegg went badly, when he claims it was ‘workmanlike and civil’. When Lord Adonis spoke to Lord Ashdown they discussed when Mr Brown would step down, with the latter saying he had to go to avoid jibes about ‘another unelected prime minister’. But Lord Ashdown said this would not matter if it was David Miliband leading the party. He added: ‘Nor if it is his brother [Ed Miliband], though he’s the second best.’ As he was drafting the traditional note to welcome the new PM, Lord Adonis said Mr Brown called Tony Blair and said: ‘I am sorry we fell out; I know it could have been better.’","Former Labour minister Lord Adonis details the fraught period after 2010 election in new book .

Murders, backstreet abortions, suicides, and bomb blasts —Molly Lefebure, aged 20, certainly had one of the most gruesome jobs in the world. The details of her story are so strange that apparently we can't be expected to believe them all. Murder On The Home Front presented a frustratingly toned-down rewrite of a true story — how a young crime reporter ditched journalism to work alongside the pioneer of modern detective methods during the Blitz. And it turned the extraordinary history of the birth of forensics into a more conventional murder mystery. Murder On The Home Front is a new ITV1 crime drama set during the London Blitz of 1940. Pictured is Tamzin Merchant as Molly Cooper and Patrick Kennedy as Dr Lennox Collins . The real Molly Lefebure, who died in . February aged 93, spent the war working for Home Office pathologist . Professor Keith Simpson, a man so eccentric that he liked to prop up a . skeleton on a chair at the table when he had his afternoon tea. But he was a forensics genius, the . first man to identify murder victims by strands of their clothing or . their hair, and a showman, too: at one murder trial he produced the . victim's skull, the first time such evidence had been exhibited in . court. Everyone reacted with horror — except the man on trial, the . victim's husband. He was hanged. That flair and drama were missing from . the TV adaptation. The characters were interesting — they couldn't fail . to be, given the originals. But fiction fell far short of the truth. The pathologist, played by Patrick Kennedy, spent a lot of time scolding gormless policemen for trampling on the evidence. While they took notes, a constable . clattered about in the background. Simpson was aghast to discover the PC . had cleaned up the entire murder scene: washed the dishes, scrubbed . blood off the furniture and destroyed all the evidence. 'Tidied things up a bit, haven't I?' the copper said proudly. Murder On The Home Front: The characters were interesting - they couldn't fail to be, given the originals. But fiction fell far short of the truth . Star Trek: The True Story reveals in the original pilot, creator Gene Roddenberry envisaged Mr Spock with a long tail with a point at the end . The show did capture the dark humour . of the Blitz. Police photographer Issy, played by Emerald Fennell, was . deliciously sardonic: 'My mother will never be able to eat red meat . again,' she complained, as she described the aftermath of a German air . raid that left 'body parts scattered all over our azaleas'. Tamzin Merchant, best known for The . Tudors (she was wife number five), had a combination of innocence and . fire as Molly, the kind of girl who would blanche when told that a box . contained a murder victim's tongue — and then look inside anyway. But the story didn't convey how . unconventional Molly Lefebure really was. 'You could spend 100 years in . London's mortuaries,' she once remarked, 'and never be bored.' The writers have failed utterly to . capture that sense of ghoulish fascination. The most successful . franchise in TV history was nearly a failure too, as Star Trek: The True . Story revealed. In the original pilot, creator Gene Roddenberry . envisaged Mr Spock as the Devil — instead of pointed ears, he had a long . tail with a point at the end. The Starship Enterprise was boringly . called the SS Yorktown, the commander was Captain April (played by . Jeffrey Hunter) and the second-in-command was a female officer called . simply 'Number One'. Indeed it seems that Roddenberry, a . former LA cop writing TV scripts in his spare time, saw all women as . little more than numbers. When the show became a success, he boasted he . had slept with every actress in every episode except two. But it was . sheer luck that made the show a hit. Hunter pulled out and the . irrepressible William Shatner replaced him as Captain Kirk. The . storylines caught the idealistic mood of the Sixties, and were acclaimed . for showing the first 'inter-racial kiss' between Kirk and Lieutenant . Uhuru, played by black actress Nichelle Nichols. Even so, Star Trek didn't become a . global success until years after the original series had been cancelled. Fans were enthralled by the science in sci-fi, from teleport beams to . anti-matter warp drives. Leonard Nimoy, the original Spock, . offered the best comment: 'I don't like the idea of teleporting. You . might scramble some atoms. I wouldn't want to be the first to try it.' Sometimes, it seems, fiction is actually stranger than truth.","Murder On The Home Front, ITV; Star Trek: The True Story, C5 ."

Carina Trimingham leaving Southwark Crown Court today, as it emerges Chris Huhnewalk would walk free from prison next month . Chris Huhne and his former wife Vicky Pryce are due to walk free from jail within weeks after serving only two months of their eight-month sentences. The news emerged yesterday as Huhne offered to pay less than a quarter of the £108,000 that prosecutors want him to cough up towards the costs of bringing him to justice. They told a court the costs were so high because the multi-millionaire former Cabinet minister chose to run a dishonest defence. But Huhne, 58, claims he should not have to meet the full taxpayer-funded bill and his barrister said he is willing to pay only £25,000. He and 60-year-old Pryce were jailed on March 11 for perverting the course of justice after she took speeding points for him in 2003 so that he could avoid a driving ban. This was seven years before their marriage collapsed over his affair with Carina Trimingham. Sources close to the former Liberal Democrat MP expect him to be released on May 13, but they added that his freedom could be delayed because of an administrative backlog of prisoners waiting to be released.  Pryce is likely to be freed on the same day – after they have served only a quarter of their sentences. They will probably be forced to wear an electronic tag and obey a night-time curfew on their release under a scheme for non-violent prisoners. For sentences of less than a year, offenders are automatically released after serving half their sentence. In addition, offenders serving sentences of between three months and four years, with exceptions for violent and sexual offenders, may also be eligible for release on a home detention curfew. This allows offenders to be freed up to 135 days before their automatic release date. Huhne returned yesterday to Southwark Crown Court, where he was jailed, to fight an attempt by the Crown Prosecution Service to get him to pay £108,539 towards the cost of bringing him to justice. Wearing an unironed shirt and looking gaunt with unkempt hair, he  listened intently during the three-hour hearing. Huhne was watched closely by Miss Trimingham and his father, Peter. He was brought by van from Leyhill open prison in Gloucestershire. Huhne sensationally pleaded guilty on the morning of what would have been their joint trial for perverting the course of justice. Pryce, an economics professor, was . convicted after a retrial because the original jury could not reach a . verdict. She is in East Sutton Park open prison in Kent. The costs bill is high because more . than a dozen legal hearings were held before the trial as Huhne tried to . get the case thrown out. It includes the £31,000 cost of a laborious . and time-consuming police inquiry he instigated with false claims of . corruption among investigators. Disgraced: Chris Huhne, pictured in February, before he was sent to jail, has been hit with a claim for more than £100,000 costs over his attempts to get his speeding points case thrown out of court . Hell hath no fury... Huhne's ex-wife Vicky Pryce, left, faces a claim for nearly £50,000 over the case. The former cabinet minister's love Carina Trimingham, right, was in court to support him today . Prosecutor Andrew Edis, QC, attacked Huhne for failing to pay and said the scale of the costs was entirely his fault. He said the ex-politician wanted to . run a dishonest defence alleging that Pryce’s claim that he made her . take his speeding points was a ‘lie’. Mr Edis said: ‘But it was not a lie, . it was true and Mr Huhne always knew that. We do submit, as to costs, . that that is serious misconduct.’ The court heard the last-minute . inquiry by Kent Police was undertaken at Huhne’s ‘strident insistence’ amid claims he could not receive a fair trial otherwise. It included the fruitless trawl of every single phone call made out of a police station over several weeks. Mr Edis said: ‘All of this occurred . because Mr Huhne decided to do everything he could to try and get away . with what he had done. ‘He gave in only at the last minute when defeat was inevitable. That is why this bill has been incurred.’ Huhne’s barrister, John Kelsey-Fry, . QC, who commands up to £20,000 a day, accused the authorities of . ‘rewriting history’. He claimed his client’s actions had in fact helped . police get to the bottom of the case. Mr Kelsey-Fry said Huhne is prepared to pay a ‘reasonable, indeed arguably generous figure’ of £25,000. Mr Justice Sweeney will publish his ruling on costs next week.","The pair are expected to be released on electronic tag in May .

Archaeologists from Israel say they have have stumbled onto a Neolithic murder mystery after two bodies were found dumped in a well dating back 8,500 years. Researchers from the Israel Antiquities Authority unearthed the ancient well in the Jezreel Valley, south-west of Nazareth, after it was discovered by road maintenance workers. But they have no idea how the skeletal remains of a 19-year-old girl and an older man came to be dumped deep down the 26ft well, and suggest that it may be a case of murder. Murder mystery: Skull fragments from the remains of a teenage girl and an older who were found at the bottom of an 8,500-year-old well unearthed by archaeologists in Israel . 'What is clear is that after these unknown individuals fell into the well it was no longer used,' said Yotam Tepper, the archaeologist in charge of the dig. The ancient well was found by workers from the Israeli National Roads Company as they carried out preliminary work to enlarge a junction on the area's Highway 66. Researchers believe the well was sunk by ancient farmers who used its waters for livestock and crops raised on the fertile surrounding plain. 'The impressive well that was revealed was connected to an ancient farming settlement and it seems the inhabitants used it for their subsistence and living,' Dr Tepper said. 'The upper part of the well was built of stones and its lower part was hewn in the bedrock. Two capstones, which narrowed the opening, were set in place at the top of the well.' He added that the well had been measured at about 26ft deep and 4ft wide. Going down: A researcher prepares to climb down the well as it is excavated by archaeologists from the Israel Antiquities Authority. They believe it was used by ancient farmers who tended the fertile fields of the area . Relics: Aside from the skeletal remains, researchers discovered these deeply denticulated sickle blades knapped from flint which were used for harvesting, as well as arrow heads and stone implements . The mysterious remains were not the only evidence of the well's original users that the IAA team discovered. 'Numerous artefacts indicating the identity of the people who quarried it – the first farmers of the Jezreel Valley – were recovered from inside the well,' said Dr Tepper. 'The finds include, among other things, deeply denticulated sickle blades knapped from flint which were used for harvesting, as well as arrow heads and stone implements. 'The excavation of the accumulations in the well shaft yielded animal bones, organic finds and charcoal which will enable future studies about the domestication of plants and animals, and also allow researchers to determine the exact age of the well by means of advanced methods of absolute dating' He added: 'The well reflects the impressive quarrying ability of the site’s ancient inhabitants and the extensive knowledge they possessed regarding the local hydrology and geology which enabled them to quarry the limestone bedrock down to the level of the water table. 'No doubt the quarrying of the well was a community effort that lasted a long time.' Lucky find: The well was unearthed by workers from the Israel's National Roads Roads company as they carried out preliminary work to expand a junction. It will new be conserved for exhibition to the public . According to Dr. Omri Barzilai, head of the Prehistory Branch of the Israel Antiquities Authority, such finds are rare in Israel - and indeed in the prehistoric world in general. 'The two oldest wells in the world were previously exposed in Cyprus and they indicated the beginning of the domestication phenomenon,' he said. 'It seems that ancient man tried to devise ways of protecting his drinking water from potential contamination by the animals he raised, and therefore he enclosed the water in places that were not accessible to them. 'The wells had another important advantage: quarrying them provided access to an available source of water that was not dependent upon springs or streams. 'Another well, which is about 1,000 years later than those in Cyprus, was previously exposed at the Atlit Yam site in Israel, and another well from this period has now been exposed at the ‘Enot Nisanit’ site. 'The exposure of these wells makes an important contribution to the study of man’s culture and economy in a period when pottery vessels and metallic objects had still not yet been invented”. The Israel Antiquities Authority and National Roads Company will act to conserve the well and exhibit it as part of the sites around Tel Megiddo in the different periods.","The 26ft-deep well in Israel's Jezreel valley dates back 8,500 years .

A controversial late-term abortion provider has been captured on video recorded by an undercover pro-life activist comparing a fetus to 'meat in a crock pot.' The footage made public Wednesday by the anti-abortion group Live Action was secretly taped on two separate occasions by two pregnant women who came to the Nebraska clinic of Dr LeRoy Carhart in December and March pretending to seek third-trimester abortions. Carhart, one of only four physicians in the country currently performing late-term abortions, is heard on the recording laying out the gristly details of the procedure, explaining to his would-be patients that he will inject a shot into the fetus that will make it get 'soft' and 'mushy.' Scroll down for undercover video . Busted: Dr LeRoy Carhart (pictured) was recorded telling undercover anti-abortion activities posing as would-be patients that their fetuses would turn 'mushy' like 'meat in a Crock-Pot' Pro-life crusade: The videos were made as part of a national campaign targeting abortion providers like Carhart . At one point, the doctor, seated at a desk in his office, compares the unborn baby to 'meat in a Crock-Pot,' and he later jokes that he has a toolkit containing a 'pickaxe' and a 'drill bit' to remove the remnants of the dead fetus from the womb. A first portion of the video was recorded on the morning of December 7, 2012. It begins with the Live Action undercover activist entering Carhart's clinic in Bellevue, Nebraska, with a large poster hailing the doctor as a 'hero' hanging on the wall of the waiting room. The unnamed woman, who is described as being 22 weeks pregnant at the time of the sting operation, is ushered into the doctor’s office and is seated opposite him. In response to the patient's inquiry regarding the procedure, Carhart explains that the fetus in her womb would be injected with a shot through her stomach , which is supposed to kill it and induce birth. 'If everything works right, they come out-you just deliver them and they come out fine,' he says. Gristly details: Carhart explained to his 'patient' that he would inject the fetus in her womb with a shot that would kill and induce delivery three days later . 'If, for some reason, that doesn't happen, then we have to take them out in pieces.' When prompted by the undercover pro-life activist, the physician explains that the medicine injected into the unborn baby kills it and the fetus turns 'soft - like, mushy,' allowing the mother to 'push it through.' The bogus patient inquires what exactly makes the fetus soft, to which Carhart responds: 'the fact that it's not alive for 2 or 3 days.' He then adds, 'It's like putting meat in a crock pot, okay? it gets softer It doesn’t get infected...' Carhart has been in the news in recent months following the tragic death of his patient Jennifer McKenna Morbelli. Small club: Carhart is one of only four doctors currently providing late-term abortions in the US . Locations: Dr Carhart operates two clinics in Nebraska and Maryland . The 29-year-old teacher from upstate New York, traveled to Carhart's clinic in Germantown, Maryland, in February to terminate her pregnancy at 33 weeks after it became apparent that her fetus had developed abnormalities. Following a complex multi-day procedure, the 29-year-old married woman allegedly suffered a ruptured uterus and passed away from massive internal bleeding in a nearby hospital. Although the circumstances of the woman's death remain unclear, the pro-life community has rallied around the tragic case, accusing Dr Carhart of being directly responsible for Morbelli's death. Dr Carhart, 69, one of only four physicians in the country who openly perform late-term abortions, has been in the cross-hairs of pro-life groups since 2005, when another patient of his died after having her pregnancy terminated. Carhart had been practicing in Nebraska until 2010, when the state banned abortions performed after the 20th week.  After that, the doctor began traveling to the clinic in Germantown to provide his services. Pro-life activists have been picketing the clinic for the past three years, carrying signs and even trying to talk Carhart's patients out of doing the procedures on their way into the office. Tragic end: Jennifer McKenna Morbelli, pictured with her husband, TJ, passed away after getting a late-term abortion in Carhart's Maryland clinic . Under fire: Pro-life activists have been picketing the clinic for the past three years, carrying signs and even trying to talk Carhart's patients out of doing the procedures . In March 2013, just weeks after McKenna . Morbelli’s death, the pro-life Live Action group sent in another . undercover activist who was 26-weeks pregnant to inquire about . performing an elective late-term abortion, emphasizing that there is . nothing wrong with the baby. The physician once again explains on tape how the baby would get 'mushy' like 'meat in a Crock-Pot' after being injected with a shot. First public comment: Dr Carhart told an activist pretending to be a patient that Jeniffer McKenna Morbelli died from complications unrelated to her abortion . He then goes on to describe how if . the woman is unable to deliver the fetus on her own, the medical staff . will take out the baby from her womb with a 'toolkit,' adding jokingly . that his arsenal includes 'a pickaxe, a drill bit.' When the woman expresses concern that she might go into labor in her hotel room, Carhart tells her that she could call him rather than 911, and his staff would come, take away the dead fetus and help 'clean up the mess.' Towards the end of the consultation,   Carhart briefly addressed Morbelli's case, marking the first time that he has publicly commented on the woman's passing. The 69-year-old doctor tells the woman seated in his office that the 29-year-old deceased patient had a 'allergic reaction' to her pregnancy that was unrelated to the abortion procedure, adding that her fetus had severe abnormalities. According to an initial finding by the Maryland Medical Examiner's Office, McKenna Morbelli died of natural causes and suffered a rare complication during delivery. The video released Wednesday by Live Action is part of a national campaign meant to expose abortion providers as baby killers. So far, the group has made three undercover recordings targeting doctors. The organization claims the videos show that doctor are willing to kill babies in violation of the federal Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, which requires them to try and save a child born alive during a failed abortion. Live Action's edited video does not show Carhart addressing this issue, however on extended transcripts obtained by The Washington Post, the doctor says repeatedly that he would follow the law and do everything to save the baby.The 69-year-old physician also offers his patients alternatives to abortion, including adoption and foster care.","Dr LeRoy Carhart, 69, is one of only four doctors nationwide performing late-term abortions .

Fashion retailer Urban Outfitters has been criticised by drugs campaigners for selling shot glasses made to look like prescription pill medication. The chain is selling a number of products, including flasks and pint glasses, with decoration which are marked with an Rx to resemble drug labelling. One flask is marked as 'Boozemin HydroAlki' while a shot glass says 'Prescription shot - take one by mouth until intoxicated. Quantity - as many as you can stomach'. Critics say hip flasks like this one sold by Urban Outfitters are trivialising prescription drug abuse . An online petition has been launched by anti-drug group The Partnership at Drugfree.org which believes the products belittles the problem of teen abuse of prescription drugs. The campaign has been supported by political leaders in the U.S. state of Kentucky where prescription painkiller abuse is rife. Republican Hal Rogers, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, complained that the products trivialise the pain and suffering of people struggling with addiction. 'I fear the sale of these items could have the unfortunate consequence of leading more teens to seek out prescription meds, or even worse, an increase in prescription drug-related overdoses,' Rogers said in a letter to the company. Political leaders have joined a campaign calling on Urban Outfitters to withdraw the products from their shelves . 'I would encourage you to remove these items from the shelves immediately so as not to contribute to this epidemic.' Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway is also supporting the cause. 'These products make light of an . epidemic that kills more than 1,000 Kentuckians each year and is . responsible for more deaths than heroin and cocaine combined,' said . Conway, co-chairman of the Substance Abuse Committee of the National . Association of Attorneys General. 'Combined with alcohol, the misuse and . abuse of prescription medications can be deadly, making the Urban . Outfitter Rx pint and shot glasses and flasks even more disturbing.' Conway said prescription drugs are . now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, and he . said too many teens are experimenting with them, believing that they are . safer than street drugs. The Urban Outfitters' products, he . said, could reinforce that belief. 'This type of cavalier attitude puts . more teens at risk,' Conway said. Urban Outfitters has not responded to the campaign or request for comment from the MailOnline at the time of publishing.","Anti-drug group says products belittle abuse of prescription drugs .

It would not be out of place speeding around famous Formula One circuits like Silverstone or Monaco. But incredibly, this racing car is not the real thing. Rather than being built in a high-tech garage by a team of expert engineers, it was instead put together in a shed in Brighton by a complete novice. Kevin Thomas, who has no engineering experience, spent four years piecing together the BAR-Honda replica at his East Sussex home. Creative: This full-size replica BAR-Honda F1 car was hand built by Formula One fan Kevin Thomas in his shed in Brighton . Dedicated: Mr Thomas has no engineering experience and spent four years piecing together the BAR-Honda replica . A working second-hand version would have set Mr Thomas back around £100,000 - but his cost just £8,000, and hundreds of man hours. The racing enthusiast hand built his version in a specially designed shed, using parts sourced on eBay and swapped with fellow F1 memorabilia collectors. Mr Thomas, who created the replica without even using a manual or guide, said: 'A couple of years ago there was a Formula One car on display in a Renault showroom near Brighton. 'I went along to see it and thought to myself '""I would love one of these.""' Soon after his visit, a company called Memento Exclusives listed a former F1 car's chassis on eBay.When it failed to attract a single bid, Mr Thomas speculatively emailed the seller - and was delighted to learn there were two more also up for grabs. Office-worker Mr Thomas said: 'I did a deal with him there and then. A little while later, he turned up on my doorstep with a Reynard BAR-001 and BAR003 chassis. I paid him cash for the pair.' He added: 'I haven't just bought things from eBay, though. There's a whole group of memorabilia sites and dealers around the UK, but also you start to build a network of contacts and they know you are looking for a particular types of car parts. Bargain: A working second-hand version of the car would have set Mr Thomas back around £100,000 - but his cost just £8,000 and hundreds of man hours. This is the shed in which he built the car . Pride and joy: Mr Thomas built the car using parts sourced on eBay and swapped with fellow F1 memorabilia collectors . 'Then when stuff turns up, they let me know. I get one or two emails a week from people saying, ""do you need a new floor?"". Things like that. 'Also I check eBay religiously every morning. It's really immaterial what it costs as the people on there do not necessarily realise the value it has to you. They think it's just a worthless old control box from a Honda.' Delighted: F1 enthusiast Kevin Thomas poses with his full-size replica car . Despite having no formal training or knowledge of the race car construction industry, Mr Thomas set about handcrafting the replica during his spare time. He managed to track down every last detail of the car - including authentic suspension systems, wheels, tires, steering wheel and a seat. Mr Thomas added: 'I slowly started to plan out what I could do with the car, and it quickly became clear that it was very difficult, or even impossible, to get the right parts. I have to use what I can get, from whatever racing car that may be.' Now, after four years’ hard labour, . all that is left to complete the replica is an engine - which Mr Thomas . hopes to locate within the next few years. He said: 'I have got it to the point now where I can pretty much get it rolling, but you could not drive it. 'The wishbones would probably snap on the first bend. 'In the next year or two, when I can find more of the correct parts, and some spares, I will get it properly rolling.

A baby died after an ambulance driver on her first shift struggled to find the child’s home – and then took a wrong turning on the way back to hospital. Amy Carter called 999 after her three-month-old daughter Bella suffered a fit and stopped breathing. But the ambulance took nearly half an hour to reach them because the driver – who was relying on a satnav – got lost. Fearing the same thing could happen on the way to hospital, the frantic mother yelled directions from the back of the ambulance, but the driver went round a roundabout twice before taking a wrong turn. When three-month-old Bella Carter suffered a fit and stopped breathing, her mother Amy frantically dialled 999. But the ambulance crew failed to arrive for 26 minutes and she was dead upon arriving at hospital . By the time they arrived at hospital, Bella had not been breathing for nearly an hour and was pronounced dead. Last night, Miss Carter, 24, of Thetford, Norfolk, said: ‘If they had got to her in time she would be alive today.’ She said that when she called the . ambulance, she gave clear instructions that they lived in a new house, . in case that led to problems finding it. The ambulance took 26 minutes to arrive – more than three times the target response time. On their way to the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds, Miss Carter gave directions from the back of the ambulance. The ambulance driver attending to Bella - on her first-ever shift as a paramedic - then took a wrong turning on the way to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds .

Pieces of a medieval board game and 1,000-year-old combs are among rare artefacts uncovered during an archaeological dig that is set to rewrite the history books. Experts have hailed the finds in Co Fermanagh as internationally significant, claiming they shed new light on life in medieval Ireland and its connection with the wider world. Iron, bronze and bone ornaments have been discovered at the crannog just outside Enniskillen, along with the chess-like pieces believed to have been part of the game. Parts of log boats, leather shoes, knives, decorated dress pins, wooden vessels and a bowl with a cross carved on its base have also been unearthed during the six-month dig. Find: This pair of iron shears was among the items uncovered during an archaeological dig just outside Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh . Relic: Weapons, such as this iron spearhead, were also found, giving an idea as to how they lived at the time . The style and design of the antler and bone combs suggest influences from northern Europe and indicate that the Fermanagh settlement had international links 1,000 years ago. The Drumclay Crannog, which is an artificial island built in a lake, is the first of its type to be excavated in the north of Ireland since 1870. Archaeologists believe people may have lived there from 600 AD to 1600 AD, and it was probably the home of a noble family, with perhaps four or five houses inhabited at any time. Parents, grandparents, children and servants would all have stayed on the crannog. The artefacts uncovered so far date back to 900 AD but there are still a number of layers of settlement yet to be excavated. Stormont Environment Minister Alex Attwood visited the site today and announced plans for an open day this Saturday to allow the public to tour the crannog and talk to the archaeologists. 'On my two visits to date, I have found the site, the dig, and the archaeology beyond my imagination, enormously exciting and changing my view of our history and Irish life,' he said. Site: The archaeologists also uncovered the sub-floor of a circular house . 'This is the first substantial scientific excavation of a crannog in Northern Ireland. What has been found has the potential not only to be internationally important but ultimately to lead to a reassessment of life in Ulster in early Christian and medieval times.' The site was excavated during the construction of a new road on the outskirts of Enniskillen.Mr Attwood placed a temporary exclusion zone on the area to facilitate the dig, which is due to finish at the end of December. Dr John O'Keeffe, principal inspector of historical monuments with the Department of the Environment, explained that the site is right in the middle of the proposed route of the Cherrymount Link Road. He said all the remains from the dig site would have been removed before construction work advanced. 'By the time the archaeological work is finished the site will not be here anymore,' he said.Dr O'Keeffe said scientific advances made in the 140 years since the last time a crannog was excavated in the north had facilitated a greater understanding of life in such a settlement. 'It has enabled us to find out much more about diet, economy, agriculture and social structures here,' he said. The expert said many of the finds had been unexpected and were similar to those unearthed at Viking sites in Dublin and York. fine-tooth comb: The objects found indicate that people were very sophisticated in their tastes, say experts . This bronze pin was one of the finds hailed as internationally significant, claiming they shed new light on life in medieval Ireland and its connection with the wider world . Some of the wooden artefacts have survived 1,000 years or more as a result of being submerged in water. The settlement at the crannog has provided new evidence of living conditions in medieval Ireland. It shows people lived in houses that would have been little bigger than a large modern living room, cooking and sleeping in the same space. The walls were insulated with heather and other plants. The objects found indicate that people were very sophisticated in their tastes, living as farming families, butchering their own animals and ploughing the land for crops. They were very skilled at metalworking and woodworking, excelling at carpentry to construct the houses and crafting and decorating wooden containers of all sizes. They played board games probably around the fire on cold evenings. They wove their own cloth, having spun the wool from their own sheep. 'Archaeology is a fragile and finite resource,' said Mr Attwood. The finds were made in a dig near Enniskillen in Northern Ireland . 'Once sites such as this have disappeared, we can never get them back again. Such sites have the ability to teach us a great deal and we owe it to future generations to rescue and to safeguard what we can. 'It will further enrich the fascinating fabric of our history and I am sure bring even more tourists to our shores. Anyone who visits on Saturday will simply have an unprecedented opportunity to see how our forefathers lived and to see history revealed before our very eyes.' The minister added: 'This is why I felt the need to open this spectacular excavation to the public. 'The Northern Ireland Environment Agency and Fermanagh District Council have been working in partnership to hold this open day between 9.30am and 3pm this Saturday and allow the public this unique opportunity to see the artefacts found, look down on the site of the dig and meet the experts behind this archaeological dig. It is an opportunity not to be missed and one likely not to be experienced in our lifetime again.' The Drumclay Crannog open day will comprise a series of talks that will take place at the Fermanagh County Museum, followed by a guided tour of the archaeological site. Access to the site for this tour can only be obtained via an official coach.","Experts say it sheds new light on life in medieval Ireland and its connection with the wider world .

Two new studies have added to the body of evidence that daylight plays an important role in preventing the condition. It is not known why daylight is important but some experts believe levels of the brain chemical  dopamine play a role. High levels of dopamine in the eyeball have been associated with a lower risk of short-sightedness. Until recently it was thought that short-sightedness was inherited, but scientists are discovering that other factors, such as sunlight exposure, play a role . Short-sightedness, or myopia, is an eye . condition that causes a person to see things clearly close-up but . struggle to see things when they are far away. In . childhood it is correctable, but it is also linked to the development . of severe forms of the eye disorder in adulthood, which increases the . risks for potentially blinding diseases such as glaucoma and retinal . detachment. Research on short-sightedness is intensifying as the condition nears epidemic status in Asia and other regions, primarily in developed countries. Shockingly, it has increased by more than 65 per cent since 1970 in the U.S.. Although it often inherited, researchers are now assessing environmental factors to help explain why rates are rising so rapidly in some populations. The Taiwanese study observed 333 students who spent their break between lessons in the playground. These children, many of whom had formerly spent recess indoors, now spent a total of 80 minutes per day outdoors. Taiwanese scientists are suggesting enforced outdoor playtimes would help stem the growing number of children who suffer with shortsightedness. The condition has rocketed by nearly 65% since 1970 in the U.S. A nearby school acted as the control group because children were not forced to spend their break outdoors. Students at both schools received eye examinations at the study outset and one year later. The results showed that significantly fewer children became short-sighted or shifted toward short-sightedness in the school that required outdoor breaks, compared with the control school. The researchers recommended that primary . schools should add frequent breaks and other . outdoor activities to their daily schedules to help protect children's . eye development and vision. ‘Because children spend a lot of time in school, a school-based intervention [such as an outdoors break] is a direct and practical way to tackle the increasing prevalence of myopia,’ said the leader of the study, Pei-Chang Wu, of Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. A separate study on the impact of daylight exposure on eye development analysed data collected in a 2005 clinical trial that included 235 Danish school children with short-sightedness. Of the children who played outside, significantly fewer became short-sighted or shifted toward short-sightedness, compared with the control school . Participants were divided into seven groups, each of which represented a different time of year. Because daylight hours fluctuate dramatically with the seasons in Denmark - from seven hours in winter to nearly 18 in summer - access to daylight was distinct for each group. Axial eye length – the distance from the front to the back of the eye – and vision were tested in each group of children at the beginning and end of their seasonal interval. Axial length is an important measurement because elongation of the eye shows that myopia is worsening. In the children with access to the fewest hours of daylight, eye growth averaged 0.19 mm; in those with access to the most daylight, eye growth was just 0.12 mm. ‘Our results indicate that exposure to daylight helps protect children from myopia,’ said the leader of the study, Dongmei Cui of Sun Yat-sen University, China. ‘Parents should encourage [children] to spend time outdoors daily. ‘When that's impractical due to weather or other factors, use of daylight-spectrum indoor lights should be considered as a way to minimize myopia.’ Both studies were published in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology.","Short-sightedness has increased by over 65 percent since 1970 in the U.S.

A council in the eastern Indian state of Bihar has banned the use of mobile phones by women, saying the phones were 'debasing the social atmosphere'. Councillors claimed the use of phones encouraged women to elope. Single women are fined £130 if they are caught using a phone, married women around £20. Ban: A council in the eastern Indian state of Bihar has banned the use of mobile phones by women, saying the phones were 'debasing the social atmosphere' The ban has been put in place by Sunderbari council which is in a Muslim-dominated area in the north east of India. 'It always gives us a lot of embarrassment when someone asks who has eloped this time,'  said Manuwar Alam, who heads a newly-formed committee tasked with enforcing the ban. Temptation: Councillors claimed the use of phones encouraged women to elope . He said the number of elopements and extramarital love affairs had risen in the past few months, with at least six girls and women fleeing their homes. 'Even married women were deserting their husbands to elope with lovers. That was shameful for us,' Alam said. 'So, we decided to tackle it firmly. Mobile phones are debasing the social atmosphere.’ Local officials have begun investigations, saying that such bans cannot be allowed in a healthy society, while women’s rights activists called it an assault on freedom that could potentially end up harming women by stripping them of one source of protection from trouble, such as unwanted advances by men.

A young man’s life has been saved by a new drug after he was struck down by the blood cancer Hodgkin's lymphoma for the second time. Student Martin Solomon, 20, desperately needed a life-saving bone marrow transplant and was told he had just weeks to live unless a donor was found. His heartbroken family searched the world for a match without success because of his mixed Irish and Afro-Caribbean heritage. Student, Martin Solomon, 20, desperately needed a life-saving bone marrow transplant because he had blood cancer. He was told he had just weeks to live unless a donor was found . Manchester United footballer Rio Ferdinand even asked his Twitter followers to join the bone marrow donor register to see if they could save his life. Time was running out for the Manchester University student and a donor had not been found so he was approved for a new treatment which has only recently become available in the UK. He has amazed doctors at Manchester’s Christie Hospital by beating the disease in just a few months thanks to the Brentuximab Vedotin. It meant Mr Solomon’s own white blood cells - which were harvested then put back in his body - were able to beat the cancer. Martin is now in remission, and doctors have told him that he could be well enough to return to university in September. His family, from Sale Moor, Manchester, started the Match4Martin campaign last year, when it was believed a bone marrow transplant was his only chance of survival. Mr Solomon is now recovering after being treated with a new drug. He is pictured (centre) with L to R: His sister Serena, 29, father Martin, 49, mother Paula, 48, and sister Zea, 23 . His parents have vowed to continue the campaign to find a donor just in case Martin’s cancer ever returns. His mother, Paula, said: ‘Compared to how things were at the end of last year, we have gone from the depths of despair to complete euphoria that Martin is still with us. We just thank God for cancer research and drug trials.’ Mr Solomon said: ‘I can’t wait to get back to normal - I’m just so relieved. ‘We’ll continue searching for a bone marrow donor for me but I am hoping to go to Croatia for a holiday with all my friends this summer and I’d like to go back to university as well.’ His father, Martin Senior, added: ‘We’ll be taking each day as it comes but plan to throw him a massive barbecue party for his 21st in July.’ Stephen Cannon, honorary consultant at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital and specialist in orthopaedic oncology, said it is too early to call the new medication a 'wonder drug', but that results are promising. He said: 'It's early days - the drug has only been about for a year and a half -  and I don't have any personal experience of it. 'But results have been positive. More research needs to be done to check that there aren't any serious side-effects, but so far it looks promising.'","Martin Solomon had weeks to live unless a bone marrow donor was found .

The freezing method- hypothermia treatment- is proven to stop babies' brains from swelling. Doctors do not yet know why the change in temperature can have such an effect. Fighting for survival: Lily Cracknell, just days old, wrapped in the cooling bag that saved her life. Her temperature dropped from 37C to 35.5C .

She said: ‘She didn’t make a sound when she came out, and I was panicking that I hadn’t heard her cry at all. 'She . was rushed to intensive care. I couldn’t believe that it had taken such a long time to get her breathing again. It was terrifying news.’ Miss Hasler had an induced labour at 36 weeks after doctors at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow diagnosed her with pre-eclampsia. The life-threatening disease causes seizures during pregnancy and can cause the baby's heartbeat to become irregular. She said: . ‘It was frightening to be told that I had such a condition. 'I knew . that she was in danger, as she was hardly moving in my womb at all. ‘Doctors told me that it was best for myself and the baby if they induced labour straight away.’ The 5lb 13oz baby was transferred to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge for the specialist treatment. She was not allowed to be touched or held in the first few days of her life. New mother Miss Hasler said: ‘A . few days after the treatment, we were allowed to hold her for the first . time, which was so wonderful. 'I’d been terrified that I was never going . to hold her properly and be a mum.’ Specialist care: Lily Cracknell was frozen after birth when she didn't breathe for half an hour. After three days in the cooling bag, doctors warmed baby Lily up and she started to recover . Lucky to be alive: Rebecca Hasler, 23, said: 'Thanks to her cool bag, she is a normal happy little girl.

But after just two weeks, she was strong enough to be sent home with her parents . Miss Hasler said her daughter, was sent home from hospital after two weeks and made a full recovery. Now, at three years old, Lily is a happy, thriving little girl. ‘Freezing her like this has saved her life, and also saved her from brain damage,’ said Miss Hasler, who lives with partner Nathan Cracknell, 22. Miss Hasler gave birth to the couple’s second daughter Rosie in June last year, said: ‘We are so proud of her. She may be tiny, but she is such a fighter.

A nine-year-old boy born with a rare syndrome that gives him obsessive tendencies has become devoted to a collection of Henry vacuum cleaners. Lane Fountain has Williams Syndrome, a condition which causes him to have a very sociable and trusting nature, and which means he is acutely sensitive to the needs of others. It has also led to him developing an obsession with vacuum cleaners. Lane Fountain, nine, has Williams syndrome which has caused him to develop an obsession with vacuum cleaners . Williams syndrome is a genetic condition that is present from birth. People with the condition tend to have elfin features. It is characterised by medical problems including cardiovascular diease, development delays and learning disabilities. These symptoms occur alongside impressive verbal abilities, highly sociable personalities and an affinity for music. Other common features include feeding problems, dental abnormalities, kidney abnormalities, hernias and attention deficit disorder. It affects one in every 10,000 people and occurs equally often in men and women. Lane currently has a collection of 17 hoovers and is constantly offering to clean his parent's home. His favourite activity is visiting vacuum shops – he will happily play with them all day. Lane’s father, Mark Fountain, 34, said:  ‘People with Williams Syndrome tend to obsess about things and in Lane's case, it is hoovers. He's adored them from a young age. ‘When we go shopping for the day his little reward for being good will be going into a shop where he can play with the hoovers for 15 minutes. ‘It's like watching an old man looking at a classic car. He studies every little detail, he knows all the different models, makes and product numbers. ‘His room is full of hoovers and he's got more in the garden. I think there's more to come because he's gravitating toward carpet washers. Lane currently has a collection of 17 hoovers and is constantly offering to clean his parent's home . His favourite activity is visiting vacuum cleaner shops and he will happily play with them all day . ‘The funny thing is he's not actually much good at hoovering. He tends to do the same spot over and over again and gets distracted by looking at himself in the mirror.’ Lane, from Rayleigh in Essex, added: ‘I love cleaning and I do it every day. I love most hoovers and carpet cleaners - especially Henry, he's my favourite.’ Williams Syndrome is a genetic condition that is present at birth and can affect anyone. It is characterised by medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning disabilities. Lane's parents say that he is now gravitating towards carpet cleaners and that they believe this will be his next obsession . Lane's father Mark Fountain (pictured) said: 'The funny thing is he's not actually much good at hoovering. He tends to do the same spot over and over again' These occur side by side with striking verbal abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity for music. It affects 1 in 10,000 people worldwide and is known to occur equally in both males and females and in every culture. Lane, who lives with Mr Fountain, his mother Danny Wolstenholme, 40, and his seven-year-old sister, Lacey, requires constant care as a result of his condition. Mr Fountain, a professional photographer, said: ‘As obsessions go, hoovering is obviously quite a good one to have and at least he's keeping out of mischief. ‘But there is a serious side to Lane's condition. Youngsters with Williams Syndrome don't have a bad bone in their body. ‘Their sole purpose it to make people happy so he's always the centre of attention making people smile and laugh. Lane was born with Williams syndrome which is a genetic condition that affects 1 in 10,000 people . He has been collecting vacuum cleaners throughout his childhood . ‘But at the same time there is no awareness whatsoever of strangers or danger. Everybody is their friend and they cannot see the bad in people. ‘Obviously there are people out there who will take advantage of the over-friendliness - and as a parent that's our biggest worry. ‘But we wouldn't have Lane any other way. He loves everyone, regardless of race, creed or colour and that makes him totally unique.’ Lane recently appeared on Channel 4 show, The Hotel, where a cleaner from the Grosvenor Hotel in Torquay, Devon, taught him how to hoover a room. As a special treat staff invited him back over the weekend to help them choose from a range of new hoovers. Sandra Morris, head of housekeeping, said: ‘We chose Lane to test the models as there's no better man for the job.’","Lane Fountain has a rare developmental disorder called Williams Syndrome .

Opera singer Katherine Jenkins ran the London Marathon on Sunday wearing light make-up, while Fern Britton tweeted photographs of herself bare-faced before and after a spin-class. But it seems the majority of women in Britain lean more towards Katherine's way of thinking than Fern's. Some two-thirds of women admit wearing beauty cosmetics in the gym, despite recent findings that you burn fewer calories during a work-out if you do. Opera singer Katherine Jenkins, left, ran the Virgin London Marathon wearing a light make-up and diamond earrings, while Fern Britton, right, tweeted a photo of herself without make-up after a spin class . While Fern appeared hot, sweaty and completely au naturel, the majority of British women would not  do the same, instead copying Katherine, who ran the marathon (and raised an impressive £25,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support) in light make-up. Despite recent findings that women work out less effectively if wearing make-up in the gym, almost two thirds of women said they would wear some form of make-up when exercising: 55 per cent said they would at least wear light make-up, and a further 11 per cent said they would almost always wear full make-up. A fifth of women (20 per cent) would wear full face make-up for a marathon or public fun-run, and well over half (62 per cent) would at least wear a light dusting of mascara and lipstick . Fewer than one in five women (18 per cent) would go bare-faced on a public fun-run, and 44 per cent said they would apply some form of beauty products for just a quiet jog around their local park. More women would copy Katherine Jenkins, left, and work out wearing at least light make-up, than Fern Britton, right, who did a spin class au naturel . Beauty expert Emma Leslie from Escentual.com, the online beauty retailer who commissioned the survey, said: 'British women always want to look their best in public, and the gym is one of the big social meeting places for people these days. Former TOWIE star Amy Childs also ran the marathon wearing make-up . 'Also, there have been several . innovations with waterproof make-up recently, products that breathe with . your skin when you work-out and will stay absolutely perfect even when . you are pushing yourself hard physically, so it's much easier to look . good working out.

'And if you are trying to tone up bits of your body about which you might feel a bit self-conscious, you don't want to add to that by not feeling the best about your face.' The research found that the gym wasn't the only place that British women were likely to wear make-up. The majority would wear full make-up for a trip to the shops (67 per cent), and 30 per cent would wear light make-up. Only three per cent wouldn't wear any at all. When doing the school run, over half of mothers wear full make-up on most occasions (52 per cent), 40 per cent wear at least light make-up, and only eight per cent wouldn't wear any. Understandably, a job interview yielded the most affirmative responses: 99 per cent of women would wear some form of make-up, and over three quarters of them (76 per cent) full make-up.","Singer Katherine Jenkins ran Virgin London Marathon looking glamorous .

Nataliya Robinson, of Nataliya Robinson Skin Clinic, said: 'Yes, coffee can help to break down cellulite. 'Natural materials such as caffeine have firm scientific basis for use in cellulite treatments (topically only), as it can actually stimulate lipolytic activity (fat breakdown). 'Coffee contains xanthines (found in most human body tissues) which increases lipolytic activity. 'The key to using coffee products on cellulite areas is to use it during the time when you are not eating, such as early morning or hour before bedtime, when insulin levels are not active.

In the same week that Condé Nast have launched a magazine targeting teenagers,  British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman has revealed she is making a film for schools which highlights 'the difference between fashion and reality and how a fashion image is constructed.' The 55-year-old said the aim of the documentary, which goes behind the scenes of a fashion shoot, is to help give today's youngsters a more positive outlook on their body image. It will show the secondary school pupils how models only achieve a flawless look with the help of make-up, lighting and airbrushing. Fakery exposed: Alexandra Shulman said a film behind the scenes on a photo shoot will show teenagers the difference between fashion and reality . 'I'm hoping that it will be fun for the pupils but, actually, it will make some serious points,' Alexandra told the Independent on Sunday. Vulnerable target market: Miss Vogue is aimed at teenagers . She admitted that the art of Photoshopping was only a 'tiny part' of the trickery used to make models look younger and slimmer. 'It's basically a huge team of people that go in to create the image, of which retouching is the icing on the cake. You can do far more with lighting and make-up,' she said. The film is currently being edited and it is hoped it will be distributed over the summer so schools can show it from their Autumn terms onwards. It seems the film is well-timed given that Condé Nast this week published the first edition of Miss Vogue, a sister edition to their glossy aimed at 17-year-olds. Daily Mail columnist Liz Jones expressed concern in today's paper that the teen mag could 'brainwash' young girls who are 'vulnerable and easily led' into chasing unrealistic ideals on how they should look. She said: 'I fell in love with Vogue in 1975, when I was 17. In some ways it improved my life - it made me dream beyond the dull shores of Essex. Yet it also almost destroyed it - because as an unattractive, acne-riddled provincial lump, I wanted the bodies and lives of the women on its pages. 'But being naive, airbrushing simply never occurred to me. I had no idea it was all artifice, a fantasy world. I thought I had to live out its pages.' Power of airbrushing: Twiggy's wrinkles are reduced and her skin looks more radiant in this Olay advert, right . Boost: Keira Knightley complained about the way her breasts were airbrushed to look bigger in the film poster for King Arthur, right . Advertisers have been rapped in the . past for over airbrushing - thereby giving consumers a false impression . of how effective their product is. For example, Olay were once said to . have breached advertising standards by airbrushing out too many of . Twiggy's wrinkles. Meanwhile Keira Knightley has complained about the way her small breasts are often airbrushed on film posters and in magazines. 'They . always pencil in my boobs. I was only angry when they were really . droopy,' she said in an interview with Allure referring to a King Arthur . poster where her breasts were enlarged. LIGHTING: Bright studio lights are a must on shoots along with studio umbrellas. These illuminate the models and reduce darkness and shadows so they look more radiant. The angle and position of the lights along with backlights and reflectors all help flatter the subject. POSE: Models can drop pounds just by the way they stand. Good posture and positioning all make a difference. Standing slightly side on, one leg in front of the other can make the figure look more elongated. A hand on the hip and a head tilted to the side is also used for a more flattering look. MAKE-UP: Professional make-up artists can take years off models with the right products and application. Concealers, foundations and powders are all combined to hide lines, bags under the eyes and blemishes. Illuminating concealers under the eyes can make them seem brighter while the way it's applied around the nose can make it appear smaller. AIRBRUSHING: Retouching an image is the 'icing on the cake' according to Alexandra Shulman. Any blemishes or lines that haven't been hidden by the previous tricks can be removed. The body shape of the model can also be completely changed by slimming down their legs, arms and waist in seconds. However, the process has also led to some noticeable mistakes such as models appearing with missing fingers or implausibly skinny legs.","Alexandra Shulman making a film for schools .

From rose-print oven gloves to strawberry-covered ironing boards, her hugely successful designs evoke a bygone age of traditional domesticity. But it seems that is not a time Cath Kidston herself is keen to return to. The businesswoman says she has never wanted to be ‘that housewife’ who gets ‘supper ready in the evening’. Despite making millions from products associated with old-fashioned homemaking, the designer insists she does not ‘aspire to that existence’ and believes ‘it’s nice to have one’s own life and support oneself’. Lifestyle choice: Despite making millions from products associated with old-fashioned homemaking, designer Cath Kidston believes 'it's nice to have one's own life and support oneself' Many of Miss Kidston’s highly popular products evoke a 1950s idyll of domestic life, when a woman stayed at home to cook, clean and care for her husband. So sought-after are her colourful sewing-kits, watering cans, tea cosies, baking trays and tablecloths that the business is now worth £89million. Yet the 54-year-old, who married long-term partner Hugh Padgham last year and has one step-daughter, says she has no desire to be a woman who is financially supported by her husband and left free to spend her time baking. She said: ‘My mother didn’t work. My father even paid the housekeeping bills, so she was entirely dependent. 'Then she was widowed when she was quite young, and I think it was seeing her so vulnerable that gave me the motivation to do this.’ And while plenty of shoppers have Miss Kidston’s products in pride of place in their homes, she is not keen to do the same herself – because she ‘doesn’t like fussy things’. She said her taste is ‘all quite clean’, adding: ‘People come to my house in Chiswick and say, “Oh, you haven’t got much Cath Kidston!” ’ She said she did keep her own range of mugs and tablecloths at home, but that they were stored in cupboards and not on display in her white Skandium kitchen. Garden furniture: So sought-after are her colourful sewing-kits, watering cans, tea cosies, baking trays and tablecloths that the business is now worth £89million . When asked what decorative item she would not tolerate in her house, she said: ‘I would never have pebbles in a bowl. I just don’t see the point of that.’ Miss Kidston is understood to be worth £25million after selling most of her stake in her home furnishing company in 2010. The designer, who suffered from breast . cancer in her 30s, was inspired by her aunt, Belinda Bellville, a . founder of the fashion house Bellville Sassoon, who suggested she go . into interiors. 'My mother didn’t work. My father even paid the housekeeping bills, so she was entirely dependent. Then she was widowed when she was quite young, and I think it was seeing her so vulnerable that gave me the motivation to do this' Cath Kidston . She moved to London from Hampshire aged 18, initially working as a shop assistant before landing a job with designer Nicky Haslam and then setting up an interiors business with a friend. In 1993, she invested £15,000 in savings to open her first store in Holland Park, West London, following a ‘career crisis’. The shop sold hand-embroidered tea towels and brightly renovated furniture. But Miss Kidston, a cousin of property programme presenter Kirstie Allsopp, initially struggled in business. ‘The whole vintage thing didn’t kick off until the late 1990s,’ she recalled in 2008. ‘I remember feeling quite broke and making cushions myself to sell in the shop, and the embarrassment of a woman coming up to the counter and saying, “Excuse me, but this is really badly made – could I get  a discount?” ’ Her company has since grown to 113 stores across the world, including three in Japan which have proved extremely popular. The chain sells everything from scarves to iPad cases. In 2010 she sold a majority share to private equity company TA Associates. She retained a minority stake and is still creative director.","Kidston says she's never wanted to be 'housewife' who gets 'supper ready'

"By . Ryan Kisiel . PUBLISHED: . 05:57 EST, 3 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:09 EST, 4 April 2013 . A 'smitten' young man was knifed to death by his first proper girlfriend, a 31-year-old mother of two, a murder trial jury was told. Michelle Mills stabbed 20-year-old Edward Miller 24 times with such ferocity that the blade of the knife broke off. The blows to his chest, abdomen and back left him bleeding to death in their rented cottage in the picturesque Leicestershire village of Scalford. Michelle Mills allegedly stabbed Edward Miller to death after she had texted a former boyfriend saying she wished she had 'never let them go' The couple, who met when Mr Miller was 18, had a stormy  relationship, Lincoln Crown Court was told. They were seen acting ‘lovey dovey’ during a Bonfire Night party at the 18th century King’s Arms pub where Mills worked part-time. But hours later, when both were drunk, they argued and Mills texted Trevor Stuckey, the father of her elder child, saying: ‘I still love you and always have. I’m sorry xx.’ In a second text she wrote: ‘I wish I’d never let you go xx.’ Moments later she took a kitchen knife and repeatedly stabbed Mr Miller. She dialled 999 but paramedics could not save him. Mills allegedly told police: ‘I grabbed the knife and I went mental. I don’t know how many times I stabbed him.’ She denies murder on November 6 last year. The jury heard that Mr Miller met Mills in 2010, when she was 29. He was living with his mother and soon afterwards got his first job, at nearby Scalford Hall hotel. The couple had been seen acting affectionately towards each other at the King's Arms before the alleged murder . From January 2012 they lived together at his mother’s home before renting a cottage in Scalford. They moved in just two months before his death. Yvonne Coen QC, prosecuting, said that while it seemed to observers that the couple were ‘completely smitten with each other’, there were problems with the  relationship and they had split up on at least one occasion. The jury heard that the argument on Bonfire Night ended in the stabbing. Miss Coen said: ‘There is no dispute that Miss Mills stabbed Eddie Miller and that she caused his death. She accepts she is guilty of causing his death. ‘The prosecution suggests that in drink she became aggressive and lost her temper. ‘She was apparently thinking fondly of her ex during the row and texted him in affectionate terms. ‘After Eddie, by her account, had grabbed her and pushed her on the sofa she got away from him. It could have stopped. All he wanted, it seems, was to sit having a drink. ‘She wasn’t going to let him ignore her so she took it to the next level by taking a knife to him repeatedly, perhaps to punish this young man for what may have happened between them before, but clearly to hurt him very severely, and during the course of it she actually broke the knife. ‘If that is right this is a plain case of murder.’ The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Michelle Mills 'launched attack on Edward Miller after she texted former lover'

Sainsbury's is giving away 20million vouchers a month in a bid to overtake Asda as the UK¿s second biggest supermarket . They've wooed us with buy one get one free offers, value ranges and loyalty card reward points. Now supermarkets are tapping into the growing trend among families for using coupons at the tills to get us through the doors – and beat rival chains in the supermarket wars. Sainsbury’s is giving away 20million vouchers a month in a bid to overtake Asda as the UK’s second biggest supermarket. The aggressive voucher strategy has helped the group to increase its sales faster than its biggest rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons. Yesterday Sainsbury’s reported an impressive annual sales increase of 4.6 per cent to £25.6billion, while underlying profits to the end of March were up 6.2 per cent to £756million. Research by the supermarket found 93 per cent of us use coupons to save money on grocery shopping, while 30 per cent have increased our coupon usage in the last year. It also discovered families living in the well-heeled counties of Sussex, Kent and Warwickshire are most likely to redeem vouchers, showing  how popular the couponing trend has become among middle-income families living through the biggest squeeze on living standards since the Second World War. Under its Brand Match coupon scheme, Sainsbury’s has issued 350million vouchers since 2011 to customers spending over £20, regardless of whether they have a Nectar loyalty card. The scheme works by calculating whether a customer has bought any big brand products, such as Kellogg’s or Heinz, which are cheaper at rivals Tesco or Asda. If the customer could have saved money by going elsewhere then the till prints out a paper coupon worth the difference. Sainsbury’s is now issuing around 20million of the coupons a month. Yesterday Sainsbury's reported an impressive annual sales increase of 4.6 per cent to £25.6billion . The aggressive voucher strategy has helped the group to increase its sales faster than its biggest rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons . The Brand Match scheme has been such a success that Tesco launched its own version with added benefits in March. Its Price Promise promotion reimburses customers at the till if their shopping would have been cheaper at Sainsbury’s, Asda or Morrisons. Crucially, it goes further than Sainsbury’s to include a comparison of own-brand products.The level of competition shows how much is at stake for the supermarkets. Sainsbury’s was overtaken by Asda at the UK’s second biggest supermarket in 2008. However, it has achieved an annual growth in sales for 33 quarters in a row and is closing in on its nearest rival with market share of 16.8 per cent versus 17.5 per cent for Asda. The Sainsbury’s results were boosted by non-food sales, such as its Tu fashion range, electrical goods and furniture, which reached £1billion for the first time. Grocery sales online were close to £1billion, while Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores took £1.5billion. The Brand Match scheme has been such a success that Tesco launched its own version with added benefits in March . Chief executive Justin King said: ‘Whilst we see no near-term change in the current economic situation, we remain confident that by continuing to invest in our long-standing strategy and by understanding and helping our customers, we are well positioned for future growth.’ On Saturday, the Daily Mail highlighted the case of 16-year-old Jordon Cox who has taken collecting coupons to extraordinary lengths. He bought £105.88 of goods, such as big brand breakfast cereals, cheese and drinks, but handed over just £1.62 at the till thanks to his coupon collection. Meanwhile research from the Institute of Grocery Distribution suggests many household are changing the family diet based on vouchers. Some 62 per cent of wealthier families changed the food they bought to take advantage of vouchers and promotions.","Sainsbury’s giving away 20million vouchers a month .

Joan Bakewell has called for a ‘proper debate’ on euthanasia, revealing she carries a Do Not Resuscitate card. The 79-year-old TV presenter said ministers needed to listen to ‘what people want’. She suggested doctors should stop keeping terminally ill people ‘full of tubes’ alive if that is not what the patient wants. Controversial comments: Joan Bakewell has waded in on the euthanasia debate . Outspoken views: Veteran broadcaster Baroness Joan Bakewell has many forthright opinions on growing old, feminism and party politics . The controversial comments come after Baroness Bakewell broke her foot in a fall and was forced to spend some time in a wheelchair. She said: ‘We have to address this whole business of dying. We need to hear the whole debate about what people want, so that people aren’t simply filled full of tubes to keep their body going, if they don’t want to be. 'I want to see it properly debated. I think the public want change. I think people would be pleased to have the choice, to decide over their own lives.’ Baroness Bakewell, who spent 18 months as the previous government’s Voice of Older People, also said too many older people were ‘living in misery’. During her campaign to improve social care to help the 1.7million elderly people living in poverty, she angered some Christian groups by voicing her support for assisted dying. In an interview, she said her DNR card instructs paramedics not to keep her artificially alive should she be involved in an accident or fall seriously ill. She revealed she also has a living will, in the possession of her solicitor and her family, giving clear instructions to ‘pull the plug’ in case of a calamity. Her comments come just a week after she became embroiled in a row with Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry over feminism. Dismissing feminism as a ‘dirty word’, Miss Berry had insisted she did not want women’s rights and said she loves it when men offer to carry her coat. Baroness Bakewell hit back by labelling Miss . Berry’s world view as ‘stable and unchanging’ in comparison to her own ‘whizzy’ life. On Saturday, the Labour peeress claimed she had not meant to attack Miss Berry after all – and had left a message for her to explain. 'Whizzy': Joan Bakewell, pictured in the sixties, said that she has lived a 'rackety' and exciting life over the years . Baroness Bakewell also talked of her next project, co-presenting a talent contest looking for the country’s best portrait painter, with Booker Prize winner Hilary Mantel as the sitter. She said she disagreed with the reaction to Mantel’s article on the Duchess of Cambridge – claiming it had actually been ‘sympathetic to royal women’ – but she added that she would like to hear more of Kate Middleton’s opinions. She told The Times: ‘I do think it would be quite interesting to know what she thinks about things.

Scientists are fighting to stop a poisonous caterpillar from threatening to kill off  thousands of oak trees. Efforts to cull the oak processionary moth, which can be toxic to humans, have failed, leaving experts mounting a rearguard action to stop it spreading. Larvae have been destroying trees around London for the past month after the insect came into the country on infested trees imported from Europe. Its caterpillars strip leaves from the . trees they occupy with their nests, often in such large numbers that . the oak is fatally weakened. Trees . are left covered in toxic hairs, which can burn the eyes and skin of . anyone touching them. In severe cases, victims can suffer anaphylactic . shock. Yesterday scientists . admitted that they are unlikely to be able to eradicate the moth. Instead, the best they can hope for is to ‘slow its spread’ by . containing it in the areas already infected. Larvae . have hatched across the capital in the last few weeks from Richmond . Common and Kew in the west to  Croydon and Bromley in the south. But, in a worrying indicator that the infestation is more widespread, an outbreak has also been found in Pangbourne, Berkshire. Oaks are the moth’s favoured habitat . but it can also eat hazel, hornbeam, sweet chestnut, birch and beech . trees. Tony Kirkham, head of the Kew Gardens arboretum, said gardeners . have previously been poisoned by the caterpillars. Staff are on standby to spray trees with pesticides, which has kept the outbreak there under control in the last five years. Bring in the big guns: A team in Richmond's Kew Gardens removing nests of the oak processionary moth larvae . ‘We . have cleared thousands of nests from trees,’ said Mr Kirkham. ‘We hope . it is under control in Kew but it looks like it is established in the . wider area of London. In Belgium, caterpillar infestation became so bad that the army was sent in to incinerate nests. The moth earned its name because of the nose-to-tail ‘processions’ the caterpillars form when stripping foliage. Their threat to humans comes from 700,000 toxic hairs found on each caterpillar, which contain the irritant chemical thaumetopoein. Even people walking near a nest can be affected as the hairs become detached and are carried by wind. 'There’s every chance it could spread. It’s a worrying pest and it’s a new pest.’ It is thought the moth came to south-west London in 2006 on an infested oak from Italy. Larvae have been hatching in the area since then, despite eradication efforts by the Forestry Commission. But its entomologists have said they are now focused on slowing its spread. The outbreaks in Bromley and Pangbourne are believed to have been caused by other infested trees from the Continent. The commission is hopeful these areas can be cleared. It is thought the growing trade in shrubs and trees has enabled the moth to spread across Europe in the past decade. Since 2009, Richmond Council has spent £200,000 trying to eradicate the pests.","Oak processionary moth larvae attacking trees in London and Berkshire .

A corrupt detective who sold drugs seized by police so he could lavish gifts on another woman behind his wife’s back has been jailed for 23 years. Nicholas McFadden splashed out on treats for his ex-fiancee after making £600,000 selling class A drugs confiscated from criminals. He had helped himself to more than £1million of heroin, cocaine and cannabis by exploiting ‘slack’ police procedures. Behind bars: Nicholas McFadden (left) and his brother Simon McFadden (right) were both jailed in Leeds . The detective constable, who is married with a child, had an affair with fellow officer Tanya Strangeway, 34, in 2007. After they became ‘close again’ in 2011, he used money from drug dealing to shower her with gifts including £10,000 in cash and a new Audi. He also refurbished his family home in Castleford, West Yorkshire, installing a new kitchen and building an orangery. McFadden, 38, and his brother Simon, 41, raided drugs  earmarked for destruction at West Yorkshire Police. The pair spent the proceeds on luxury lifestyles of lavish holidays, designer clothes and champagne. Simon, a debt collector, also bought pricy paintings and indulged a bizarre passion for ‘expensive sausages’. Yesterday the pair were jailed at Leeds Crown Court after being convicted of drug dealing and money laundering. Judge Tom Bayliss said: ‘We as a community are entitled to expect the very highest standards from our police officers. Partners: Clair Mcfadden (left), wife of Nicholas McFadden, 38, and his ex-fiancé Tanya Strangeway (right) ‘Without that ability to trust our police, society cannot function properly. You undermined that trust.’ He added: ‘Your motive was simple greed.’ During the five-week trial, the court heard that Nicholas McFadden, who worked for the specialist Organised Crime Group, ‘spent heavily’. When colleagues noticed he had begun to wear designer clothes and expensive watches, he lied and said his wife Clair, an assistant headmistress, had received an insurance pay-out after being ill with cancer. He travelled first-class to London and Egypt and bought a private number plate for Clair,  38, who had no idea of his crimes. She told the court: ‘He told me the money came from the overtime he was doing and said he’d remortgaged his property. ‘I accepted what he said because he was my husband and a police officer. He thanked me and said it was all down to me organising him.’ He also lavished gifts on Miss Strangeway, his former fiancee, who he had been seeing behind his wife’s back before she became pregnant in 2007. She told the court they had become ‘close’ again in 2011 when he texted her to say he wanted to give her a present. Evidence: Police found these bundles of cash stashed by 38-year-old Detective Constable Nicholas McFadden . The court heard police first became aware of Nicholas McFadden’s suspicious activity in the middle of 2011 when his bank alerted them to the fact he had deposited a total of £30,000 in small payments into cash machines over three months. When they raided his home, they found banknotes stuffed into sacks in his garage and more hidden around his house and car. At Simon’s home, they found mobile phones containing messages about drug deals. Simon and his wife Karen, a medical secretary, had spent money on extravagant shopping trips, splashing out £11,000 in Harvey Nichols and over £2,000 in Vivienne Westwood. Champagne lifestyle: The luxury Breitling watch owned by corrupt Detective Constable Nicholas McFadden . In total, Nicholas McFadden had £430,000 and Simon McFadden had a further £160,000 which could not be traced to any legitimate source. The court heard Nicholas McFadden had taken the drugs from a hold which contained those recovered from three major police operations. Nicholas McFadden was convicted of three counts of theft, two counts of conspiracy to supply class A drugs heroin and cocaine and one of conspiracy to supply class B drug cannabis. He had already admitted money laundering. Evidence: When police raided Nicholas McFadden's family home in Castleford they found almost £160,000 in banknotes stuffed into sacks in his garage, £20,000 hidden in his house and £6,000 in his sports car . Simon McFadden, of Leeds, was jailed for 16 years after being found guilty of the same three conspiracy charges and money laundering. His wife Karen, 41, who had already pleaded guilty to money laundering, was sentenced to 12 months in jail, suspended for two years. Detective Chief Inspector Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ‘Some police officers, Nicholas McFadden’s former colleagues, had risked their lives to take drugs off the streets and he, along with his brother, was putting them back there. ‘He has betrayed his friends and his former colleagues.’","West Yorkshire Police's Nicholas McFadden exploited 'slack' procedures .

His companion on the trek, Philip . Goodeve-Docker, 30, froze to death before rescue teams were able to find . them, and he and third team-member Roan Hackney are being treated for . frostbite. Mr Norman was last night on high doses . of morphine to numb the excruciating pain of his injuries as he . recovers in an Icelandic hospital, said his friend Georgina Lilley from . Wokingham.

'He just wants to get home but so far we don’t know for sure when that’s going to happen.' The IT worker and his two companions . had been on a 370-mile unsupported trek across Greenland's frozen . interior to raise money for charity when they were caught in . unexpectedly bad weather.

Mr Goodeve-Docker, who was embarking . on his first trip and had been ‘training furiously’, wrote about the . dangers of one of the most ‘deadly landscapes in the world’. The events manager estimated the trek . from east to west across the Greenland ice sheet, the world’s second . largest, would take 30 to 35 days. He wrote: ‘We will travel 550-600km . across one of the most dazzling,  beautiful, yet barren and deadly . landscapes in the world, dragging all our own supplies (between . 100-135kg). ‘This is one of the great polar . challenges, through which we face such dangers as polar bears (not cute . and cuddly), crevasses up to 500+ metres deep, polar winds, temperatures . of 5C to -50C, plus the horror of three men with one tent and no . washing. ‘Part of my reasons for this frankly nutty adventure is my grandfather, Patrick Pirie-Gordon, who passed away two years ago.’ Mr Pirie-Gordon, who had helped fund . polar exploration as treasurer and honorary vice-president of the Royal . Geographical Society, was also treasurer of the QNI (Queen’s Nursing . Institute), the charity for which his grandson hoped to raise money.

One person wrote: ‘Would have paid any money to have you back my friend, still can’t believe you are gone.’ Another added: ‘In memory, you made a difference and lived large!!’ Experts suggested the expedition was hit by what are called katabatic winds, which can exceed 100mph. Billy Payne, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said gusts of 95mph were reported on the east coast of Greenland on Saturday evening. Temperatures fell to minus 5C (23F), or minus 14C (7F) with wind chill. ‘It is likely the interior (of Greenland) would be much colder. These sorts of winds obviously are dangerously high,’ he said.

The Prime Minister has said he was prepared to consider legislation that would guarantee an in/out referendum if he wins the general election in 2015 . With anti-EU party UKIP set to make a significant breakthrough today, David Cameron has reinforced his commitment to hold a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe. The Prime Minister said yesterday he was prepared to consider legislation that would guarantee an in/out referendum if he wins the general election in 2015. More than 100 Conservative MPs have urged Mr Cameron to back legislation on a referendum in this Parliament – even if Labour and the Liberal Democrats conspire to vote it down. Mr Cameron also sought to reassure . core Tory voters by acknowledging frustration with the slow pace of . change on immigration policy, and promised measures in the next few . weeks to limit immigrants’ access to welfare and the NHS. Tory . and Labour strategists expect UKIP to perform strongly in today’s . council polls, taking seats from both parties, and to come second in a . Commons by-election in the South Shields seat vacated by David . Miliband. One poll . yesterday suggested UKIP could take as much as 22 per cent of the vote . in local elections and significantly limit the progress made by Labour. A third-place showing behind UKIP would trigger a crisis for Labour leader Ed Miliband. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg claimed voters’ hostility to his party was easing, but conceded it could come fourth in terms of vote share today. Whatever happens, the Conservatives will lose hundreds of council seats last contested in 2009, when Gordon Brown’s government was at the nadir of its popularity and the then opposition won 44 per cent of the vote, compared to Labour’s 12.7 per cent. Tory high command is preparing to field senior figures to steady nerves over the weekend – echoing Mr Cameron’s message yesterday that the party is far better placed than the governments of Margaret Thatcher were in mid term. The Tories are preparing a ‘vote Farage, get Miliband’ campaign in the run-up to the 2015 general election – seeking to persuade those who back UKIP as a protest vote today that they risk letting in a pro-EU Labour government if they do the same at a Westminster election. Sitting pretty: UKIP leader Nigel Farage smokes a cigarette while on the phone during the campaign trail yesterday . Mr Cameron said: ‘Their [UKIP’s] policies are coming under scrutiny, their candidates are coming under scrutiny, and that is a welcome part of the political debate. ‘I’m arguing that really it’s a choice of which team do you want to run the county council, and of course the general election, which, I think even more so, will be do you want a Conservative government that’s going to continue the work of getting the deficit down, getting Britain back to work, sorting out the welfare system, reducing immigration – do you want those things? 'Or do you want to put all of that at risk with a Labour party which . . . has only got one idea and that’s to put up borrowing?’ He said that in the coming weeks the Government would introduce rules ‘to make sure that when people come here they are not coming for the health service or the benefit system or anything else’. Asked whether he would consider an EU referendum Bill in this parliament, he told BBC Radio 4: ‘I think we need to demonstrate absolutely that we are serious about this referendum. Anything we can to do to strengthen that offer, I am prepared to consider.’ Aides said the most probable scenario is for the Tories to support a referendum Bill introduced from the back benches. Mr Farage said he was open to the idea of joint Tory/UKIP candidates in 2015, adding: ‘The bar to it is simple: David Cameron.’","More than 100 Conservative MPs have urged Mr Cameron to back legislation on a referendum .

Google has lifted the lid on some of their new green methods for handling the billions of emails they deal with each and every day. And in typical Google feel-good fashion, they decided to demonstrate their methods in a cute animation full of whimsical imagery, showing our emails bouncing through cables as cats play on rooftops and cars trundle along the road. 'The Story of Send', as Google terms it, takes us on a journey which starts when your email - or Gmail, assuming you are using Google's email system - bounces out of your laptop, and ends when the email arrives on the recipient's smartphone. Although the animation is a colourful land where Google employees skate through the data banks and listen to their music through their headphones, clicking on any of the various Play buttons that dot the landscape lead into very serious documentaries about how Google reduces their power needs and uses green technology to reduce the search engine's impact on the environment. Along the way, we also learn some fascinating facts about their data farm - for instance employees work in Hawaiian shirts and shorts rather than waste energy on air-conditioning the giant vaults containing thousands of hard drives, or how 100 Google searches equals the amount of power used to light a light-bulb for 28 minutes. Some of the tidbits revealed by Google include how the company keeps its data centres - those vast warehouses full of hard-drives storing Google's colossal amounts of data - at a warm 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26C), rather than spend a lot of energy and money keeping air-conditioning the building. Instead, the company simply asks its workers to wear shorts to work. Also, the company says that: 'Since 2007, we’ve recycled enough servers to avoid buying over 90,000 replacement machines. We always look for ways to reuse what we have, and when we can’t, we completely erase any data components and resell them. 'We’re proud that we recycle 100% of the electronic equipment that leaves our data centers.' Other little facts that appear on the animation include how a user streaming three days of YouTube uses the equivalent energy it takes to manufacture, package and deliver one DVD, and how using 100 searches uses the same amount of energy as using a 60W light bulb for 28 minutes.

And, if you are scared of sending private emails, or using 'cloud' services, whereby companies like Google, Microsoft or DropBox look after your data and can stream it to multiple devices, Google wants you to know there are some real-world security options built into their data farms. The company says: 'We understand the importance of keeping your personal data secure. That’s why we protect your message with a wide range of security measures. Security cameras, iris scans and fingerprint scans at our data centers are just a few of the measures we take to secure and protect your information.' The company also states they use renewable energy for more than 30% of our operations.

"Justin Welby was speaking at a Bible Society debate on ethics in finance . By . James Salmon . PUBLISHED: . 18:53 EST, 22 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:18 EST, 23 April 2013 . Britain is in the grip of a ‘depression’ and requires radical changes in banking to snap out of it, the Archbishop of Canterbury warned last night. Speaking at a Bible Society debate on ethics in finance, Justin Welby described the financial crisis as a ‘generational problem’ driven by a slump in confidence as much as a breakdown in the markets. He said: ‘What we are in the moment is not a recession but is essentially some kind of depression. It’s going to take something very major to get us out of it in the same way as it took something major to get us into it.’ Speaking at a Bible Society debate on ethics in finance, Justin Welby (pictured at Lady Thatcher's funeral) described the financial crisis as a 'generational problem' driven by a slump in confidence as much as a breakdown in the markets . The grim diagnosis comes ahead of the publication of official growth figures on Thursday which are, at best, expected to show Britain narrowly avoided an unprecedented ‘triple dip’ recession. Welby, who sits on the influential banking commission of MPs and peers, called for a ‘revolution’ in banking. He said: ‘We need a revolution in the aims of banks so they exist to serve the society they are in. Companies are not self regarding things to maximise returns for shareholders.’ Despite calling for an improvement in ethics and standards at British  lenders, he  argued that  some of the criticism of them has been unfair. The Archbishop's comments echo those of Governor of Bank of England Sir Mervyn King . He said: ‘My experience of the last year on the banking commission ruins many of one’s illusions.  They (bankers) don’t come in with horns and a tail burning £50 notes to light large cigars.’ He added:  ‘One of the things they did is borrow short to lend long, a classic error.’ The Archbishop became the latest influential figure to suggest that state backed Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group should be broken up into a ‘good’ bank to lend to the economy and a ‘bad’ bank, storing all their toxic assets. This echoes comments made by Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King earlier this year. But Welby, who said he was speaking in a personal capacity, also argued a British lender should be broken up into regional banks to better serve their local communities. ‘Part of the banking system should be local, not London based. We need to bring new entrants in, and recapitalise one of the banks and break it up into regional banks.’ Welby’s comments  come after the Church of England vowed last week  to ‘turn the tide’ on a culture of lavish bonuses for bankers and business chiefs. It slammed the ‘culture of entitlement and greed’ in bug businesses, saying it ‘rides roughshod’ over the Christian principles of justice and fairness’. It promised to use the financial firepower of  investments held in its £8billion pension scheme to vote against excessive pay packages. Its investments include Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Shell and Vodafone.","Radical changes needed to snap out of it, the Archbishop of Canterbury said .

The watercolour, entitled 'Girl Bathing', was created by the infamous hardman in 1986 as he served life in Norwich prison. Experts believe it was inspired by Edgar Degas's 'The Tub' which killer Kray became obsessed with during his incarceration. Painting: 'Girl Bathing' was created by the gangster Reggie Kray in 1986 as he served life in Norwich prison . Artistic: Reggie Kray took up painting as a hobby while in prison. Three of his paintings are due to go under the hammer next month . It is being auctioned with two of his other paintings called 'Tree Studies' which have been seen before. The three - all marked with Kray's prison number - are expected to fetch around £500 each during the sale by Cheffins in Cambridge on May 2. Sarah Flynn, from Cheffins, yesterday said: 'Painting became quite a hobby for him in prison and he is not bad at all. 'He obviously enjoyed painting and that comes through in his work. 'The paintings are owned by a distinguished local private collector. He is selling them because he is downsizing his collection. 'The nude painting is very different, and quite an unusual find so I would imagine there will be a lot of interest in it.' Both Ronnie and Reggie Kray became keen artists while they served life in prison, usually copying classic images by famous artists.

Liam Byrne (left) told the Commons that if his . party's 'safeguards' on homelessness were not accepted, Labour peers . would vote against the Govt in a crucial vote on amendments to its . flagship Welfare Reform Bill. Iain Duncan Smith (right) has described it as a 'wrecking' amendment . In a heated exchange with Mr Byrne, Mr Duncan Smith said: 'If he says he's in favour of the cap, then why do his side keep on voting against it and today in the other place they have laid an amendment which is officially a wrecking amendment on the cap, so they cannot weasel their way out of it and say they are in favour on the one hand and against on the other. 'And I remind him, when it comes to housing benefit, under his side housing benefit pretty near doubled in ten years and it was set to rise far more than it'll rise under us.' Mr Byrne said the housing benefit bill was set to rise by 'an extraordinary' £4billion over the course of four years. He said: 'Now what we do not want on top of that is another bill for council tax payers to clean up the cost of homelessness. The issue began to trend on Twitter this morning with many explaining their exasperation over the level being set at £26,000 . 'Now the Secretary of State for DCLG . has already warned us that 20,000 people will be made homeless as a . result of the way his cap will be introduced. 'This . morning his own department published an impact assessment that put up . the number of families affected by the cap by a third. It's almost as if . he's making this policy up as he goes along. 'So . I hope he will accept Labour's safeguards this afternoon that guard . against a new risk of homelessness. If he dismisses it, if he wants to . be so glib about it why doesn't he accept the amendment this afternoon, . because if he doesn't we will support the Lord Bishops' amendment to . safeguard against a new bill for council tax payers.' Do you think £26,000-a-year benefits cap is fair? Mr Duncan Smith said he did not . accept the Bishops' amendment, adding: 'Of course it would raise roughly . the level that we would see on the level of income to about £50,000. It . would be rather pointless having a cap set so high that nobody could . ever earn it.' He . stated he had an email from a vicar stating he was wondering why the . Bishops 'had failed to recognise that he as a vicar is only paid at . £22,000 a year and wonders why they are getting excited about £26,000 . being a poverty level figure'. Referring to housing benefit, he said the Government was saving £2billion a year and it doubled under Labour. Lib . Dem Sir Alan Beith (Berwick-Upon-Tweed) said many of his constituents . 'object strongly to paying through their taxes for people to get more in . benefits than they can get on a working wage or to live in properties . which are far beyond anything they could afford on their wage'. DAVID CAMERON: 'It's a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone? I don't believe they should' He added it was important to get the transition right, but the principles were sound. Mr . Duncan Smith replied: 'Absolutely, the principle behind this, the . application of it, is vital and I simply cannot understand why the party . opposite snigger and wriggle on this issue, failing to do what is . right, failing to do what is proper and facing up to their . responsibility.' Mr Duncan Smith hit out Labour's position on the benefit cap proposals, stating it had 'taken more different positions than a Jane Fonda workout'. Tory Margot James (Stourbridge) said average earnings in her constituency were £23,700 a year, arguing that 'to oppose or to equivocate on the policy on a cap on benefits is an outrageous insult to all hard working people in this country'. Mr Duncan Smith replied that she was 'absolutely right', adding that 'this cap is fair and it is popular'. The welfare system they inherited 'is in a mess and trapping people in dependency when we could free them'. Speaking as Mr Byrne listened, he said the Opposition's position on the issue was ill conceived, adding: 'The right honourable gentleman on this has taken more different positions than a Jane Fonda workout.' Earlier, David Cameron said: 'It's a basic issue of fairness. Should people really be able to earn more than £26,000 just through benefits alone? 'I don't believe they should. And I think the overwhelming majority of people in the country would back that view."" Speaking in Leeds Mr Cameron said the £35,000 equivalent wage was a 'good, healthy salary'. As ministers faced a concerted challenge to their welfare reforms, Opposition spokesman Lord McKenzie of Luton said his party backed the cap but it had to be 'based on fairness""'. In report stage debate on the Welfare Reform Bill, he told peers: 'A particular concern for us is its potential to drive increased homelessness.' Labour, with the backing of Church of England bishops, want the Government to exempt from the cap those threatened with homelessness because of its introduction. But Work and Pensions minister Lord Freud defended the cap, insisting households should not be able to receive more in benefits than the average family earned from work. 'People on benefits should face the same choices as working families, including where they can afford to live,' he said. The cap was welcomed by the Centre for Social Justice think tank, which was founded by Mr Duncan Smith in opposition. Executive director Gavin Poole said: 'Members of the House of Lords should think twice about opposing a reform that will help tackle child poverty in the UK. 'Our present system traps families in dependency on state handouts and sends a corrosive message to the two million children who live in workless households. 'Deprived of the role model of a parent who goes out to work and earns a living, many of these children will simply repeat this stultifying, destructive cycle, graduating to an adult life on benefits. 'By capping benefits at the level of average income and by restoring the incentive to work, ministers are taking a major step towards ending intergenerational poverty and giving young people the chance to make something of their lives.","Prime Minister: 'It's a basic issue of fairness.

Police believe relatives of the elderly pair feared the women had been possessed by demons and were responsible for the illness. Local police spokesman Emmanuel Mahoko said traditional healer Maxwell Pira summoned both pensioners to a gathering before passing round a mystery liquid in a cup. The officer said: 'Pira gathered all family members and started praying for them. 'He also said prayers for a liquid which he called ""holy water"". 'He instructed all the family members to drink the water which was passed around in a cup, but warned that those responsible for the sickness of the young girl should not drink the concoction as they would die.' Inspector Mahoko added: 'The two elderly women drank the liquid but collapsed almost immediately. 'They were put on a scotch cart but died on the way to hospital.' Officials confirmed the two women's bodies were taken for post-mortem examinations. Detectives have launched an investigation to confirm the cause of death and to establish the contents of the liquid. New Zimbabwe reported that Pira had vanished after the tragedy and was believed to be on the run. Inspector Mahoko told the publication the suspect faced two charges of murder. Belief in witchcraft remains prevalent in many parts of Africa, where people often balance organised religion with traditional belief systems.","Jersey Mutero, 83, and Erita Bhebhe, 73, collapsed within seconds .

Francis has inherited a Vatican rocked by a scandal in which documents leaked to the media spoke of alleged corruption in its administration and depicted prelates as fighting among themselves to advance their careers. Last month, he set up an advisory board of eight cardinals from around the world to help him reform the Vatican administration, known as the Curia. They will help him put into place changes in an administration which has been held responsible for some of the mishaps and scandals that plagued the eight-year reign of Pope Benedict before he resigned in February. Benedict left a secret report for Francis on the problems in the administration, which came to light when sensitive documents were stolen from the Pope's desk and leaked by his butler in what became know as the 'Vatileaks' scandal. Before the conclave that elected Francis, cardinals called for changes to the Curia to make it a model of good governance, including introducing term limits on Vatican bureaucrats. Anger at the mostly Italian prelates who run the Curia was one of the reasons that cardinals chose the first non-European pope for 1,300 years and quashed the chances of one of the front-runners, Milan Archbishop Angelo Scola.

Four Republican lawmakers want to classify bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, an 'enemy combatant' Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has not be read his Miranda rights – but a battle is being waged whether he should. Four prominent Republican Congressmen have argued that the 19-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen should be treated as an ‘enemy combatant,’ meaning that he would not be Mirandized. Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, as well as Rep. Peter King, New York, said in a joint statement they ‘do not want this suspect to remain silent.’ In a statement obtained by the Washington Post, the four Republican lawmakers wrote: ‘The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans.’ Officials said late Friday after Tsarnaev was detained that they would use a public safety exemption to delay the suspect’s Miranda rights. However, the exemption expires 48 hours after the arrest, so quick actions must be taken. According to authorities, the suspected bomber remains at Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in critical but stable condition. Eleven of the bombing victims are still being treated only doors away. Outspoken: Sens. John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, are part of a group of four lawmakers demanding not to read the teenager his Miranda rights . Joint statement: Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, left, as well as Rep. Peter King, New York, right, both signed the statement saying there were valuable things that the suspect could reveal . Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said today that Tsarnaev is likely unable to communicate, but hopes the suspect comes around 'because we have a million questions.' The reading of a suspect’s Miranda rights alerts a person of their right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the right to a fair and speedy trial. The Congressmen wrote that alerting Tsarnaev of his rights as a naturalized U.S. citizen shouldn’t be anything near a priority. ‘We should be focused on gathering intelligence from this suspect right now that can help our nation understand how this attack occurred and what may follow in the future.’ The lawmakers then challenged the Obama administration to consider the ‘enemy combatant’ option, saying: ‘We continue to face threats from radical Islamists in small cells and large groups throughout the world,’ saying their primary goals were ‘killing as many Americans as possible, preferably within the United States.’ Federal public defender Miriam Conrad, who represents Massachusetts, told FoxNews.com that her office will likely represent Tsarnaev following his charges. Guarded: Police guard the entrance to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center today, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is being treated, rooms away from 11 of the bombing victims . Critical: Tsarnaev, who was arrested Friday night, remains in critical condition under heavy guard after he was apprehended in Watertown . The debate over denying the suspect his Miranda rights has sparked outrage in the American Civil Liberties Union. The organization said Saturday that denying Tsarnaev his rights is ‘un-American.’ Anthony D. Romero, ACLU’s executive director, said in a statement today: ‘Every criminal defendant is entitled to be read Miranda rights. The public safety exception should be read narrowly. ‘It applies only when there is a continued threat to public safety and is not an open-ended exception to the Miranda rule. Additionally, every criminal defendant has a right to be brought before a judge and to have access to counsel. ‘We must not waver from our tried-and-true justice system, even in the most difficult of times. Denial of rights is un-American and will only make it harder to obtain fair convictions.’ According to FoxNews.com, the Obama . administration’s Department of Justice is weighing its options and could . seek the death penalty. As  Guardian columnist Glenn Greenwald notes, the Obama administration . pushed back Miranda rights in 2010, limiting the rights for terrorists . arrested on U.S. soil to be Mirandized. Slate’s . Emily Bazelon also looked at the examples of other terrorism suspects, . including the Christmas Day 2009 ‘underwear’ bomber, Umar Farouk . Abdulmutalab, who was only Mirandized after 50 minutes of interrogation. Captured: The FBI wanted poster released last night was updated to show that Dzhokhar was in custody . Open investigation: Law enforcement evidence technicians continue to investigate the scene of the Boston Marathon bombings on Saturday . Then, Times Square bombing suspect Faisal Shazad was arrested in 2010 for trying to bomb the New York City neighborhood. In both cases, Bazelon notes, the FBI said they received valuable information from invoking the public safety exception. But, she writes: ‘Because no one is crying over the rights of the young man who is accused of killing innocent people, helping his brother set off bombs that were loaded to maim, and terroriz(e) Boston Thursday night and Friday. ‘But the next time you read about an abusive interrogation, or a wrongful conviction that resulted from a false confession, thing about why we have Miranda in the first place. It’s to stop law enforcement authorities from committing abuses.’","Sens. John McCain, Lindsey Graham, and Kelly Ayotte and Rep.

Pupils born later in the academic year should be allowed to pass key tests with fewer marks than their older classmates, experts said yesterday. They claim it would be fairer because of the ‘large and significant difference’ in academic performance between pupils born at the start and end of the academic year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said younger pupils should be able to pass tests at seven, 14 and their GCSEs at 16 with lower marks set on a sliding scale according to the month in which they were born. The IFS report said younger pupils were far less likely to achieve five GCSEs at grades A* to C, compared to classmates 11 months older. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank said younger pupils should be able to pass tests at seven, 14 and their GCSEs at 16 with lower marks set on a sliding scale according to the month in which they were born. Posed by models . Those born in August are also more frequently classed as having special educational needs, are less likely to go to university at 18 and have less confidence in their academic abilities than those whose birthdays fall in September. Although the study found the ‘detrimental effects’ did not appear to continue into adulthood, when the chances of being employed and average earnings were the same, the Government needed to address ‘the fact that children born at different times of year have to sit the tests when they are different ages’. But Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said adjusting pass marks would open the door for other problems to be weighted against results, such as a child’s social background. He added: ‘Age is an extremely important factor but if you make an adjustment because of the date of birth then there is an argument about including other concessions, such as disability or time off school or background.’ Ellen Greaves, co-author of the study, said: ‘Our findings point to a simple solution to the pitfalls of testing children born at the start and end of the academic year – age-adjusting the cut-offs required for pupils to achieve particular grades would ensure that no child is prevented from going on to further or higher education simply because of the month in which they were born.’ IFS programme director Claire Crawford added: ‘Our research continues to show very large differences in attainment between children born at the start and end of the academic year, which affects the post-compulsory education options open to them. ‘While we find little evidence that these differences persist into adulthood, this does not mean  that policymakers should be let off the hook. ‘Children who are relatively young in their year have lower self-confidence, lower belief in their academic ability and are more likely to start smoking younger than their relatively older peers. ‘This suggests that it is still vital for policymakers to act to overcome these differences.’ The report, which was funded by the Nuffield Foundation, revealed 53.7 per cent of younger children gained five good GCSEs, compared to 60.1 per cent of older children. One in eight were labelled as having mild special education needs at age 11, compared to just one in 14 older children. They were also more likely to indulge in ‘risky behaviours’, such as under-age smoking. The report recommended the age-adjusted scores should be used when assessing whether students can continue into further and higher education.","Institute for Fiscal Studies: Younger pupils far less likely to achieve five GCSEs at grades A* to C, compared .

The big cat tried its luck against the herd of 15 elephants by stalking the group and sipping from the same water hole. But one of the herd spotted the leopard, decided it was being far too bold and squirted a stream of water in its direction to shoo it away. The leopard had been stalking the herd of 15 elephants when one decided to give it a good hosing to scare it off . The leopard was spotted by Swiss photographer Mark Müller, in Etosha National Park in Namibia . The moment was captured by Mark Müller, 46, at the Kalkeuwel water hole in Etosha National Park, Namibia, as he watched the elephants at play. The Swiss photographer said: 'They were splashing about, spraying water on their backs and being rather noisy.' But other animals in the surroundings, including giraffes and zebras, clearly sensed danger and moved away. 'Suddenly I discovered a leopard entering the open area around the waterhole,' said Mr Müller. The elephant loomed over the leopard as it stalked the herd . The leopard tried its luck against the herd the Kalkeuwel waterhole but came away with a soaking . Mr Müller said it was a 'one of a kind' experience to capture the two-second tussle . 'The leopard calmly and without any signs . of fear just walked between the elephants and some giraffes to the . waterhole, crouched down and started to lap up water. 'The elephants must first have been as . surprised as me at the cat's careless attitude, despite the proximity of . the much larger elephants.' The elephants began to encircle the leopard in an act of intimidation. It began to walk away, but paused between some of the herd and a giraffe. And that's when one elephant decided to teach the smaller creature a lesson. 'What I did not notice at the time was that one of the elephants must have sucked up a trunk full of water,' Mr Müller said. 'With a flash that elephant sprayed the water at the leopard, which stood no more than five metres away.' The impromptu shower sent the leopard running for the bushes and left Mr Müller, who uses a Nikon F4 camera, reeling with his good fortune. He said: 'I do not think I breathed from the moment the leopard started walking between the elephants to the waterhole. 'The shower was so unexpected and I was very lucky to have captured it - that sequence took maybe two seconds. 'I knew immediately that I had witnessed something very special.

'The Burj Khalifa is a perfect building for shooting a 360 degree pano from the top of, because its 'roof' is only 1.5 meters across. 'This means that you can shoot from a single location and capture the entire view, without the building itself getting in the way (aircraft beacons and lightning conductors excluded!). 'I shot a 45 gigapixel panorama of the Dubai skyline in April 2010 – at the time, the world’s largest ever digital panorama, and thought that a panorama from the pinnacle of the Burj Khalifa would be a great way to top that. 'As long as it was big enough to make it interesting to zoom around in, it didn’t need to be 10’s or 100’s of gigapixels. 'It’s all about the view. Nothing can top that view – it is a unique place. 'Since the time of the Great Pyramids, remarkably few buildings have held the title of 'World’s tallest structure on land'. 'The Burj Khalifa is only the 15th in over 4,500 years of human history. 'It’s a very, very special building, and hopefully people will appreciate it even more now that they can see the view from the top. 'It’s all about being able to take people up there “virtually” and share what I experienced for real, and I hope people enjoy it!'

Rags to riches: Ecotricity boss Dale Vince who won his application to strike out a compensation claim by his ex-wife . In the 21 years since his divorce from Kathleen Wyatt, former hippy Dale Vince has built one of the UK’s biggest green energy companies and made millions. Meanwhile Miss Wyatt – a woman said to have a penchant for penniless men – has struggled financially. Yesterday her attempt to claim a £2million share of Mr Vince’s fortune was thrown out by a court after a judge said the former New Age traveller turned wind farm tycoon was not ‘her insurer against life’s eventualities’. Senior family judge Lord Justice Thorpe added that she had left her claim – amounting to around £100,000 for every year since she divorced him in 1992 – far too late. The judge, sitting with Lord Justice Jackson and Lord Justice Tomlinson in the Appeal Court in London, allowed Mr Vince’s appeal against the High Court’s refusal to strike out Miss Wyatt’s claim. Lord Justice Jackson said: ‘In the family context, there is no statutory bar to bringing a claim for financial relief ten, 20 or even 30 years after the divorce. ‘Nevertheless, the court should not allow either party to a former marriage to be harassed by claims for financial relief which are issued many years after the divorce and have no real prospect of success. 'It must be an abuse of the court’s process to bring such proceedings. The present case is a classic example of such abuse.’ The court heard that the couple married in 1981, when Miss Wyatt already had a daughter from a previous relationship, and lived largely on benefits. They had a son but separated after only three years. Mr Vince, 51, was later living in an old ambulance when he made a wind turbine out of retrieved and recycled materials to generate his own energy. Mr Vince with his £1million electric supercar: His ex-wife Kathleen Wyatt claimed she tried and failed to get him to pay her maintenance and child support . Grand: The £3million, 18th-century fort occupied by Dale Vince, who had faced a £125,000 legal bill . From that grew Ecotricity, which he founded in 1995. Mr Vince’s legal team argued that when he and Miss Wyatt were divorced his unlikely business empire was years in the future and he had hardly a penny to his name. The money he subsequently made has allowed him to indulge his love of sports cars and he now lives in £3million, 18th century Rodborough Fort, near Stroud, Gloucestershire. He has remarried and has a four-year-old son. Living the high life: Mr Vince, centre, now runs a successful business Ecotricity which is worth several million . In contrast Miss Wyatt, 53, of Monmouthshire, is said to have travelled to a hearing in the case last month by getting up early to use the bus and sleeping in the bus station. Lord Justice Thorpe said yesterday of Miss Wyatt, who found a new partner in 1993 with whom she had two children: ‘Impecuniosity has been the experience of all the wife’s adult life. Both the men with whom she has entered into family life were seemingly equally impecunious. ‘Her husband was the most improbable candidate for affluence. She can no doubt appeal to his sense of charity but in my judgment he is not to be compelled to boost her income.’ 'Considerable enterprise': Mr Vince in the Nineties set up a wind energy business with a new girlfriend that developed into Ecotricity, now a massive player in the UK's eco energy sector, with over 70,000 customers .","Dale Vince today won court battle against wife claiming financial support .

Detectives investigating sexual abuse at one of Britain's top music schools have today said more than 30 women have come forward since a former pupil killed herself after suffering years of abuse. A major investigation was launched in February following the conviction . of ex-choirmaster at Chetham's School of Music, Michael Brewer, who indecently assaulted former pupil Frances . Andrade. Ms Andrade, who was 48, took a fatal overdose during his trial, and officers say since then other women have been 'spurred . on' by her bravery and contacted the police. Greater Manchester Police has also revealed . they 'are currently investigating a pool of about 10 offenders', some of whom . are former teachers. Inspired: The death of brave Frances Andrade (left), who was abused by Michael Brewer (right), has 'spurred on' others to report allegations of abuse . Detectives believe they are making 'good progress' on their major probe into abuse at the school . Detective Chief Inspector Jamie Daniels, from GMP's Protective Services Division, said: 'This is a significant inquiry in terms of potential number of offenders and number of victims. 'We are supporting each and every person who has come forward and made a complaint to us as best we can and I must credit them all for having the courage to face demons that have been haunting them for many, many years. 'This has been a high-profile investigation from the off and due to the complexities and sensitivities involved cannot and will not be rushed. 'I want to reassure the public that I am absolutely committed to getting justice for these women, many of whom have been spurred on by the bravery shown by Frances Andrade in the case against former teacher Michael Brewer. 'I also want to reassure everybody, that where we have identified immediate safeguarding concerns the appropriate steps have been taken in partnership with other organisations. 'Chetham's and other establishments have provided, and continue to provide help and support at what is clearly a very difficult time for their respective staff and pupils. 'It goes without saying that if anyone has been a victim of any offence or has any information that can assist this investigation I would urge them to get in touch.' Probe: More than 30 former female pupils of Chetham's School of Music (pictured) have reported abuse to police . Nearly all of the abuse is alleged to have taken place at Chetham’s - however it is believed some took place when complainants were pupils at the Royal Northern College of Music, also in Manchester. The allegations came to light after the trial of former Chetham’s choirmaster Michael Brewer, convicted earlier this year of indecent assault in the 1970s and 1980s. A second music teacher, Wen Zhou Li, a 57-year-old violin tutor from Cheshire who has worked at both Chetham’s and the RNCM, has also been arrested on suspicion of rape before being released on bail. No charges have been brought and Mr Li strenuously denies the allegations. Paul Lewis, an acclaimed pianist who studied at Chetham’s in the 1980s, claimed ‘every pupil’ knew of the abuse. Malcolm Layfield, who was head of strings at the Royal Northern College of Music, was accused by Frances Andrade of preying on students. He said he had resigned from the Manchester-based college as his position was ‘untenable’. Married Mr Layfield, 61, taught at Chetham’s alongside Brewer. He has admitted sexual relationships with at least six pupils, some of whom were just 16. It was stated all the girls were over the age of consent and the ‘liaisons’ were ‘consensual’. More than 1,000 former Chetham’s pupils and professional musicians signed a petition calling for an independent inquiry into sexual abuse at the school and other private music conservatoires.

Los Angeles Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant has scored a victory in an ongoing legal battle with his own mother, who planned to auction off more than a million dollars’ worth of his sports memorabilia. This week, a judge issued a temporary restraining order against Goldin Auctions barring the auction house from selling Bryant's basketball jerseys, jackets, high school championship rings, trophies and other collectibles pending a full hearing. The New Jersey-based auction business has filed a complaint claiming that Bryant's mother, Pamela Bryant, put up for sale a large collection of sports memorabilia, which she had received as a gift from her millionaire son. The items numbering in the hundreds were expected to fetch around $1.5million. Family feud: Lakers star Kobe Bryant has accused his mother, Pamela (pictured) of selling his valuable collection of memorabilia, and even stealing some of the items from his home . He said, she said: Kobe Bryant (left) insisted that his mother (right) was never given consent to take his collectibles and sell them, but Pamela Bryant claims her son had given her permission to auction them off . Earlier this year, Mrs Bryant joined forces with the Berlin, New Jersey-based Goldin Auctions to sell the sports mementos from her son's high school days and early NBA career. In return, Pamela Bryant received a $450,000 advance, which she in turn used to buy a house in Nevada. However, the 34-year-old athlete, who is currently recovering from a season-ending injury to his Achilles’ tendon, filed his own complaint against the auction house insisting that he had never given his mother permission to sell his memorabilia. Mr Bryant went on to stay in his court filing that his mother stole some of his personal items from his house, TMZ reported. 'I never told my mother that she could have my personal property, let alone consign it for public auction,' Bryant wrote. According to the complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in Camden, New Jersey, the Lakers shooting guard claimed that Mrs Bryant admitted to him recently that she was never given consent to sell his possessions. 'I confronted her about her false . statement that I had given my memorabilia to her,' Bryant wrote in the filing cited by ESPN. 'I said . to her, ""Mom, you know I never told you that you could have the . memorabilia."" 'Her response . was, ""Yes, but you never said you wanted it, either."" Of course, this is . untrue, since my wife and I requested that she return my memorabilia . several years earlier.' Last . week, Kobe Bryant's lawyers demanded that Goldin Auctions scrap the . scheduled June sale. In response, the auction house sued the athlete for . the right to go ahead with the sale of The Kobe Bryant Collection. Mr . Bryant has emphasized that he was only suing the auctioneers and not . his mother, but both he and his wife, Vanessa, had testified in writing . that Pamela Bryant took the memorabilia and put it on the auction block . without their permission, and then refused to return the prized . possessions. Bryant said in . a sworn statement that the items at the center of the dispute  go back . to his teenage years have 'tremendous sentimental value,' adding that he . was planning to hand down his 'well-deserved memorabilia’  to his . children, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. Bryant said his mother can claim ownership of only two items, NBA Championship rings that he had custom-made for his parents. For sale: An advertisement for an auction of items belonging to Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant is seen just before the basketball star ordered the auction house to stop . Deal: A lawsuit by the New Jersey auction house claims that Kobe Bryant's mother Pamela Bryant, seen beside his father Joe Bryant, already struck a deal with them for the items' sale . Vanessa . Bryant also weighed in on the mother-son spat, stating that when . confronted about the items, her mother-in-law agreed to return theme, . but said that she had moved all the jerseys and championship mementos to . a storage facility. Attorneys for both sides in the legal dispute will present their arguments in the case May 20 in Camden. The disagreement is a high-value, . high-profile version of a question many families face: Can Mom get rid . of the stuff a grown child left at home? In this case, the 900 mementos happen to be worth upward of $1.5 million. Among . the first 100 or so items Pamela Bryant intends to sell: the NBA star's . jerseys, practice gear and sweatsuits from Lower Merion High School; . varsity letters; a trophy for being the outstanding player at the 1995 . Adidas ABCD basketball camp; and a signed basketball from the 2000 NBA . championship game. And . then there are rings, for the 1996 Pennsylvania high school . championship, a pair that the Lakers made for Bryant's parents for the . 2000 NBA championship and one from the 1998 NBA All-Star game. According . to court filings, Pamela Bryant struck a deal in January with Goldin . Auctions in Berlin, N.J., which earlier this year sold a rare Honus . Wagner baseball card for a record $2.1 million. In its court filings, Goldin says . Pamela Bryant told the auction house that she asked her son five years . ago what he wanted to do with the items that were in her home. 'Kobe Bryant indicated to Pamela . Bryant that the items belonged to her and that he had no interest in . them,' the auction house's attorneys wrote. So she put them in a . $1,500-per-month New Jersey storage unit. Gifted: A Los Angeles Lakers championship ring given by Kobe to his father Joe Bryant is seen among the items the auction house hopes to sell . Fair game: Two Lower Merion High School basketball jerseys worn by Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant are seen for sale though Bryant contends that his mother doesn't have the right to sell the collectibles . Price tag: The 900 items belonging to Bryant, seen with his wife Vanessa at a cancer research benefit on Thursday, could bring in upward of $1.5 million . The challenge came last Tuesday when Goldin sent a news release announcing the auction. By day's end, Kobe Bryant's lawyer had sent a cease-and-desist letter telling the auction house to call off the sale and return the items to him. Kenneth Goldin, owner of the auction house, says he can't cancel the auction because he's already advanced $450,000 to Bryant's mother and put money into advertising the auction. Kobe Bryant's lawyer Mark Campbell said in a statement, 'Mr. Bryant's personal property has ended up in the possession of someone who does not lawfully own it. We look forward to resolving this legal matter through the legal system.' Bryant has had a sometimes icy relationship with his mother and father, Joe 'Jellybean' Bryant, a former pro basketball player for the Philadelphia 76ers who is now coaching in Thailand.","Auction house has filed a lawsuit after basketball great ordered them to stop .

Katrina Brown is suffering from a rare, deadly illness after being exposed to uranium while serving in Iraq . A soldier who developed a deadly illness after being exposed to uranium in Iraq is facing a race against time to raise the money she needs for potentially life-saving treatment. Katrina Brown, 30, was exposed to radioactive material while serving as a medic at a 600-bed military clinic in Basra in 2003. She was diagnosed with rare systemic sclerosis in 2008 which is slowly attacking her major organs - and will eventually lead to her death if left untreated. Mrs Brown, who joined the Army at the age of 17, believes the illness is linked to exposure to depleted uranium. She was handed a card before flying home from her 2003 tour warning her she had been in contact with radioactive materials. She currently survives on 18 pills a day, costing over £3,000 a month. Now, she believes her only hope is to have a stem-cell transplant in a bid to regenerate her organs. But the procedure is not available on the NHS and the health service has said it cannot pay for her transatlantic care. She is is now trying to find £110,000 to fly out for an operation in America after being turned down for funding by a host of charities. Mrs Brown, who lives with her husband Martin in Gloucestershire, said she still holds on to the dream of returning to her Army career. She said: 'Since I was diagnosed, . everything's been a battle - as well as battling the illness I've been . fighting to try and access the right treatment. 'Now we've been offered . this ray of light but obviously we need help to raise the money. 'I've lost about 90 per cent of my . mobility and the longer I live with the illness, the more I'm . deteriorating physically, but I know I can't give up.' Ms Brown was exposed to radioactive material while serving as a medic at a 600-bed military clinic in Basra in 2003. She was diagnosed with rare systemic sclerosis, which is slowly attacking her major organs . 'We found out about this treatment in Chicago in November. 'Since then, I've started to be dream a little and it's given me such a lift to think about going back into the Army - and that I might have had my last Christmas not working.' Mrs Brown believes she needs the immunotherapy treatment before the end of the year as her physical condition continues to decay. 'I have to raise the money quickly or I will miss the . timescale,” she said. 'You are supposed to have it done within four . years of diagnosis. I’m in my fourth year.' The stem cell treatment involves effectively wiping out her immune system and 'rebooting' it. She said: 'It’s not the army’s fault. I was just doing my job. I just want to raise the money and get the treatment.' If you wish to make a donation to Katrina's medical care, please click here.","Katrina Brown, 30, was exposed to radioactive material in Basra .

The vast majority of the $1 million reward offered in the manhunt for rogue ex-cop Christopher Dorner will go to a couple who he tied up in their Big Bear cabin, police said Tuesday. The Los Angeles Police Department posted a document on its website in which a panel of three judges detailed the payouts for the much-sought reward. They decided that about $800,000 will go to James and Karen Reynolds. Daniel McGowan, who found Dorner's burning truck in the Big Bear area where he eventually was discovered, will get $150,000, and $50,000 will go to tow truck driver R.L. McDaniel, who reported spotting Dorner at a gas station earlier in the manhunt. Windfall: Karen Reynolds, 57, and her husband, Jim Reynolds, 66, are set to receive $800,000 after they were tied up by Chris Dorner and called police when they freed themselves . The $1 million reward was announced by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa during Dorner's rampage in February. Dorner had vowed warfare on LAPD officers and their families for what he called an unfair firing. He killed four people, including two law enforcement officers, during his nearly one-week run from authorities that ended with his death on Feb. 12. A dozen parties came forward claiming they provided the key tip that ultimately led Dorner to hole up in a vacant mountain cabin where he apparently took his own life after a shootout with law enforcement. The reward was coordinated through more than 30 agencies or entities, including the FBI, the Los Angeles Dodgers and the University of Southern California - but details of the offer were never written down, so it lacked specifics. Murderer: Chris Dorner, a combat-trained disgraced LAPD cop, became enemy number one in Southern California after he killed two police officers and two civilians earlier this year . The uncertainty and competing legal claims have caused controversy in the months since the manhunt ended. Some entities that contributed money for the reward withdrew their pledges because Dorner wasn't captured or convicted. The judges' memorandum said in awarding the money, they decided the 'comparative value of the information provided and how directly it causally led to Dorner's capture.' The manhunt was underway Feb. 7 when McDaniel spotted Dorner at an AM/PM gas station in Corona. He was about to call police when he spotted an LAPD squad car and alerted the officers. 'As the officers interviewed Mr. McDaniel, Dorner's vehicle turned back ... and passed by the AM/PM en route to Interstate 15 northbound. Mr. McDaniel positively identified the truck,' and officers gave chase immediately, according to the document. That chase led to two shootouts between Dorner and law enforcement. One officer was injured in the first shootout, and one was killed and another was critically wounded in the second. Rick Heltebrake filed a lawsuit last week seeking the $1 million reward but did not submit a claim under the reward's process . Dorner then escaped 50 miles northeast . to Big Bear, but that wouldn't be known until the next breakthrough in . the investigation, the document said. McGowan, who works for the Snow Summit ski resort in Big Bear Lake, called authorities Feb. 7 after he spotted a burning truck on the side of a rarely used, unpaved fire route. He called authorities, who discovered the truck belonged to Dorner. That information initiated an intensive, focused search for Dorner, with hundreds of Southern California law enforcement officials descending on the Big Bear Lake area. Officers went door to door hunting for Dorner in the following days, but it wasn't until Feb. 12 that they received their next fruitful tip. Karen Reynolds called authorities to say Dorner had held her and her husband at gunpoint and tied them up before stealing their purple Nissan SUV to escape. Dead: Dorner shot and killed himself in a burning cabin in the mountains above Los Angeles during a standoff with police on February 12 . Karen Reynolds identified Dorner, gave the location of the cabin and the Nissan's description. Less than half an hour later, he was spotted by Fish and Wildlife wardens and a chase ensued. Dorner then crashed the Reynolds' vehicle and carjacked camp ranger Rick Heltebrake, and it was his vehicle that was tracked to a cabin where Dorner later died. A message seeking comment was left for James Reynolds on Tuesday night. Heltebrake filed a lawsuit last week seeking the $1 million reward but did not submit a claim under the reward's process, according to the document. To qualify for the reward, claimants had to have contacted law enforcement and provide information that furthered the investigation and led to capture. A message seeking comment was left for Heltebrake's lawyer. Dozens of groups and municipalities pledged money for the reward during the intense nine-day manhunt .","Dorner shot and killed himself in a burning cabin in the mountains above Los Angeles during a standoff with police on February 12 .

Hospitals that give false information about death rates will face unlimited fines under a package of new powers aimed at preventing another Mid Staffordshire-style health scandal. Ministers hope the new criminal offence will deter health chiefs from giving false or misleading mortality statistics as part of efforts to bring an end to a ‘cover-up culture’ in the NHS. Care minister Norman Lamb said the laws would be a legacy of the campaign fought by those who suffered the ‘horrors’ of failings at Stafford Hospital. Legislation published yesterday will also make it easier to sack managers or even shut down hospital services guilty of providing poor care. Until now, hospitals have only been able to be put into administration if they get into financial problems. The Care Bill also sets out plans for a cap on the amount people will have to pay for social care. A £72,000 limit on costs will be introduced in 2016 and the threshold for financial assistance will be extended from £23,250 to £118,000 at the same time. The legislation responds in part to Robert Francis's report on the failings at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust which found that as many as 1,200 patients might have died needlessly after they were ‘routinely neglected’. New powers will give the regulator Monitor the ability to intervene if the chief inspector of hospitals identifies problems with the quality of care. Monitor will also be able, for the first time, to put a foundation trust into administration on clinical grounds if the Care Quality Commission (CQC) requires it. Mr Lamb said: ‘The chief inspector of hospitals if he spots poor care will be able to serve a notice which will ultimately end up, if nothing is done to address it, with the potential for the board or individual members to be removed and ultimately for the hospital trust to be put into administration.’ The minister said those affected by the Mid Staffs scandal ‘suffered wholly unacceptably’. ‘In a way a legacy of their campaign is that we are introducing new rules that will be much more effective for the future,’ he said. Ministers hope the reforms will prevent a repeat of the care failings at Mid-Staffs where up to 1,200 people may have needlessly died . The Bill will give the CQC legal powers to design a new rating system for hospitals and care homes, similar to the way Ofsted measures the performance of schools. The new criminal offence will apply to all providers of NHS secondary care, including private firms, and will initially be restricted to the treatment of mortality data. One of the criticisms of the response to the Mid Staffs situation has been the lack of individual accountability, but the new criminal offence will only apply to organisations rather than the people responsible. However Mr Lamb said under employment law a prosecution would give ‘pretty powerful justification for dismissal’ of any individual identified as responsible for giving false or misleading data. He said the actions taken by the Government, including steps already announced such as a duty of candour and a ban on gagging clauses, were ‘bringing an end to the cover-up culture that has existed in some places in the past’. Asked whether the Government's measures would prevent another Mid Staffs, he said the package ‘achieves an awful lot in protecting us from anything like that happening again’.","Care minister Norman Lamb promises an end to NHS's 'cover-up culture'

A member of one of Britain’s grandest aristocratic families appeared in court yesterday accused of beating up his wife. Edward Alexander Somerset, a son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, denied six charges of assaulting his wife of 30 years. The 55-year-old wore a silver earring and looked gaunt and scruffy in black jeans, a navy blazer and a stained tie as he arrived at Bristol Crown Court. Court appearance: Lord Somerset, seen left outside Bristol Crown Court today, denied six counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against his wife Lady Caroline Somerset, seen right in 2006 . He and his wife, Lady Caroline, live . on the 52,000-acre Badminton Estate, which is owned by Lord Edward’s . father and is home to the Badminton Horse Trials. Yesterday Lord Edward pleaded not . guilty to six counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against . Lady Caroline, 54. His trial is expected to begin in December. Lord Somerset was told his trial was expected to take place in early December during a preliminary hearing at Bristol Crown Court. The father-of-two looked at the floor for much of the hearing but spoke clearly and loudly to deny all charges. The peer, a nephew of the eccentric Lord Bath, lives on a 17th century estate, home to the world-famous Badminton Horse Trials. Aristocrat: Millfield-educated Lord Somerset, 55, is a son of the Duke of Beaufort and a nephew of Lord Bath . Allegations: The couple, who live on the 52,000 acre Badminton estate in Gloucestershire, have been married for 30 years . Millfield-educated Lord Somerset, who has been married for 30 years, previously attended North Avon Magistrates Court in connection with the charges. It is thought several members of the aristocracy as well as staff from Badminton will be called as witnesses during the two week long trial. Lord Somerset and his wife live in Grade II-listed Essex House, dating from the early 18th Century, which stands at the village entrance to the Badminton estate. He is the third of four children of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, 85 year-old David Somerset, who is estimated to be worth £135million. His eldest brother Henry John Fitzroy, Marquess of Worcester, 60, is heir to the estate and title. His father remarried in 2000 after the death of his first wife and has been described by Tatler as one of 'the people who really matter'. Trial: Lord Somerset is seen with his wife Lady Caroline Somerset attending a fancy dress party in 1993 . They said the duke was an 'incredibly dashing' man who 'utterly worships his children'. The duke is listed 590th in the latest Sunday Times Rich List, which notes he stands to make £180,000 a year from a planned wind farm near Swansea. Judge Michael Longman adjourned the case and told Lord Somerset he will remain on unconditional bail until his next hearing - a plea and case management hearing on July 17.

A gas tanker truck exploded on a highway in the Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec killing at least 19 people and injuring three dozen, authorities said today. The Citizen Safety Department of Mexico State, which surrounds Mexico City, did not rule out the possibility the death toll could rise more as emergency workers continued sifting through the charred remains of vehicles and homes built near the highway on the northern edge of the metropolis. Residents pitched in to rescue people from the wreckage of crushed and burned cars and shattered homes. Television footage showed plumes of flame shooting out of homes in the pre-dawn darkness. Scroll down for video . Emergency services working next to destroyed homes and vehicles after a gas tanker truck exploded on a highway in the Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec . Authorities did not immediately report a cause for the explosion. 'We just pulled burned people, and put out the fire in the houses, but we don't really know what happened,' said Rogelio Martinez, a resident of the neighborhood where the crash occurred. Emergency personnel at the scene pulled dead victims from their homes, some apparently burned in their beds. An Associated Press journalist at the scene saw rescue workers take three bodies, covered with white sheets, from one home. A huge piece of the truck's gas tank was blown 50 yards by the force of the blast, landing atop the wall of a house and cars parked outside. Charred wreckage of cars littered the blast site. Firefighters and rescuers work amid the wreckage left by the blast of a gas tanker that exploded in Ecatepec, Mexico state .

'People are very shaken, above all because of the injuries and the large number of dead,' said Bedolla. 'I've spoken with the families of the victims, and they are just sobbing.' The explosion closed the highway between Mexico City and Pachuca for hours. The pre-dawn accident exposed two recurrent public safety issues in Mexico: extremely heavy trucks that are frequently involved in serious accidents, and the construction of improvised homes just feet away from major highways. Some of the cinder block homes hit by the massive explosion were just steps away from the busy, four-lane highway. Other homes were mere shacks, built of sheet tin. The blast killed and injured dozens, according to the Citizen Safety Department of Mexico State . Mexican trucks, often overloaded or unsafely operated, have been involved in a number of spectacular, deadly accidents in recent years. The truck involved in Tuesday's accident was a double tanker: one cab pulling two gas tanks. The driver was injured in the crash, and was under detention at a local hospital. One year ago, the Mexican government announced measures to tighten inspections and lower maximum allowed weights for freight trucks after protests over a string of deadly accidents involving double-trailer trucks. Mexico had allowed trucks to travel two-lane roads with loads of up to 80 metric tons and lengths exceeding 100 feet, compared to a U.S. limit of is 80,000 pounds (40 tons) on interstate highways. It subsequently reduced that limit by about 4.5 tons. In April 2012, a double-trailer truck on a two-lane road in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz lost its rear trailer, which slammed into a bus carrying farm workers, killing 43 people.","Mexico State authorities did not rule out the possibility the death toll could rise more .

An historic Chinese vase made for an 18th century emperor has sold at auction for £50,000 - but could have been worth ten times that value had a previous owner not drilled a hole in the bottom to turn it into a lamp. The centuries-old vase was made for the Chinese Emperor Qianlong, but its hugely important seal of authentication was destroyed when a two centimetre hole was drilled in its bottom to feed an electrical cable through. The former owner of the antique even customised it with fittings and a garish lampshade, giving it pride of place in his hallway. Cut price: Auctioneer Amy Brenan, left, carefully holds the £50,000 vase, right, that could have sold for up to £500,000 . But experts believe that if he hadn't have drilled the hole, then the 15 inch tall vase may have sold for up to £500,000. The vase sold instead for £47,800 when it was sold at Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, Dorset. The bottle vase dates from the 18th century is likely to have been made for the Imperial household. A relative of the unnamed owner bought it off a London-based dealers at the turn of the 20th century and converted it into a lamp years later. It was inherited by the last owner who has kept it ever since at his home on the Isle of Wight. Andrew Mulborough, a specialist in Asian art at Duke's, said he was invited to the property to inspect other antiques when he saw the vase out of the corner of his eye. He said: 'It was on a floor-standing cabinet in the hallway. I initially thought that it couldn't be original and asked the owner if I could have a closer look. Expensive: The valuable vase was commissioned for the Qianlong Emperor who ruled China in the 18th century . 'As soon as I touched it I knew it was a fabulous piece of Chinese porcelain. 'I was hoping to find an Imperial mark on the bottom of it but tragically there was a hole from where the mark would have been. 'My heart did sink and the joy of finding the vase was equalled to my disappointment. 'Given the sheer quality of the workmanship on the vase, which was top notch, it is highly likely there would have been an Imperial reign mark on it. 'These marks tell you during which reign it was made and also that it was made for the Imperial household. 'The owner told me it wasn't him who made the drill hole. He was a little disappointed but just said that was the way it was. 'I brought it back to Dorchester and very carefully removed the lamp fittings around the top of it.' The bottle vase was decorated with buddhistic lions in underglaze blue and red, a technically difficult process. Guy Schwinge, a partner at Duke's, added: 'The irony is that if the vase had not been drilled and turned into a lamp base, it could easily have fetched £100,000. 'If the Imperial reign mark was still intact, the vase would have sold for more than £500,000.' Ceramics from the Quinlong period are highly-sought after, especially among the newly rich Chinese who are buying back their lost heritage. Ruined: The two centimetre hole was drilled to allow an electrical cable to feed up into the vase and turn it into a table lamp . In 2010, a pair of Qianlong vases which were given to a couple as a wedding gift and kept on a bedroom shelf as ornaments fetched £500,000 at the same auction house. Later the same year a blue and white dragon vase from the same era, valued at just £10,000, sold for almost £5million at an auction in San Francisco. Earlier this year, another vase which was valued at £10,000 to £15,000 sold for almost £1million in Leyburn North Yorkshire. Emperor Qianlong . Emperor Qianlong was the sixth Emperor of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty and the fourth Qing Emperor to rule China proper. He reigned from October 1735 until February 1796 making him one of the country's longest serving emperors. Qianlong, whose name means 'lasting eminence', was also considered one of the most enlightened of the emperors. He was an enthusiastic patron of all forms of Chinese art and published catalogues of Royal collections which he expanded greatly. The Emperor wrote thousands of poems in beautiful calligraphy, was a talented painter and commissioned many magnificent temples and palaces. During his reign, Qianlong was determined to expand his empire and Tibet became a protectorate, Ili and Turkestan were conquered and Burma and the Nepalese Gurkas acknowledged Chinese suzerainty. In the last decade of his reign, delegating decisions to others led to an increase in corruption and inefficiency in government. He officially abdicated in favour of his son in 1796 so as not to rule longer than his grandfather, but ultimately reigned until his death two years later.

This is the moment an historic RAF fighter jet was transported to its new home by a Chinook helicopter. The Gloster Meteor T.7 was both the UK's first jet aircraft and the Allies' first operational jet fighter when it entered service in 1944. This 1949 aircraft has been located at Imjin Barracks in Gloucestershire - home to NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps for the last 13 years - since 1981. Scroll down for video . A RAF Chinock helicopter moves a historic Gloster Meteor T.7 jet to its new home at the Jet Age Museum which is based at Gloucestershire Airport in Staverton . But it was recently bought by the Gloucestershire Jet Age Museum in Staverton. So instead of transporting the jet via road, the RAF decided to make use of its Chinook fleet and fly the out-of-service aircraft to its new home. The 100ft long helicopter lifted the 4.8 ton jet before flying it 1.5 miles over the rooftops of Gloucestershire to its resting place. Major Chris Hyde, Allied Rapid Reaction Corps spokesperson, said: 'I can't think of anything more fitting than for Imjin's Meteor aircraft to 'fly' to its final destination. 'We're honoured that we have had the opportunity to host this splendid aircraft, one that has been part of Britain's and the Allies' treasured history.' Engineers started work on the Gloster Meteor in 1940 with the first Meteor flying in in 1943. Ready for lift-off: The RAF Chinock helicopter moves into place before the operation begins . The 1949 aircraft was moved the short distance from RAF Innsworth as the base has now closed and the Meteor's future was uncertain . The historic jet was recently purchased by the museum and is slated for restoration and inclusion in its exhibits . It was heavily reliant on a groundbreaking turbojet engine, which was developed by Sir Frank Whittle and his company, Power Jets Ltd. The jet commenced operations in July 1944 with 616 Squadron of the RAF. This particular plane, which was once flown by former MP Norman Tebbit, has a chequered history. It was involved in a number of minor flying accidents, some of which required return to the manufacturers for repair. The 100ft long helicopter lifted the 4.8 ton jet before flying it 1.5 miles over the rooftops of Gloucestershire to its resting place . The Chinook lifts the Gloster Meteor T.7 above Staverton Airport, in Gloucestershire . The Meteor will now join a growing collection of aircraft at the new museum . In 1957, it was delivered to the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment at Boscombe Down, where it performed a variety of flying and ground test roles before ending its flying life some 2,000 flight hours later in 1968. Officially 'struck off charge' in 1977, the aircraft was transported to RAF Innsworth in 1981, where it underwent a long term restoration. It was unveiled as the former HQ Personnel and Training Command 'gate guardian' in 1994 with the site later renamed Imjin Barracks after the Battle of Imjin in the Korean War. The aircraft will now undergo a new restoration before going on display at the museum at Gloucestershire Airport. A Gloster Meteor fighter aircraft. 3,947 were built and used by the RAF, as well as other nations such as Israel and Belgium . The Gloster Meteor saw early action in the Second World War and the Korean War . Maj Hyde added: 'The Meteor aircraft represents a very important link to Gloucestershire's military and industrial heritage. 'It embodies a period of rapid technological progress in the region that is still represented in the area today. 'In military terms, the Meteor defines an era where former adversaries forged military alliances that aided in the development and establishment of NATO, the ARRC's parent organisation.' Thousands of Meteors were built to serve in the RAF and other air forces and remained in use for several decades. They saw limited action World War Two.","Gloster Meteor T.7 was UK's first jet aircraft when it entered service .
