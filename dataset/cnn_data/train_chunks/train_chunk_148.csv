"(EW.com) -- Okay -- 35 million votes later and it is ovahhhhhh! After a two-hour ""grand finale"" packed with mostly clear cellophane (plus performances by Pitbull and One Direction), ""The X Factor"" has a season 2 champ! Was it Fifth Harmony, Tate Stevens, or Carly Rose Sonenclar who won the $5 million recording contract and free Pepsi injections for life? TATE STEVENS! The 37-year-old country man from Missouri has pulled it off! He's had a strong season of honest, consistent performances. Tate thanked the man upstairs (Santa? Is he real?) first and foremost, and then country music fans for helping him achieve his dream of quitting his day job. ""You know what? Congrats to you,"" Tate's mentor L.A. Reid told Tate, a man he had never seen before in his life. This was a well-deserved win. I still don't find Tate that spectacular, but let's be honest -- it's hard to seem glamorous when you're sharing the stage with break-dancing toy soldiers and big-ass sculptures of reindeer. (""The X Factor"" is so bad at most things, but in the cat-uh-gry of ""going all out for Christmas,"" it is a true five-million-dollar winner. That is also how much they spent on sets tonight.) Indeed, the three final acts got to indulge in some severe HOLIDAY BLOWOUT performances that were tons of fun while also being entirely 1-800-TOO-MUCH. For ""Please Come Home For Christmas,"" Tate maneuvered his way around four sparkly, human-sized breast cancer awareness ribbons wearing angel wings, not to mention those deer sculptures. Twas a vision! At one point during the epic season-long glare-off between the judges and the hosts, Simon coyly refused to reveal the dirty little metaphor he'd just come up with in his head, and Mario Lopez delivered what will surely be the greatest non sequitur of his life: ""I wanna know what a dog laying an egg sounds like, but that's for another day."" Huh. You guys ready for some crazy hats?! EW: See all 'X Factor' recaps . Fifth Harmony -- excuse me, #5HSantasHelpers -- took on a classic Christmas song as well, but what's important here is their fastidiously chosen headwear. The wardrobe department (or possibly Camila, who will one day rule us all) decided to make Camilla's GIANT HAIR BOWS her ""signature thing,"" so all the others got to wear weird things too so as not to feel left out. I'll rank them in order of my preference: 1. That bow, duh. 2) Normani's white mink hat and matching shrug, 3) Lauren's fascinator with tons of netting, 4) Ally's parasol, and 5) Dinah Janes miserable ""a red bird just died in this show"" top hat. All were remarkable in their own ways, though, just like the members of Fifth Harmony! Awww. I wanted them to win. They'll at least get to make a record. Carly actually disappointed with her cover of ""All I Want for Christmas Is You,"" suggesting maybe she can't really handle upbeat tunes, performance-wise. She looked frazzled and lost onstage, vying for attention with the breakdancing toy soldiers and BILLIONS OF FALLING PRESENTS in the giant screens behind her. I've never heard her voice waver like that. Weird! I also spent most of this wacky performance trying to figure out if Carly was wearing footed pajamas or boots. Few things infuriate me more than matching boots and pants. The whole point of wearing boots is that they should be set apart and admired by all! One Direction dropped by to perform their ritual duty of reminding everyone they were once associated with ""The X Factor."" Throughout ""Mr. Worldwide"" (ugh enough with that) Pitbull's performance of ""Don't Stop the Party"" and then, randomly, ""Take On Me,"" I began to involuntarily un-focus my eyes. It turns out that when viewed as a Magic Eye poster, Pitbull and those 25 backup Slinkys of his looked like Howie Mandel and his Deal or No Deal human props. Once I imagined it, I could not stop seeing it! Also, I had to just Google the title of Howie Mandel's former game show and it took an embarrassing amount of time. Like, double-digit seconds. The worst. What else? That red carpet abomination at the top of the show was laughably awful, but at least it was quick. We saw Simon as a Grinch (his face looks better in neon green), an invigorating clip show of Simon's long-running lifeless tiff with Demi Lovato, and Britney looking horrified in the corner of the screen during a montage of her other horrified faces. My favorite filler segment, of course, was the mashup of everyone's favorite sugarplum fairy L.A. Reid's incredible seated dance moves. ""I'll tell you what -- you were like a conductor!"" Mario marveled after reliving some of L.A.'s sweet moves. ""I am a conductor,"" L.A. reminded him. No sense of humor. Ever. ""Literally and figuratively, right there!"" continued Mario with some of his most impressive vocabulary to date. I'm glad they got all of that settled. Ate up a solid two minutes. That's pretty much it! Are you happy with the winner? Were you surprised it wasn't Carly? Which of Khlomeister's costumes was your (least) fave: Green lace gift pouch, inexplicable black wetsuit, or pink and gold Christmas ribbon? Discuss! See original story at EW.com.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The son of the former shah of Iran called Monday for solidarity against Iran's Islamic regime, warning that the democratic movement born out of the election crisis might not succeed without international support. Reza Shah Pahlavi has lived in exile since 1979, when his father was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution. ""The moment of truth has arrived,"" Reza Shah Pahlavi said at Washington's National Press Club. ""The people of Iran need to know who stands with them."" Pahlavi has lived in exile since 1979, when his father, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution. Under the shah's regime, Iran saw nationalization of its oil and a strong movement toward modernization. Still, his secular programs and recognition of Israel cost him the support of the country's Shiite clergy, sparking clashes with the religious right and others who resented his pro-West views. The son now lives in the United States with his family, where he spends much of his time talking about the Islamic regime in Iran. During his remarks, he broke into tears when he spoke of ""bullets piercing our beloved Neda,"" a woman killed Saturday by Iranian police at a protest in Tehran, whose death has become a rallying cry among demonstrators in Iran.  Watch one woman's account of clashes with security forces » . The Iranian regime, he said, was a ""sinking Titanic"" that might not survive the demands for democracy and human rights reverberating through the country.  Watch Pahlavi call vote ""fraud"" » . Citing anecdotes from people inside the Iranian establishment, Pahlavi said he had heard that security forces have begun to distance themselves from the regime. ""It has already started,"" he said, citing reports that members of the security forces have gone home after their shifts ended and changed into plain clothes to join the protesters. ""Many, many elements within the security forces, within the Revolutionary Guard, are showing discontent,"" Pahlavi said. ""There is an amazing reflection that is happening. ... This is a movement that has blown out of proportion."" Pahlavi praised the statements and tone of President Obama, saying that any outside attempt to interfere in Iran's internal affairs ""will give the tyrants the excuse they need to paper over their own differences and target every man struggling for freedom as a foreign agent."" But he said there was a difference between interfering in a country's sovereign affairs and standing for principles of human rights and democracy. ""We welcome that. This is effective. It is important,"" he said. ""This is precisely what Iranians at home demand world leaders, particularly someone like President Obama, who after all his entire message of hope and change and affirmative action ... was a big inspiration to many."" But, he added, Obama and other world leaders must be prepared to change their tactics if the violence against protesters gets much worse. ""The question is, what will the world governments do this time?"" he asked. ""Are we going to have Tiananmen Square revisited? Or is [it] going to be this time different?""","Reza Shah Pahlavi: Democratic movement needs international support to succeed .

"(CNN) -- A NATO delegation arrived Tuesday in southeastern Turkey to survey the Turkish-Syrian border for the possible deployment of Patriot anti-aircraft missile batteries, the semi-official Anadolu news agency reported. Turkey has turned against its former ally, asking fellow NATO members last week for the missiles to bolster its air defenses because of several Turkish deaths blamed on Syrian forces. A delegation of Turkish and NATO officials was scheduled to do a site survey to determine where to deploy the batteries, the Turkish military said. ""The deployment of the Air and Missile Defense System is a precaution for defensive purposes for possible air and missile threats from Syria, and is not for the establishment of a 'no-fly' zone or for offensive maneuvers,"" according to a Turkish military statement. Strike from Syrian plane reported near border with Turkey . ""The area of deployment for the Air and Missile Defense System, the quantity of the system, the number of foreign personnel that will come into our country and the time of the deployment will be determined after the site survey."" The fact that Syrian warplanes and helicopters have bombed targets within a few hundred meters of Turkey at least three times in the past month raises the question of whether the NATO military alliance could be sucked into the grinding Syrian civil war. Tensions exploded between Syria and Turkey last summer, when Syrian anti-aircraft fire brought down a Turkish military reconnaissance jet, killing its two crew members. Turkey announced it was changing its rules of engagement with Syria. In October, the Turkish government won authorization in parliament for possible cross-border military incursions into Syria after Syrian mortar fire killed five civilians in the Turkish border town of Akcakale. Turkish and Syrian military forces have also engaged in cross-border artillery duels since the Akcakale incident. The Syrian government has lambasted Turkey, saying it ""supports the armed terrorist groups in cooperation with some Gulf countries to threaten Syria's stability and security."" Meanwhile, a Russian diplomat reportedly expressed concern over the possibility of deploying the missile system. Russia is a long-standing ally of Syria. ""We don't like this idea because we see hidden threats in it,"" said Russian First Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Denisov, according to the state-run Itar-Tass news agency. ""All the answers we have been receiving are reduced to soothing statements,"" he said. ""But as far as military political problems are concerned, we want clear and exhaustive explanations: where (a threat comes from), for what purposes, for what term and why."" Summing up, Denisov reportedly said: ""We believe that the decision (to deploy missiles) is creating more problems than it might solve."" Opposition says shelling kills 10 children in Syria . Syrian opposition: Barrel bombs rain from the sky . Back on the ground in Syria, ""fierce aerial shelling"" bombarded areas in the northwestern part of the country Tuesday, dissidents said. Government forces dropped more than 10 barrel bombs on the Aleppo province city of Deir Hafer, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Over the past several months, dissidents have reported aircraft dropping barrels full of explosives, nails and fuel onto civilian areas. At least 131 people were killed across Syria on Tuesday, including 48 in Damascus and its suburbs, the LCC said. Nationwide, the group said five women and 12 children were among the dead. Syrian state-run TV reported the destruction of a ""terrorist training camp"" in Kafr Takharim, Idlib. In a separate incident in the province, it said government forces ""clashed with al Qaeda terrorists after they attempted to attack a regime checkpoint in the vicinity of Maaret Al-Nouman, killing a large number of these terrorists."" The government also said it destroyed a hideout used by the al Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, which has claimed responsibility for suicide attacks in Syria. Rights group: Evidence shows cluster bombs killed children . An attack that killed at least 10 children at a playground this week was the result of a cluster bomb strike, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday, citing witnesses and video footage. The group called for ""all governments"" to condemn Syria's use of cluster bombs, which are particularly vicious because they explode in the air and send dozens or hundreds of smaller bombs over an area the size of a football field, according to Human Rights Watch. More than 70 countries have signed a treaty banning the use of cluster bombs, but Syria is not among them. In October, the Syrian government said it had not used cluster bombs during the current conflict. ""It's going to new lows that these banned weapons are being used and civilians and children are being killed,"" said Kimberly Brown, a conflict adviser with Save the Children. The organization is working with refugees in countries around Syria, including Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon. How did the Syrian crisis begin? What started as security forces cracking down on mostly nonviolent protesters has spiraled into a civil war between pro-government forces and the rebels, including the Free Syrian Army. About 40,000 civilians have been killed since the first protests 20 months ago against President Bashar al-Assad's government, according to the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. And more than 380,000 Syrian refugees have fled to neighboring countries, creating humanitarian challenges abroad. The Syrian government routinely refers to its battle against ""terrorists,"" the term it uses for rebel fighters and extremist elements in the country. CNN cannot confirm claims by the government or the opposition because of government restrictions that prevent journalists from reporting freely within Syria. CNN's Ivan Watson, Arwa Damon, Holly Yan, Saad Abedine, Christine Theodorou, Hamdi Alkhshali and Gul Tuysuz contributed to this report.","NEW: Russian official blasts idea, saying it's ""creating more problems than it might solve""

"Norman, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Six o'clock on a Sunday morning and I'm dragging myself out of bed to drive to Norman, Oklahoma, of all places. I grab my camera gear and overnight bag packed with extra underwear, then sneak out of my Dallas-area home for a day that promises to push my adrenaline to new levels. Two-and-a-half hours later, I pull into an ordinary-looking Oklahoma neighborhood. Weird, there's a roundabout in the middle of this residential street? Wait, that's it! The house with five cars in front, many of which have tornado logos emblazoned on the side. The doorbell button is busted, so I knock. Almost immediately, Reed Timmer, one of the stars of the Discovery Channel's ""Storm Chasers"" series, welcomes me into his home. Without going into too much gory detail, let's just say there's no doubt this place is a dude's hangout. Make that multiple dudes. Reed's cool. We talk about where we'll head today to try to catch a tornado up close. He introduces me to Gizmo, their Yorkie. John Hallen and Jeff Shardell, two chasers I've never met but will know much better by the end of our adventure, arrive with McDonald's breakfast. A few more chasers join us, and the conversation turns to whether we should pack for an overnight chase. Gizmo races through the doggie door to the backyard where the six of us gather to toss a Nerf football and watch low-level clouds stream by in the Oklahoma gusts. Those clouds are a sign that moisture is streaming in, which is good for tornado formation. Minutes later, we reach a collective decision to pack for an overnighter. Suddenly, as if we're a team of firefighters, everyone grabs their gear and piles into two chase vehicles. I jump into the back seat of a Mercury land-yacht. Jeff is driving, with Reed riding shotgun. John's in the back seat behind Jeff. And Terra, John's giant Schnauzer, claims the middle seat between us. Terra apparently loves tornadoes, and she clocked 20,000 miles chasing with John last year. Departure time: about 10:30 a.m. Our target: Topeka, Kansas. Expected tornado: 6:00 p.m. Damn! How do they know when and where a tornado will strike? They toss around various names of computer weather models and ""z"" times as they each make their case for when and where to go. It's all foreign to me. I just hope they're right. See inside a Tornado Intercept Vehicle . About an hour up the road, John introduces me to his homemade energy drink. It's a concoction of vegetables and Habanero sauce that he bottles and freezes for the trip. Reed is pumped when he sees the cranberry colored juice. Reed takes a drink, and John hands the bottle to me. As a new dad with a son in day care, I immediately think about catching a cold from the shared bottle. Then I remember I'm on this trip to catch a tornado. If we screw this up, a cold will be the least of my worries. So, I take a swig. It tastes like vegetables. Hot vegetables! Why didn't I bring a bottle of water? After butt-numbing hours of driving, we eventually end up at a Burger King in Ottawa, Kansas, about an hour southeast of Topeka. It's nearing 5:00 p.m., but so far, there's nothing showing on radar. Will today be a bust? We'll know in another hour or two. After grabbing dinner, talk turns toward Iowa, where storms have fired up. Should we go there? This is often the dilemma storm chasers face. While we're waiting for something to happen, a TV crew from nearby Kansas City grabs Reed for a quick interview. Minutes later, a girl who's studying meteorology in high school stops by to talk with Reed about the jet stream and how she wants to chase storms. Soon afterward, a woman drives up and asks if she should be worried that we're in her town. Finally, the latest radar data come in, and the team spots a storm about an hour north that looks promising. Like a scene from the movie ""Twister,"" we quickly dispense with the chit chat, load the dog into the backseat and race towards the developing storm near Perry, Kansas. The adrenaline begins to build as Reed, Jeff and John excitedly examine the radar loop and point to the sky towards the left edge of the storm clouds. They don't look ominous at first. But, as we drive further into the storm, the clouds take on a decidedly serious color. Winds sweep up dust devils as we pass farms along the two-lane highway. We stop at three different locations under the rotating heart of the storm, hoping that a funnel will descend. Cameras are rolling as winds gust and hail begins to fall. But, there's no funnel. We jump back into the car and head east, trying to stay in front of this beast that's moving at 50 mph. Through the rear window, John spots what looks like a ""gustnado."" Wind gusts from a storm sometimes spin and create what looks like a small tornado, but a gustnado isn't directly connected to any rotation above. We pull over to the side of the road as the dust cloud behind us builds. ""Uh, it's coming right for us"" I utter calmly, as it grows larger and closer. Like a NASCAR pro, Jeff loops the car around to the opposite side of the highway. We grab our cameras and spring into action to film this amazing event. It soon becomes clear this isn't a gustnado, but an actual tornado. Share your stories, photos and videos of severe weather . About 50 yards from where we're standing, this monster cloud of dust begins to tighten as it spins. You can see a tube of dust reaching into the sky. It moves almost gracefully through a field as we look on in awe. We can't feel any wind at first. Then, suddenly in a deafening roar, strong winds begin to push us from behind like a crowd at a ball game. It's as if the tornado is taking a huge breath while it sucks in the air it needs to survive. After the tornado passes, we pile into the car and race to get ahead. As we continue our pursuit, we see leaves, grass and other small debris floating through the air. We drive a few miles only realize the tornado has vanished. That is it. After hours of driving hundreds of miles, this incredible display of nature's violent side is over in a matter of seconds. Still, the trip is a huge success. That single storm was the only storm in the U.S. that produced a tornado that day, and we were in exactly the right spot to see it. The tornado touched down only a few miles from our target location of Topeka within an hour of our target time. While meteorologists can't predict with any certainty when or where a tornado is going to form, this chase showed that they are definitely making progress. After our euphoria and adrenaline subside, we head towards nearby Kansas City, Missouri, to watch the storm sweep through. Just as the lightning intensifies and the winds begin to gust, 2-inch hail stones began to fall. Terra may love tornadoes, but she's no fan of hail. She begins barking fiercely as Reed, Jeff and I try to film the hail in the headlights. Fortunately, there are no injuries or serious damage to our team. We wrap up our chase with a late night visit to Applebee's for dinner. When the new weather models show a lower probability of tornadoes the next day, we decide to head back to Norman. During the late night drive, I work in the backseat to edit the incredible video. Eventually, the long day catches up to Jeff, Terra and me. As I drift off to sleep, Jeff crashes in the backseat, while Terra sleeps with her head in my lap. My first chase is already filling my mind with dreams of the power of nature in Tornado Alley.","CNN's Aaron Brodie chases tornado with Reed Timmer of ""Storm Chasers""

"Washington (CNN) -- A law enforcement official confirms members of the Westboro Baptist Church, known for its controversial practice of picketing military funerals, participated in training for law enforcement officials at Quantico Marine Base in Virginia. The sessions were discontinued this spring after Tom Browne, assistant director for the FBI, voiced strong opposition to bringing the group to a military facility. Members of Westboro were ""respectful"" when they were on the base and did not cause any disruption, according to the official. He adds, ""It wasn't the purpose to give them another outlet to vent their views. It was more academic."" The story about staff training sessions between the FBI and Westboro Baptist Church members was first reported by NPR News on Wednesday. Other controversial groups, including the Ku Klux Klan, have taken part in similar training sessions. The purpose, according to the official, is ""to expose law enforcement to these groups, see what they are about, and understand their perspective."" In addition, the official says, the groups have a chance to hear law enforcement's point of view in a classroom setting. ""We are not endorsing these groups at all,"" said the official. ""The reality is there are groups out there who are making presence known who the police have to encounter."" ""They still have First Amendment protections just like anyone else,"" the official added, but police may have to mitigate a situation where there is a potential for violence. The official maintained that understanding who these groups are and what they believe can help law enforcement. ""It is an effort to engage in open dialogue in a setting that is more academic, rather than having to do it on a street in a peacekeeping kind of scenario."" FBI and law enforcement officials participated in three sessions at Quantico between 2008 and spring of 2011. There was a fourth session at a facility in Manassas, Virginia, before a halt was called to Westboro's involvement.","Westboro members participated in training sessions with the FBI .

"Washington (CNN) -- A toy that absorbs water and can expand to 400 times its original size has been voluntarily recalled after a report that a baby ingested one and needed surgery to remove it, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday. The CPSC said the marble-size toy can be swallowed, and once inside the stomach, it can expand and cause blockage in the small intestine. The toys do not show up on an x-ray and require surgery to be removed, according to the commission. Nearly 95,000 Water Balz (round shape), Growing Skulls (skull shape), H2O Orbs ""Despicable Me"" (round shape) and Fabulous Flowers (flower shape) toys were sold in stores in the United States and Canada from 2010 to November 2012. An 8-month-old Texas girl reportedly ingested a Water Balz last year and underwent surgery to remove the toy. The packaging states the toy ""Grows to the Size of a Racquetball!"" The CPSC and Health Canada, along with the importer DuneCraft Inc., based in Cleveland, announced the voluntary recall on Monday. The toys, manufactured in China and the United States, were sold in packages of six in green, yellow, red, blue and black. Consumers are urged to stop using the recalled product immediately.

"(CNN) -- The gunman in last week's Oregon mall shooting acted ""weird"" and had talked about moving and selling his possessions, his roommate said. In court documents released Monday, those and other details drew a rough sketch of the shooter, identified as 22-year-old Jacob Tyler Roberts. Investigators say he opened fire at the Clackamas Town Center mall outside Portland, killing two people and wounding a third, before taking his own life. Oregon gunman on Facebook: 'I have lived one crazy life' Hours after the deadly rampage, the roommate called a tip line and told a detective he thought Roberts might be responsible. The roommate said he once found a box of AR-15 ammunition at the house. He told the detective Roberts had acted ""weird"" recently and talked about moving to Hawaii and selling his belongings on Craigslist. Roberts, in fact, had sold some things there, said the roommate. The documents also showed the weapon used in last Tuesday's shooting, a Stag Arms brand AR-15 style rifle, was legally purchased by a friend of Roberts. The night before the shooting, Roberts spent time with that friend, telling him he needed to get out town and needed a gun. When the friend awoke the next day, his rifle and Roberts were missing, he told a detective. Authorities have offered few other details about Roberts, the man they say shot 54-year-old Cindy Ann Yuille and 45-year-old Steven Mathew Forsyth. Both died of single gunshot wounds. Shooting victims remembered . Roberts also shot Kristina Shevchenko, police say. The 15-year-old suffered a collapsed right lung and injuries to her liver after being shot in the chest, a doctor told reporters last week. She was listed in fair condition early Monday, up from serious, at Oregon Health & Science University Hospital in Portland. Shoppers return to Oregon mall after shooting .

"New York (CNN) -- Fashion models have often been accused of being beautiful, but plastic. On one block in the heart of Manhattan, they really are. A stretch of Broadway has been transformed into a ""Sidewalk Catwalk"" -- 32 life-sized synthetic models on pedestals seeming to strut their stuff through New York City's fashion district. From Hilfiger to Von Furstenberg, the latest trends and brand image from 32 designers are on display. ""What makes this experience really fantastic is all these fashions are really meant to make a statement about why this area is so important, why this area has to be zoned and [to] keep it for fashion,"" Geoffry Gertz, a professor of fashion at Parsons School of Design, said. Historically, New York fashion designers manufactured and produced their product in the city. In recent years, Gertz said about 90 percent of fashion goods production has been shipped overseas, where labor and materials are less expensive to mass produce. ""I think it's key to all of this, is how to inspire the youth? How do we protect an industry where they can come and buy fabric, buy trim, buy threads, find a factory to make it all?"" said the fashion professor. The show was created by the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, and is aimed at showing tourists and New Yorkers the historical and artistic representation of the industry. ""It's just beautiful to see, to walk down Broadway and see all these things,"" said Ben Issacs, who works near the display. ""I hope to see a lot more of these beautiful things in the future."" ""The way the designers present themselves to the consumer is in retail -- we wanted to give them a way to present themselves creatively as artists,"" said Barbara Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center Business Improvement District . ""Giving them a public place for art is a way to do that, rather than presenting themselves commercially."" Designers protected the dummies from the elements by wrapping the mannequins in materials. They face extreme heat in the summer in the city and prodding and poking tourists, though on one weekday morning, the models stood quietly while tourists and locals sat reading and eating nearby. To build the models, designers used metals, sequins, glass, paint, hemp and stone -- and in the case of designer Yeohle Teng, brick and cement to enclose a mannequin with a wall. ""The mannequins are so different from each other, there's no main theme at all, and the people are just as diverse as the mannequins,"" Randall said. Designs ranged from Victor Alfaro's mannequin, draped in tailored parts of a real parachute, to Diane von Furstenberg's mannequin covered in leopard print and the personally painted insignia ""love is life,"" to Betsy Johnson's streetwalking pink and platinum doll drawn in black and covered in sunflowers. Tommy Hilfiger recreated the American flag much as Jimi Hendrix recreated the national anthem at Woodstock in '69, with a mannequin walking through a torn waving plastic American flag. Similar to Los Angeles's street angels, and New York City's former cows and bulls statues, the mannequins are being auctioned off to private donors. These mannequins have been posted on eBay, with starting bids of $500 -- all proceeds will go toward the Material for the Arts organization -- the biggest contributor of materials to public schools and charities in New York City. Randall said she has received offers from one individual donor who may purchase a series of mannequins, and put them on private display in another city. The unique fashion show runs until September 3, on Broadway between Times Square and Herald Square. CNN's Gabriella Casanas and Richard Roth contributed to this report .","""Sidewalk Catalk"" is a unique display of 32 synthetic models in New York's fashion district .

Dawn Nguyen of Rochester, New York, faces charges over allegedly lying when she purchased an AR-15 rifle -- a .223-caliber weapon -- and 12-gauge shotgun that the gunman had with him during the attack. Authorities say she told the gun dealer that she planned to be the owner of the weapons, but had instead purchased them on June 7, 2010,for gunman William Spengler. ""It is absolutely against federal law to lie relating to the acquisition of firearms,"" said Hochul, who said Spengler indicated in a suicide note that he had gotten the weapons from the neighbor. Dispatcher told firefighter: 'Brother, hang tight' Nguyen, 24, was ""turned ... over to ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) agents to be processed at the federal level, and arraigned by a federal magistrate this afternoon,"" according to state police Investigator James Newell. Spengler, 62 -- who had been convicted of killing his grandmother decades ago -- used the same type of weapon employed in the recent assault on Sandy Hook Elementary School, which left 26 people dead, including 20 children. As a convicted felon, Spengler was not allowed to legally possess weapons. Autopsy shows suspect died of self-inflicted wound . ""He was equipped to go to war,"" Webster Police Chief Gerald Pickering said. The gunman was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound hours later. In his possession were three firearms, including two .223-caliber Bushmaster rifles and a Mossberg 12-gauge shotgun. While Nguyen's charges involve two weapons, authorities indicated the possibility of additional charges regarding the third weapon. Nguyen's attorney was not immediately available for comment. If convicted, she could face up to 10 years in jail and $250,000 fine.

"(CNN) -- Nine-man Chelsea lost 3-2 to Manchester United in a pulsating and controversial top-of-the-table English Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge Sunday. It was the first league defeat of the season for the Blues, who hold a slender one point lead in the standings after nine games over second-placed United and defending champions Manchester City. The score was tied at 2-2 just after the hour mark when Branislav Ivanovic was shown a straight red for pulling down Ashley Young after he was played through by Robin van Persie. There could be few arguments with referee Mark Clattenburg's decision but six minutes later Fernando Torres was shown his second yellow card in highly controversial circumstances. He pushed the ball through the legs of United defender Jonny Evans but went down spectacularly as he went past him -- replays indicated he had been clipped by the Northern Irishman. Clattenburg ruled it was a deliberate dive and the Spain international trudged off, his manager Roberto Di Matteo shaking his head in disagreement. Soon afterwards, United boss Alex Ferguson was seen remonstrating with his Chelsea counterpart, but his anger turned to joy when his second half substitute Javier Hernandez reacted quickly to turn home a Rafael cross shot. To add to Chelsea's sense of injustice, television replays appeared to indicate the Mexican had come back from an offside position to score the winner. Later Sunday, Chelsea said they had made a formal complaint against referee Clattenburg, accusing him of using ""inappropriate language"" to two of their players. A club spokesman said: ""We have lodged a complaint to the Premier League match delegate with regards to inappropriate language used by the referee and directed to two of our players in two separate incidents in today's match."" The visitors had been two goals ahead inside 12 minutes as Van Persie's early shot rebounded off a post to hit David Luiz and dribble over the line. Dutchman Van Persie then connected with an Antonio Valencia cross to make it 2-0. But back came the leaders with Juan Mata stroking home a free kick just before the half time break. They came out in inspired form at the start of the second half and Oscar picked out fellow Brazilian Ramires to head the equalizer. Chelsea looked the more likely side to go on to take three points before the red cards changed the course of the match. Ferguson believed Torres was at fault for his own sending off. ""Did he intend to dive? I thought he went down,"" he told Sky Sports. ""I think Jonny may have just caught him a little bit but he can either carry on running -- which he could have done -- but he chose to go down. ""He could have carried on and scored so I cannot understand it. It's his own fault."" In the early kick off, Liverpool had led Everton 2-0 in the Merseyside derby before the home side hit back to salvage a draw. Uruguay international Luis Suarez was at the center of the action, his early shot deflecting off Leighton Baines to produce the opening goal. His celebration raised eyebrows as he ran and dived full-length in front of Everton manager David Moyes in response to his remarks about him earlier in the week. Suarez then headed home Steven Gerrard's free kick to put Liverpool in command but the home side were quick to respond. Leon Osman and Steven Naismith were on the score sheet to stun Brendan Rogers' men. Suarez thought he had scored the winner in injury time as he lashed his shot high into the net, but it was controversially ruled out for offside. Tottenham Hotspur moved into fourth place in the standings with a 2-1 win at struggling Southampton with Gareth Bale, returning to his old side, putting the visitors ahead after 15 minutes. Clint Dempsey added the second but Southampton hit back after the break through a Jay Rodriguez goal. Papiss Cisse hit an injury time winner for Newcastle as they beat West Bromwich Albion 2-1 in the day's other match in the EPL.","Manchester United beat Chelsea 3-2 at Stamford Bridge .

"(CNN) -- Two cosmonauts and an American astronaut were on their way back to Earth from the International Space Station Saturday morning after engineers used jumper cables to fix a glitch that delayed their departure, NASA said. The trio undocked from the space station in a Russian Soyuz spacecraft at 10:02 p.m. ET, NASA said. They are scheduled to land in Kazakhstan on Saturday morning after spending 176 days in space and 174 aboard the station. An undocking glitch earlier had delayed the departure of Cmdr. Alexander Skvortsov and flight engineers Mikhail Kornienko and Tracy Caldwell Dyson. NASA said the opening hooks and latches on the docking port would not release. To resolve the problem, flight engineer Fyodor Yurchikhin installed jumper cables to a failed sensor Friday, allowing the hooks to open. According to NASA, a Soyuz space capsule took the first crew to the orbiting laboratory in November 2000. After the February 2003 Columbia accident, the Soyuz became the means of transportation for crew members going to or returning from the International Space Station.

"(CNN) -- By a substantial margin, the Senate on Friday passed an extension of a controversial overseas wiretapping program, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The law has already been reauthorized by the House, and President Obama is expected to sign it. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, the law, know by its acronynm FISA, has helped authorities prevent terrorist plots. ""In the past four years, there have been one hundred arrests to prevent something from happening in the United States,"" Feinstein said. ""Some of these plots have been thwarted because of this program. I think it is a vital program."" But critics say the law gives intelligence agencies wide latitude in carrying out surveillance, under oversight by a special FISA court whose proceedings are not public. ""It's something with enormous potential for abuse,"" said Julian Sanchez, with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""The FISA Amendments Act authorizes what the Fourth Amendment was written to prevent, which is to say, general warrants -- blank checks for surveillance."" In 2005, a national debate erupted when the Terrorist Surveillance Program authorized by President George W. Bush was revealed in the media. Under that program, begun shortly after the 9/11 attacks, intelligence agencies could spy on communications between U.S. residents and people overseas without a warrant, if it was believed one of the parties was linked to terrorism. The FISA law passed in 2008 required officials to obtain a warrant to spy on any American -- including, for the first time, Americans who are abroad. The law also established FISA as the exclusive means for authorizing electronic surveillance. Privacy advocates say if a foreigner overseas is being wiretapped, which does not require a warrant, an American communicating with that person could still have their communications with that foreigner monitored. But defenders say the law contains provisions to protect privacy and prevent abuse, including a prohibition on spying on Americans except with a warrant. The National Security Agency, the country's primary surveillance agency, told CNN in a statement: ""One of the biggest misconceptions about NSA is that we are unlawfully listening in on, or reading e-mails of, U.S. citizens. This is simply not the case. NSA is unwavering in its respect for U.S. laws and Americans' civil liberties."" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, proposed an amendment requiring more disclosure. ""I think we ought to know, generally, how many Americans are being swept up under the legislation,"" he said during Thursday's debate on the Senate floor. But defenders of the law say, the effectiveness of espionage programs depends on a level of secrecy. ""It's very hard to have covert and clandestine intelligence-gathering, if it's not secret,"" said Clifford May, an advocate of national security with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. Without reauthorization, the law was scheduled to expire Monday, at the end of 2012.","The law has helped authorities prevent terrorist plots, says a senator .

"(CNN) -- He may have knocked out eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao during their recent bout in Las Vegas but if Juan Manuel Marquez wants a fifth fight against the legendary Filipino he'll need to get permission from his wife. The Mexican stunned the world of boxing by knocking out Pacquiao in the sixth round of their welterweight contest earlier in December. It was the first time the 39-year-old has claimed victory in four fights against Pacquiao, who many pundits regard to be the finest pound-for-pound fighter the sport has ever seen. But with fans clamoring for a fifth bout, Marquez says the only way it will become a reality is if his wife allows him to renege on his promise to retire whatever the outcome of the fourth. ""I made a promise and I know that promises are debts,"" Márquez said in an interview with CNN en Español. ""I don't see a case to fight again but logically he wants a chance,"" he added of talk that he and Pacquiao could square off for a fifth time. Marquez's emphatic victory offered the Mexican some redemption after he failed to win any of the first three fights against Pacquiao. Their first encounter in May 2004 ended in a draw, while the Filipino took a points victory at the conclusion of their rematch four years later. But their third clash in November 2011 ended in controversy when Pacquiao was awarded victory in a marginal points decision. The crowd booed as the judges' verdict was read out and Marquez claimed he should have been declared the victor. That disappointment made his knockout of Pacquiao, who lay motionless for several minutes after being hit with the decisive blow, even sweeter for the veteran. ""It was a point in my favor because the other fights have ended in controversy but for me this was a clear success,"" Marquez said. ""For me it was a perfect shot -- I think the knockout has been one of the best in a while."" Pacquiao is one of the sport's greats, winning titles at eight different weight divisions. In recent years he's combined his exploits in the ring with a political career in the Phillipines. His defeat left the country devastated, especially in the aftermath of a super typhoon that devastated parts of the country days before the fight. Pacquiao's wife was also seen in tears and has since pleaded with her husband to quit. Marquez said he shared her pain having watched a tape of the fight. ""It happened to him now and it could have been me. We are both exposed to this and it made me very sad that Manny Pacquiao's wife was crying,"" Marquez added. Pacquiao has now lost two fights in a row after his defeat to American Timothy Bradley in June, though he did make a purse of around $25 million for the fourth installment of his battle with Marquez. Marquez dedicated his victory to his family, coaching staff, and especially to the president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto. ""I want to dedicate this fight to the new president of Mexico, but with the condition that he handles his duties well,"" Marquez said. The 39-year-old had been criticized in some quarters, including on social networking sites, for his support of Nieto, leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He said: ""I'm no tiny of piece of gold that will be liked by everyone, many people are in one political party, other people are with another, I simply speak as a citizen."" The fighter was fined last October for wearing political propaganda in support of PRI in his third fight against Pacquiao.","Juan Manuel Márquez cools talk of a fifth fight against Filipino fighter Manny Pacquiao .

"(CNN) -- The holidays are a time of reflection and often a time of charity, even for some of Hollywood's biggest stars. CNN's Alina Cho is taking a special look at how three celebrities are doing their part for causes near to their hearts in this year's ""Big Stars, Big Giving,"" which is scheduled to air 8 a.m., 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. ET December 26-28 on CNN. Matt Damon . Water.org . Academy Award winner Matt Damon is using his star power to lead the way for change and bring clean water to those who do not have access to such a basic staple. ""Every 20 seconds, a kid under the age of 5 is dying, losing their life because they do not have access to clean water. And it just doesn't have to be that way,"" Damon tells CNN. Damon and water expert Gary White founded water.org in 2009 with a plan for what Damon says is a solvable problem. Close to a billion people do not have an affordable solution to clean drinking water, and the problem is twofold. ""To me, the most disturbing thing, not only is it contaminated, but people are walking hours to get this kind of water, "" Damon said in an interview with Impact Your World a few years ago, ""So, you're forced to give your children this water knowing that the chances of them getting a water-borne disease is pretty high."" Damon and White say that charity is not enough and have created the concept of ""water credit,"" which allows people access to affordable loans to buy a toilet or a faucet to bring clean running water into their homes. And it's working. White says that loans are being paid back at a rate of 98% in places such as Haiti. Matthew McConaughey . J.K. Livin Foundation . Actor Matthew McConaughey and his wife, Camila, have made bettering the lives of young adults their mission. They founded the Just Keep Livin, or the J.K. Livin Foundation, to empower high school students ""to lead active lives and make healthy choices to become great men and women,"" as their mission states. ""I want to find a place where I can help out where it's prevention before you need a cure,"" McConaughey tells CNN. McConaughey has so far brought the J.K. Livin Foundation into 14 schools without after-school programs and where 75% of the students are on a free or reduced lunch program and below the poverty line. They are students who come from families who might not have the means to provide healthy meals or access to gyms. The J.K. Livin Foundation gives the students a safe place to be after school and the tools they need to grow into healthy adults. The program meets twice a week for two hours a day and is voluntary. The students who choose to attend participate in physical fitness, nutrition education and a gratitude circle. ""Everyone goes around and says something that they are thankful for. And that's a lesson that came from my mother and the family I grew up in. I found that the more you find something to be thankful for, the more you end up having things to be thankful for, and so it goes well beyond the gym,"" says McConaughey. Eva Longoria . The Eva Longoria Foundation . In addition to establishing herself as one of Hollywood's leading ladies, Eva Longoria has also made a name for herself campaigning for social issues. She's lent her voice to raise awareness of the AIDS crisis in Africa and sex trafficking in Thailand. When she decided she wanted to create her own foundation in 2010, she decided on a cause that hit much closer to home for her. The Eva Longoria Foundation aims to help Hispanic women get a college education. Some 27% of Latinas live below the poverty line, and 17% drop out of high school. Only 15% of adult Latinas have college degrees. Longoria hopes to empower women and change those statistics. ""I come from a family of teachers. I wasn't the first to go to college. It was expected, and that's rare in a lot of low-income families and a lot of minority families,"" says Longoria. Longoria's foundation supports other programs that help Hispanic women excel in their education, and it aims to provide Latina entrepreneurs with career training, mentorship, capital and opportunity. ""I don't want the Latino community to just be a large community. We need to be an educated community because this is going to be our future work force,"" says Longoria.","Three big stars are focused on giving back in a big way .

"(CNN) -- Top State Department officials are vowing to improve security at U.S. diplomatic posts around the world, some before the end of the year. Those promises were repeated Thursday in Washington in a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the first of two sessions in which Deputy Secretaries of State William Burns and Thomas Nides testified about the deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya. ""We've learned some very hard, and painful lessons in Benghazi, and we are already acting on them,"" Nides told senators. ""We have to do better."" The two testified the State Department deployed five teams to assess security at 19 U.S. diplomatic posts in 13 countries. They said the department partnered with the Pentagon to send 35 additional Marine detachments -- about 225 Marines -- to medium- and high-threat posts with the hope the additional Marines would be deterrents against any attack attempts. Also, the department wants to hire more than 150 diplomatic security personnel -- an increase of 5% over current staffing -- and provide them with equipment and training. The hearings follow a scathing independent report released Tuesday that blamed ""systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies"" for inadequate security amid the attack that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. This week's report and hearings mark a significant chapter in the winding saga surrounding the events of September 11, 2012. That night, the consulate became engulfed in flames. Cameras captured images of a huge crowd of people in the streets -- some waving Libyan flags -- around the consulate, before gunmen descended on the compound. The assault was ultimately determined to be a terrorist attack. Stevens, a lifelong diplomat admired by many of different political parties, had previously written diplomatic correspondence warning that al Qaeda-linked militants were growing in strength in an enclave not far from the city. Burns' and Nides' appearance on Capitol Hill marks the first time officials of their level have spoken about the attack. Both are top advisers to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is not able to testify because she is ill. Clinton ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack. Such reports are mandated by Congress when Americans working on behalf of the U.S. government are killed overseas. The 39-page unclassified version of the report concludes that the leadership failures resulted in a security plan ""that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly inadequate to deal with the attack that took place."" Nides told senators he's leading a task force to implement 29 recommendations in the review board report. Some of the recommendations will be implemented before the end of the year. ""We accept every one of them,"" Nides said. ""The undersecretary of political affairs, the undersecretary for management, the director general of the Foreign Service and the deputy legal adviser will work with me to drive this forward,"" Nides said. The task force has already met to translate the report's recommendations into 60 specific action items, he told senators. ""We've assigned every single one to the responsible bureau for immediate implementation, and several will be completed by the end of this calendar year,"" he said. He promised to work with Congress to make sure those recommendations become reality. Four State Department officials were disciplined after the release of the report. One resigned, and three others have been placed on administrative leave, spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said. On Thursday, Nides also asked that Congress provide the department with more money to pay for ramped-up security. Sen. John Kerry, widely considered the leading candidate to succeed Clinton, seemed to agree that the department should get more funds. He said in the hearing that spending on U.S. missions overseas must increase, and the system that requests and delivers that money must be streamlined. In the past year, $650 billion was spent on military budgets, while the budgets for international affairs were less than one-tenth of the Defense Department's, the Massachusetts senator said. Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, said he was ""dismayed"" that the hearing was centered on additional money for the State Department in the absence of a review of how the agency spends the money it already has. ""We have no idea whether the State Department is using its money wisely or not,"" he said. Yet he said the department knew about the threats posed in the days before the attack, based on incoming cables, and should have requested funds to support the situation in Benghazi. Nides testified that the State Department has already requested additional funds for its 2013 budget. When asked whether Clinton had heard of the security concerns prior to the Benghazi attack, Burns said the conversations with Clinton and senior level officials were mainly focused on the overall general security picture in Libya, but there was a general awareness of the deteriorating security situation in the eastern part of the country. Clinton is recovering from a stomach virus and concussion but is expected to appear before the House Foreign Affairs Committee next month to discuss the Benghazi attack, according to Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, the outgoing chairwoman of the panel. Burns testified about other actions he and officials are taking to tighten relations with countries like Libya that are still shaky after recent revolutions that toppled dictators. Burns said he'd just gotten back from Tunisia, where a suspect in the Benghazi attack is being detained. ""I believe we're making some progress there,"" the deputy secretary offered. There was a short portion of the Senate hearing that touched on the controversy surrounding comments by Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, describing the Benghazi attack in the days following the incident. Rice said on Sunday news programs in the days following the attack that it was the result of a protest against an online anti-Islam film. She's been heavily criticized for those statements, to the point that she withdrew her name for consideration as the next secretary of state to avoid what she called a ""lengthy, disruptive, and costly"" confirmation process. Critics said Rice's comments were out of line with the true intelligence about the incident, and were an attempt by the administration to avoid tying it to terrorism. Oklahoma Republican Sen. James Inhofe asked Burns about Rice's statements. ""What happened in Benghazi was clearly a terrorist attack,"" Burns replied. ""I am convinced my colleagues in the administration and intelligence community operated in good faith.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Recognizing that the ""Internet of 2012 is vastly different from a decade ago,"" the Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday announced changes to strengthen privacy for children online ""in this ever-changing technological landscape."" The revisions to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, also known as the COPPA Rule, which was originally passed in 1998, will make it more difficult for children's personal data to be collected by mobile phone apps, smartphones and tablets. Parents will have greater control over the information that websites and online services can collect from children under 13. Apps, or applications, are software programs that mobile phone users can purchase and install on their devices. ""The new COPPA rule captures the new online reality... and puts companies on notice that they must comply with the law,"" said Sen. Jay Rockefeller, chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Rockefeller, D-West Virginia, told reporters at a Capitol Hill news conference that he's been ""stewing inside"" about this issue for a while, and he warned that third parties will be held liable for personal information they collect from children. He said third parties also will be held liable ""if they know they are collecting information on websites or apps directed toward children."" The FTC says one of the proposals will ""close a loophole that allowed kid-directed apps and websites to permit third parties to collect personal information from children through plug-ins (software) without parental notice and consent."" ""Parents should be the gatekeepers to decide whether others can collect information,"" said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz. A recent report by the FTC found that only 20 percent of the apps linked to general disclosure information or a privacy policy before the app was downloaded. Many of the apps shared certain information with third parties, such as device ID, geolocation or phone number without disclosing that fact to parents, the FTC said. Companies could potentially develop detailed profiles about children without a parent's knowledge or consent. The commission will require website operators and online service providers ""take reasonable steps to release children's personal information only to companies that are capable of keeping it secure and confidential."" Another amendment would ""modify the list of 'personal information' that cannot be collected without parental notice and consent."" ""FTC stands for something,"" said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Massachusetts, a proponent for updated protection rules. ""Today FTC stands for 'For The Children' across the country."" Common Sense Media, an organization that provides families with information about kids, media and technology, applauded the new regulations. ""These COPPA updates will provide a stern reminder to companies and developers that they need to do more to build a trustworthy online space for kids and families and ensure that kids can benefit from tech innovation without exploitation,"" said James Steyer, Common Sense Media CEO. The amendments will go into effect on July 1, 2013. CNN's Todd Sperry contributed to this report.","Changes to children's privacy act target the collection of personal data by apps .

"(CNN) -- It was special, just like Emilie Parker. That's how Jill Cottle Garrett described Saturday's funeral for her 6-year-old niece, one of 20 children and six adults killed at a Newtown, Connecticut, school. The LDS Rock Cliff Stake Center church in Ogden, Utah, was filled with glitter and pink flowers -- Emilie's favorite color -- ""fancy"" and effervescent like the little girl herself. ""Everything was special to Emilie,"" her aunt told reporters outside the church. ""Emilie was an example to not only her little sisters but to her family, to all her little friends. And now she's an example to the world about purity ... tragedy and forgiveness."" Emilie had been practicing for a Christmas show, which would have been Sunday. She never got the chance to perform, but the songs -- ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" and ""Silent Night"" -- were played during her funeral. Her two little sisters sang along, smiled, danced, even took flowers off Emilie's casket and threw them into the air. ""They were celebrating Emilie and her life today,"" Garrett said. The girl was one of three Sandy Hook Elementary School students laid to rest Saturday, the last of the victims of the December 14 mass shooting to be buried. NRA official to face questions on gun control . One was Josephine Gay, who had turned 7 just days before Adam Lanza forced himself into her school and began firing. A photo of the happy child, wearing a green hat and with glasses on the end of her nose, has been republished widely.

Her funeral took place on a blustery day in Newtown, as strong winds whipped the hairs of emotional mourners outside Saint Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church. Honoring victims and paying tribute to Newtown . Some who did not go inside the church instead left tributes at a makeshift memorial steps away, which was full of messages and flowers. Services also were held Saturday for 6-year-old Ana Marquez-Greene, who is remembered for a singing voice bigger than her size. A representative for her father, the jazz musician Jimmy Greene, described the girl as ""beautiful and vibrant.""

"(CNN) -- On Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, a line of 26 black crosses stand in the sand, with the Stars and Stripes behind them and a pot of flowers alongside. They are the tribute of the group Rio de Paz -- River of Peace -- to the victims at Sandy Hook Elementary School, from a group that knows all too well what tragedies gun violence can inflict on society. Brazil, Norway, Britain, France and Australia are among many countries that have seen terrible episodes of gun violence in recent years. But alongside the many expressions of sympathy and condolences that have poured into Newtown, Connecticut, from around the world, there is also a sense of bewilderment that such tragedies happen on an almost routine basis in America. ""Routine"" may seem an exaggerated or callous description, but it was President Barack Obama who said at an interfaith service Sunday night in Newtown: ""We can't accept events like this as routine."" Strangers inspired to honor Newtown victims . Even so, commentaries from abroad often include a sense of resignation that not much can or will be done to prevent such atrocities in the future. John Cassidy, who is British and blogs for The New Yorker, writes of driving to his hometown of Leeds in northern England, as he heard the news of the killings at Sandy Hook. ""Nowhere have mass shootings been as prevalent as the United States, and nowhere has the policy reaction been so pathetic,"" he wrote this weekend. Brian Masters, writing in the UK's Daily Telegraph, agreed. ""No American politician will have the nerve to propose the only cure to this repetitive insanity, which would be a sensible, mature and responsible attitude towards the ownership and use of guns,"" he predicted. In the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, commentator Tzipi Shmilovitz was more brutal. ""America is not ready to talk about how it is easier to get a handgun than it is to see a doctor, not ready to speak about the video games that have extreme violence. It is just willing to sweep up everything under the carpet of tears."" And over at Haaretz, one of Israel's leading commentators, Chemi Shalev, lamented a ""combustible mix of angry American young men, often disturbed and usually white, spurred on by the pervasive and always growing presence of limitless violence in popular American culture, together with the easy-access, open market of guns and ammo, which together produce these shooting slaughters with such sickening regularity. ... ""And if you pour in the often gruesome violence so rampant in the computer and video games that so many American boys are weaned on and addicted to, it should come as no surprise, perhaps, that not only are the most evil and inhuman of mass murders possible, they may soon become commonplace,"" he added. Such observations are not new. Five years ago Chris Lockwood, U.S. editor of The Economist wrote in the Los Angeles Times: ""We might be a little surprised that a country with all the ingenuity and energy that America has seems simply to throw up its hands when it comes to guns, and in effect declares that the homicide rate and regular appalling school massacres, are insolvable problems."" Obama has now suggested otherwise -- broadening his existing support for a ban on assault weapons. ""We can't tolerate this anymore; these tragedies must end,"" he said Sunday. ""We will be told that the causes are complex and that is true. No single law, no set of laws can eliminate evil and prevent acts of violence, but that can't be an excuse for inaction,"" he continued. Dunblane: How UK school massacre led to tighter gun control . Commentators and academics from other countries who have looked at this ""inaction"" in America often raise the following points. The polarization in U.S. politics means that on the really difficult issues, paralysis is more likely than progress. The power of lobbying interests -- and in the case of guns that means the National Rifle Association -- contributes to that paralysis, they say. They also assert that the U.S. Constitution and its political culture protects individual liberty -- or license -- to a much greater degree than is the case almost anywhere else. That includes allowing the ownership of powerful firearms capable of killing dozens within a minute. Sixteen years ago, both Australia and the United Kingdom saw gun rampages similar to those at Virginia Tech, the Sikh temple in Wisconsin, the theater in Aurora, Colorado, and Sandy Hook. More: How other countries have dealt with massacres . In the town of Dunblane, Scotland, 16 children and one adult were shot dead at an elementary school in 1996. The gunman then shot himself. The atrocity led to revisions to the Firearms Act that in effect banned the possession of handguns in Britain. Jack Straw, the minister who pushed the legislation through Parliament, said after the Sandy Hook killings that he would ""not put money"" on U.S. laws changing. In a BBC interview, Straw added: ""I think sensible people want it to happen, but the National Rifle Association, which is this extraordinary gun lobby and gun manufacturers' lobby, controls politics in a number of states."" One tweet put it more bluntly: ""Dunblane,1996. 16 dead kids+adult. 1.2 million sign petitions. UK govt. enacts new law. Halts private guns. Tag, USA. You're It."" In that same year, a 28-year old Australian killed 35 people with two semiautomatic rifles in just eight minutes. Then-Prime Minister John Howard pushed through a law that banned assault weapons and instituted a gun buy-back policy. (Some 650,000 were taken out of circulation.) Howard recalls telling an audience in Texas in 2008 that the law was among his proudest achievements in 12 years as prime minister. ""There was an audible gasp of amazement,"" he wrote in an op-ed this year in The Sydney Morning Herald. After the mass shooting in Aurora this year, Howard said he was not optimistic it would change anything. ""The responses of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney ... were as predictable as they were disappointing,"" he said. ""There are many American traits which we Australians could well emulate to our great benefit. But when it comes to guns we have been right to take a radically different path,"" Howard concluded. Australian-born media magnate Rupert Murdoch chimed in Saturday on his Twitter account: ""When will politicians find courage to ban automatic weapons? As in Oz after similar tragedy."" Some columnists don't detect any popular pressure in the United States for change, even if the gun control debate has flared in the wake of the Sandy Hook shooting. Mirjam Remie, who writes for the Dutch newspaper Handelsblad, observes that ""support for stricter gun laws has been steadily declining for decades. According to Gallup, it is 44%, but twelve years ago it was 66%."" Debate rages about the relationship between the availability of guns in society and the number of deaths caused by guns. But the laws enacted in the UK and Australia sharply restricting gun ownership do appear to have made a difference. A study (PDF) by researchers at Harvard University in 2011 found that in the 18 years before the new law was enacted in Australia, a total of 13 gun attacks had led to four or more fatalities. In the 16 years since the new law, the number was zero. Individual homicides involving guns have also fallen. Japan has some of the most restrictive regulations in the world on gun ownership. Shotgun licenses for hunting require a lengthy application; handguns are forbidden. Homicides by gunfire in Japan rarely get into double figures in a year. In the view of author David Kopel, who has studied Japan's gun control laws in great detail, its regulations work because they are ""part of a vast mosaic of social control ... a pervasive cultural theme that the individual is subordinate to society and to the government."" That would not be acceptable in the United States. Even so, while recognizing the power of the Second Amendment, foreign commentators are not shy of recommending what could and should be done to tackle gun violence in the U.S. In the UK, The Guardian editorialized in the wake of the Newtown shootings: ""A proper federal system of regulation, including background checks registration, and limits on the type and number of weapons an individual can own, would bring the U.S. belatedly into line with other civilized countries, as would a determined push back against state legislation allowing the carrying of concealed weapons in public."" Hours before the Sandy Hook massacre, Michigan lawmakers passed legislation allowing those with concealed pistol licenses to carry guns into schools, hospitals and churches among other places. In the words of one commentator: ""No society that holds itself up as an example to the world should, as the United States does, brazenly shrug off what are clearly deep national character flaws when it comes to our love of guns or our celebration of hate politics."" The writer was not a foreigner, but an American -- David Rothkopf -- writing in Foreign Policy. And he was writing not this weekend, but after Jared Loughner shot and killed six people, and injured more than a dozen, including U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in January 2011.","Australia and UK also have had terrible episodes of gun violence in recent years .

"(CNN) -- The little girl was deeply concerned. So on Christmas Eve, she called in to the North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa tracking center with an urgent question: . ""If I lose my tooth, and the Tooth Fairy comes, could the Tooth Fairy scare away Santa Claus?"" The Santa trackers at NORAD started on Christmas Eve at 6 a.m. ET, fielding questions from all over the globe and continuing a tradition that began by accident in 1955. That year, an ad placed in a local Colorado Springs newspaper encouraged kids to call a phone number to find out Santa's whereabouts on Christmas Eve, but instead of the intended number, the operations center for what is now called NORAD was printed. Col. Harry Shoup was in charge that night, and instead of hanging up, he had his operators find Santa and report on his location. NORAD is typically charged with detecting attacks against North America by aircraft, missiles or space vehicles, but on Christmas Eve, its high-tech tools of detection are repurposed to find and track Santa. John Cornelio, a media spokesman at NORAD, says the organization is on track to receive more than 100,000 calls and 10,000 e-mails. He says the volunteer Santa trackers are mostly NORAD workers or their family members. After a quick briefing, the trackers start taking calls, relaying Santa's position as shown on a big screen on the front wall of the call center. Tracking information is also posted to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. On the other end of the phone for some lucky youngsters Monday was first lady Michelle Obama, who watched Santa's progress along with children nationwide from her vacation in Hawaii. When 5-year-old Fischer from North Carolina called her, Santa was delivering presents to the children of Libya. ""And you know how many gifts he's delivered already?"" the first lady asked Fischer, who said he wanted a four-wheeler for Christmas. ""No, m'am,"" he replied, according to a transcript from the White House. The first lady replied, ""More than 3 billion gifts he's already delivered."" Abby, whose favorite Christmas song is ""Silver Bells,"" spoke with Michelle Obama alongside her siblings, Lilli and Kyle, while Santa flew over Italy. And Kayla, age 4, guessed that the red nose visible on the satellite as the sleigh flew over the sleeping children of Croatia was ""Rudolph the Reindeer."" Cornelio says NORAD has learned that Santa ""roughly arrives at homes between 9 p.m. and midnight, but only after the kids have gone to bed."" He says that kids can help make things a lot easier for Santa if they're in bed at that time so he doesn't have to backtrack. As for the monumental logistical challenge of delivering all those gifts (NORAD reports that he's already delivered more than 2 billion gifts, as of 1 p.m. ET), Cornelio says that time to Santa is different from what it is to most people. ""What seems like 24 hours to you and I actually is a lot more significant period of time to Santa. ... That's what allows him to actually travel all around the world in a 24-hour period."" While the Santa trackers handle a variety of questions, there are some they just don't have the answer to. One child called in earlier to ask if Santa likes President Barack Obama or his electoral opponent, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Cornelio replied: ""Santa would have to best answer that question. What we do is make sure Santa travels safely."" To reach the Santa trackers, call 1-877-Hi NORAD (1-877-446-6723) or e-mail noradtrackssanta@outlook.com.","NEW: Michelle Obama takes some calls from children .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Thursday he welcomed plans by Britain to withdraw almost 4,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of next year. Afghan security forces are ready to ensure security and protect their country, Karzai said, according to a statement from his office. British Prime Minister David Cameron said Wednesday that UK troop numbers would reduce to about 5,200 by the end of 2013. UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the accelerated withdrawal was thanks to ""real progress"" on the ground in the southern province of Helmand. ""This is a direct result of the success of the Afghan National Security Forces in assuming a lead role in delivering security for the Afghan people,"" he said. ""There remain huge challenges ahead for the Afghan people. Our combat mission is drawing to a close, but our commitment to the Afghan people is long term."" Karzai said the UK announcement was ""a timely decision for the security responsibilities to be transferred to Afghan forces."" There will be about 9,000 British military personnel in Afghanistan by the end of this year. Britain's announcement comes only days after the last French combat units left Afghanistan. About 1,500 French troops will remain in Afghanistan into 2013 to remove equipment and help train Afghan forces. Britain is the second-largest contributor of troops to the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force, with the majority of its personnel operating in Helmand. The United States, whose troops make up the bulk of the force, still has some 68,000 personnel in Afghanistan. Coalition forces are working to get Afghan security forces ready to take charge of security after the NATO mission in Afghanistan concludes at the end of 2014.

"(CNN) -- The winter storm system that walloped the Midwest moved east Friday night, bringing with it not just snow but powerful winds -- all of which made travel perilous and last-minute Christmas shopping more complicated across several states. Earlier this week, blizzard-like conditions left many locales white less than a week before the holiday. Many communities in central Iowa, for instance, got about a foot of snow, and the city of Madison, Wisconsin, got 15.2 inches Wednesday and Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. This much snow generally isn't expected as the system moves east, hitting Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. But that doesn't mean there haven't been -- and won't still be -- plenty of headaches. Snow is hardly foreign to these areas. But the addition of strong winds, especially in mountainous areas and along the Great Lakes, makes staying on snow-slickened roads even harder. ""It's scary,"" Esther Boyer told CNN affiliate WDTN, soon after her car slid into a ditch Friday in western Ohio. ""I guess I was just driving too fast, and you should slow down a lot sooner."" The lone blizzard warning, in effect Friday night through 6 p.m. Saturday, was for parts of northern West Virginia and north-central Maryland. The National Weather Service predicts 8 to 12 inches of snow and sustained winds of up to 35 mph, with gusts blowing up to 60 mph. ""Strong winds will cause blowing and drifting of snow with blizzard conditions expected at times with visibilities of one quarter mile or less (and) wind chill temperatures in the single digits ... also possible,"" the agency's forecast said. ""Downed trees and power lines could result from the strongest gusts on Saturday."" More populated areas -- many of which, such as Buffalo, Cleveland and Erie, Pennsylvania, were seeing snow around 9 p.m. Friday -- are also expected to be hit hard. The latter two cities are among those facing a winter storm warning through 7 p.m. Saturday. The weather service's forecast calls for 5 to 7 inches of snow, with 10 inches possible in spots, plus regular winds approaching 30 mph and up to 45-mph gusts by Lake Erie. A similar warning applies to western Pennsylvania, where 5 to 9 inches of light to moderate snow -- some of it ""heavier, lake-enhanced snow"" -- and gusts as strong as 40 mph are expected. Even more snow, between 10 to 18 inches, is forecast farther south in Pennsylvania and in northern Maryland, with 50-mph gusts possible. ""A winter storm warning means that snow will make travel dangerous,"" the weather service said. ""If you must venture out at all, use extreme caution."" These advisories follow severe weather farther west that caused major problems earlier this week. While the city itself was largely spared of snow, Chicago's two airports -- O'Hare and Midway -- were clogged with travelers due to flight cancellations. Blinding snow is blamed for a 30-car pileup on Interstate 35 near Fort Dodge, Iowa, that killed two people, said Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright. It was one of close to 100 weather-related accidents reported around the state by Thursday morning, according to Bright. CNN's Stefan Simons, Jim Kavanagh, Jareen Imam, Laura Smith-Spark, Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: Cleveland, Buffalo and other locales see snow as the system moves east .

"(CNN) -- Suicide bombings, hurricanes, plane crashes, shootings at high schools. Unfortunately we hear about such events on television or read about them in the newspaper all too often. On July 29, 1999, I got a real reminder of the difference between news and tragedy. What started out as an ordinary day at work turned out to be anything but. I had just graduated from college and was seven weeks into my first ""real"" job when Mark Barton came into my office and shot everyone in sight. You may have heard about the largest killing spree in Georgia history, the day-trading shootings in Atlanta; well I'm lucky enough to have survived them. I was shot in the lower back with a hollow point bullet. For those of you who are unfamiliar with hollow point bullets, they are the most destructive. They enter your body and expand into a mushroom shape. One of my surgeons said the bullet was like a guided missile. It destroyed my inferior vena cava, one of the two main veins of the heart. It also hit my spine, pancreas and intestines. I needed 115 pints of blood during the two emergency surgeries immediately after the shooting. To put that into perspective, the human body holds approximately 10 pints. The doctors told my family that my chance of survival was one in a thousand. That may sound grim, but I would have had no chance if blood wasn't available during my emergency surgeries. Cancer survivor's challenge: Give the gift of life this season . I am now missing a disc in my lower back, have scoliosis in my upper back, have extensive scar tissue throughout my abdomen and have nerve damage in my right leg. I have progressed from a wheelchair to walking without any assistive devices. Those injuries seem minimal now, considering my doctors gave me little chance to survive. It frightens me to think that there was a severe blood shortage just two days before the shooting. There weren't even 115 pints of blood on hand, let alone 115 pints of the type I needed. It is not uncommon to experience critical blood shortages in the middle of the summer and during the winter holidays. Schools are not in session, and people are on vacation. If Mark Barton had snapped just a couple of days earlier, I would have died. It truly is a miracle that I am here today, and I'm certainly grateful for that. It's hard to believe that I'm even alive, let alone that I'm able to walk. Among the first of many miracle workers who made my recovery a reality was the Red Cross. As the nation's largest blood collection organization, the Red Cross made an emergency appeal during that critical shortage in 1999 and made sure that those 115 pints where there when I needed them so desperately. As you can imagine, I would do just about anything for the Red Cross. I will be forever indebted to this organization, even though nothing was ever asked of me in return for those 115 pints of blood. I'm also thankful for the 115 anonymous donors whose blood flowed through my veins. Without their generous, selfless donations, I wouldn't be here today. I wouldn't have met my wonderful husband or given birth to our two precious little girls. Sickle cell patient won't let disease define her . I have made it my mission to raise awareness about the importance of blood donation and increase blood collections. I volunteer as the chairman of the American Red Cross Southern Region Blood Services board of directors and am a member of the American Red Cross Metropolitan Atlanta Chapter board of directors. I serve as SunTrust Bank Inc.'s corporate champion on the American Red Cross life board. In these roles, I commit to hosting blood drives throughout the year but most importantly during critical times in late June and December. Although public speaking is my greatest fear, I also co-founded the Red Cross Southern Region's Speakers Bureau and tell my story to anyone who will listen in hopes that I will encourage those who have never donated to do so and to encourage those who do to do so more frequently. Most importantly, I practice what I preach by donating blood as often as I can. The chances of something catastrophic like being shot happening to you are slim to none. While you may not need 115 pints of blood like I did, you will almost certainly need at least a pint at some point during your life and there's no substitute for it. Blood cannot be manufactured; it has to be donated. A single pint of blood can save the lives of up to three people, and donating generally takes less than an hour and is virtually painless. So now is your chance to become a hero. It's easy. All you have to do is roll up your sleeves and give a pint a blood. You won't meet the recipient, but you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you're saving someone's life. So please schedule an appointment to donate or just stop by the closest blood drive in your area.

"(CNN) -- With 1 billion tourists in 2012, it's little wonder the last 12 months have drummed up some juicy fodder for aviation reporters. London's Olympic Games were a success -- the expected tourism boon not so much. ""Dark tourism"" (travel to sites of death, disaster or the macabre) became a phrase. And various climatic events conspired to wreak havoc on travel plans across the world. But which were the stories that really stood out to those who are involved in the industry every day? These are the top 10: . 10. SAS on its last legs . ""A new comprehensive plan will pave the way for a new, strong and competitive SAS,"" read the statement from SAS last month. ""The plan needs to be fully implemented and new collective agreements must be signed in a very short space of time in order for SAS to have access to necessary funding."" One of Europe's oldest airlines -- and one that still knows the meaning of passenger service -- is in dire straits. SAS faces aggressive competition from low cost carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle, which has hundreds of aircraft on order from Airbus and Boeing. The pioneer of polar flights, fully 40 percent of SAS's workforce is to be chopped. If the airline fails, and it's been on the brink before, this will continue the trend in Europe toward consolidation that included the acquisition by British Airways of struggling Iberia. Not that this consolidation under the International Airline Group (IAG) banner has gone well, either. 9. Iberia on the brink . IAG's Iberia will lose 4,500 jobs in a cost-cutting effort after losing €262 million (US$340 million) through September. IAG characterizes Iberia in a ""fight for survival."" Nearly 25 percent of its aircraft will exit the fleet and pay might be cut by 35 percent. There's a January 31, 2013, deadline for labor to reach an agreement with IAG, which is negotiating to buy Spain's Vueling Airlines, which is based in Barcelona. Iberia cuts jobs in survival bid . 8. A380 loved by passengers, but continues to be a profit drag on Airbus . The Airbus A380, a technological marvel and by all accounts a passenger delight, continues to be a thorn in the profit-and-loss statements of Airbus and parent EADS. Discovery of wing rib bracket cracks in 2011 after the November 2010 high-profile engine failure on Qantas Flight 32 required costly refits. Never a safety-of-flight issue and affecting only a handful of the thousands of brackets on the A380's wings, the retrofits and airline compensations cost Airbus nearly €300 million (US$394.8 million). Airline schedules all over the globe were disrupted as fixes took aircraft out of service. The ad wars that broke out between Boeing and Airbus in late November -- 747-8 versus the A380 -- only add another dimension to the long-running rivalry. How do you pick up an Airbus A380? 7. Boeing roars back with 737 MAX . In 2011, Airbus stunned Boeing by announcing orders and commitments for about 1,500 re-engined A320neos. This year, Boeing came roaring back, expecting to finish with firm orders for around 1,000 re-engined 737 MAX aircraft. Boeing still trails market share, and the MAX will enter service two years later than the NEO. But any way you look at it, this was Boeing's year. Boeing unveils futuristic 'swallowtail' wingtip for 737 MAX . 6. AirAsia continues to become major force . AirAsia and its CEO Tony Fernades are leading the low-cost carrier revolution in Asia. Taking a page from Sir Richard Branson's book with the Virgin brand, Fernandes is leveraging the AirAsia name and logo to bring low-cost travel to hundreds of millions of people. Fernandes likes to point out Asia (excluding China) has a larger popular base than the United States or Europe and that island and mountainous geography make flying the best (and sometimes the only) way to get around. AirAsiaX, the long-haul, low-cost operator, floated an initial public stock offering this year. Fernandes has major expansion plans in mind for this airline. A word of caution: Citi Research in Hong Kong thinks AirAsia is expanding too rapidly, has too many aircraft on order and faces over-capacity in Malaysia from LionAir. AirAsia inks huge Airbus deal . 5. Boeing dithers on 777X . While Boeing moved ahead with the 787-10, it dithered on enhanced revisions to the highly profitable 777-300ER. When Jim Albaugh was CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, he wanted Authority to Offer (ATO) by the end of this year. Albaugh is gone, retiring unexpectedly. ATO for the 777X is put off for perhaps a year, say people familiar with Boeing's current thinking. The 777X is Boeing's answer to the Airbus A350, which promises to be far more economical than the 777-300ER. But Boeing figures it has more time because ... 4. Airbus delays A350 . The composite A350 was already some 18 months behind schedule when Airbus announced a new delay this year for its planned entry-into-service (EIS) from mid-to-late 2014. Many expect a further slip into 2015. First flight is still planned for mid-2013 -- in time for the Paris Air Show in June? But technical issues at Airbus' plant in Broughton, Wales, will delay assembly for the test aircraft needed for certification, thus delaying EIS. Airbus' challenges with the program prompt questions over whether the smallest family member, the A350-800, will be canceled and whether the largest, the A350-1000, is sufficient. Airbus says the -800 won't and the -1000 is, but market doubts remain. First look at the Airbus A350 XWB . 3. Boeing launches 787-10 -- sort of . The 787 program's problems have become legendary in the industry and Boeing won't make money on it for years. The ATO of the third member of the family, the high capacity, 6,800 nautical mile range 787-10 is a key bright spot. Although official ATO didn't come in October as expected, a ""soft"" ATO did and Boeing is talking with potential customers. A formal launch of this program is now said to be expected by mid-2013. This sub-type should be a real winner for Boeing and a profitable member of the 787 family. 2b. China expands aerospace role . China's ambitions to become a major global aerospace player draws skepticism from many quarters. The AVIC/COMAC ARJ21 regional jet is essentially a Chinese copy of the old McDonnell Douglas DC-9-10 built in 1965. And it's yet to enter service and is already five years behind schedule. Many think the COMAC C919 will be similarly disappointing. But the C919 has 380 orders and commitments (albeit entirely from Chinese airlines and lessors) even though it's not expected to be up to Airbus and Boeing standards. The government wants the C919 to take half the home market, about 2,000 aircraft over 20 years, and this comes out of Airbus' and Boeing's market share. But this isn't all. There are more than 20 Chinese companies that want to play in the aircraft leasing field, though fewer than a dozen are active so far. Many are affiliated with Chinese banks, which are becoming bigger players in financing aircraft. Anyone who thinks China won't be a major global player for aircraft, lessors and finance needs to think again. It's just a matter of when, not if. It might take a generation, or even two, but China will become a viable, global aerospace presence. 2a. China leads the way to block Europe's Emission Trading Scheme . The European Union announced plans to implement its Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) that requires airlines to buy and sell carbon credits. Airlines and several countries, led by China, objected to this unilateral action, saying it should be a global accord reached through the International Civic Aviation Organization trade group. China was the first to tell its airlines not to comply. Others followed. But China uses aircraft orders from Airbus and Boeing as political leverage and refused to ratify an order for US$14 billion worth of Airbus product. This would cost jobs. In November the EU blinked and put off implementing ETS. We'll see if Airbus lands the stalled orders by year end. Nothing demonstrates the powerhouse clout China has on the global stage more than this. 1. Merger between EADS and BAE Systems collapses . Barely in office after assuming the slot in mid-2012, EADS CEO Tom Enders proposed a merger between EADS and Britain's BAE Systems. Word leaked prematurely in September and under British takeover law, a decision to move forward or not had to be made the next month. The combination would have created a global defense behemoth rivaling The Boeing Co. It would have positioned EADS North America to bid more credibly on future U.S. defense contracts. It would have balanced EADS' over-reliance on subsidiary Airbus for revenues and profits. It would have diversified BAE's sole reliance on defense, a shrinking market. It would have, at long last, diminished the government ownership (and meddling) of France and Germany in EADS and Airbus affairs. Fat chance. The highly parochial French surprised everyone by going along. But Germany's government objected to losing sway over Airbus jobs. Britain's government feared losing influence over BAE, a stock company, but which is one of Britain's major employers and a top defense contractor. German opposition killed the deal, and with it Enders' dreams of EADS becoming a ""real"" public company free of government influence. BAE, EADS $45 billion deal collapses .

"London (CNN) -- British ministers had a special guest in their midst during their Cabinet meeting Tuesday: Queen Elizabeth II. It was a historic occasion because it is thought to mark the first time a monarch has attended such a session since Queen Victoria more than a century ago. Read more: Diamond jubilee complete coverage . The monarch, wearing blue, was greeted at the door of 10 Downing Street by Prime Minister David Cameron. The queen has not attended a Cabinet meeting before now because her involvement in Britain's political life is generally formal or ceremonial. Her role is clear: ""As Head of State The Queen has to remain strictly neutral with respect to political matters, unable to vote or stand for election,"" according to the British Monarchy's website. Her presence as an observer Tuesday coincides with the end of the yearlong celebration marking her 60 years on the throne. During that time, the United Kingdom has had 12 prime ministers. The session lasted 90 minutes, during which ministers presented her with a gift they personally paid for to mark her diamond jubilee. The queen also visited the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on Tuesday, where she was paid a rather unusual tribute: the naming after her of 169,000 square miles of the Antarctic. Foreign Secretary William Hague said the southern part of the British Antarctic Territory had been designated ""Queen Elizabeth Land"" in honor of her 60-year reign. The previously unnamed territory is nearly twice the size of the United Kingdom and about a third of the whole land mass of the British Antarctic Territory, Hague said. The queen's visit to the Foreign Office, only her second in the past six decades, is the final official engagement of her busy jubilee year.","NEW: A large part of the British Antarctic Territory is named for Queen Elizabeth II .

"(CNN) -- Winter weather complicated travel for many Americans on Wednesday -- and left six dead in weather-related accidents, and even forced one NBA team to take the rare step of postponing a game due to the conditions. Six people, including two young children, have died in weather-related incidents since Tuesday. A 1-year-old and 2-year-old child were killed in a car accident in Arkansas, an official with the state's department of emergency said. Tommy Jackson also said a man was killed in his home in Saline County by a falling tree. A 53-year-old man in Rayville, Louisiana, was killed when a tree fell on his house, Richland Parish Sheriff Lee Harrell said. Snow totals in parts of Indiana ranged from 6 to 12 inches, CNN affiliate WRTV in Indianapolis reported. About 350 snowplows were clearing roads throughout the city. ""It's pretty bad. You get a lot of drifting out there. That's what's killing us, mainly,"" said plow driver David White. The Indiana Pacers said their game against the Chicago Bulls was rescheduled due to severe weather in Indianapolis. No makeup date was announced. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told residents they should avoid nonessential travel. ""Winter weather has arrived for many parts of the state, so as a precaution we have opened the emergency operation center to coordinate response efforts using all state and local resources,"" Cuomo said. ""I also urge New Yorkers to closely watch local news reports for weather updates and adjust their travel plans accordingly."" New York State Police said long sections of Interstate 84 and the Taconic State Parkway were closed for several hours while crews cleared snow. Wind was causing major delays at airports, including Philadelphia International Airport. At one point, it had delays of more than four hours, the longest setbacks in the country, the Federal Aviation Administration said. Several other airports in the Northeast experienced delays of more than two hours on Wednesday. CNN meteorologist Alexandra Steele said wind was the primary problem. ""(Many of) the big cities aren't seeing snow accumulation, they're seeing very heavy rain with the wind, "" she said. One gust in New York reached 31 mph, and gusts could become stronger as the night progressed, she said. Airlines cancel hundreds of flights . Drivers in Pennsylvania were traversing ice- and snow-covered streets and highways. In Pittsburgh, which was seeing its first major snowfall of the season, travelers battled the elements. One said a trip from her mother's house that normally could be done in 30 minutes took her three hours. CNN affiliate WTAE reported the speed limit of some sections of the Pennsylvania Turnpike were lowered to 45 mph and big rigs with empty trailers or two trailers weren't allowed on the road. A CNN photojournalist who traveled from Ohio to Washington, D.C., said one two-mile stretch of the turnpike took 30 minutes to navigate. As many people tried to get home, others were surveying the results of the storms that began in the Midwest and surged east. A white Christmas is rare for Little Rock, Arkansas, but a powerful winter storm took it to a new level: The 9 inches that fell broke a December 25 snowfall record that stood for 86 years. In areas where the storm has passed, officials were assessing the damage. More than 25 storm-related injuries were reported in Mississippi, the state's emergency management office said. No fatalities were reported. In addition to the injuries, about 70 homes were damaged, most in the southern portion of the state. On Tuesday, Gov. Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency for several battered Mississippi counties, a declaration that helps get support to victims. He said that at least eight counties reported damage and injuries. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe declared a statewide disaster. ""Our main priority is focused on recovery,"" said John Kilcullen, director of operations for emergency management in Mobile, Alabama. Officials at the National Weather Service gave a preliminary EF2 rating to a tornado that struck downtown Mobile on Christmas Day. Other tornadoes -- one that went though parts of Choctaw County, Alabama, and ones than struck Stone, Lawrence and Jones counties in Mississippi -- also were EF2's, which have wind speeds (for three-second bursts) between 111 and 135 miles per hour. The weather service said an even stronger EF3-rated tornado struck Pearl River County in Mississippi. CNN's Devon Sayers, Chuck Johnston, Carma Hassan, Todd Sperry, Jeremy Moorhead, Mariano Castillo, Joe Sutton, and David Close contributed to this report.","NEW: At least six dead from weather-related incidents, including two children .

"(CNN) -- Jim Nicholson could've just handed over the cash. Instead, he gave the would-be robber a run for his money -- and paid for it. The 30-year-old bank teller said the suspect, dressed in black and wearing sunglasses, walked up to his counter at the Key Bank branch in suburban Seattle, Washington, demanding he fill the man's bag with cash. ""So I grab the bag ... I threw it on the floor,"" Nicholson told CNN Radio. He said he demanded the robber show him a weapon. When he realized there was none, Nicholson said, he lunged at the robber, chased him down the street, pinned him down and waited for the police. That was Tuesday of last week. He lost his job Thursday. Why? ""Policy violation,"" Nicholson said. ""Basically, we are supposed to comply with any robber that would come in. We're supposed to just give him the money and let him go -- and obviously I did not do that."" Key Bank spokeswoman Anne Foster declined to comment on the incident, saying it's under investigation, and Nicholson's termination, saying it's a personnel matter. ""What I can say is Key's highest priority is to protect the safety of our employees and our clients,"" she said. ""Our policies and procedures are in the best interest of public safety and they're consistent with industry standards."" ""Money, after all, is insurable and it's replaceable,"" she added. ""Lives are not."" Nicholson said he knew about the company's robbery policy before the incident, but said he acted on instinct. He found his dismissal a bit harsh, but said he doesn't plan to challenge it. ""I think that they probably wanted to set an example,"" he said. ""I don't think they want other tellers to do the same thing.""","Jim Nicholson, 30-year-old bank teller said suspect demanded cash .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A homeless man included in a mock video produced by a friend of Justin Timberlake's for the actor-singer's wedding celebration wants Timberlake to visit him on Skid Row. Lawyer Gloria Allred, known for representing clients with high-profile complaints, held a news conference on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles Monday to publicize the demands of the man, identified only as Eddie. ""I just want Justin Timberlake to come and talk to me about the things he can do to help us people that's down and out and that's lost things in our lives and not back on track,"" said ""Eddie,"" who appeared at the news conference with Allred. Allred also challenged Timberlake and his friends to ""take action to provide meaningful assistance to Eddie and others like him."" ""This issue is not just about fans being upset or anyone being offended by a video,"" Allred said. ""It is about people being down on their luck and in desperate need of help by those who are in a position to provide it. Mr. Timberlake, you, and your friends and others are in a position to provide that help."" Mr. and Mrs. Timberlake help bring Sandy relief . The short video -- titled ""Greetings from your Hollywood friends who just couldn't make it"" -- was not shown at the wedding of Timberlake an Jessica Biel, which took place in Italy in October. But Allred said it was produced for a related event. Eddie was one of several people who live on the streets of Los Angeles who are seen wishing the celebrity couple well in their marriage. ""Jessica and Justin, I haven't seen y'all in a long time. My gift is in the mail,"" Eddie said in his clip. While he was paid $40 to appear on the video, Eddie said he had no idea it would make fun of him or his friends. ""We're human beings and we need to be noticed and appreciated, just like other people,"" he told reporters. ""Not just to take a video of a person and put it in a rich wedding and everybody laugh about it, or whatever, like it was a joke on the homeless people."" Timberlake posted a letter on his website apologizing for the ""silly, unsavory"" video, which he said was produced by a ""knucklehead"" friend without his cooperation or knowledge. ""I don't live my life making fun of people (unless, of course, I'm making fun of myself on SNL)... Especially, those who are less fortunate or those in need,"" Timberlake wrote. ""I grew up with a family and community that instilled ideals in me like hard work, honesty and empathy."" While Timberlake said he had no involvement in making it, ""by association, I am holding myself accountable."" Eddie, who has lived on the streets for ""six or seven years,"" said he was hoping for a job as a clerk, custodian, caretaker or construction worker. ""Once upon a time, I did have a job and was living good, and my mother passed and a lot of things hurt me within myself and by me not having a job, I kind of fell short of money,"" he said. ""And you know, if you don't have any finances, you don't have nothing to pay rent or anything like that you become on the street."" Next Friday is his 58th birthday, but he'll spend it on the street, just like this Christmas, he said. His only family members are two daughters who live in another state, he said. Timberlake's representative did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on Eddie's call for help.

"Copenhagen, Denmark (CNN) -- Thousands of protesters took to the streets and hundreds were detained Saturday in Copenhagen as they demanded a climate-change agreement that would curb greenhouse gas emissions and aid developing countries harmed by pollution. They marched to the Bella Center in the Danish capital, where the global climate change summit is being held. More than 900 protesters were detained, police told CNN, but nearly all were released. Only five were charged and will go to court Sunday, police said. Countries are expected to end negotiations in Copenhagen on an ambitious new climate deal by next Friday, the end of the two-week summit. Environment ministers came to Copenhagen this weekend for talks, and world leaders are to arrive late next week. Considerable progress has been made in areas including technology, adaptation and the prevention of deforestation, Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, told reporters on Friday. ""It is now also time to begin to focus on the big picture."" De Boer hailed the European Union announcement to provide 7.2 billion euros, or $10.6 billion, over the next three years to help developing countries take action on climate change.

"(CNN) -- Central African Republic rebels and government officials will meet early next week for talks, a minister said Saturday, after a spate of violence that has left the fate of the inland African nation in limbo. The upcoming discussions will be in Gabon, on Africa's western coast, said the Central African Republic's Minister of Territorial Administration and Decentralization Josue Binoua. He did not specify the date when the discussions would begin. Central African Republic diplomatic adviser Honore Nzessiwe had indicated Thursday that the government was then trying to arrange a meeting with rebel leaders in Libreville, Gabon. The development comes as officials from various nations take steps to protect their citizens and interests in the Central African Republic, amid fears of more violence. U.S. President Barack Obama wrote a letter Saturday to Congress informing them that about 50 U.S. troops were sent to Chad on Thursday ""to support the evacuation of U.S. embassy personnel and U.S. citizens from the Central African Republic."" ""Although equipped for combat, this stand-by security force was deployed solely for the purpose of protecting U.S. citizens and property, if necessary,"" Obama wrote. The rebels were reported earlier this week to be about 190 miles from Bangui. But there's been a lull in rebel attacks in recent days, which Margaret Vogt, a special representative of the U.N. secretary-general, said might be evidence that they are respecting an earlier promise to halt their advance on the capital. The volatile situation -- which has spurred demonstrations in Bangui, the country's capital and largest city, urging foreign intervention amid concerns rebels could soon enter the city -- prompted government authorities to set an 8 p.m. (2 p.m. ET) curfew Sunday, Binoua said. Already, the lingering unrest has prompted the United Nations to relocate dependents and nonessential staff from the country and the U.S. Embassy in Bangui to shut down operations. The U.S. State Department said Thursday -- the same day U.S. troops were sent to Chad -- its ambassador and diplomatic team left the capital, but that the United States is not cutting off diplomatic relations with the turbulent African nation. Read more: U.S. diplomats leave Central African Republic . President Francois Bozize on Thursday asked for other nations' help in staving off rebel advances that threaten his rule. Bozize specifically called on France -- which ruled his country, then as a colony known as Ubangi-Shari, until it gained independence in 1960 -- and the United States to help ensure ""the rebels return home ... instead of destroying and killing Central Africans."" U.N. efforts have focused on calling for a disarmament process, but a lack of funding from the European Union meant such a program could not be carried out in the country's northeast, where there is fighting, Vogt said. France has a permanent presence of 200 to 300 military personnel at Bangui's airport under the mandate of the Economic Community of Central African States, and French President Francois Hollande ordered them to safeguard his nation's embassy earlier this week. But Hollande said Thursday that his nation's troops are not there to ""protect a regime,"" but instead protect French nationals and interests. France will not ""interfere in the internal affairs of a country, in this case, CAR,"" Hollande said, adding, ""That time is over."" Read more: CNN Inside Africa .

"(CNN) -- The annual report of national college rankings published by U.S. News & World Report is, regrettably, one of the most powerful forces in American higher education. I say ""regrettably"" because the list of rankings, although comprising data, surveys and statistics, doesn't even begin to express the quality, comprehensiveness and special character of the more than 4,000 colleges and universities in the country. The report is so powerful that an administrator at Claremont McKenna College, a small, elite liberal arts school in California, submitted inflated data in order to enhance the college's standing. Is anyone surprised by this revelation? Just as athletes use steroids and gambling happens at Rick's, colleges and universities succumb to their own set of pressures, including the desire to be on top in the rankings. U.S. News & World Report has been highly successful at inducing far too many high school students and their families to think that there are only a handful of colleges worth attending in the entire country, and by extension saying that if a student doesn't get into one of the 'select' few, then life will never be worth living. Attending a Tier 3 school doesn't make you a Tier 3 person, nor does enrolling at Princeton make you a prince. Ironically, we know from a survey of human resource managers (these are the people who actually hire college graduates) that the colleges they recruit from most enthusiastically are not necessarily the same as the ones U.S. News implies students should strive to enter. A college degree has become a 21st-century economic necessity. Getting into the ""best"" college is a national obsession. Many believe it's a passport to a golden future. Let's play a numbers game: 100 high school seniors each apply to 10 colleges; 1,000 applications are now in play. Each college hopes to enroll 10 students; 100 freshman spots are in the air. All of the 100 students will have a place to go to college but not every one will get into his or her first choice, nor will every college get its highest-ranked applicant. Students strive to make themselves extremely attractive to specific colleges, and colleges work hard to make themselves more appealing to specific students. The game is afoot. To stand out from the crowd of applicants, students try to game the system. They take prep courses to improve their SAT scores; enroll in ""easy"" classes to get higher grades; search out exotic internships; and play sports or music, or master additional foreign languages -- not because they necessarily want to but because they believe they have to in order to look outstanding. This is an unfortunate outgrowth of an overwrought system. And it should not be surprising to learn that schools also game the system by slicing and dicing their numbers in a fashion that makes them appear more appealing in one or more U.S. News category, and thus more attractive to potential students and their families. But gaming the system and providing enhanced data are two entirely different things. The first is, as I said before, regrettable, and the later -- providing inflated information -- is ""extremely regrettable."" My mother would call it lying. Americans love lists and rankings. And if a person can start out at the top, then all the better. For many people, scarcity breeds adoration: Everyone wants to go to Harvard because not everyone can go to Harvard (nor should they). As Super Bowl season comes to a close, we will sneak up on March Madness. There is an inexplicable correlation between the NCAA Final Four participants and increases in applications to those four schools. Everyone loves a winner. This is parallel to product placement in TV shows or movies. See James Bond drive an Aston-Martin and perhaps you'll come in to the showroom for a test drive. See Duke play basketball and perhaps you'll come to campus to meet Coach K. The rankings aren't going away. U.S. News & World Report has a highly profitable mare in its stable: The rankings are about making money. The business of U.S. News is to sell magazines -- online and in print. It is secondly about mission: providing consumers with a public service product in return for money. Colleges must do a better job of educating applicants to the limits (and some values) of the rankings ""racket."" The public must remember that there is no 'best' college for any one student. After an hour's conversation, I'll give a student a list of 20 schools where he or she will (a) get an excellent education (b) have a wonderful time (c) be able to afford the tuition, and (d) graduate. And I'm pretty sure my list of 20 and U.S. News' list of 20 are not necessarily the same. Is vichyssoise better than chicken soup with matzoh balls or just more satisfying to some people than to others? Frequently, it's a matter of taste more than nutrition.

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities arrested a 37-year-old Bronx woman on Thursday after she allegedly concocted a ruse in the wake of the Connecticut mass shooting and posed as a relative of one of the slain children. Nouel Alba is accused of using her Facebook account to solicit money from those wanting to donate to victims' families, claiming that the money was to be used for a ""funeral fund,"" according to a U.S. Justice Department statement. The donors apparently transmitted the money to a PayPal account controlled by Alba, who later allegedly lied about the scam to federal investigators, prosecutors said. Newtown: No more gifts, please . ""This arrest should serve as a warning to anyone who attempts to profit from this tragedy by contriving fraudulent schemes that exploit the many victims, their families and individuals who sincerely want to help,"" said Connecticut U.S. Attorney David Fein in a statement. On December 14, a 20-year old gunman opened fire in Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 26 people just after he killed his mother in their Newtown home. Alba has since been charged with lying to federal agents and was released on $50,000 bond. If convicted, she faces up to five years in jail and a maximum $250,000 fine. On December 19, CNN's ""AC360"" broadcast a story about the alleged ruse and interviewed Alba, who denied her involvement in the alleged scam. ""This says -- this has your e-mail on it. Right there,"" said CNN investigative producer David Fitzpatrick. ""This is about Noah Pozner's funeral."" ""I never sent that,"" Alba replied. Later, in the interview Alba identified one of her e-mail accounts presented by Fitzpatrick. ""Yeah, that's one of my gmails. ...Yeah, my personal account,"" she said during the interview.

"(CNN) -- Novak Djokovic began his Abu Dhabi title defense talking about donkey cheese, but he ended it with the perfect start to his preseason preparations. The world No. 1 retained his title in the Middle East exhibition event on Saturday, beating 11th-ranked Nicolas Almagro in a three-set final that should have blown away any remaining rustiness following his demolition of another Spaniard, David Ferrer, in the semis. Djokovic will now head to Australia for another warmup event, the mixed teams Hopman Cup, where he will line up with glamor girl Ana Ivanovic in Serbia's opening rubber against Italy's Andreas Seppi and Francesca Schiavone on Monday. The 25-year-old on Thursday denied claims that he has bought the world's entire supply of donkey cheese for his restaurant business back home. ""I did not expect this story was going to get so much attention, and everywhere in the world too,"" he told the Gulf News ahead of his first match at the Mubadala World Tennis Championship. ""There is a certain farm in Serbia that produces it and, as I understand it, it is the only farm in the world to do so, which is very interesting. ""They came to our restaurant and offered co-operation, so that is all. We are now thinking and seeing what we can do with that, but it is not true that I already bought the whole supply."" Australian Open champion Djokovic had to fight hard against Almagro -- who was a late replacement for the ill Rafael Nadal. He finally triumphed 6-7 (4-7) 6-3 6-4 in two hours and 35 minutes against the 27-year-old, who beat Serbian Janko Tipsarevic in another three-set match on Friday. ""Nico played an amazing game. He was hitting strong from the baseline and he wasn't giving me much time,"" Djokovic said. ""It was a close match and I am very satisfied with how I played. This is a top-level event and we all want to see where we are in readiness for the season. Hopefully I'll be back to defend my title."" World No. 9 Tipsarevic finished the six-man tournament in fourth place after losing 7-6 (7-4) 6-2 to fifth-ranked Ferrer in Saturday's playoff. The Hopman Cup began in Perth on Saturday, with Australia beating Germany 3-0 in Group A and Spain defeating South Africa 2-1 in Group B. Australia's win was helped by a knee injury suffered by Germany's former world No. 9 Andrea Petkovic, who has slipped out of the top 100 after suffering a series of physical problems in 2012. She led Australian 16-year-old Ashleigh Barty 6-4 in their singles match before retiring, and was then unable to play in the mixed doubles -- and is a major doubt for the season's opening grand slam in Melbourne next month. In the opening men's match, Bernard Tomic beat veteran Tommy Haas 7-6 (8-6) 3-6 7-5. Haas, ranked 31 places higher at 21st in the world, blew a 6-1 lead in the tiebreak and failed to serve out for victory at 5-4 ahead in the decider. Kevin Anderson gave South Africa an early lead when he beat Fernando Verdasco in straight sets, but Anabel Medina Garrigues leveled the tie with victory over Chanelle Scheepers and the Spaniards then won the doubles 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 10-8.","World No. 1 Novak Djokovic beats Nicolas Almagro in final of Abu Dhabi exhibition .

"(CNN) -- Russia's upper house of parliament has approved a controversial measure banning adoption of Russian children by U.S. families, Russian media reported Wednesday. The legislation now goes to President Vladimir Putin to be signed into law, the semiofficial RIA-Novosti news agency said. Read more: Russia's lower house approves bill to ban U.S. adoption . The legislation could affect hundreds of American families seeking to adopt. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to U.S. State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most popular country for U.S. citizens to adopt after China and Ethiopia. The U.S. Ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul tweeted that passage of the bill ""saddens"" him, but said he's open to dialogue. The bill also bars any political activities by nongovernmental organizations receiving funding from the United States, if such activities could affect Russian interests, the news agency said. The legislation also imposes sanctions against U.S. officials thought to have violated human rights. Read more: Russian lawmakers eye adoption ban to U.S. The vote in the Federation Council, Russia's upper house, was unanimous, but Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has criticized the bill. It is expected to be signed by Putin in coming days. Lawmakers in the State Duma, Russia's lower house of parliament, adopted the bill last week. The move by Russian politicians is widely seen as retaliation for a law that U.S. President Barack Obama signed on December 14. That bill, called the Magnitsky Act, imposes U.S. travel and financial restrictions on human rights abusers in Russia. ""The United States is concerned by measures in the bill passed in the Russian Duma today that, if it becomes law, would halt inter-country adoptions between the United States and Russia and would restrict the ability of Russian civil society organizations to work with American partners,"" U.S. State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell said last week. The Magnitsky Act is named in honor of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered the largest tax fraud in the country's history in the form of rebates claimed by government officials who stole money from the state. Magnitsky died in 2009 after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. The Russian bill's implementation would nullify a recent agreement between the United States and Russia in which the countries agreed to additional safeguards to protect children and parties involved in inter-country adoptions. ""American families have welcomed more than 60,000 Russian children into American homes over the past 20 years,"" Ventrell said last week. ""Just last month we implemented a bilateral adoptions agreement with Russia to improve safeguards for adopted children and their families. If Russian officials have concerns about the implementation of this agreement, we stand ready to work with them to improve it and remain committed to supporting inter-country adoptions between our two countries."" Only China has more adoptions to the United States than Russia. Backers of the Russian bill said American adoptive parents have been abusive, citing 19 deaths of Russian children since the 1990s. In 2010, an American woman caused outrage after she sent her adopted son back to Russia alone on a one-way flight, saying the boy, then 7, had violent episodes that made her family fear for its safety. Konstantin Dolgov, Russian Foreign Ministry's Special Representative for Human Rights, said on Twitter that Russia is ""well aware of, and have pointed out more than once, the inadequate protection of adopted Russian children in the US."" He also noted that the United States is one of three nations that has not signed the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child. Anthony Lake, U.N. Children's Fund executive director, touted the importance of ""inter-country adoption."" ""While welcoming Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev's call for the improvement of the child welfare system, UNICEF urges that the current plight of the many Russian children in institutions receives priority attention,"" Lake said. UNICEF asked that Russia let children's ""best interests"" guide the ""design and development of all efforts to protect children."" ""We encourage the government to establish a robust national social protection plan to help strengthen Russian families. Alternatives to the institutionalization of children are essential, including permanent foster care, domestic adoption and inter-country adoption,"" he said. The United States has signed but not ratified the convention, which has sparked concerns from conservatives over its impact on U.S. sovereignty and parental rights. Groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had urged lawmakers to reject the bill. ""This bill hits back at Russia's most vulnerable children and could deprive them of the loving families they desperately need,"" Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said last week. John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia program director, has said, ""this bill is frankly a childish response to the Magnitsky Act.""","Upper house of parliament OKs ban on adoptions of Russian children by U.S. families .

"(CNN) -- On a day of national celebration in Pakistan, the country's cricket team provided the perfect present for Quaid Day by defeating archrival India in its Twenty20 encounter in Bangalore, India. On the 136th anniversary since the birth of Father of the Nation, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's players marked the day in style with a hugely impressive performance. The Quaid-e-Azam was the man who helped secure the formation of the state of Pakistan on August 14, 1947, and went on to become the nation's first ever governor general. He is highly revered and his memory was not forgotten by Pakistan captain Mohammad Hafeez, who dedicated the victory to the national hero. ""It is a gift for the whole nation, it is Quaid day back home,"" said Hafeez following his team's five-wicket victory. India-Pakistan cricket series hit by media blackout . Pakistan's joy came following an enthralling contest during the first bilateral series between the two teams in five years. Needing to surpass India's 133-9, Pakistan fought back from a nightmare start to snatch victory with just two deliveries remaining. Pakistan's hope of trumping its fierce rival appeared to have faded when India reduced the visitor to 12-3. But Shoaib Malik, who is married to Indian tennis star Sania Mirza, hit 57 from 50 balls, which included a giant six to win the game. It was a game which India had looked set to run away with as openers Gautam Gambhir (43) and Ajinkya Rahane (42) put on 77 for the opening wicket. Tendulkar quits one-day internationals . But a huge collapse, which accounted for nine wickets and just 47 runs, allowed Pakistan back into the contest. Umar Gul took 3-21 and Saaed Ajmal 2-25 as India finished on 133-9 from its 20 overs. India's low total looked less than formidable but an early crisis almost left Pakistan facing an embarrassing defeat. Bhuvneshwar Kumar produced a blistering spell on debut, taking 3-9 as the top order was ripped apart. It was only when Malik and Hafeez finally got themselves into the contest with a 106-run partnership that Pakistan finally looked to threaten. When Hafeez fell for 61, the tourist needed 16 from the remaining 17 deliveries to win. And despite a few nervous moments, it was left to Malik to seal victory, smashing the ball for six with three balls to go before sparking scenes of celebrations amongst his teammates. Malik said: ""We were struggling when the debutant bowler, I don't remember his name, took those early wickets, Hafeez played a brilliant innings. ""You are playing against India, pressure is always there, but you have to play according to the situation.""","Pakistan defeated India by five wickets in Bangalore .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's first cricket tour of India in five years is set to be hit by a news blackout in an escalating row over press freedom. The high profile tour kicks off with a Twenty20 international in Bangalore on Christmas Day, but all the leading news agencies, such as Thomson-Reuters and Associated Press, have decided against filing match reports. The disagreement stems from an earlier decision by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to exclude photographic news agencies from covering games, including the recent Test series between India and England. ""It is regrettable that the politically-charged Pakistan tour will be affected by the BCCI's failure to recognize the long-standing importance of photographic news agencies in the flow of sport and news images every day,"" said the News Media Coalition, which represents a group of media organizations. ""As a direct result of the BCCI stance, great sporting moments from the cricket tours to India are going unrecorded and therefore lost forever. England's first four games were the hidden series and the Pakistan tour is heading for the same fate. That's not good for cricket -- nor for the image of India abroad,"" Andrew Moger, Executive Director of the NMC, was quoted on its website. The BCCI offered it's own photographic content for the India-England series, but newspapers and leading websites outside of India declined to use them. The BCCI is arguing that international news agencies such as Getty Images use the pictures for commercial as well as strictly editorial purposes and should pay a license fee. The World Association of Newspapers (WAN-IFRA), said in statement: ""All publishers, including those in India are concerned that the BCCI has decided to act against the photographic agency sector which has for years provided images for editorial customers in every country without problem. This is denying the ability of editors to select from the best of photography for the benefit of readers."" As the row over media coverage escalated, security has been stepped up at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ahead of the opening game. Police bomb squad officers with sniffer dogs have undertaken a painstaking search amid fears that the game could be disrupted by protests from Indian nationalist organizations. It is the first time Pakistan has visited India for a series of matches since the 2008 Mumbai attacks which led to a breakdown in diplomatic relations between the two sub-continent nations. But they did meet in the semifinal of last year's World Cup in the northern Indian city of Mohali when the prime ministers of both countries shook hands. Indian cricket fans are still digesting the news that their iconic batsman Sachin Tendulkar has retired from one-day internationals with immediate effect. The 39-year-old Tendulkar had already retired from Twenty20 internationals, but was expected to have been available for the three 50-over one day international matches against Pakistan over the New Year period. Over 3,000 Pakistan fans are expected to watch the opener and 60-year-old Mohammed Bashir, who lives in Chicago, told AFP that the fact the matches were going ahead at all was good news. ""That the teams are playing each other on Indian soil is in itself a big thing. We should not expect anything more to come out of this encounter,"" Bashir, who cut a colorful figure in the green and gold of Pakistan, said.","News blackout for India v Pakistan cricket series .

"(CNN) -- Frank Lampard underlined his continued value to Chelsea by scoring both goals in their 2-1 win at Everton Sunday as they went third in the English Premier League. South African Steven Pienaar gave Everton a second minute lead but former England international Lampard turned the game around for the visitors. The 34-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and reports have been linking him with a move away from the west London giants, even as early as the January transfer window. ""I know there is a lot of speculation and talk but I just want to continue playing,'' Lampard told Sky Sports after the match. ""I will always have Chelsea in me for life."" During his 12 years at the club, Lampard's goal tally from midfield has always proved a key factor in Chelsea's success and his well-placed 42nd minute header canceled out Pienaar's earlier opportunist effort. Everton, who are challenging strongly for a Champions League berth, hit the woodwork three times in a fine match, but came unstuck late on. Tim Howard saved from Juan Mata, but Lampard was in the right place to turn in the winner. Sylvain Distin made a last-ditch saving tackle to deny Fernando Torres a third for Chelsea before Nikica Jelavic wasted a chance for Everton to equalize. He shot straight at goalkeeper Ross Turnbull, a halftime replacement for Petr Cech, who has an injured ankle. The victory lifted Chelsea above Tottenham Hotspur into third place in the standings, still 11 points behind leaders Manchester United, but with a game in hand. In the later kickoff, Liverpool left Queens Park Rangers in deeper problems at the bottom of the table with a 3-0 win at Loftus Road. Liverpool manager Brendan Rogers did not travel with the team after going down with an infectious virus but it was Harry Redknapp's QPR who were left feeling under weather after a sorry performance. Luis Suarez took advantage of defensive frailties to score twice in the opening 16 minutes, taking his EPL tally for the season to 13. Danish defender Daniel Agger headed the third near the half hour mark and the game was effectively over as a contest. Liverpool move up to ninth with QPR on 10 points from 20 games, eight points adrift of safety.","Chelsea beat Everton 2-1 to go third in the English Premier League .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The alleged U.S. operative of a Mexican cartel was known as ""The Pretty One."" That was her alias in Mexico ""La Bonita, "" according to Mexican officials. This week the fugitive is back in Mexico in custody following her capture by U.S. authorities in the Los Angeles area on immigration violations. Anel Violeta Noriega Rios, 27, was the subject of a 5 million peso (about $375,000) reward by Mexican authorities and is charged in a 64-page criminal warrant issued in January 2010 in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas for alleged organized crime and drug trafficking, authorities said. Noriega Rios is an alleged member of the La Familia cartel based in the Mexican state of Michoacan, and she was one of its main U.S.-based operatives, authorities charge. The cartel is known to be ""extremely violent,"" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said. Mexican authorities charge that Noriega Rios helped oversee the cartel's methamphetamine distribution activities in California and Washington state, ICE officials said. The cartel also is allegedly engaged in cocaine and marijuana trafficking, kidnapping, extortion and producing methamphetamine for export to the United States, U.S. officials said. ICE officers and U.S. marshals arrested Noriega Rios without incident last week at her El Monte, California, residence, about 14 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, authorities said. Noriega Rios was arrested on ""administrative immigration violations,"" and two days later she was turned over to Mexican authorities at the border crossing in San Ysidro, California, U.S. officials said. U.S. and Mexican authorities exchanged ""strategic information"" that led to her capture, ICE officials said. ""Mexican officials note the case also demonstrates the ongoing commitment between ICE and the Office of the General Attorney of Mexico (PGR) to address matters of mutual concern,"" an ICE statement said this week. U.S. Department of Homeland Security databases show that Noriega Rios had been arrested and repatriated to Mexico five times between 2004 and 2005 by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol agents, and she had no U.S. criminal convictions, ICE officials said. She was delivered to Mexican authorities last week after ICE officers reinstated a prior order for her removal from 2004, ICE officials said. In a statement, David Marin, acting field office director of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations in Los Angeles, said U.S. authorities ""will continue to work closely with its law enforcement counterparts in Mexico to assure the safety of law abiding citizens in both nations.""

"(CNN)  -- Holders Chelsea stayed on course for the domestic double in England with a 3-0 win over Aston Villa at Wembley on Saturday to reach the FA Cup final. A Didier Drogba goal midway through the second half and further late strikes from Florent Malouda and Frank Lampard secured victory for Carlo Ancelotti's men in a game of otherwise few chances. They will face either Tottenham Hotspur or now-relegated Portsmouth, who play the second semifinal at Wembley on Sunday. Portsmouth will go into that match as massive underdogs and hardly encouraged by West Ham's 1-0 win over Sunderland in English Premier League action on Saturday, which confirms their demotion after a season of financial turmoil. Whoever reaches next month's showpiece will face a Chelsea side, who are leading the Premier League and playing with renewed vigor since their shock Champions League exit to Inter Milan. It was the 32nd goal of the season in all competitions for Ivory Coast star Drogba and one of his most important as he reacted quickly to divert home John Terry's shot which was going wide. Terry had been given the chance to shoot after a poor headed clearance from a corner by Villa center back Richard Dunne. The victory was sealed when substitute Michael Ballack crossed to the far post for the excellent Malouda to fire past Brad Freidel before Lampard scored a third with one of the final kicks of the match. It proved another Wembley letdown for Martin O'Neill's Villa, who were beaten in the English League Cup final by Manchester United. They started the match the brightest and had strong appeals for a penalty turned down by Howard Webb as Norway striker John Carew appeared to be pulled down by Jon Obi Mikel. But in the second half Chelsea, who thrashed Villa 7-1 in the Premier League last month, took command and although the margin of victory was flattering underlined their growing confidence at the business end of the English season. Lampard, who rounded off the win with his last-minute goal, said their confidence had increased after Drogba's opener. ""The double is still on, it'll be very tough but we want to go all the way,"" he told ITV Sport. In the other Premier League game played on Saturday, Burnley beat fellow strugglers Hull City 4-1 to re-energize their survival hopes, but both sides remain in the bottom three after West Ham's win.","Chelsea beat Aston Villa 3-0 to reach final of the English FA Cup .

"London (CNN) -- It would be a mistake to write off threats of war against Syria from Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as mere bluster, assuming that Turkey will maintain the status quo in valuing its relationship with the United States on one hand, while resisting Iran's hegemonic ambitions on the other. The recent cross-border confrontation could ignite regional convulsions as Turkey is sucked into Syria, leading to belated actions on the part of the international community. The Assad regime knows its time is limited as the rate of military and intelligence officers defecting to Jordan and Turkey increases in momentum. Rebel attacks are inching closer to the heart of the Assad regime, such as the recent attack on the Syrian air force intelligence compound in the Damascus suburb of Harasta. This contributes to the regime's recklessness in firing upon Turkey with impunity. Ankara may also be emboldened by the fact that Iran, a key Assad ally, could be limited in its ability to intervene due to its economic woes at home. This week its currency -- the rial -- plummeted in value due to a combination of sanctions and Tehran's own mismanagement of the economy. Turkey has less to lose by responding to Syrian aggression -- this rationale is supported by recent reports that Iran has withdrawn from Syria 275 members from a special operations unit attached to its elite Quds Force. The conflict in Syria is no longer considered a purely internal matter. It clearly has regional ramifications. Thus I believe Turkey's aim to secure its border is inextricably linked with regime change. Its increased military operations may stem from a calculus that it would accelerate the Assad regime's demise. The Turkish parliament's assent for its troops to conduct operations inside Syria is not merely a symbolic attempt to bolster Turkish pride while responding to domestic political pressure over the Syrian attacks. It gives its armed forces the ability to do more than defend its borders. It is also likely that NATO may assist Turkey -- a member state -- with the defense of its 560-mile border, creating a de facto humanitarian buffer zone, where the Syrian opposition could have a command post. However, this risks escalating the conflict into a NATO-led mission outside the framework of the U.N. Security Council -- the kind of interventionist measure Russia and China would oppose as they did in Libya. The shift towards conflict with Syria is characterized by the kind of strategic shift in the region that we've seen before with Turkey. Erdogan was initially reluctant to impose sanctions on Iran and is now embracing EU sanctions on Tehran. The Turkish premier was also supportive of Iran's nuclear ambitions all the while seeking to downgrade relations with Tehran's nemesis, Israel. Now it is aligning itself with the Sunni bloc, including Gulf states and Jordan against Iran and its Syrian proxy. This could prompt an Iranian military response and in turn instigate another spike in oil prices. The longer the Syrian civil war continues, the greater the prospect of regional sectarian tensions emerging along Sunni-Shiite fault-lines. This could result in a Middle Eastern Cold War between regional powerhouses Saudi Arabia, with its mainly Sunni population, and the Shiite-dominated Iranians. Meanwhile, The Obama administration's apparent strategy of ""leading from behind"" is an excuse for its dithering over the Syrian humanitarian crisis. Similarly, the United Nations' inaction over the crisis results from a deadlock at the Security Council, with China and Russia opposed to any intervention -- implausibly advocating that the rebels conduct dialogue with a murderous regime. Yet with the UN's extensive history of paying lip service to upholding the values of human rights while ignoring genocide in Rwanda, Sudan, Balkans and Iraq, its dismissive manner towards the current massacres taking place on a daily basis in Syria should come as no surprise. There are estimates that up to 50,000 people have been killed, with up to two million people internally displaced since the conflict started. The U.N. claims that 300,000 Syrians have fled the country. The U.S., realistically the only nation with the necessary military and logistical capability, could easily have prevented the refugee crisis that has heightened the prospect of conflict with Turkey. Its wariness to arm rebels was to prevent blowback from the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood and other empowered Islamists in Syria. Yet the protracted conflict there has generated a kaleidoscopic civil-war and vacuum of governance across much of Syria that has attracted Islamists, and even revived al-Qaeda, enabling it to infiltrate the ranks of the opposition and gain support in the wake of its attacks on Syrian military and government installations. The U.S. and its NATO allies could also have prevented much bloodshed by using air power to target the Assad regime's military apparatus. Syria's military concentrated in Damascus, Aleppo and northern Raqqa province are strained and would be overstretched if forced to respond to external military pressure. Yet Washington and its NATO allies could now be forced to place a significant number of troops on the ground to prevent the proliferation of Syria's stockpile of chemical and biological weapons. The Obama administration has resigned itself to wishful thinking assuming, as Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has done, that Syrian security forces could be held together to secure chemical weapons sites in the wake of the toppling of the Assad regime. In a vacuum of governance dominated by Islamists, this may become a proliferation nightmare. While the U.S. is keen on winding down its involvement in the Middle East to refocus its attention on Asia, Syria may be the instigator that sucks it back into the region for another decade to manage a second Cold War. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barak Seener.","Turkey's military retaliated against Syria attacks on Turkish border town recently .

"(RollingStone.com) -- Cee Lo Green, Blake Shelton, Adam Levine and Christina Aguilera -- all four coaches of ""The Voice"" -- joined producer Mark Burnett, host Carson Daly and the show's social media maven Christina Milian for a press conference Sunday night at Burnett's Malibu home. Looking out at the panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean, Levine quipped, ""So this is what reality TV buys you."" That, or maybe just knowing what makes for good TV. And Burnett and his team have demonstrated a knack for spotting opportunities. Last season there was shock among fans when singer Jesse Campbell, one of the favorites to win the title, was eliminated by coach Christina Aguilera. Even her fellow coaches expressed their disbelief. This season, which starts September 10th, they'd be able to do something about it, thanks to a new element called ""the Steal,"" which allows judges to pick up a contestant who's been ousted by another coach. Journalists got a sneak peak at a recently taped battle round between two of Green's competitors, who each delivered a smoking rendition of Mariah Carey's ""Vision of Love."" As soon as Green carried out the unenviable task of choosing just one, the other coaches hammered on their buttons and made their pitches to bring the loser onto one of their teams, just like they do in the battle rounds. Judges can only pick two additional team members, which will lead to a new cycle of the show called ""Knockout Rounds,"" where the teams will pare down before beginning the live episodes. The new opportunity for poaching has added a lot to the show, the coaches told Rolling Stone. ""It's nice to throw those elements in to kind of spice things up,"" Levine said. ""Those things definitely help keep it fresh for us."" It also adds more pressure, Shelton said. ""There's nothing that's more nervewracking than knowing, 'Okay, both these singers did really good and I gotta pick one and I know damn good and well one of these other three are gonna steal the person I don't pick,'"" he said. ""There's a chance that person may go on and win this and that's gonna make me look really stupid. That definitely goes on in your mind. As an artist and somebody on television I have enough of an ego that I don't want to look that stupid. I want to look brilliant."" Ultimately, though, he recognizes it's great for the show and viewers. ""It's going to be so exciting for people watching at home,"" Shelton said. ""Here's the truth, as much as we want to sit up here and talk about how different this show is, and it is, what people love the most is those damn buttons. People love to see us hit those buttons and somebody's life is changed at that moment. This is another way of changing somebody's life later on in the show, where they think all hope is lost, they're going home, the next thing you know the button gets pushed and they're right back in the game again. That's pretty exciting."" The new components add another element to what Levine, Aguilera and Shelton call ""the best season yet."" Only Green holds out on that, saying, ""A few memorable things have happened thus far, but season three isn't completed yet, so I don't know if this is the favorite season yet."" For the four coaches, though, the biggest strength of this season is their bond. In the first clip shown at the junket, the four are seen performing the Rolling Stones' ""Start Me Up,"" and they resembled a band, much more than they did in the combined performances of the first two seasons. What helped meld them into a tight, family-like unit is the way all four work with contestants, Aguilera said. ""Over time we see how each of us react as coaches, giving such heartfelt advice and attention to these up-and-coming young fresh talents and it's so nice to see,"" she said. ""It's refreshing because we came into it not wanting to knock anybody down and I think we all respect that. We might take shots at each other, but never the talent. So there's just a magic, there's a bond there that's unbreakable at this point."" Shelton concurred, recognizing the quartet is now joined together by the success of the series. ""We're always going to be connected to each other through this show,"" he says. He admitted there have been some rough moments, like any family. ""We've been through a lot of s**t with each other, no doubt,"" he said. ""We've had fights, ups and downs and weird moments and f**k-offs and all that stuff. But all friends go through that I think and you either go through it and you never speak to each other again or you go through it and your relationship is even stronger. We didn't have to come back together, but we did, and our relationships are stronger."" Levine agreed that the coaches have left the rockiest moments behind them. ""We are getting along better than we ever have and I guess our energies have all congealed and we're very, very close at this point,"" he said. The show will run this year in both the fall and spring seasons, which could result in one or more of the coaches having to take a sabbatical to go on tour. Although Burnett said the coaches have their ""chairs for live,"" the assembled journalists were keen to speculate on who the replacement coaches might be. Green shut down the speculation while nicely summing up the bond among the current four. ""For me, there's nobody comes to mind that can replace my Blake, my Adam and my Christina,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- His journey started in Nigeria, a taunted teenager with large tumors on his face, driven into deep despair. Eleven years later, Victor Chukwueke has undergone numerous surgeries and is a step closer to achieving his dream of becoming a doctor. In a rare act, the United States Congress passed a private bill last week granting Chukwueke permanent residency after years of his living in Michigan on an expired visa. The bill is awaiting President Barack Obama's signature. ""The day Congress passed the bill was one of the happiest days of my life,"" says Chukwueke, who left Nigeria as a teen in 2001 to get treatment for the tumors. Private bills -- which only apply to one person and mostly focus on immigration -- seldom pass. His is the only private bill to pass in Congress in two years. ""I was overwhelmed with joy; it was nothing less than a miracle,"" the 26-year-old says. ""Only in this country can so many miraculous and wonderful things happen to someone like me."" Before coming to the United States at age 15, Chukwueke lived in the southeastern Nigeria town of Ovim. He suffers from neurofibromatosis, a genetic disorder that causes massive life-threatening tumors on his face. Treated as an outcast because of his deformed face, he was depressed and humiliated, he says. His family abandoned him at an orphanage. Nuns from the Daughters of Mary Mother of Mercy rescued him from the orphanage more than a decade ago and arranged for a Michigan doctor to perform surgery on him. He says he considers himself lucky to have developed the tumors. ""Without them, I would not have met the nun, left Nigeria, arrived in the U.S. and had the miracle to attend medical school,"" he says. He lives with the nuns in Oak Park, Michigan. They have cared for him since he came to the U.S., where he has undergone seven surgeries, including one that left him blind in the right eye. Doctors performed Chukwueke's surgeries over a period of time, he says, which contributed to his expired visa. Despite the obstacles, he remains committed to getting an education. ""My own personal struggles to receive treatment have motivated and encouraged me to pursue a medical career ... to alleviate the pain and suffering of others,"" he says. ""A medical career will allow me many gratifying years of making a difference in the health and lives of others. I strongly believe one can make another person's life worthy of living ... I have experienced it."" He finished his GED -- the equivalent of a high school education -- while undergoing treatment and enrolled at a community college. A benefactor later helped him attend Wayne State University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in biochemistry and chemical biology last year. He had a 3.82 GPA and gave the university's commencement speech. ""Should I call myself a victim, or should I press forward to my dreams?"" he asked during the speech amid thunderous applause. Soon after his graduation, the University of Toledo in Ohio admitted him to medical school. The only hurdle: The program requires him to have permanent residency status, also known as a green card. Though he qualifies for the DREAM Act, which gives immigrants who came to the United States as minors temporary residency, the measure would not give him the permanent status mandated by the university, according to his attorney. And so began Chukwueke's journey to get legalized, a quest that has seen strangers rally to his help. His attorney Thomas K. Ragland took his case pro bono. ""Victor's story is remarkable,"" says Ragland, who is based in Washington D.C. ""Here is this kid who comes from Nigeria, he was taunted and teased for his diseases, and he comes to this country and excels, despite so many surgeries. It is a testament of not letting anything get in the way."" Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, sponsored the bill, S. 285. The measure passed the Senate in the summer and the House last week . ""Already, his example has enriched Michigan and our nation, but I know that his contributions to our country are only beginning,"" Levin said in a statement. The number of illegal immigrants in the United States was estimated at 11.5 million last year. If Obama signs the bill, the State Department will reduce by one the number of immigrant visas available to Nigerians. That signature, Chukwueke says, will be his favorite holiday gift.","Victor Chukwueke's visa expires after he comes to the U.S. for treatment of tumors .

"(CNN) -- Lionel Messi scored his 91st and final goal of 2012 on Saturday as Barcelona enjoyed a comfortable 3-1 win over Real Valladolid at the Estadio Jose Zorrilla. The Argentine forward's 60th minute goal -- courtesy of his trusty left boot -- doubled the league leaders' lead after Xavi had opened the scoring two minutes before halftime. The home side halved the deficit in the 89th minute when Javi Guerra scored before Cristian Tello added a third for Barcelona in injury time. The result leaves Barcelona nine points clear at the top of the table with 49 points from 17 games as La Liga heads into a Christmas break. The win followed an announcement by the Catalan club on Saturday that coach Tito Vilanova had been released from hospital following an operation to remove a tumor from a salivary gland.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Growing up, Heather Davis wasn't the kind of kid people would have called fat or even chubby. Heather Davis weighed 250 pounds and wore a size 22 at her heaviest. She lost 110 pounds and wears a size 4. Like many children, Heather studied hard, did her homework and played sports after school. During elementary school, she remembers being thin -- but things started to change as she approached adolescence. ""My bad eating habits began during my 'latchkey kid' years,"" says Davis. ""In high school and middle school, I played sports, but with a diet of Doritos and soda for lunch ... large family dinners ... I became overweight."" During her senior year in high school, Davis, who is 5 feet 9 inches tall, weighed 200 pounds. ""We had a meat-and-potatoes family. We had dessert every night and I was a member of the 'clean your plate club,' remembers Davis. ""It caught up with me."" By the time she was 22 and attending graduate school, Davis' weight had ballooned to 250 pounds. Davis says her weight gain was caused by major life transitions -- triggered by emotional eating, a junk-food diet and lack of exercise. Davis dreaded shopping for clothes and said she found it hard to find stylish, age-appropriate clothing for her bigger body. She says it was a struggle to look neat and put together as most of her shirts ""hugged every roll."" Looser-fitting clothing, she says, made her feel as if she were wearing a tent. The additional weight also began to take a physical toll. Everyday tasks such as walking up stairs or in the shopping mall started to become difficult. Davis says she was constantly hot and any physical exertion would cause her to sweat, even in below-freezing temperatures. Life became a constant struggle. ""I would get hot a lot because of the extra weight I was carrying. Picture yourself with a 100-pound backpack on,"" says Davis. ""That was what it was like climbing the escalator. My knees hurt. My back [and] shoulders hurt a lot."" Davis, who lives in Washington, says she had tried everything to lose weight, such as low-carb and low-fat diets and even starvation. But one day, something clicked. ""I was on the campus shuttle and saw the Gold's Gym,"" Davis says, ""And, I said 'I can go down into the Metro and go home and eat my Ben & Jerry's [ice cream]. Or, I can go over there and really do this. Just do this!'"" Watch Davis' dramatic weight loss transformation . Davis remembered her grandmother -- with whom she'd been extremely close -- who had died from heart failure brought on by years of unhealthy eating and lack of exercise. ""She will never get to see my wedding, children or experience other joys in her life,"" Davis says. Davis says there wasn't any defining experience or ""lightbulb"" moment that forced her to make a change. It was the realization that after years of failed diets and the physical toll of obesity, she'd had enough. During her first visit to the gym, Davis says she could barely handle 15 minutes on the treadmill. But she stayed on track by reminding herself that weight loss was going to be hard work and there was no easy way out. She did cardio exercise for two weeks and began modifying her diet by cutting out starches, ice cream and pizza. Within the first two weeks, she had lost 8 pounds. She was motivated by the positive results and gradually increased her cardio, incorporated weight training and continued to change her diet. Davis remained determined, and over the next 12 months, with the support of her family and regular check-ins with a gym trainer, she lost 110 pounds. She went from wearing a plus-size 22 to wearing a size 4 or 6. The weight loss and healthier lifestyle boosted the 31-year-old's self-confidence and gave her access to a richer, fuller life. ""My days of treating my body badly are over,"" says Davis. ""I focus on things I enjoy such as European travel, language classes and beach vacations."" Staying healthy for Davis means eating in moderation and incorporating fun forms of exercise into her daily life. She no longer owns a vehicle and enjoys long walks in downtown Washington. She's also set another goal for herself -- a second graduate degree -- which she hopes will allow her to help others. ""I'm working on my master's in public health because all of this health awareness has made me want to help other people,"" Davis says. ""Obesity is reaching epidemic proportions and I will take pleasure using both experience and scientific knowledge toward planning and evaluating programs designed to help people incorporate healthy behaviors into their lives."" Davis is training to run a half-marathon and is running up to 6 miles. She says even though she's lost 110 pounds, she's still the same person -- outgoing, and more importantly -- happy. She's also become an inspiration for people who desperately want to lose weight. ""If I can do it, anybody can do it,"" says Davis.  iReport.com: Have you lost weight?

"New York (CNN) -- A helicopter that crashed into the East River, killing two of the five people aboard, was over its weight capacity when it went down in October 2011, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report released Thursday. The initial aviation accident report from the NTSB did not specify the exact cause of the crash. However, it stated the weight of the helicopter at takeoff was over its capacity by more than 250 pounds. The report said the Bell 206 chopper had a capacity of 3,200 pounds, based on the manufacturer's specifications. When the helicopter was weighed two days after the accident by a company that specializes in aircraft weight-and-balance services, that company said ""the takeoff weight at the time of the accident was calculated to be 3,461.2 pounds."" It was reported at the time of the crash that the flight was to take friends visiting from abroad on a sightseeing flight around New York City. Shortly after takeoff, the helicopter, its pilot and his four passengers went down into the East River and sank in 35-feet-deep water. In addition to the two killed in the crash, a third passenger died about a month afterward from injuries suffered in the incident, the NTSB said. The pilot Paul Dudley, 56, reported that he had calculated the total load at takeoff to be 1,131 pounds. However, the NTSB report cited a post-accident interview in which the front-seat passenger said Dudley did not ask for anyone's weight nor did he execute any paperwork, or perform any calculations before takeoff. Dudley released a statement Thursday noting ""several inconsistencies"" in the NTSB report and claiming the cause of the crash was due to an unanticipated ""loss of tail rotor effectiveness."" The statement went on to mention Dudley's ""unblemished"" 28-year aviation record and said that he is still recovering and mourning the loss of his friends every day. The final report from the NTSB is expected to be released within the next few months and it will officially state the probable cause of the crash, according to Keith Holloway, public affairs officer of the agency.","The helicopter crash in October 2011 killed two of five people aboard .

"(CNN) -- George Hochsprung's world began to crumble Friday when one of the students at the Connecticut middle school where he works walked up to him. Something was happening at the elementary school less than 10 miles away where Hochsprung's wife was principal, the student said, holding a computer. There were reports his wife had been killed. Hochsprung rushed out of the building, one of dozens of family members of students and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, desperately seeking information about their loved ones that day. His wife, Dawn, was in a meeting that morning when a 20-year-old local man blasted his way into the elementary school armed with three guns. She stepped out of the meeting to find out what was going on and never returned. She was among the 26 people shot and killed inside the school by the gunman, Adam Lanza, who then turned a weapon on himself. Twenty of the dead were children. As people across the world struggle to comprehend Lanza's atrocious acts, George Hochsprung has been left with a future that no longer makes sense. He is more than 20 years older than his wife, who was 47 when she died. He never imagined he would outlive her. ""Dawn and I built this beautiful house in the Adirondacks, our dream,"" he said in an interview Sunday night, sitting on a couch surrounded by his three daughters and one of his stepdaughters. ""It was going to be Dawn's house because I was going to die,"" he said, explaining that they had included extra rooms in the house, so that their children and grandchildren could come keep his wife company after he was gone. ""And now it's me,"" he said. ""I don't think I can do that."" He is now leaning on the support of their children and 11 grandchildren, but even that seems incongruous to him. ""My job has always been to take care of other people,"" he said. Slain principal remembered as energetic, positive, passionate . Fittingly for two people who had made their careers in education, the couple met at a school, Rogers Park Middle School in Danbury, Connecticut. It's the same school where he was working Friday. He was a good deal older when they met, but she was his superior in the school hierarchy: She was an assistant principal, and he was a seventh-grade math teacher. ""I just fell in love with her,"" he said. But it took a little while for him to persuade her to marry him: ""She turned me down five times."" Once he won her over, their wedding was influenced by their mutual love of sailing, taking place on a boat at sea near the Connecticut port of Mystic a decade ago. They had both been married previously, and their union brought together three daughters on his side and two on hers. One of her two daughters, Erica, described a devoted mother. ""Every practice, she was there,"" she said. ""All of my sister's cheerleadering stuff, she was there. Every dance competition. She was doing homework on the bleachers, but she was there. And she was my rock."" Dawn Hochsprung's commitment to her family was closely matched by her dedication to her students, according to friends and family members. ""She was really nice and very fun, but she was also very much a tough lady in the right sort of sense,"" according to Tom Prunty, a friend, whose niece goes to Sandy Hook and was uninjured Friday. ""She was the kind of person you'd want to be educating your kids. And the kids loved her."" Her decision to step out into danger when the shooting began has left her husband with some difficult emotions. ""Dawn put herself in jeopardy, and I have been angry about that,"" he said. But that changed Sunday, he said, when he met two teachers who told him that his wife had instructed them to take shelter while she confronted Lanza. ""She could've avoided that,"" George Hochsprung said. ""But she didn't; I knew she wouldn't. So, I'm not angry anymore."" His voice wavering, he continued: ""I'm not angry. I'm just very sad.""","Dawn Hochsprung was principal of the school were 26 people were massacred .

"Sydney, Australia (CNN) -- In Ireland it took years to weed out the details of systemic sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy. In Australia, Prime Minister Julia Gillard has put no time limit on what will be the most wide-ranging inquiry into child sex abuse in the nation's history -- one that will not be confined to the Catholic Church. As she announced the establishment of a Royal Commission into institutional responses to instances and allegations of child sex abuse, Gillard said the inquiry would not target any one church but would encompass all religious institutions, state institutions, schools and not-for-profit groups like scouts and sports clubs. ""There have been too many revelations of adults who have averted their eyes from this evil,"" she said. The evil of which she speaks is said by the mother of one victim to be endemic. Pat Feenan's son, Daniel, is now 36 years old. ""Every morning he opens his eyes, he walks with that pain,"" she told CNN. Daniel was an 11-year-old altar boy at St Patrick's Church in Maitland in the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, when the abuse began at the hands of Father James Patrick Fletcher, who died in prison after being found guilty of child abuse -- including that of Daniel. The family were devout Catholics when Fletcher was assigned to the parish and to the Feenan family, who opened their home to him. Soon after, the grooming began, and in time, the family says, so did the abuse. According to court evidence, throughout Daniel's high school years Fletcher forced him into violent oral and anal sex, often in open spaces and always under threat. Fletcher would tell Daniel their ""special time"" together should be kept secret lest Fletcher hurt one of Daniel's brothers. The abuse ended when Daniel was 17. Seven years later he went to the police. Though he was later contrite, the archbishop of the diocese tipped off the abuser, moving him to another parish, according to a police investigation. ""I am ready and willing to help the Royal Commission in any way I can,"" Pat Feenan told CNN. ""And so is my courageous son. He's brave. He was the first in the Maitland Archdiocese who had to testify in court. My Daniel had to go through the pain of the inquisition and the media and the reporting of the horrible details. ""He knows he has played a part in this, and he knows I fought really hard for this Royal Commission and for justice. He feels vindicated,"" she added. Vindication is not something the Royal Commission can deliver Chrissy and Anthony Foster of Victoria. ""Our girls were assaulted at school by the local Catholic priest,"" Anthony Foster told CNN. ""They were five years old and up, raped multiple times over many years. It went on for several years -- we think about five years with Emma and with Katie probably about three or four years,"" he said. When Emma was 14, parish priest Kevin O'Donnell, now deceased, was convicted of the sexual assault of 13 others. During his trial, testimony was offered that he had abused consistently from 1946 until he was brought before the courts. When Emma heard news of his conviction, she began to harm herself, the family says. ""We saw her with blood pouring out of her wrists,"" said Foster, ""taking heroin to dull the pain."" When she was 26, Emma killed herself. Katie's story is equally tragic. When she 14, her parents found a suicide note she had written along with her diary in which she had detailed how O'Donnell had abused her. The Fosters were alarmed when they saw their daughter had begun to binge drink. A year later, just before her 16th birthday, tragedy struck. ""She was at a friend's house,"" Foster told CNN. ""She was drunk, crossed the road and was hit by a car. She has severe brain injuries,"" he said. ""She has pre-accident memory. But she can't run her life. She has a five-minute window on life,"" added Foster. Katie and Emma Foster's abuser is buried in the Catholic Church crypt at Melbourne Cemetery. Prime Minister Gillard insists the inquiry -- with the power to compel witnesses, offer indemnities and seize documents -- is not aimed at the Catholic Church. ""This is a Royal Commission which will be looking across religious organizations as well as state-based care and the not-for-profit sector. It is not targeted at any one section or religion,"" she said. However, the only religious leader Gillard consulted after she decided on the Royal Commission was the Catholic Archbishop, Cardinal George Pell. A divisive figure, Cardinal Pell defended himself and his church against claims last week of systemic cover-ups by the church hierarchy. As calls for a national inquiry grew louder in the wake of explosive claims by a senior police officer that the church was complicit in the crimes by moving offending priests and destroying crucial evidence to stymie prosecutions, Cardinal Pell said the Catholic Church was being disproportionately targeted. ""We have to answer up for what we've done,"" Cardinal Pell told his congregation on the weekend. ""But any suggestion that we are the only culprit or only community producing culprits is entirely misleading,"" he preached. But others disagree. ""This is really an inquiry into the Catholic Church and the cover-up,"" Foster told CNN. ""It's all the revelations of abuse in the church that brought this to a head. We know there is other sexual abuse, but this has come about because of rampant sexual abuse by Catholic Church clergy,"" he said. For Pat Feenan and her son Daniel, the Royal Commission is most certainly about the sins of the Catholic Church and what he sees as the lack of compassion shown to its victims. ""We went through the whole trial with no support from the church,"" she told CNN. ""The priests supported Fletcher, to see how he was, to pray with him. We were in the same courthouse, and no one came near us. The church community were not encouraged to be mindful of the victim. There were prayers for the priests and not for the victim. That's not fair,"" she said. As for the police officer who blew the whistle on both fellow officers and the church for covering up the abuse, the announcement represents an opportunity. ""Now we're going to start listening to the victims and start listening to their families,"" said Detective Chief Inspector Peter Fox. ""And we're going to start doing something about the problem. The big problem is denial, when you're not prepared to sit down and actually start to acknowledge that there's a problem and look at ways of fixing it,"" he said. Gillard said her government will consult with victims' support groups, religious organizations and state and territory governments to determine the Royal Commission's terms of reference.","Australia to investigate institutional responses to allegations of child sex abuse .

"(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. ""We got a regrettable result,"" Noda said. ""The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ."" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. ""The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,"" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. ""The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,"" Abe said. Abe said plans to take a strong stand Japan's territorial disputes with China and its other neighbors but also seek to improve relations with Beijing. The LDP didn't necessarily regain all Japanese voter confidence, Abe said, adding that voters rejected the ""political confusion"" spawned by the DPJ. But the results of the poll show voters decided to again embrace the LDP and its many years of governing. ""Because the Liberal Democrats have been in power traditionally for quite a long time they're seen as more a competent governing party,"" said John Lee, an adjunct associate professor at the Center for International Security Studies at Sydney University. ""The day-to-day business of the current party is seen as pretty dismal."" Read more: Shinzo Abe 2.0:China's economic hope? Noda's DPJ was expected to receive a pounding after disappointing the electorate during its three years in power. In 2009, hopes were high that the party could reverse the rigor mortis that had taken hold of the country's economy. Then in March 2011, a monstrous earthquake and tsunami swamped large regions of the country's north, adding a hefty reconstruction bill to the government's growing debt. Figures out Friday show business confidence is sliding as the high yen restricts export earnings and worried consumers curb their spending. It follows figures released last week showing the country has slipped into recession. The leading contenders in Japan's national election started their 12-day campaign in Fukushima, the coastal prefecture that became the focal point of last year's disaster after the quake and tsunami crippled a nuclear plant there, causing the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986 in Ukraine. The devastated landscape is a reflection of the economic woes that successive Japanese leaders have tried and failed to contend with for years -- a shrinking economy that's no longer competitive on the world stage in close proximity to a rising economic powerhouse, China. Read more: Back to the future in Japan . In his first official campaign speech in Fukushima, Abe focused on economic arguments, saying he would act to counter deflation, weaken the yen and promote economic stability. ""We'll regain economic power in Japan,"" he said. He has promised to tackle deflation, calling for monetary easing by the Bank of Japan to achieve an inflation rate of 2%. Abe also wants the Bank of Japan to buy government bonds to fund a range of public works to stimulate the economy. ""He wants to effectively throw credit at the economy again, which a lot of economists say will just deepen Japan's problems and deepen Japan's debt. But Abe's priority is to reverse deflation, which is obviously a crippling phenomenon in the Japanese economy,"" Lee said. Read more: Could 'Abe trade' be justified? Since assuming power in September 2011, Noda has struggled to contend with the country's economic struggles. His deal-making over a financial bill effectively ended his term, forcing him to dissolve the lower house in exchange for opposition support. He seized on a popular backlash against nuclear energy after the Fukushima meltdown and promised to phase out nuclear power by 2040. However, Noda faced fierce resistance to his plan to raise government revenue by doubling the 5% sales tax by October 2015. Now that that's done, Noda's likely successor is set to inherit a smoother ride, said Keith Henry, founder of the consulting firm Asia Strategy. ""When you think about it, the consumption tax is through. All (Abe) has to do is put a budget together for next year, which should not be that difficult. And if he can, then they have upper house elections in July, and it could be fairly smooth sailing for him for at least a year, maybe two.""

"(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier accused of killing 16 Afghan villagers in a shooting rampage could face the death penalty if he is found guilty in a court-martial. The military has referred the case of Staff Sgt. Robert Bales to a court-martial authorized to consider capital punishment, according to a military statement released Wednesday. Another six Afghans were wounded in the spree near a small U.S. base in Afghanistan's Kandahar province last March, the military said. ""The charges are merely accusations, and the accused is presumed innocent until proven guilty,"" the military emphasized in its statement. Bales' defense attorney John Henry Browne said Wednesday he didn't receive any notice from the Army or the prosecutors about the decision to pursue the death penalty; he said he found out about it through the media. ""That's how much we seem to matter to the prosecutors and the general,"" quipped Browne. ""I am concerned this is a death penalty case, but I am not surprised. We've prepared him for this. He knows he's being singled out,"" Browne said. ""We understand that decision, but we think it's totally irresponsible of the government and the Army,"" Bales' lawyer said. ""We think the Army is attempting to escape responsibility for the decision to send Sgt. Bales to Afghanistan for his fourth deployment, knowing that he had (post-traumatic stress disorder) and a concussive head injury,"" Browne said. ""I think that the person who made the decision to send Sgt. Bales to the most dangerous area in Afghanistan in a small outpost is responsible for Sgt. Bales being in Afghanistan, and he should have never been there."" Bales' wife, Karilyn, has called the accusations ""completely out of character of the man I know and admire."" In a statement released Wednesday, she wrote, ""I no longer know if a fair trial for Bob is possible, but it very much is my hope and I will have faith."" She and their children visit Bales every weekend, and ""for a few hours I can see and feel the love that flows"" between them, she added. Afghan authorities have pushed for swift action. ""He committed a mass killing crime, and we would like the court in the United States to implement justice and punish him according to the crime,"" Ahmad Zia Syamak, a spokesman for Afghan President Hamid Karzai, told CNN last month. But Browne said prosecutors may regret hastily moving the case forward. ""The reality is almost every death case in the Army -- almost every -- has been overturned on appeal, and there hasn't been an execution in the Army since the early '60s,"" Browne said, referencing the 1961 hanging of Pvt. John Bennett. Read more: Afghan survivor: 'He just started shooting' CNN's Josh Levs and Paul Vercammen contributed to this report .","NEW: Staff Sgt.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Apple's share price has fallen more than 25% since its record high set three months ago -- no less than five analysts have lowered their price targets for the U.S. technology giant in the past few days. To make matters worse for Apple, Android smartphones continue to reign supreme in global market share: for every one such device running on Apple's iOS, about seven smartphones running Android's operating system are computing away. Is Apple losing its bite? In the short-term, investors and analysts seem to think so. But in the medium-term, they believe milestones exist that can put the shine back on Apple's share price and image. Apples do fall . On September 19, Apple's share price closed at a historic high of $702.10, exactly one week after the debut of the iPhone 5. But as the freshness of the device's latest iteration wore off, so did the bullishness for Apple's stock. On December 17, it fell below the psychological $500-mark, to slide below $497 in pre-market trading. The company's share price quickly climbed above that threshold that day but still sits at lows not seen since mid-February. The dive in Apple's share price has also been attributed to a cut in orders from its parts suppliers. One fear is that Apple may have produced too many iPhone 5s in the current quarter and it may now need to scale back manufacturing in 2013. Analysts from UBS, Citibank, Mizuho, Canaccord and Pacific Crest all cut their price targets on Apple leading to a further drop in the Cupertino-based company's share price. Another fear is that the iPhone 5 has not been selling as well as previous versions; however that has now been debunked. A record 19 million iPhone 5 units are estimated to have been sold in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to a survey by Morgan Stanley, which would represent a 33% year-on-year increase. Apple also sold more than two million iPhone 5 units in China when it debuted this past weekend. ""Customer response to iPhone 5 in China has been incredible, setting a new record with the best first weekend sales ever in China,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, in a press release. ""The Company remains on track to launch in 100 countries by the end of the year. In our view, this is a positive,"" said RBC's Amit Daryanani. Comparing Apples To Androids . But for all the hope and the hype that surrounds Apple, Android smartphones reign supreme in terms of market share by operating system. Investment research firm Morningstar says Apple has much work to do in 2013. ""Although Apple has a robust product pipeline and ample opportunity to gain share in its various end markets, short product life cycles and intense competition will prevent the firm from resting on its laurels,"" it wrote in a statement. Globally, less than two in ten smartphones that shipped in the third quarter of 2012 sported Apple's iOS operating software. But in that same period, Google's Android platform ran 75% of smartphones around the world. This also represented a 91.5% increase over the same quarter in 2011, according to International Data Corporation. Apple's iOS claimed just under a 15% market share in the same period. Apple's next crop . Despite the recent release of the iPhone 5, analysts are already looking ahead to Apple's potential product releases for 2013 to pull the company's share price up. ""For Apple we believe the sell-off is nearing a bottom but we acknowledge the fears around margins, maps, emerging markets, competition and execution. The company clearly needs to ease these concerns in the near future,"" said Barclays' Ben Reitzes. ""It may take another round of new products and innovations to regain investor confidence and help drive another run."" One analyst from Jefferies predicts an iPhone 5S may ship in the summer of 2013 and that iPhone 6 prototypes already exist. Speculation is also growing that Apple may debut an Apple television set, a so-called iTV, by the fall of 2013. In a recent Morgan Stanley survey, 47% of 1,568 respondents said they were ""somewhat interested"" or ""extremely interested"" in buying an Apple-branded TV set which could translate into 56 million units being sold in the U.S. alone. The report added a potential iTV rollout represents a new $13 billion opportunity for the world's most valuable company.","Apple's share price has fallen 25% since record high of $702.10 set three months ago .

""May peace spring up for the people of Syria, deeply wounded and divided by a conflict which does not spare even the defenseless and reaps innocent victims,"" the pope said in his traditional Christmas message, delivered from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. ""Once again, I appeal for an end to the bloodshed, easier access for the relief of refugees and the displaced, and dialogue in the pursuit of a political solution to the conflict.""

But Christians, who represent 10% of the population, have been drawn into the war, which has largely been fought by the Alawite-dominated government and the largely Sunni opposition. Christians have been historically protected by the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, and have been reluctant to take sides. Some Christians in Syria abhor al-Assad, and others support the government. Many have been apprehensive about the prospects of an opposition government and fear the influx of jihadists in rebel ranks. Jaramana, a town in the Damascus suburbs with a Christian and Druze population that has mostly been pro-regime, was the site of violence Monday night.

The Local Coordination Committees of Syria, an opposition network, said Tuesday that Free Syrian Army rebels killed five military intelligence soldiers in clashes with government forces. A report issued last week by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria focused on sectarian hostilities and referred to dangers faced by Christians. It cited a car bombing outside a bakery in Jaramana and the kidnapping of Christians in September. Read more: Opposition: More than 100 Syrians killed in bakery attack . Before the conflict started in March 2011, the largest Christian communities were in the Damascus, Aleppo and Homs regions, it said. But many Christians have fled their homes because of the violence. Homs Christians have escaped to Damascus, and some have made their way to Beirut; Armenians who had been living in Syria have sought refuge in Armenia. Syria's Armenian Orthodox and other Christian communities ""have sought protection by aligning themselves with the government, with the consequence that they have come under attack from anti-government armed groups,"" the report said. Read more: Refugee figures fail to give true picture of Syria crisis . Some Christians have formed ""armed self-defense groups to protect their neighborhoods from anti-government fighters by establishing checkpoints around these areas."" More than 40,000 Syrians have been killed since March 2011, and hundreds of thousands have been displaced from their homes. At least 171 people were killed Tuesday, the LCC said. Of those, 61 died in Damascus and its suburbs. The Syrian Observatory reported that rebel fighters had taken over the town of Harem in Idlib province. Regime forces and militia allies surrendered; many of them and pro-government civilians died during clashes, it said. Tuesday's violence occurred after two days of air assaults on Syrians who had been waiting on line for bread. An air assault in Homs province killed at least 15 people Monday, a day after more than 100 were killed at a bakery in Hama province, opposition activists said. Both bombings took place in areas known for anti-government sentiment. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) blamed ""armed terrorist groups"" for the Hama province attack.

Dr. Abu al Fida said he treated about 30 of the more than 60 people who were affected by the gas this week. Those who were close to the source of the gas suffered symptoms such as paralysis, seizures, muscle spasms and, in some cases, blindness, he said. Those who were farther from the source suffered difficulty breathing, disorientation, hallucinations, nervousness and a lack of limb control similar to excessive tear gas exposure, he said. Al Fida said those affected responded well to atropine, which is used to treat sarin gas patients, but it was unclear what the substance may have been. He said the gas appeared as a white flash that went clear. Opposition activist Rami Abdulrahman, director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said six rebel fighters died after inhaling a white gas that had no smell. ""Gas was released and spread in the area after members of the regime forces threw canister bombs,"" Abdulrahman said. ""... The activists said that everyone who (inhaled) the gas felt severe headaches, and some had seizures."" CNN cannot independently confirm government or opposition reports from Syria because the government has severely restricted access by journalists. State-run SANA quoted Fyodor Lukyanov, the editor-in-chief of the journal Russia in Global Affairs, as warning that ""allegations of the Syrian government using chemical weapons could be excuses for foreign military intervention in Syria."" It added, ""In a statement to journalists on Tuesday, Lukyanov said that the reports on chemical weapons in Syria could be exploited to undermine the authorities and motivate foreign forces, stressing that there's no proof that chemical weapons have been used and that these reports seem to be another round of the media war against Syria."" U.S. President Barack Obama has previously warned that any use of chemical weapons by Syria in its civil war would be crossing a ""red line"" that would prompt a swift U.S. response. Diplomatic front: More talks, but no clear results . On the diplomatic front, U.N. peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi met Tuesday with members of the National Opposition Coordination Commission at a hotel in Damascus. Commission Chairman Hassan Abdel Azim said possible solutions to the crisis were reviewed with the envoy. The group is seen as a government-approved opposition group or regime front. It is not recognized by other opposition groups, such as the LCC or the Free Syrian Army. Read more: U.N. announces $1.5 billion aid effort for Syrian refugees . Tuesday's meeting came a day after Brahimi met with al-Assad. The LCC on Tuesday laid out its demands for peace talks.

The group also warned against granting the government ""more time to continue to destroy and kill.""

"(CNN) -- Senate Republicans and Democrats remain far apart in their effort to avert a year-end combination of spending cuts and tax increases that could trigger a new recession, Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday. ""There's still significant distance between the two sides, but negotiations continue,"" Reid said as Congress held a rare Sunday session in a bid to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. ""There's still time left to reach an agreement, and we intend to continue negotiations."" No votes will be held Sunday, but Reid said there may be further announcements when the Senate reconvenes Monday morning: ""I certainly hope so."" With barely a day left to avert what economists predict will be a one-two punch to the U.S. economy, talks hit what a Democratic source called a ""major setback"" when Republicans insisted that changes to how Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation be included. Republicans have dropped that demand, but ""they never should have been on the table to begin with,"" said Reid, D-Nevada. Using what's known as ""chained CPI"" would change the way Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, meaning that future Social Security recipients would receive less money over time. Democrats consider this prospect a ""poison pill,"" the source said, and GOP senators said later it wouldn't be included. ""If that is a show-stopper for the majority leader, we will take that off the table,"" New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte told reporters after coming out of a Republican caucus meeting Sunday afternoon. With the clock running down, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell appealed to Vice President Joe Biden to help ""jump-start"" negotiations after complaining that he had received no response to an offer he put on the table Saturday night. ""I want everyone to know I'm willing to get this done, but I need a dance partner,"" said McConnell, R-Kentucky. McConnell and Biden, who served together in the Senate for more than two decades, were having a ""pretty fruitful"" conversation Sunday afternoon, said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee. Reid said earlier that McConnell has shown ""absolutely good faith"" in the talks, but ""it's just that we are apart on some pretty big issues."" As he headed home Sunday evening, Reid was asked about progress, and he responded: ""Talk to Biden and McConnell."" Top-level sources on both sides of the negotiations said talks are primarily now in the hands of McConnell and Biden, and they are keeping Reid and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, informed. If nothing gets done before Monday night at midnight, the expiration of the Bush administration's 2001 and 2003 tax cuts will increase tax rates, while $110 billion in automatic cuts to domestic and military spending -- the result of the 2011 standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling -- will start to kick in. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts the combined effect could dampen economic growth by 0.5%, possibly tipping the U.S. economy back into a recession and driving unemployment back over 9%. In an interview aired Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" President Barack Obama blamed Republicans for the stalemate that brought lawmakers back to Capitol Hill on a weekend. Obama urged the GOP to drop its opposition to tax increases on top earners and cut a last-minute deal. ""They say that the biggest priority is making sure that we deal with the deficit in a serious way. But the way they're behaving is that their only priority is making sure that tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans are protected,"" he said. ""That seems to be their only overriding, unifying theme."" Obama told NBC that could cost the average middle-class family about $2,000. He said the Senate should go ahead and vote on legislation to make sure middle-class taxes are not raised and that 2 million people don't lose unemployment benefits. ""If we can get that done, that takes a big bite out of the fiscal cliff,"" he said. ""It avoids the worst outcomes."" During the interview, Obama said he was willing to consider using chained CPI to adjust Social Security -- even though it was ""highly unpopular among Democrats"" and opposed by the AARP, the powerful lobby for seniors. ""In pursuit of strengthening Social Security for the long term, I'm willing to make those decisions,"" Obama said. ""What I'm not willing to do is to have the entire burden of deficit reduction rest on the shoulders of seniors, making students pay higher student loan rates, ruining our capacity to invest in things like basic research that help our economy grow. Those are the things that I'm not willing to do."" But the Democratic source, who did not want to be identified because of the closed nature of the talks, said members understand Obama proposed using chained CPI as an element of a larger deal that also would change how the federal debt ceiling is adjusted -- an element no longer included in the plans. Most Democrats oppose chained CPI, but many were wiling to go along with it as part of a larger deal, the source said. On taxes, meanwhile, Democrats are arguing that taxes should go up for those making $250,000 or more, though some discussions have involved the possibility of raising that figure to a $400,000 threshold. Many Republicans have opposed any increase in tax rates. Boehner suffered a political setback by offering a compromise -- a $1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in -- that his GOP House colleagues refused to support. After Obama's NBC interview, Boehner said the president needs to stand up to his own party and insisted it was the president ""who has never been able to get to 'yes.'"" ""I am pleased Senators from both parties are currently working to find a bipartisan solution that can finally pass that chamber,"" Boehner said in a statement issued by his office. ""That is the type of leadership America needs, not what they saw from the president this morning."" Sunday night, Boehner met with House GOP leaders and told them to sit tight and stick together as he awaits news on whether the Senate can strike a deal. After the meeting, Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole told reporters that Boehner said: ""I've stayed out of those negotiations."" ""Every time we get involved in them, we sort of get burned, so we're going to let the Senate work its will, see what they do and what they send us, and we'll act accordingly,"" he said. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, told ABC's ""This Week"" he thought the chances of a short-term, last-minute deal brokered by Senate leaders were better than 50-50. ""I've been a legislator for 37 years, and I've watched how these things work on these big, big agreements,"" Schumer said. ""They almost always happen at the last minute."" And Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said the chances are ""exceedingly good"" that some type of deal will be reached by Monday night. ""I think, whatever we accomplish, political victory to the president, hats off to the president. He stood his ground. He's going to get tax rate increases, maybe not $250,000, but upper-income Americans,"" Graham said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""And the sad news for the country is that we have accomplished little in terms of not becoming Greece or getting out of debt."" Other Republicans argued Sunday that Obama's plan hasn't done enough to limit spending. ""The president is doing nothing about the addiction that his administration has to spending. He's the spender in chief,"" Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" Obama told NBC that he has cut more than $1 trillion in spending and offered another $1 trillion-plus in additional cuts ""so that we would have $2 of spending cuts for every $1 of increased revenue."" He said the majority of Americans have made clear they support his calls for ""a balanced approach"" that would increase taxes on the wealthy. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, warned that now is ""exactly the wrong time to go over this cliff."" ""We are in the midst of an economic recovery. We are seeing new job creation, businesses are seeing new growth, we are seeing the kind of economic indicators we've been waiting for for years. This going over the cliff is going to bring uncertainty to our markets, and with that uncertainty, a pullback in consumer confidence and a reduction, I'm afraid, of business activity and the creation of new jobs,"" he said. But former Democratic Party chairman and 2004 presidential contender Howard Dean told ABC that heading over the cliff would not be so bad, calling it a ""fiscal curb"" instead. ""You go back to the Clinton tax rates, and you make some significant cuts. And you cut the Defense Department, which hasn't been cut in 30 years,"" said Dean, a former Vermont governor. Meanwhile, going over the cliff gives Obama more leverage, ""because then all of sudden, middle-class people's taxes are going to rise, and that's going to be bad for every politician in Washington."" ""Maybe they'll actually get something done,"" he said. ""But I think, at this point, at this late hour, I think almost any deal they come up with is worse than going over the cliff."" Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, told CNN's ""State of the Union"" that she expects Congress will vote to extend tax cuts for incomes below $250,000 -- perhaps below $400,000 -- before midnight Monday. A Senate agreement ""would build momentum"" for the move in the House, she said. ""I think it would be horrific for the country if at this time, the final days of this legislative session that already has reached historic proportions of failure, that we would now culminate in failure to extend these tax cuts,"" said Snowe, who is on her way out of office. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Lisa Desjardins, Ted Barrett and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.","NEW: McConnell and Biden are main negotiators now, sources on both sides say .

"(CNN) -- Skier Lindsey Vonn is to take a sabbatical from World Cup competition, but the American insists the break has nothing to do with her recent admission she suffers from depression. Last month the finest female skier of her generation had to spend a couple of days in hospital due to an intestinal infection that she said had affected her ""energy and strength"". ""After talking with my family and consulting with my coaches and trainers, I've decided to take a break from the World Cup circuit,"" said Vonn on her Facebook page. ""I believe that some time off the mountain will help me regain the physical strength that I require to compete at the level that I demand from myself. I look forward to getting back on the mountain in the New Year."" Alpine Director of the U.S. Ski Team Patrick Riml added: ""We support Lindsey in the decision so that she can return to the World Cup and compete in the World Championships at full strength."" This season Vonn has won two downhills and two super-Gs, with her St. Moritz super-G victory in Switzerland delivering a 57th career World Cup triumph to put her within five victories of record-holder Annemarie Moser-Proell on the all-time list. But the American was below her best in the weekend races at Val d'Isere when her bid for a fifth-straight win ended in a crash. ""I want to be emphatic that this has nothing to do with my recent interview with People Magazine,"" added the 28-year-old Vonn on Facebook, referring to her admission that she has suffered from depression and currently takes an anti-depressant to manage the condition. ""I had completed that interview weeks before I was in the hospital with the intestinal infection."" In the magazine interview, Vonn revealed that she had hit a low point four years ago. ""I couldn't get out of bed anymore. I felt hopeless, empty, like a zombie,"" said Vonn, who added: ""All the parts of my life are finally in sync. I accept who I am, and I'm moving forward."" Last week Vonn told CNN in an exclusive interview that was pondering taking legal action in her bid to race against the men after the International Ski Federation (FIS) blocked her bid to challenge the sport's top male stars at a recent meeting in Canada. ""I don't want to make a big stink out of it but I feel like their response that I can't race with the men simply because I'm a woman was definitely gender-biased so I'm going to do what I can and hopefully make something work. ""So right now I'm looking into options -- my father is an attorney so I'm just seeing if there's any options, legally, that I can take.""","American skier Lindsey Vonn is to take a break from World Cup circuit .

"SHANGHAI, China (CNN)  -- On Saturday at 10 a.m. it's show time for Brenda Zhang and her subtitle team. They roll out of bed, meet each other online and chat, while their modems download the latest episode of ""Prison Break,"" which just aired half a world away on Friday night in America. Chinese netizens have a growing appetite for online English content. Once they have the show on their hard drives, the team spends the rest of the day creating subtitles for it in Chinese before putting it back online for other fans to watch. Dozens of such groups exist in China. They are voluntary and are translating a mix of media, from books and magazines to games, TV shows and movies. The translated products are for an audience whose primary means of accessing foreign entertainment is the Internet. The members of these online translations groups participate out of a desire to improve their English. For many there is also a passionate interest in overseas content and a desire to make it accessible to other Chinese people. ""This is a way to fulfill your life and do something you are interested in,"" said Zhang, a 24-year-old who translates for a team that calls themselves ""Showfa."" ""I think Chinese people need to know something different, to see how the foreigners think about life, think about love."" Aside from the international content made available on the Web, largely by the translation groups, people in China have fewer opportunities to legally watch imported entertainment than in many developed countries. While the viewing selections have been growing in recent years, Beijing still issues quotas for the number of international films allowed in cinemas each year, while the limited amount of content permitted to air on state-run TV is usually censored, poorly dubbed and not popular anymore. Translation team members download TV shows through different methods: watching directly from a Web site or downloading from a translation group Web site. Clips can also be downloaded through BitTorrent -- file-sharing sites such as Xunlei. Through this method, groups post their ""seeds"" on these sites, and people can download them.  The translation teams acknowledge that what they are doing is less than legal and say they do worry that someday they may be forced to quit (so far there are no reports of a group being shut down).  ""We are living in this grey zone,"" said Deping Wang, a former member of a team called 1000fr. ""It is not legal, but at the same time, nobody can live without it. This is the dilemma.""  Many international media companies are concerned the groups are eroding their potential profit margins in China by illegally making the content available for free. Some, however, see the translation groups' efforts as a conduit for cultivating a market that will be willing to buy content if it is allowed to be distributed through official avenues in the future.  ""While there is still an issue on the translation right, we also take a broader view to look at its impacts on other parties such as it's providing a platform for a Chinese audience who would otherwise not be able to understand or access The Economist content,"" Henry Luk, Asia-Pacific regional director for The Economist Group, told CNN via e-mail.  Since 2006, a group calling itself the Eco Team has translated more than 8,000 articles from British newsmagazine The Economist. Members collaborate with the translations, posting articles on their message board to be collectively copy-edited. The final versions are published on Eco Weekly a biweekly publication that can be downloaded and printed at no cost. The Eco Team Web site has more than 60,000 registered users, according to the group.  ""We want this magazine to be published in Chinese,"" said translator Jerry Bai at a recent party held by some of the Eco Team members in Shanghai. ""This is our only one wish.""  However, beyond the copyright issues that come up around the subtitle squads, Bingchun Meng, a media lecturer at the London School of Economics who is studying the teams, sees them as an opportunity to understand the social dynamics of virtual groups.  ""These are fascinating communities,"" Meng said. ""You think that everything online is more egalitarian and anti-establishment, but what we see is the emergence of another kind of operation of power, but maybe the power doesn't come from the traditional source but from different venues.""  Virtual communities  The translation teams consist of loosely structured yet highly coordinated, even hierarchical, virtual communities often consisting of hundreds of participants around the world. While some members occasionally meet each other offline, they mostly communicate through email, online forums or via instant messaging services, like QQ and MSN Messenger.  Within each team, there are leaders responsible for organizing the translation efforts of various sub-groups assigned to different TV shows and movies in English and also other languages such as German and Japanese. Leaders select the shows to subtitle by taking votes from Chinese ""netizens"" about the programs they want to see.  More experienced translators are given so-called ""zero day"" shows -- highly popular programs, like ""Prison Break,"" that are recorded and uploaded by someone living abroad to a special FTP site immediately after the program. Meanwhile, back in China, a team is on standby, ready to download and subtitle the show as fast as they can for Chinese fans to watch online -- and to see if they can beat rival translation gangs.  Competition can be fierce. To get ahead, some teams route content through servers in Thailand and Hong Kong to circumvent slow speeds that can stymie downloads between the United States and China.  ""It can buy 10 minutes, and, you know, 10 minutes means a lot of things,"" said Wang, the former member of 1000fr, one of the first translation teams in China.  There are around a half-dozen other subtitle groups that are well known, including YDY, or Yidianyuan (Garden of Eden), 1000fr's main rival.  ""These two groups fight together to see who is the fastest to translate into Chinese,"" Wang said. ""Two hours was one of our record translation times.""  Before someone can be a translator, he or she must first go through an application process and take a language test. Wang said she had to translate 300 words in 15 minutes to become part of 1000fr.  Teams also often have entire human resources departments responsible for recruiting new members, and there is never a shortage of applicants.  ""A lot of people apply. A lot,"" said Zhang, who is responsible for bringing in new recruits for Showfa's Japanese subgroup. ""There are a lot of TV series, and we need a lot of human resources.""  But just as quickly as new members come, they also go. Many of the translators are college students with plenty of time on their hands, often quitting once they graduate and have to get a job.  Zhang finished school several years ago but still manages to find time to spend with her subtitle group who she says are also her best friends. They also meet online every Tuesday morning to translate another popular American show, ""24"". Yet now on Saturdays, Zhang and the translators will have to come up with a different routine. This season of Prison Break was its last.  ""We will take a break,"" Zhang said. ""And wait for new shows.""","Online translating teams in China volunteer to translate pirated English media .

"(CNN) -- Adam Wilson posted two messages on Twitter on April 15. The first one, ""GO BADGERS,"" might have been sent by any University of Wisconsin-Madison student cheering for the school team. The brain-computer interface allows people to compose a tweet by focusing on the desired letter. His second post, 20 minutes later, was a little more unusual: ""SPELLING WITH MY BRAIN."" Wilson, a doctoral student in biomedical engineering, was confirming an announcement he had made two weeks earlier -- his lab had developed a way to post messages on Twitter using electrical impulses generated by thought. That's right, no keyboards, just a red cap fitted with electrodes that monitor brain activity, hooked up to a computer flashing letters on a screen. Wilson sent the messages by concentrating on the letters he wanted to ""type,"" then focusing on the word ""twit"" at the bottom of the screen to post the message. The development could be a lifeline for people with ""locked-in syndrome"" -- whose brains function normally but who cannot speak or move because of injury or disease. Wilson and his supervisor, Justin Williams, made the breakthrough last month after hearing a question posed on the radio.  Watch a demonstration of the technology » . ""Wouldn't it be great if you could Twitter just by thinking about it?"" That query sparked what Williams called the ""a-ha moment."" ""We can do that,"" said Williams, an assistant professor and the principal investigator at the lab in Madison, Wisconsin. ""We can do that tomorrow."" In the end, it wasn't quite ""tomorrow,"" Williams said, but Wilson had written the software to link existing technology with Twitter ""within a couple of days"" of starting on the project in March. He sent Williams his first ""tweet"" -- or message -- from the brain-computer interface on March 31.  Watch Dr. Gupta explain how it works » . ""I had set up my phone to get Twitter updates, and I walked in my door and got this message, and I knew it was really possible,"" he told CNN by phone. ""My wife was sitting there, and I showed her the message and she immediately got excited about it -- and it's rare that I come home from work and she gets excited about what I have been doing."" That's because using the brain to post Twitter messages is potentially much more than an academic exercise or a party trick -- it could help paralyzed people communicate. ""These are people who have ALS, like Stephen Hawking, or they have a brainstem stroke, or a high spinal-cord injury,"" Williams explained. ""There is nothing wrong with these people's brains. It's a normal person, locked into a lifeless, useless body."" (The British physicist Hawking has ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which is also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.) Hundreds of thousands of people suffer from locked-in syndrome, Williams estimated. Many of them want just the kind of ability the brain-Twitter project seems to offer, said Kevin Otto, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Purdue University in Indiana. ""The interesting thing about this project is they are directly addressing some of the patient desires,"" he said. ""A lot of people think [locked-in patients] want to walk and want fancy prosthetics, but a lot of times what they want are bladder control and basic communication skills."" Otto, who was not involved in the University of Wisconsin project, called it ""a very important incremental step to take two existing technologies and marry them together like this."" Williams had been working on brain-computer interface technology ""for many years,"" he told CNN, before the idea to use Twitter. ""The technology we were developing was 10 or more years down the line, so we started wondering, 'Is there something we can do now?' "" His lab at the University of Wisconsin -- like those at Brown University, Purdue and the Wadsworth Center in Albany, New York, among others -- is developing ways for locked-in people to communicate. Projects range from manipulating a cursor on a computer screen to operating a robotic arm, and they can include devices physically implanted into a brain. But the Twitter project has a lot of advantages, Williams said. ""Twitter fits so many of our needs and patients' capabilities,"" he said. ""Their first interest is in being able to communicate in a normal fashion, and at a distance."" Twitter is simpler than e-mail, he said. ""If I am locked in and I want to e-mail someone, the format is all wrong. You have to be able to select recipients and group them, copy, paste, send. ... We don't think about that much as normal people, but it can become unmanageable. ""Twitter takes care of all those things. They just have to get [the message] to a location where people can come and find it,"" he said. Locked-in people communicating by tweet might have followers who don't even realize they are disabled, Williams said. ""Nobody's going to notice that the person at the other end is disabled. They might not have any idea. And that might be very empowering for people,"" he said. The interface is not unlike the method the French journalist Jean-Dominique Bauby used to dictate his novel ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly"" -- later turned into a movie -- after a massive stroke left him paralyzed except for his left eyelid. Bauby's caregivers recited letters of the alphabet; he blinked when he heard the one he wanted and they wrote them down. The brain-Twitter application flashes letters on a screen while the user, wearing a cap fitted with electrodes, concentrates on a letter. ""When the letter that you are concentrating on flashes, we can pick that up,"" Williams said. Williams declined to say how soon the interface could be available commercially, noting it has not yet been used by anyone with locked-in syndrome. ""I'd hate to speculate about things being on the market,"" he said. ""Adam [Wilson] is going to graduate in May, and his next role is to start preclinical trials with subjects in New York and Germany."" But Williams said he is excited about the development. ""We were interested in seeing what we could do right now to help people,"" he said. ""The field has come far enough that we need to start getting to people in their homes.""

"(CNN) -- Sitting in front of the TV on Friday, I watched in horror as the death toll climbed with each news report coming in on the mass shooting in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut. The magnitude of the shooting shocked me. It also took me back to five years ago, when I received a phone call on a blustery April morning that changed my life forever. I was out shopping, and my cell phone had rung several times, but I had chosen to ignore the calls. Luckily, I answered the third call, which came in at 10:38 a.m. My daughter Emily, then a sophomore at Virginia Tech, was on the phone. She said, ""Mommy, I've been shot."" Clutching the phone, my knees buckling, I tried to make sense of what I was hearing. Emily quickly handed the phone to the EMT who had triaged her and was waiting with her for an ambulance. The EMT assured me that Emily was going to be fine, that there were very seriously wounded students that needed to be transported immediately and she was waiting with Emily for the next ambulance. She also shared that the situation on campus was ""very bad."" The world soon knew how bad it was. The incident at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007, remains the worst mass shooting in U.S. history in terms of casualties. Thirty-two students and school staff were killed that morning by a dangerously mentally ill student with guns, including high-capacity magazines. The killer should have been prevented from purchasing firearms, but when he purchased his weapons, his mental health records were not in the FBI database against which background checks are run. He used 30-round magazines, which had been outlawed up until 2004, when Congress let the Assault Weapons Ban expire. Shooting triggers 'mind battle' for Columbine survivors . We were one of the lucky families -- our daughter survived, when so many others did not. Eleven of the 17 students in her classroom were killed, along with her professor. A classmate dialed 911 when they first heard the shooter, but dropped his cell phone when almost immediately, the killer burst into the classroom and began spraying bullets at everyone. Emily reached over and picked up the phone and kept the dispatcher on the phone during the entire ordeal by hiding the phone. Law enforcement repeatedly told me how brave Emily was to keep them on the line. Law enforcement has also told me that the single most effective thing we can do to prevent gun violence would be to require all purchasers for all gun sales to undergo a background check. Then-Gov. Tim Kaine appointed a panel of experts to investigate all aspects of the massacre and report back their recommendations. Recommendation VI-2 stated, ""Virginia should require background checks for all firearms sales."" Sadly, that hasn't happened, and gun deaths now outpace motor vehicle deaths in my state. America has witnessed mass shooting tragedies grow in frequency in the last five years to the point that, according to one report, there have been 16 mass shootings between February 22, 2012, and December 14, 2012, leaving over 80 dead and many injured. I can't help but ache with sorrow, anguish and concern for all those families suffering the sheer agony that I saw the families of the 32 killed at Virginia Tech suffer. And I can't help but be angered at the cowardly behavior from our elected leaders. They have abandoned all sense of right and wrong, despite epidemic deaths from guns, and ignored their duty not only to keep our communities safe from gun violence, but to keep our children safe as well. When I think of those killed -- over 60,000 Americans have been murdered with guns since the shooting at Virginia Tech -- I have to wonder how many might be alive today if our elected leaders had taken to heart their responsibilities. Why is it that our elected leaders have not only ignored the pleas of survivors and family members of victims of gun violence, but those of our public safety officials -- police and law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line day in and day out -- only to listen to the gun lobby when determining public safety policy? What sense can that make when the gun lobby's sole purpose is to sell as many firearms as possible to make as much money as possible? Do you own a gun that fell under the now-expired federal weapons ban? We have come to a time when many say the unimaginable has happened again -- the mass shooting in the Newtown school where 26 people were killed, including 20 children. It is sheer senselessness. My heart goes out with the utmost compassion to the families suffering so terribly from Friday's massacre. For those whose loved ones have been killed, there is no real closure; there are permanent holes in their hearts. Time may lend a helping hand to healing, but their lives have been changed irrevocably. As my friend Lynnette, whose son was murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting, laments, ""There is no ending to the heartache."" I am brought to tears thinking of all we have seen, all we have not done and all we have let die. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lori Haas.","Lori Haas: The magnitude of the Newtown shooting shocked me .

"(CNN) -- His eyes stinging with pepper spray, a developmentally disabled 21-year-old man was hit and forced to the ground before being taken into custody by California sheriff's deputies in an incident that left his family Thursday demanding justice. Antonio Martinez was taken to a hospital and detained for possible obstruction of justice, but there was no citation or charge filed on that or other counts, said San Diego County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Jan Caldwell. His father is considering suing the department and the city of Vista, California, the young man's sister, Jessica Martinez, said. ""But really, all we want is for the sheriff's deputy who did this to my brother to get fired,"" Jessica Martinez, 20, said. ""That's all we want. We want justice."" The incident occurred Tuesday evening in Vista, where sheriff's deputies were looking into a domestic violence incident, Caldwell said. One of them saw Martinez cover his head with his hood and, believing he might be involved in the incident, tried to talk with him, said the spokeswoman. The 21-year-old -- who weighs 158 pounds and stands 4 feet, 11 inches tall, according to a Sheriff's Department document -- didn't respond to the commands, she added. Martinez is well-known around the Vista neighborhood, where he lives and his family has a bakery, his sister said. He was out walking between his home and the bakery when the deputy called out to him, at which point neighborhood men explained that the young man had Down Syndrome and wasn't doing anything wrong, according to Jessica Martinez. The deputy didn't back off. Instead, while trying ""to gain compliance and prevent a possible escape,"" he used pepper spray on Antonio Martinez, said Caldwell from the Sheriff's Department. The deputy began using a baton as an agitated crowd approached, the spokeswoman added. The deputy hit Antonio Martinez with it, forcing him to the ground, then levied ""a couple more strikes to get his hands free,"" Sheriff's Department Capt. Joe Rodi told CNN affiliate KGTV. Jessica Martinez said she joined the crowd after a nearby business owner had run into her bakery, telling them police were beating up her brother. ""I heard my brother screaming mine and my sister's name,"" she said. ""He was screaming for help. ""My brother wasn't fighting. He was crying and screaming. He was scared."" Two deputies got on top of Antonio Martinez as he rubbed his eyes from the pepper spray, eventually handcuffing him and putting him in a police car, his sister said. He was taken to Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside, California, where Jessica Martinez and her father found him with scratches but no broken bones. The family asked to take Antonio Martinez home from the hospital, but a sheriff's deputy refused, Jessica Martinez said. It wasn't until around 11:30 that night -- at the Sheriff's Department, after being brought back from the hospital -- that he was released, she said. ""When I asked my brother if he was sad, Antonio told me his heart hurt,"" his sister said. ""He's just really sad right now, and he doesn't want to go to the bakery any more."" The San Diego County Sheriff's Department has opened an investigation, according to Caldwell. Rodi met with the family Wednesday and acknowledged the situation should have been handled differently. ""We made a mistake here,"" Rodi told KGTV.

"(EW.com) -- This is the most exciting TV development news we've heard in awhile. CBS TV Studios is in the very early stages of a new version of the classic series ""The Twilight Zone."" Bryan Singer (""X-Men"") is attached as executive producer. There is no writer and no attached network at this time. So this project could go nowhere. But the development wheels are turning. Creator-host Rod Serling's original 1959-64 edition of ""The Twilight Zone"" is considered one of the best shows of all time. Attempts to revive the series have largely struggled â€” there was a 1985 edition that ran for three seasons (two on CBS, one in syndication), and another in 2002 on UPN that lasted only one season. Terence Malick's 'To the Wonder' trailer . Yet a potential revival now of this ground-breaking anthology show makes sense. Sci-fi and horror series are delivering big ratings (AMC's ""The Walking Dead,"" NBC's ""Revolution"") and there's several other genre projects coming to the small screen (NBC's ""Hannibal"" and ""Dracula""; CBS' ""Under the Dome""). Networks have become less squeamish about edgy content, which has allowed producers to more realistically depict dark subject matter. Plus, FX already took a step toward successfully reviving the anthology format by launching American Horror Story, a drama with close-ended seasons. There's been a second ""Twilight Zone"" movie mired in development for several years now too, with Leonardo DiCaprio attached as executive producer. The film is reportedly about a test pilot who returns to Earth after an experimental flight to discover it's 96 years in the future. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- He used to be found slugging it out for major tennis titles on the Centre Court turf at Wimbledon -- now Mark Philippoussis spends his time lapping up the surf in San Diego. After more than a decade in the pressure-cooker atmosphere of top-level tennis, and a stint as an eligible bachelor in a television dating show, the man who was known as ""The Scud"" because of his fearsome serve and aggressive approach now prefers a slower pace of life. The 35-year-old enjoyed a 14-year career in the game, his pair of Davis Cup titles with Australia tempering the bitter sting of his two grand slam final defeats. But Philippoussis has swapped his racket for a board, and insists he is as dedicated to surfing as he was professional tennis. ""The first wave I stood up on and rode to the beach, I thought, 'This is what I am going to do for the rest of my life.' I knew right then and there I was just hooked,"" he told CNN's Open Court show. ""It's so hard to explain until you go out there and you surf -- you can't really explain what surfing does to you. For me it's my meditation. People do yoga, they go on their runs and they see it as their way to release and for me it is getting in the ocean. ""Some of the things I have seen in the ocean -- whales and dolphins on a wave I'm on, a dolphin underneath you -- it makes you feel so small but also at the same time that you are part of something so special. It's an incredible thing, it's amazing surf."" ""It's completely in the now, my mind's not wondering what I'm going to do later, what I did yesterday, it's only about being out there, being in the moment and surfing that wave, nothing else."" If life is a beach for Philippoussis now, it wasn't towards the end of his career when injury blighted his final attempts to snare the one thing his resume lacked -- a major title. He lost twice in grand slam finals -- to compatriot Pat Rafter at the U.S. Open in 1998, before running into a young pretender called Roger Federer at Wimbledon in 2003. The ""Fed Express"" would go on to win the next five titles at the prestigious grass-court major. But though disappointment will forever linger in those twin failures, Philipoussis regards his two Davis Cup triumphs as his finest achievement. In both the successful 1999 and 2003 campaigns, Philipoussis won the decisive rubber that handed his team, and his country, victory. The first came against Cedric Pioline in front of a hostile crowd in France, while the second installment saw him beat Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain in front of a partisan crowd in his home town of Melbourne. That commitment to the team, rather than the individual, is a typically Australian trait, where representing your country inspires pride and every last ounce of effort. ""It's the pinnacle of what you want to do as an athlete,"" he said, ""especially in Australia where we are so sports driven. We love our sports. With the Olympics, with swimming, with everything we want to do, with the history. ""Davis Cup has huge history with Australia, with the names and how many times we have won the cup so you grew up watching a lot of those matches. ""There's a tournament every week on the ATP Tour so obviously we want to do as well as we can, but if we don't the mentality can be easily, ""OK next week."" With Davis Cup, well, it is every year, but it's every few months that you play that tie, and it's not just you, you are playing for your teammates, your coach, your captain, your country. ""There's a lot of pressure there, the atmosphere at Davis Cup is like no other event and it's an incredible experience."" His efforts in 2003 proved to be the final year Philippoussis threatened tennis' top table, as persistent injuries and erratic form saw him slide out of the top 100 and turn his thoughts to life off court. As such Philippoussis, who completed various stints of modeling throughout his playing career, played the role of eligible bachelor for the 2007 television show ""The Age of Love"" in which he had to choose one lady to date from a group of younger ""kittens"" or older ""cougars."" ""If I could sum it up in one sentence I would say it was quite an experience,"" he explained. ""It was fun, then extremely frustrating, then I kind of wanted to get off the show and it was one of those things that I look back on and I don't regret at all. ""I did it, it was another experience in my life and it was fun. Would I want to do anything like that again? No. Absolutely not, but it was fun."" His last competitive tennis match came in Dallas in 2010 but now his main focus in life is to plan board meeting after board meeting, in the Pacific Ocean. ""One of the amazing things about surfing is that every wave is different, every condition is different, every time I get up on the board is different. But the most important thing for me is it's my passion, I want to try to get as good as I can. ""I'm improving; I'm out there every day. Just like tennis, if you want to get better, you've got to get out there, so I am.""","Former tennis star Mark Philippoussis has turned his hand to surfing in California .

"(CNN) -- An NBC reporter and his crew spoke Tuesday of their overwhelming relief after being freed from kidnappers in Syria who kept them bound, blindfolded and repeatedly threatened to kill them during a five-day ordeal. Speaking from Turkey, Richard Engel described on NBC's ""Today"" show how he and his crew were seized by a group of masked, heavily armed men shortly after crossing into northwest Syria from Turkey on Thursday. Read more: Syrian refugees on run: 'I want people to feel our pain' While the NBC crew members were bundled into a waiting container truck, one of the rebel fighters who had been escorting them into Syria was executed on the spot, Engel said. Then followed five days during which the team was moved among a series of safe houses and interrogation places, always blindfolded. Although they weren't physically harmed, they were subjected to ""a lot of psychological torture"" and threats of being killed, Engel said. Read more: Refugee figures fail to give true picture of Syria crisis . ""They made us choose which one of us would be shot first. When we refused, there were mock shootings. They pretended to shoot him several times,"" he said, referring to producer Ghazi Balkiz. Hearing a gun fired while blindfolded ""can be a very traumatic experience,"" he said. Back in the United States, fears for their well-being mounted. The network sought word of where they were but kept their disappearance out of the news for fear of jeopardizing their safety. While the crew was missing, there was no claim of responsibility, no contact with the captors and no request for ransom, the network said. Read more: Syrian rebels gaining ground in Aleppo, opposition says . Only on Monday did the welcome news come that they had been freed after their kidnappers ran into a rebel checkpoint as they moved the hostages to another site. Two of their captors were killed in the ensuing firefight, but the NBC crew was unharmed. The team spent the night with the rebels who rescued them before crossing the border into Turkey on Tuesday morning. ""We're very happy to be here. We're in good health. We're OK,"" Engel told the ""Today"" show from Antakya, still wearing the same clothes he was held in but smiling broadly. Read more: Syrian regime approaching collapse, NATO chief says . Engel, alongside Balkiz and cameraman John Kooistra, spoke of how they tried to use jokes to keep each other's spirits up during their long ordeal. Kooistra said that he had ""made good with my maker"" and with himself, and that he had been ""prepared to die many times."" Engel also pointed out how fortunate they were to have been released unharmed while so many others in Syria remain in captivity or fear for their lives. Syria's government has severely restricted foreign news organizations' access to the country. Read more: An afternoon with a Syrian bombmaker . NBC has not named all the crew members, but the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said there were two Americans, a Briton of Jordanian origin, a Turk and a German of Syrian origin in the NBC team. Conflicting accounts have emerged of who was responsible for the crew's abduction and subsequent release. Engel said he had ""a very good idea"" of who kidnapped them, saying it was the Shabiha, a militia loyal to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. He said their captors talked openly of their loyalty to the government and of their Shia faith. The majority of the rebels are Sunni Muslims. Engel said the NBC journalists were told they had been captured with the intention of exchanging them for Iranians and Lebanese held by the rebels. Read more: Aleppo Today TV becomes vital news source amid Syria's chaos . The Observatory also cited a rebel who participated in the operation to release the NBC team as saying that gunmen loyal to the Assad regime were behind the kidnapping. However, NBC said earlier the abductors belonged to an unknown group that was ""not believed to be loyal to the Assad regime."" And Mohammed Cheikh Omar, a brother of Ammar Cheikh Omar, one of the captured members of the NBC team, told CNN that his brother said the kidnappers were a group claiming to be Free Syrian Army. Ammar Cheikh Omar said the group that freed the crew was a Free Syrian Army brigade called Ahrour el Sham. The Observatory named the rebel group that freed the crew as the Freeman of the Levant Brigades. In other developments: . Other hostages still held in Syria . A Ukrainian journalist, Ankhar Kochneva, continues to be held by Syrian rebels who have reportedly threatened to kill her unless a hefty ransom is paid. The rebels have given the Ukrainian government more time to meet their demands, the official RIA Novosti news agency reported Tuesday. And Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Tuesday that Moscow was taking ""all the necessary steps"" to free two Russian citizens abducted in Syria on Monday, RIA Novosti reported. Their captors have demanded a ransom payment, the state-run Itar-Tass news agency cited the Foreign Ministry as saying. The two Russians, who work for a private company in Syria, were seized near the port city of Latakia, Itar-Tass reported. An Italian engineer was kidnapped alongside them. Blasts shake Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus . Explosions rang out inside a densely populated Palestinian refugee camp in Damascus as clashes erupted again between rebel fighters and a pro-government Palestinian militia, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. The renewed fighting comes amid wide concern about the humanitarian situation in the Yarmouk refugee camp, home to nearly 150,000 people. Syrian warplanes bombarded the camp Sunday, hitting a school and a mosque and causing at least 15 deaths, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Since then, fighting between rebels and a Palestinian faction reportedly led by Ahmad Jibril, a longtime leader of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command, has rocked the camp. One displaced Yarmouk resident told the pro-Assad Al-Watan newspaper that a large number of Syrian armed forces were gathering to the west of the camp Tuesday. He said he believes this ""may be a lead-up to a military operation to cleanse the camp of the militants."" Mohammad Shtayyeh, a member of the central committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization and head of the relief committee for the Palestinians in Syria, condemned the loss of life in Yarmouk. He said it was the responsibility of the Syrian government to ensure the safety of Palestinians in their country. ""Palestinian blood should not be part of the struggle for Syria, and the Palestinians are not part of it,"" he told CNN. Speaking by phone to U.N Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moallem warned the Palestinian refugees against helping the rebels. He ""stressed the need for the Palestinians to refrain from supporting or harboring these armed group which are intruders to the camp and help expel them,"" according to Syrian state news agency SANA. UNRWA, the U.N. agency for the Palestinian refugees, said that ""credible reports point to civilian deaths, injuries and destruction of property in Yarmouk."" Thousands are fleeing the camp in search of safety, the agency said. UNRWA is now housing more than 2,600 displaced people in the Damascus area, a number that is rising fast, it said. Initial reports suggest well over 2,000 Palestinian refugees have also sought refuge in Lebanon, it said. The agency ""remains gravely concerned about the safety of the Palestine refugee population in Syria and appeals to all parties to refrain from actions that endanger civilian lives and property,"" it said. U.N. humanitarian chief Valerie Amos said via Twitter that she was horrified by the bombing of the camp. ""Senseless loss of life. Civilians must not be targeted,"" she said. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the latest attacks ""mark a significant and alarming escalation of the conflict in Syria. All parties must stop unlawful attacks on civilians and comply with international law."" Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas has urged combatants in Syria ""to spare our camps and our people in Syria"" and not draw the Palestinians into the civil war. He also called on the world community ""to take immediate action"" to protect Palestinians in Syria. Rebels and the government have gained and sought support from Palestinians in Syria. Many displaced Palestinians have been living for decades in Yarmouk, a nearly square-mile district inside Damascus about five miles from the center of the city. Formed in 1957, the urban enclave is the largest Palestinian refugee community in Syria, with more than 148,500 registered refugees, the United Nations said. At least 28 people have been killed across Syria on Tuesday, including nine in Damascus, according the LCC. Two children are among the dead, the activist network said.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- The doctor convicted of causing Michael Jackson's death asked an appeals court this week to let him out of jail while the judges decide whether they will overturn his conviction. The judge who presided over Conrad Murray's trial last year denied bail in a February hearing, saying his lawyers had not proven he was not a risk to flee the state or harm someone else with his questionable medical practices. Jackson died of an overdose of a surgical anesthetic and sedatives in his home while under Dr. Murray's care on June 25, 2009. Los Angeles County District Judge Michael Pastor, who sentenced Murray to four years in prison for the involuntary manslaughter conviction, ""unjustifiably erred"" by denying Murray's request to remain free during his appeal,"" Murray lawyer Valerie Wass said in a motion filed this week with California's Second District Court of Appeals. Read more: Judge rejects e-mail ban in Michael Jackson death lawsuit . ""Appellant respectfully requests that this court order his release on his own recognizance pending appeal, or alternatively, that it order his release on reasonable bail,"" Wass wrote. Murray, who has been in a Los Angeles County jail since a jury found him guilty in November 2011, is eligible for parole after serving two years. Murray is set to be freed October 28, 2013 unless he is let out early on bail or because of jail overcrowding. Pastor said he doubted Murray would stick around for the appeal decision because he has ""resources"" to flee and ""significant ties elsewhere,"" including to Grenada, where he was born, and Trinidad, where he was raised. But Murray is a naturalized U.S. citizen with children in the United States, including a 3-year-old son in California, Wass argued in her motion for bail. The prospect of losing his life in the United States would prevent him from leaving the country, she said. ""It would be all but impossible for appellant to flee"" because he has become infamous from the media coverage of Jackson's death and the trial, Wass wrote. As for resources, Murray is broke, she said. Pastor also suggested Murray was a danger to the public because of his dangerous attitude toward using propofol, the drug that killed Jackson. Wass argued in the appeal that Murray would not be practicing medicine since California suspended his medical license after he was convicted and he voluntarily surrendered his other medical licenses in Texas and Nevada. ""He lacks the means and ability to prescribe or obtain pharmaceutical drugs,"" she wrote. Prosecutors have until the end of December to file their response to Murray's bail request. Read more: Conrad Murray gets bigger cell, but still unhappy . Murray is appealing his conviction on several points, including the contention that Pastor erred in not allowing his lawyers to present evidence of Jackson's financial troubles, which they argued would support their theory that the pop star's desperation led him to administer the fatal dose to himself. Wass argued that the judge's decision not to allow the defense to call Beverly Hills dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein or his staff as witnesses denied Murray a fair trial. Murray's lawyers contended that drugs given to Jackson by Klein in the weeks before his death contributed to his death. The judge's refusal to sequester the jury in a hotel during the trial, which was televised live, ""may have improperly influenced the jurors,"" Wass argued. Another major issue in the appeal is the decision not to allow Murray's lawyers to test the contents of a bottle found next to Jackson's bed. They contend it could reveal evidence to support their theory that Jackson gave himself the fatal dose while Murray was out of the room. Jackson's mother and three children are suing AEG, the promotion company they say hired Murray and supervised Murray's care of Jackson as he prepared for comeback concerts in London in summer 2009. Murray is expected to be a witness in the wrongful death trial scheduled for next April.

"(CNN) -- A Florida man arrested on terror charges allegedly wanted to attack a landmark in New York City but didn't have the money or bomb-making components to carry out his plot, according to arguments made by federal prosecutors during a detention hearing Tuesday. According to a federal law enforcement official familiar with the case, the government alleges Raees Alam Qazi, 20, wanted to avenge deaths in Afghanistan and those killed by U.S. drone attacks. Prosecutors said Qazi, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Pakistan, considered such potential targets as Wall Street, Times Square and theaters. After the man's arrest in late November, investigators searched his home in Oakland Park, Florida, and found Christmas tree lights, wires, batteries, hydrogen peroxide, a disassembled remote-control car and other materials, according to the law enforcement official. At a detention hearing Tuesday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, prosecutors said that after Qazi was arrested he told law enforcement officers he had tried to contact al Qaeda. The prosecutors said he was motivated by the lectures of the late radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed by a drone strike in Yemen, and by Inspire magazine. The online magazine is produced by the terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and it has carried articles on how to make bombs. The federal law enforcement source said there is no evidence Qazi ever actually contacted members of al Qaeda or related terror groups. Prosecutors said Qazi traveled to New York on November 24 and spent nights sleeping at a mosque, a restaurant and on public transportation -- apparently reflecting his financial situation -- while he allegedly considered what site to attack. On November 29, Qazi returned to Florida, where he and his brother and accused co-conspirator Sheheryar Alam Qazi, 30, were arrested. Qazi allegedly said he returned to Florida to continue to prepare and gather resources for an attack, according to prosecutors. The two brothers were indicted on charges of plotting to use an explosive device and conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists. Both have pleaded not guilty but face a maximum of life in prison if convicted. According to the law enforcement official, Raees Qazi was the more active of the two in the plot and of greatest concern to investigators. At the detention hearing, prosecutors revealed that in their search of Raees Qazi's home they discovered an apparent goodbye letter to his brother. ""May God bless you or thank you for everything,"" prosecutors quoted the letter as saying. ""I cannot pay you back for the help you have given me, but Allah can, God willing. (Don't panic, just keep it cool especially when someone asks)."" A federal judge ordered Raees Qazi detained pending trial. His brother remains in jail as well. No trial date has been set.

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Marshals Service announced Friday the arrest of Felipe Alexander Torrealba, one of its 15 most wanted fugitives. The agency said he was captured Thursday at an apartment complex in Fort Myers, Florida. It did not say if he resisted when he was apprehended. Authorities recovered two handguns, about $15,000 in cash, a wig and a pair of binoculars inside the two-story townhouse where the 26-year-old was hiding, the agency said.

There were also arrest warrants for him in Texas and Florida for aggravated battery of a law enforcement officer, possession with intent to distribute cocaine, trafficking oxycodone, unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, aggravated assault with a firearm and resisting officers with violence, the agency said.

"(CNN) -- Fire, the wheel and even cup noodles were among the varied answers to the question posed by CNN: ""What is man's greatest achievement?"" Man set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. Was that man's greatest achievement? Have your say. CNN producers armed with cameras put the puzzler to passersby in Berlin, Madrid, Rome, Bangkok, Tokyo, New Delhi and Paris. In the lead-up to the 40th anniversary of NASA's Apollo 11 mission, more people might have been expected to nominate the moon landing as one of man's greatest feats. Alas not. One woman in Germany suggested the computer. ""It has opened up my world. I can stay in my house and travel all over the world,"" she said. Another suggested the airplane. ""It's the easiest way to get from one country to the other. Imagine if you would be able to only take the ship. It would take you ages to go somewhere, so it makes humanity more flexible.""  See what they said » . Fire also got a look-in. ""Everything started there right?"" said one man in Spain. There was agreement in Italy: ""I think the most important is that man discovered fire because it's bringing a lot of life."" The written word was also nominated in Italy, as were architecture and sanitation. ""The biggest achievement of mankind? Music, right?"" suggested one woman in Spain. In New Delhi, video games got one man's vote. ""It allows you to be whomever you want, in whichever world you want, and lets you live an alternate fantasy life,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- A cold snap in Ukraine has killed 83 people, while hundreds more have sought treatment for hypothermia and frostbite, according to state media reports. Some 536 people have been hospitalized with hypothermia, an adviser to Health Minister Volodymyr Yurchenko is quoted as saying Friday by state news agency Ukrinform. Of those 83 have died, he told a meeting of the Emergency Situations Ministry. Authorities have set up nearly 2,800 ""heating points"" to help vulnerable people across the country, according to the Emergency Situations Ministry website. Between December 15 and 21, these relief centers have helped more than 13,500 people, it said. Cold arctic air has blasted Ukraine for more than a week, forcing temperatures in the capital, Kiev, below the December average high of 0 degrees and low of -5 degrees Celsius, CNN forecasters say. The mercury in Kiev hasn't risen above -8 degrees Celsius (17.6 degrees Fahrenheit) since Monday. But the chilliest period came Tuesday, when it plummeted to -17 degrees Celsius (1.4 degree Fahrenheit.) While the forecast doesn't look much better over the next couple of days, the capital may get back to near average temperatures on December 25 and 26. Last winter, more than 110 people died in Ukraine as a result of a bitter cold spell that lasted around a month, from January into February. The government said then that more 90% of the deaths were alcohol-related, with some victims drinking in the mistaken belief it would help keep them warm. CNN's Laura Smith-Spark and Judson Jones contributed to this report.","NEW: Arctic air has kept temperatures in the capital, Kiev, below average for over a week .

"(CNN) -- Indian cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has brought down the curtain on his record-breaking one-day international career, confirming his retirement on Sunday. The ""Little Master,"" who has thrilled fans since he first made his debut as a raw 16-year-old back in 1989, scored an astonishing 49 centuries in the 50-over game. The 39-year-old is the world's leading run scorer in one-day cricket, hitting 18,426 runs from his 463 matches at an average of 44.83. Tendulkar was a key part of the India team which won the 2011 World Cup in his home city of Mumbai. His final one-day appearance came on March 18 in which he scored 52 during the six-wicket win over Pakistan at the Asia Cup. Tendulkar reaches 100th international hundred . It was in his penultimate innings that he reached his 100th international century, a total which includes both one-day and Test match cricket, following a knock of 114 against Bangladesh. Previously, at the age of 36, he scored the first double-century in the 50-over format since the first one-dayer was played in January 1971, hitting an unbeaten 200 against South Africa. But following a poor Test series against England, in which he made just one half-century and averaged 18.66, Tendulkar says India must build for the future. 'Blessed' ""I have decided to retire from the one-day format of the game,"" he said in a statement. ""I feel blessed to have fulfilled the dream of being part of a World Cup winning Indian team (in 2011). ""I am eternally grateful to all my well-wishers for their unconditional support and love over the years."" No decision has yet been made over whether Tendulkar will continue to play the five-day format following his disappointing performances during India's series defeat by England this month. Tendulkar has scored a record 15,645 runs in 194 matches at an average of 54.32 with 51 centuries and remains a hero around the world to cricket fans. 'Unbeatable' records . Former India skipper Krishnamachari Srikkanth told reporters that Tendulkar's records will never be matched. ""I am surprised by his move but he is leaving ODI cricket on a high,"" he said. ""I am sure he will want to leave on a high in Test cricket also. He will be looking forward to a good Test series against Australia. His records cannot be surpassed."" Former captain Sourav Ganguly added: ""I felt that he might have played on, but it is his decision and I think it is right. ""There was a doubt on whether he would play ODI cricket or not. But I am not surprised by his decision. He has done what he thought was right.""","Sachin Tendulkar has quit one-day international cricket at the age of 39.

"(CNN) -- Facebook recently announced new privacy controls that enable users not only to limit how their information is shared, but also to better understand how that information is exposed to others. Increased transparency and strong, simple privacy controls like these are practices more companies should embrace. Facebook's changes follow a recent move by a Senate panel to approve a bill that would require law enforcement to get a warrant before reading private e-mail. This proposed change to the outdated 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act is good news -- and not just for the likes of Gen. David Petraeus, who would rather their compromising situations remain private. Both actions are important steps toward improving privacy protections online, but we have a long way to go -- because it's not only e-mails and social networks we might want to keep private. What about our purchases, the websites we visit, or our personal details? Consider my own recent experience. A friend reached out to me, concerned over the profile he had seen of me on a dating website. I was listed as a widow and, as he and I both knew, my husband is still very much alive. And married. To me. To my horror, someone had set up a dating profile for me, using information easily gleaned from the Web: my name, my photo, the university where I teach, the number of my children. All of it was accurate except two claims: I was a widow and that I was ""looking for a relationship.'' How much do Google, Facebook profit from your data? Many privacy advocates and information security experts react to examples like mine with calls for more consumer control of information. If we treated personal information like private property akin to a home or car, the argument goes, then I would have the power to decide when and to whom to ""sell"" or license my information, and of course would have a case against the dating website for ""stealing"" it. But responding to the ever-expanding market in private information by participating in its sale seems to only legitimatize and promote, not limit, the practice. More important, viewing privacy as an individual problem to be fixed by individual property rights will not lower our risks because it fails to take into account the social value of privacy. One obvious social value is in protecting personal details -- name, occupation, marital status. The problem with the dating site profile wasn't that I didn't get paid for my information. It's that its misrepresentations could have had serious consequences for my personal life and my reputation. I have a strong interest in ensuring reported facts about me are correct: We all do. Much of modern social and economic life would be impossible without reliance on such facts. Privacy enhances social relationships, both private and contractual. I share information with my doctor not simply because I value her services and expect confidentiality, but because I trust her and value our relationship. In health care, patients must be willing to disclose personal and intimate information to clinicians. If someone exposed to HIV or bird flu were not willing to tell a doctor because of privacy concerns, not only would his or her health suffer, but the health of all would be endangered. Probably the most important social value related to privacy is its role in civic engagement, which of course includes voting, but also the ability to interact freely without surveillance. Although we worry mostly about government agents snooping on us, corporate and third-party surveillance of online communications, relationships and activities has increased significantly in the past decade. Most forces in the marketplace encourage companies to exploit rather than protect consumers' private information. Businesses lack information accountability and fair information practice policies are weak. Online tracking of purchases, social networks, and locations for commercial gain could end up harming civic engagement in the same way that we worry government surveillance will do. Opinion: Despite Facebook, privacy is far from dead . Because privacy is social, it is not a property of individuals. My ""individual privacy"" is actually created, and thus protected, by people I know, and my doctor, my bank, my telephone line, my voting booth, my library card. Privacy depends on social norms, professional ethics, organizational policies, legal rules and regulations and technical standards. No one of these mechanisms -- technology, norms or laws -- determines or fully protects privacy, but in concert they do. To argue that the best way to bolster privacy is to make it an individual responsibility contradicts its actual social nature. Another drawback: People might not be very good at managing their privacy by themselves. In the rush to adopt a new device or try a new application, many don't fully consider, or are even aware of, tradeoffs they might be making when they provide a lot of personal details. New Facebook policies and the proposed strengthening of the electronic privacy act are important steps, but until we follow privacy-by-design technology, strengthen fair information practices, and encourage policies that recognize the social nature of privacy, our online world will continue to lack the mechanisms we need to promote and protect personal privacy. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Denise Anthony.","Denise Anthony: Facebook's new protections, enhancement of e-mail privacy act good news .
Anthony: But we need to protect privacy of purchases, websites we visit, personal data .
The idea privacy is something an individual can own and sell is bad strategy, she says .
Anthony: Privacy can't be regulated alone; it's a social, community bond ."
"(EW.com) -- It was a great weekend to be a director named Paul Anderson. Not only did Paul W.S. Anderson's ""Resident Evil: Retribution"" become his fourth straight ""Resident Evil"" film to debut atop the chart; Paul Thomas Anderson's drama ""The Master"" had one of the best opening weekends of all time in limited release. In first place, ""Resident Evil: Retribution,"" the fifth entry in the stalwart horror/action franchise, earned $21.1 million — 21 percent less than 2010′s ""Resident Evil: Afterlife,"" which began with $26.7 million. This is the first time that a ""Resident Evil"" movie has earned less than its predecessor. The original Resident Evil earned $17.7 million in 2002. ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" grossed $23.0 million in 2004. ""Resident Evil: Extinction"" scored $23.7 million in 2007. Notably, ""Retribution,"" which is being distributed in 3-D and IMAX, also sold the fewest tickets of any of the ""Resident Evil"" films in its opening weekend. Sony, who is distributing the $65 million Milla Jovovich (Paul W.S. Anderson's wife) vehicle under its Screen Gems division, isn't worried, though. ""The Resident Evil"" franchise's international prospects have grown substantially over the last decade, and with a $50 million international start this weekend, ""Retribution"" has a good shot at finishing ahead of Afterlife's $296 million worldwide cume. Audiences issued the film a ""C+"" CinemaScore grade . Disney's 3-D re-release ""Finding Nemo"" made a more modest splash in second place with $17.5 million. Though the family film, which was converted into 3-D for less than $5 million, was expected to top the chart, Nemo was unable to match the numbers of Disney's recent 3-D re-releases ""The Lion King,"" which debuted with $30.2 million in September 2011, or even Beauty and the Beast, which began with $17.8 million earlier this year. Ever since ""The Lion King's"" successful 3-D run, which added $94.2 million to its total, studios have been eager to capitalize on the low-cost high-return 3-D re-release strategy. Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace raced to $43.5 million earlier this year. Titanic garnered $57.9 million domestically — and $343 million worldwide. Next up, Disney will re-release ""Monsters, Inc."" (out Dec. 19), and next year will bring 3-D re-releases of two more Star Wars films, as well as Jurassic Park and The Little Mermaid — and those are just the films we've already heard about. Yet Finding Nemo's softer-than-expected weekend reveals that audiences may be losing interest in the gimmick rather quickly. When all is said and done, ""Finding Nemo"" will prove a financial boon for Disney, even if it finishes in the same range as ""Beauty and the Beast 3-D,"" which took in $47.6 million. Conversion costs were minimal, and for the ""Mouse House,"" merchandising is far more lucrative than theatrical earnings. ""Nemo's"" solid box office run will keep the film's characters (and appeal) alive as audiences wait for the recently announced Finding Nemo 2. Lionsgate's $14 million demonic effort ""The Possession"" grossed $5.8 million in its third weekend, a drop of just 38 percent. The ""Based on a True Story"" film, which stars Kyra Sedgwick and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, has held up much better than equivalent horror titles and has now earned $41.2 million total. Two other holdovers rounded out the Top 5. In fourth, Warner Bros/' bootlegging crime drama Lawless fell 30 percent to $4.2 million, lifting its total to $30.1 million after three weeks. In fifth, Focus Features' ParaNorman earned another $3.0 million, giving the creepy kid flick $49.3 million after a full month in theaters. 1. Resident Evil: Retribution -- $21.1 million . 2. Finding Nemo -- $17.5 million . 3. The Possession -- $5.8 million . 4. Lawless -- $4.2 million . 5. ParaNorman -- $3.0 million . Further down the chart, two movies made impressive debuts in limited release. Arbitrage, the buzzy financial thriller starring Richard Gere, grossed $2.1 million from 197 theaters, yielding a terrific per theater average of $10,508. The film opened on VOD this weekend as well.

"New York (CNN) -- It was the last stop for some of New York's finest and most reviled: famed composer Leonard Bernstein, ""Boss"" Tweed, and organized crime's ""Lord High Executioner,"" Albert Anastasia -- shot dead in a barber's chair in 1957. Civil War generals, inventors, baseball legends, so many who helped define American history -- in good ways and bad -- are buried at Brooklyn's Green-Wood Cemetery. Today, their headstones are places to visit on daily tours of the 175-year-old cemetery, a stately presence in an otherwise scruffy neighborhood. There was no such marker there for my grandfather, Henry H. Varian, a newspaperman of some renown who toiled for the likes of Hearst and Pulitzer. A survivor of shipwrecks who rounded dangerous Cape Horn five times during his years as a sailor before the Panama Canal opened, he claimed to have read his own premature obituary three times -- once after nearly drowning and twice following serious accidents. Nobody can explain now precisely why Henry Hudson Varian -- the full name he used as a byline on essays and some of the poems commonly published in newspapers in those days -- was buried without a headstone. This fall, 75 years after his death, several generations of his family from up and down the East Coast came together to mark the grave of a man most of us never knew who started a journalistic tradition spanning more than a century, that endures to this day. Pearl Harbor survivor helps identify unknown dead . Search for grave site . First, we had to find exactly where my grandfather was buried -- a task speeded by technology few could have conceived in his day: a mobile phone my son Michael used to pinpoint the burial site amid Green-Wood's 478 acres of rolling hills, paths and glacial ponds with nearly 600,000 ""permanent residents."" Michael, a New Yorker, was part of the family entourage led by my godmother, Frances Campbell -- Henry Varian's only surviving child, now a widow in her 80s -- who had journeyed from Virginia, Maryland, Georgia and New Jersey. ""I was so excited about that, you can't imagine, to see all the Varians together,"" said Aunt Frances. ""It was just wonderful. I couldn't believe it was happening."" After finding the grave, we headed across the street to the Brooklyn Monument store, a small, cluttered house that showcased the rich history of the cemetery, whose sprawling grounds had been a Revolutionary War battlefield before becoming a burial place. A large framed picture on a wall in the back room brought back one of my happiest childhood memories -- it was the team photo of the 1955 Dodgers, who brought the first and only World Series baseball championship to Brooklyn. Outside was a small ""garden"" where Monica Hakola, wife of the store's owner, helped us pick out an appropriate headstone. My godmother liked the one with the rose-leaf pattern because her father once wrote her a poem -- also published in his newspaper -- titled, ""The Rose of New Rochelle."" The rest of us agreed and she quickly handed over a cash down payment. Aunt Frances is the only surviving member of the family with memories of my grandfather, who died nearly a decade before I was born. His photograph sat on our living room piano throughout my childhood, but I knew almost nothing about him -- until now. Overseas burial ground honor fallen Americans . High seas adventurer turned newspaperman . Born in 1867 in Liverpool, England, Henry Varian was one of 13 children of an Irish lawyer and Brazilian-born mother of Spanish heritage. He went to college in Wales and studied art in Dublin, then decided to go to sea as a midshipmen. He came ashore in the United States at age 19, where he worked at several newspapers on the West Coast and in Chicago as a reporter before heading to New York. There, he rose to high-level editor positions at several newspapers. All but two of the publications where he worked over a 38-year career -- San Francisco's Chronicle and the currently online-only Seattle Post-Intelligencer -- reside in newspaper graveyards today. His first job was with the San Francisco Call, where he covered violence during a railroad workers strike that led to the establishment of Labor Day. In another major assignment, he reported on the 1893 Chicago World's Fair for the Chicago Mail. Moving east, he became executive editor of The New York Globe and then moved to Pulitzer's World, where he directed coverage of the Spanish-American and Boer wars as foreign editor and waged campaigns against the vice rackets, fortune-tellers and organized prostitution as city editor. ""He held all the important executive positions on the World,"" said his December 4, 1938, obituary in the Brooklyn Eagle. Always faithful: Marine veterans tend to hero's grave, cemetery . His career was cut short as a result of a near-death experience. On his way home in Brooklyn one night, he was run over by a speeding streetcar while crossing Flatbush Avenue and ""dragged 20 feet,"" according to a March 22, 1915, New York Times account headlined: . ""Henry Varian, Hit By A Car, May Die"" He didn't for another 23 years, but he suffered severe injuries that eventually led to blindness, including a compound skull fracture and, the Times said, ""almost his entire right side has been crushed in."" A year later, he became a widower. He remarried and had two more children -- my father, another career newsman, now deceased, and daughter Frances. He went blind before Frances' birth, yet the two were very close, she recently recalled. She never really thought of him as being blind. ""At Christmastime every year, he'd knock on my door and say, 'Let's go down and see what is there,'"" she said. ""He walked down the stairs with no problem -- he had his own way of doing it."" Henry Varian retired because of his blindness in 1927 and died little more than a decade later at age 71. It was the height of the Great Depression. The family moved from its comfortable suburban home in New Rochelle, New York, and his only son -- my father -- walked away from a college football scholarship and got a job to help support the family. He eventually followed in his father's footsteps, first as a newspaper reporter in upstate Binghamton, New York, and, after fighting in World War II, as a photo editor for Acme Newspictures, which was taken over by United Press in the fledgling days of still picture journalism. That led to two more generations of journalists -- myself, and then my oldest son, Bill, a newspaper reporter for more than two decades, now with the Tampa Bay Times. In a family of storytellers, the story of my grandfather's unmarked grave remains an enigma. The one person who might be able to explain it, Henry Varian's widow -- my grandmother Martha -- died in 1991 at the age of 102. ""I knew there was something that was missing,"" her daughter, my Aunt Frances, told me recently. After an earlier visit to the cemetery nearly 10 years ago, she began saving to buy a headstone.

"Buenos Aires (CNN) -- It's been nearly 30 years since British and Argentinian troops fought over the Falkland Islands, but politicians from both countries are ratcheting up their rhetoric over the British-controlled territory. The ideological battle comes as Prince William is scheduled to begin a Royal Air Force tour of duty there next month -- a move which has drawn more attention to the islands at a time when Argentinian officials are increasingly criticizing the British presence in the area. ""They are preying on our natural resources, our oil, our fish,"" Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner said Wednesday. British Prime Minister David Cameron has offered a different take, criticizing Argentinian officials for their renewed claims to the island. ""We support the Falklands' right to self determination, and what the Argentinians have been saying recently I would argue is actually far more like colonialism, because these people want to remain British, and the Argentinians want them to do something else,"" he told lawmakers last week. The islands have been under British rule since 1833. Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, prompting a war in which more than 600 Argentinian and 255 British troops died. After the war, the United Kingdom retained control of the islands, which are off Argentina's coast in the South Atlantic. About 2,500 residents live on the islands, in addition to 1,700 people stationed at the British military's Mount Pleasant Complex there, according to the islands' government website. Fernandez has recently emphasized her country's claim to the territory, saying she wants British officials to enter into talks with Argentina over the islands, which are known as the Malvinas in Argentina. Cameron's comments about colonialism have roiled Argentinian politicians and protesters alike. Demonstrators marching outside the British Embassy in Buenos Aires this month burned British flags and urged Argentina to sever ties with the United Kingdom. The foreign relations committee of Argentina's Senate is scheduled to hold a meeting Thursday to draft a resolution condemning Cameron's remarks, the state-run Telam news agency reported. Fernandez has won over several neighboring countries. Last month, members of the Mercosur trade bloc -- which includes Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay -- said they would stop ships bearing the Falkland Islands flag from entering their ports. That move angered British officials. ""It is unacceptable to engage in an economic blockade of the Falklands. Mercosur should take the responsible decision and not do this,"" UK Foreign Office Minister Jeremy Browne said. Fernandez thanked Argentina's allies for their support. ""The Malvinas are not an Argentine cause, but a global cause,"" she said. Prince William will be one of four Royal Air Force pilots to be sent to the Falkland Islands military base next month, the British Ministry of Defence said in November. The Duke of Cambridge, who is qualified as a search and rescue pilot, has been flying Sea King helicopters for the Royal Air Force from a base in Anglesey, Wales. CNN's Jose Manuel Rodriguez, Max Foster, Claudia Dominguez and Antonia Mortensen contributed to this report.","President Fernandez says the British are ""preying"" on Argentina's natural resources .

"(CNN) -- Twitter posts about anti-government protests have landed a human rights activist in Bahrain behind bars. Said Yousif al-Muhafda is accused of disseminating false information about clashes between security forces and protesters in the country's capital, the state-run Bahrain News Agency said Thursday. Al-Muhafda, the head of documentation for the Bahrain Center of Human Rights, was arrested Monday during a demonstration, attorney Mohamed Al-Jishi said. Just before his arrest, the center said a series of posts went out on his Twitter account, describing a shotgun injury, tear gas and ""security forces spraying pepper spray on female protesters faces as they mock them/laugh."" Al-Muhafda has been using the account for months to document what he says are human rights violations in Bahrain. A government prosecutor pointed to one Twitter post, which showed a picture of an injured leg. The image, posted Monday, ""resulted in protests and acts of sabotage that disrupted security on that same day,"" Bahrain's government news agency said, citing Deputy Attorney General Mohammed Salah. The activist's attorney says he was observing the demonstration, not participating. He is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday. Human rights activists have criticized the arrest, saying it is part of a growing crackdown on social media posts. ""The authorities are placing extensive surveillance on social media, and several were arrested because of their online posts in an act that serves to intimidate others to move into self-censorship,"" the Gulf Center for Human Rights and the Bahrain Center for Human Rights said in a statement. Bahraini authorities imposed a ban on public protests in October, saying it was necessary because ""increasing violence has resulted in death and serious injury to many."" But Amnesty International said the move breached people's right to free speech. Violent clashes have broken out between security forces and opposition protesters on numerous occasions since protests began in the island nation in February 2011, spurred by uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt. Bahrain plays a key strategic role in the Middle East and is home to the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet headquarters. U.S. still concerned about violence in Bahrain .

"(CNN) -- The Colombian government said it would appeal to international bodies over what it called a threat made over the weekend by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. On his weekly Sunday television show, Chavez ordered the Venezuelan military to begin preparations for a war with the neighboring country, warning of a conspiracy between Colombia and the United States to attack Venezuela. ""The two governments have joined together to fool the world or to try to fool the world,"" Chavez said. Addressing his military commanders, he added, ""Let's not waste a single day in the preparation of our main mission: to prepare ourselves for war and to help the people prepare for war. It's everyone's responsibility."" On Sunday Colombia's government responded, saying it has not undertaken any hostile actions toward Venezuela. Colombia said it would ask for intervention from the United Nations Security Council and the Organization of American States. A Colombian government spokesman, Cesar Mauricio Velasquez, called Chavez's remarks ""war threats."" On Monday Venezuela retorted by calling Colombia's response ""hypocritical"" and ""immoral."" Chavez's accusations of threats from Colombia and the United States come from an agreement between the two countries that allows U.S. military personnel to be stationed at seven Colombian military bases. The Venezuelan leader is the leading critic of the agreement and has said that the agreement is part of a plot to destabilize his leftist government. ""Don't be mistaken, Mr. Obama, and order an overt aggression against Venezuela using Colombia,"" Chavez said Sunday, in a reference to U.S. President Barack Obama. ""Don't make that mistake, because we are willing to do whatever it takes. Venezuela will never again be a colony."" On Monday the U.S. State Department said it supported talks to defuse the conflict. ""We support Colombia's call for dialogue between Venezuela and Colombia to overcome recent tensions in the relationship,"" a State Department spokesman told CNN en Español. ""As a member of the hemispheric community, we are prepared to work collaboratively to promote peaceful solutions to disputes in the region."" Relations between Colombia and Venezuela have been rocky since the summer. In August, Colombia accused Venezuela of supplying guerillas with shoulder-fired anti-tank weapons. Such weapons seized from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had been traced to Venezuela, Colombia said. The FARC has been fighting the Colombian government for more than 45 years. Chavez, at the time, said the accusation amounted to blackmail. Last month Venezuelan authorities said they captured two Colombian spies. Colombia denied the claim. Also in October, near the border between the two countries, Venezuelan authorities found the murdered bodies of 10 men that Colombia described as an amateur soccer team that had been kidnapped near the border. Venezuela said the men were paramilitaries. Tensions were last stoked a week ago when two Venezuelan national guardsmen at an international bridge between the two countries were killed by gunmen on motorcycles. Venezuela blamed Colombian paramilitaries for the attacks, and accused the Colombian government of complacency toward such groups.","Colombia says it would ask for intervention from U.N.

All the farmers were also the ski racers in the old days, so their families went in the barns and grabbed the bells. ""Olympians have told me that when they're at the bottom of the hill, they can hear a little shouting but they can really hear the cowbells."" Winter Olympic icon . Watch any ski race on television and you will hear the same dull, persistent background clanging. Turn up in person and dull is the wrong word: stand in the right (wrong?) place and it's more a cacophony. Already steeped in Alpine history, cowbells have become a global success and Winter Olympic icon over the last two decades. Halvorson got into the business ahead of the Salt Lake City Winter Games of 2002, where the golden, oblong bells became a sought-after souvenir. ""It's really a European cultural thing that, in the past 15 years or so, has grown here in the States,"" she told CNN. ""If the Swiss are coming to an event they'll bring really big bells, a foot high or more. Belarus has some good bells too, and they come with sheepskins on. ""How many do we sell? I quit counting when we reached 70 tons -- and that was before the 2002 Games."" Halvorson imports bells manufactured in Norway by a small family business Moen Bjøllefabrikk, based in a factory south-west of Oslo. ""My grandfather started it in 1922,"" says head of the company Lena Alette Moen Grude. ""He began producing bells for his neighbors' domestic animals and sheep."" The company has changed with the times -- it now makes GPS tracking devices for livestock -- but when a Winter Olympics is within sight, cowbells become their hottest commodity by far. ""We produce approximately 30,000 bells each year,"" says Moen Grude. ""For us, it started before the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer in 1994. The fans saw it as the only souvenir that let them take the spirit of the Olympics back home. ""For the Salt Lake City Olympics, we produced 68,000 bells -- more than two years' production -- in two months. When there is a Winter Olympics, it dominates our company. ""I remember producing the bells for Salt Lake City, working late at night and listening to the Games on the radio. I could hear the bells being rung in America as I was engraving them in Norway. That was special."" Changing fabric . Like brass bands, or singing at football matches, the ting-a-ling sensation of a cowbell feels warm and traditional -- part of the very fabric of sport. But that fabric is changing. Where once making noise at events was the responsibility of the fans, clubs and venues increasingly see the atmosphere as theirs to generate, maintain -- and police. Go to most major sporting events in 2013 and the ambiance will be provided by vast, booming speaker systems. In a world of YouTube, endless TV channels and bewildering freedom of entertainment choice, sports reach out and grab their audience by the ears. So is the cowbell a relic of an age when fans were left to their own devices? ""Sport now sells music and music sells sport,"" says academic Anthony Bateman, who researches the relationship between the two at England's De Montfort University in Leicester. ""The links are getting stronger and stronger and that is partly commercial. ""Music is pumped out to encourage chanting and singing and there is a sense that, for example, football clubs are intruding into what was once a fairly spontaneous part of fan culture."" Records of chanting at football matches go back to the 19th Century, with famous songs such as Portsmouth's ""Pompey Chimes"" and Norwich's ""On The Ball City"" dating to the late 1800s. A century earlier, says Bateman, early books on cricket described a ""rambunctious crowd culture, a little like the (present-day England supporters') Barmy Army"". Contrast that with an example from 2004, he says. ""The Premier League actually paid someone (Birmingham City fan Jonny Hurst) $16,000 to write chants for different clubs. ""People said that typified the sterile, corporate atmosphere -- supporters are not trusted to come up with their own songs any more. It was an organic relationship in the past, and now things seem terribly forced."" Indoor sports arenas, in particular, now batter occupants with wall-to-wall music during stoppages in play. Extreme outdoor pursuits emerged hand-in-hand with a youth culture of music and video, while football teams have been known to play recordings of chants to get a crowd going as sports establish which techniques work, and which simply alienate their fanbase. ""Sound is one way by which sports are now constantly reinventing themselves,"" concludes Bateman. Cowbell in vogue . Yet diehard ski race fans still stand on a slope and ring bells from a small Norwegian factory, in the tradition of Alpine farmers. And that tradition spreads by the month. Moen Grude recently packed off a shipment of bells with Norwegian fans heading to the European Handball Championships. Cycling and triathlon are increasingly the domain of the cowbell. Tennis racket manufacturers gave away branded versions at the U.S. Open. Halvorson denies any suggestion this last example is a sign that even the cowbell can go corporate. ""What's happening is they're becoming collectible. A guy once called me, saying: 'My wife and I just got divorced. The wife got the cowbells. Do you happen to have this one? This one? How about this one?' ""They didn't make a cowbell for Nagano but they did one for the Nagano Paralympics, then for Lillehammer, Salt Lake, Torino and Vancouver. The Vancouver one is very hard to find. ""But what we sell is fun. That's what we sell. A cowbell is simply an interaction between athlete and spectator.""","Cowbells represent a defiant clanging in a world of corporate glitz .

It grew from Alpine traditions where farmers would take bells along for winter ski racing ."
"(CNN) -- As news of the tragic shooting at a school in Newtown, Connecticut, rippled across the globe, Mari Lolarga found a candle in his home in the Philippines and lit it in honor of those who died. Lolarga, who lives in Santa Rosa City, said he found it ""unspeakable"" that someone would kill people who could not defend themselves, especially children ""who know nothing of violence."" ""I wanted people to understand that while we may not be Americans, we too are parents who care deeply for our children,"" the father of two said. His heartfelt reaction was typical of many in CNN.com's international community responding to last week's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. It triggered an outpouring of views from across the world, with many offering condolences to those affected. How other countries deal with massacre nightmare . From Haiti to Pakistan, people said they were shocked at the apparent targeting of children and expressed helplessness that they could not do more to stop the violence. View from abroad: Sorrow, but little hope for U.S. gun control . Many were teachers, describing a kinship they felt for those women who died protecting their charges. Others were parents, saying they wanted to hold their offspring a little closer and reach out to those for whom such contact would no longer be possible. ""May Allah give courage to all families to face it bravely, may the souls of those angels rest in peace,"" said Ghulam Murtaza, an elementary school teacher from Pakistan. In Lithuania, a teacher identifying herself as Veronika commented: ""I send all my love and prayers to the families. It is all I can do from so far away, but my heart is now in Newtown with all the affected people. God bless them all."" And in Haiti, Frisnel Oxine said he could barely read the news reports for crying. ""I also have a girl of 6, and I just imagine she could have been there,"" he said. ""We used to travel to the U.S. and wanted (her) to stay for school."" There are few parts of the world left unscarred by mass shootings. Places such as Dunblane, Scotland, or Aurora, Colorado, conjure images of terror and loss simply from their names. 'This is what parents in the Middle East go through every day' In Port Said, Egypt, Maggy Hamada spent hours glued to CNN in her home, growing increasingly depressed and sympathetic toward the families left bereft. Hamada, an Egyptian-American, compared the tragedy to the many children killed in recent violence across the Middle East. ""The murder of these innocent children living in America is obviously something very new (to America), and no one would think in a million years that this could happen in the U.S,"" she said. ""... I guess it's a wake-up call for America because they tasted a bit of what the other countries in the Middle East go through every single day."" In grief and with love, from Canada . Inevitably, many questioned U.S. gun control laws, comparing them with their own countries and finding the U.S. government wanting when it comes to action. Lisa Garnier from Canada said she and her husband were so devastated by the news they both sat down and cried. ""What else would your reaction be?"" Garnier asked. ""It doesn't matter where you were. Anyone who heard it had to take a moment to sit down. It's horrible."" The pair said they could not help comparing U.S. gun laws to their situation in Canada, where there are strict licensing laws and waiting periods. They also felt that the last thing you would do is arm more citizens with lethal weapons. ""The police or the army -- they are the people that should have guns,"" said her husband, Julian. ""They need to have 100% of all people background checked and a waiting period of a week or more so no one can buy a gun on a spur of the moment."" South African questions tougher gun control . However, others said they felt that guns were not the problem -- just better enforcement of laws and more arming of responsible citizens. Wessel Smith from Pretoria, South Africa, owns a gun and carries it with him at all times. He said he wishes he didn't have to do so but said several years ago his wife had an AK-47 pointed at her during a robbery. The incident convinced him that ""responsible citizens"" with no criminal backgrounds should be armed. ""Gun control won't stop crazy men from murdering people in schools,"" he said, ""(but) if I was a teacher at that school and I was carrying a weapon, that guy would have been dead."" Despite differing opinions on how to stop such crimes from being committed, many people said they were united in one thing -- grief for those parents who had lost a child. ""As a mother of two kids I understand there are no words that can support the poor parents,"" said one commenter from Russia who identified herself as Julia. ""I just want to say that people in Russia are crying with you now.""","People from Haiti to Pakistan express sorrow over killings in Newtown, Connecticut .

"(CNN) -- Looking ahead to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, the Brazilian Ministry of Defense sent 7,500 troops to the country's northwest borders with Peru and Bolivia for another in a series of crackdowns on ""cross-border crimes."" The operation, nicknamed Agata 6, is expected to last two weeks. This is the sixth time that Brazilian soldiers, backed by fighter jets, combat helicopters, patrol boats and armored vehicles, are taking over parts of the country's vast border areas to fight crime alongside the local population. So far, the Agata missions have seizing more than 332 kilograms of marijuana, 19.5 kilograms of cocaine, and 11,730 kilograms of explosives. Heading the operation is the chief of the Joint Staff of the Armed Forces of Brazil, Gen. Jose Carlos De Nardi. The Brazilian government hopes the military show of force through the Agata operations will increase the feeling of security among the population and deter crimes that go beyond drug and arms trafficking and smuggling. ""In each area there is a specific type of offense,"" De Nardi said. ""While in the south there is, for example, animal theft and smuggling, in the central-west we have drug trafficking and in the north gold mining, timber smuggling and arms trafficking. The important thing is that Operation Agata enables the armed forces to map all cross-border crimes."" Before launching the operation, Brazilian Minister of Defense Celso Amorim informed the governments of Bolivia and Peru and encouraged them to send their own observers in an effort to increase South American cooperation in defense missions. Part of the military deployment will also focus on bringing social projects to the country's biggest allies along the border -- the local, mostly rural population. The first five Agata operations have provided more than 14,500 dental and 18,500 medical services to people within Brazil's border regions, officials say. The operations also provide the local population with vaccines and medications. Amorim said that the Ministry of Defense, which launched the Agata program in 2011, is planning to carry out at least three more deployments in 2013. Brazil sends troops to border to fight crime .

"(CNN) -- Seventy dollars. Gary Bender had difficulty believing what was right before his eyes. Bender, an accountant who lives in Irvine, California, was looking at a hospital bill he had found while going through the possessions of his late mother, Sylvia. ""I'm kind of the family historian,"" he told me. ""I keep things."" What he was looking at was the bill for his own birth, in 1947. The bill had been mailed to his parents after they, and he, had left Grant Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, in May of that year. The grand total for his mother's six-day stay at Grant, for the use of the operating room, for his days in the nursery, for the various medicines and lab work -- for all aspects of his birth -- was $70. ""It made me think, 'How did we get from that, to where we are today?'"" Bender said. He was referring to the soaring costs of health care in the United States. For all the discussion of how out of hand the price of medical treatment has become, somehow that one old piece of paper put the subject in sharper focus for Bender than all the millions of words in news accounts analyzing the topic. 10 ways falling off the fiscal cliff could hurt your health . ""It can't just be inflation, can it?"" he asked. No, it can't. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, $70 in 1947 would be equivalent to $726 in 2012 dollars. Does it cost $726 for a hospital stay to deliver a baby these days? Dream on. According to a 2011 report from the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the cost for a hospital stay, including physician fees, for a conventional birth with no complications was a little over $11,000 in 2008, the most recent year the report covered. For a birth involving a Caesarean section, the cost was around $19,000. (While five- or six-day hospital stays were commonplace for mothers and newborns in the 1940s, today they routinely leave the hospital within 48 hours of childbirth -- so the higher costs are for shorter stays.) At Grant Hospital in Columbus -- now called Grant Medical Center -- a spokeswoman told me that the average cost for having a baby is around $15,000. So what exactly has happened, for costs to rise so astronomically? A lot of things, said Dr. Gary Hankins of the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, a former chair of ACOG's obstetric practice committee. The technology available to keep mothers and babies safe is light years removed from what was available in 1947, he said, and ""regrettably, the technology is expensive."" He said that in almost every way, new mothers and their babies are better off now than they were 65 years ago. The antibiotics that have been developed to fight infections, the improved surgical procedures, the sophisticated anesthesia, the highly accurate electronic fetal monitors and other medical machinery -- all provide advantages for mother and child that did not exist in 1947. Medical malpractice insurance premiums figure into the high cost of childbirth today, he said. And there are some physicians who question whether all procedures that are regularly performed, increasing costs, are routinely necessary. But for all the frustration that patients feel about the price of medical care, one fact is indisputable: . The rate of infant mortality, and the rate of mortality for new mothers, has plummeted, said Hankins. In 1950 nearly 30 infants out of 1,000 died at or soon after birth; in 2009, that number was 6.4 out of 1,000, according to the ACOG report. It may be more expensive to give birth to a child today, but both the mother and child, if there is trouble during delivery, have a much better chance of survival than they once did. Opinion: Fairness needed for pregnant workers . At Grant, where Gary Bender was born, Dr. Michael Sprague, medical director of women's health, told me that ""infection, blood clots, hemorrhage -- our ability to diagnose and treat all of these"" is considerably better today. ""You never know who that patient is going to be,"" Sprague said -- the mother or baby who suddenly requires all the resources a hospital maintains, at great expense, to save lives during delivery. I sent copies of Gary Bender's childbirth bill to Hankins and Sprague. Both were amazed at the particulars: . The hospital room charge for Sylvia Bender was $7 per day, for six days. The cost for Gary to stay in the nursery was $2 per day. The flat rate for maternity service was $15. Grant Hospital, by the way, was not an anomaly; a 1947 brochure from Santa Monica Hospital in California, to use one example, listed a similar price structure for having a baby: $17.50 for maternity service, $2 per day for the nursery, an extra $15 if the birth was by cesarean section. And Gary Bender, who came into this world for $70? He told me that last year, the cost of the health insurance he and his employer sign up for, covering him and his wife, was in excess of $18,000 -- and that was before a single visit to a physician, and before a single prescription was filled. ""It just astonishes me that in our lifetime, we have seen such extremes in medical costs,"" said Bender, who was one of more than 3.8 million American babies born in 1947. And who -- with that old hospital bill still in hand -- lived to tell the tale. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene.","Bob Greene's friend found the hospital bill from his birth in 1947. It was $70, $726 in 2012 dollars .
He says the price of a hospital birth in 2008 was $11,000. Why is it so expensive now?
He says huge pricetag is partly due to advanced technology that has greatly cut infant mortality .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Tanks, troops and police pushed through the streets of two shantytowns in northern Rio de Janeiro Sunday in a move to retake control of some of the city's most crime-ridden areas. In the predawn operation, state authorities targeted the slums, or favelas, of Jacarezinho and Manguinhos with more than 2,000 military troops and police. They have a larger long-term goal: securing 40 slums before the World Cup in 2014, and keeping them safe for the Olympics two years later. Police said they seized automatic weapons, guns and grenades and arrested dozens of people in a series of slum raids over the weekend. There were no reports of deaths or injuries Sunday. On Saturday, police said five suspected drug dealers were killed during a slum raid. Police have already taken over about 30 favelas since they began operations in 2008, but it's an uphill battle. About one-fifth of Rio's residents live in the city's 1,000 shantytowns, many of them perched on steep hills overlooking beachside condominiums. Jacarezinho and Manguinhos are smaller favelas, far from tourist hotspots, but they became centers for organized crime and drug dealing after other slums were taken over by police. Sunday's operation there stands in stark contrast to the invasion of the Alemao favela in 2010, when more than 30 people were killed in shootouts. Police now announce days in advance when they're going to go into a community, to avoid major violence. But critics say it simply gives criminals a chance to escape to another slum, or the suburbs. Authorities said they planned to set up a ""police pacification unit"" in Manguinhos by December, and in Jacarezinho by January. Three years ago, they took a similar approach in the notorious Cidade de Deus, or City of God, slum where military police backed by the army seized control from drug traffickers. ""They were abandoned for 40, 50 years,"" said Maj. Bruno Xavier of the police pacification unit there. ""You can't recover that in three years."" But now, Xavier told CNN last month, they plan to prove to the slum's 40,000 residents that they're here to stay.","Two slums are targeted in an operation aimed at cleaning up crime before the World Cup .

"(CNN) -- Mexican crooner Vicente Fernandez, an icon of folk music known for his ranchera ballads, will undergo a liver biopsy in Houston on Tuesday, he announced. Considered Mexico's most famous living singer, Fernandez told CNN affiliate Foro TV that doctors had found a 2-centimeter ""ball"" in his liver that requires examination. ""They don't know what it is, but it shouldn't be there,"" Fernandez said. Fans will anxiously await the results of the biopsy. Fernandez asked the public not to be alarmed and to pray for him. ""To clarify things, in reality I don't have anything, unless they tell me something"" after the test, he said. Near Mexico City's Plaza Garibaldi, where mariachi groups often perform Fernadez's songs, fan Isidro Salazar said he was praying for the singer. ""I hope that God gives him relief,"" Salazar said. Many in Mexico count Fernadez's songs among their personal repertoire and can sing lines from his well known ballads on cue. Fernandez's career has spanned four decades, and he is known as the king of ranchera music. He has appeared in more than 25 films as well, though his music career has eclipsed his acting career. ""For more than 45 years, Vicente Fernandez has maintained his position as the biggest living singer in Mexico, combining a operatic vocal range with a deep comprehension of the folk roots of ranchera music,"" his official biography says. The 72-year-old has won a bevy of awards, including, this month, three Mexican Music Billboard awards. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Chinese police have detained an ethnic Tibetan monk and his nephew, accusing them of ""goading"" eight people into setting themselves on fire. Lorang Konchok, a 40-year-old monk at Kirti monastery in southwestern Sichuan, had incited self immolations ""on the instructions of the Dalai Lama and his followers,"" state news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday. Xinhua said a police investigation and a confession from the monk showed he had recruited eight people since 2009. Three of the protesters died, the report added. Campaigners say that more than 90 ethnic Tibetans -- men and women -- have set themselves on fire since 2009 in a series of dramatic protests against Beijing's treatment of Tibetans. Because of Chinese restrictions on reporting in Tibetan regions, these acts have been difficult to confirm. The self-immolations have increased in frequency during recent months, with 28 setting themselves alight in November alone. Xinhua did not detail what evidence police had of the involvement of the Tibetan spiritual leader. The Tibetan government-in-exile in India was not immediately available to comment. The monk used his position at the monastery to encourage others to self-immolate, saying the act was not against Buddhist doctrines and those who did it were heroes, the report said. Konchok recruited his 31-year-old nephew, Lorang Tsering, to help and the pair collected personal information and took pictures of those who agreed to go ahead with the self immolations, it added. The monk also promised to ""spread their deeds abroad so they and their families would be acknowledged and honored,"" Xinhua cited a police statement as saying. Last week, Maria Otero, the U.S. special co-ordinator for Tibetan issues, said in a statement that tough Chinese policies in Tibetan areas had exacerbated tensions, including the immolations. ""Chinese authorities have responded to these tragic incidents with measures that tighten already strict controls on freedoms of religion, expression, assembly and association of Tibetans,"" she said. The statement provoked a harsh reaction from Beijing. The arrests also follow the release of a legal document last week that appears to stipulate that anyone caught helping someone self-immolate should be held liable for intentional homicide. ""Organizing, plotting, inciting, coercing, enticing, abetting, or assisting others to carry out self-immolations is, at its essence, a serious criminal act that intentionally deprives another of his or her life,"" the Gannan Daily newspaper said in a commentary on December 3, according to a translation by the Dui Hua foundation. Beijing says Tibet has been a part of China since the 13th century and regards the Dalai Lama as a terrorist. The Dalai Lama, who fled to India in 1959 after a failed uprising, has long denied China's assertion that he's seeking Tibetan independence. He says he wants only an autonomy that would offer protection for their traditional Buddhist culture.","Chinese police detain ethnic Tibetan monk and his nephew .

"Islamabad (CNN) -- A campaign to eradicate polio from the northwest tribal region of Pakistan is on hold after fatal attacks on health workers vaccinating children, the Balochistan government said Tuesday. Six polio vaccination workers were killed in attacks in Pakistan since Monday, the World Health Organization and Pakistani police told CNN Tuesday. Another attack last July wounded a WHO doctor and his driver while they worked on the polio campaign in Karachi. Read more: At the U.N., a vow to eradicate polio by 2015 . The motive for the attacks was unclear. However, Pakistanis have viewed polio vaccination campaigns with suspicion after the CIA's use of a fake vaccination program last year to collect DNA samples from residents of Osama bin Laden's compound to verify the al Qaeda leader's presence there. Bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces in May 2011. In June, a Taliban commander in northwest Pakistan announced a ban on polio vaccines for children in the region as long as the United States continues its campaign of drone strikes in the region, the Taliban said. ""Polio drops will be banned in North Waziristan"" until the strikes cease, according to a Taliban statement. North Waziristan is a tribal region of Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. Read more: WHO doctor attacked during Pakistan polio campaign . The vaccination campaign has been suspended indefinitely in Quetta, Killa Abdullah and Pishin districts, Balochistan government spokesman Noor ul Haq Baloch said. ""The reason behind suspension of the campaign is the security threat to workers,"" Baloch said. ""At least six people working on a polio vaccination campaign have been reported shot dead in several locations in Pakistan -- Gadap, Landi, Baldia and Orangi towns of Karachi city, Sindh Province and Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province,"" a WHO statement said. ""Those killed were among thousands who work selflessly across Pakistan to eradicate polio."" WHO earlier estimated that 280,000 children living in the tribal area were in need of polio vaccinations. Read more: Taliban's vaccine ban may affect 280,000 children . ""Polio is a highly infectious disease caused by a virus that can cause permanent paralysis in a matter of hours,"" WHO said. ""Safe and effective vaccines protect children from the disease. Currently the disease remains endemic in only three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan."" Health officials confirmed four cases of polio in Balochistan in 2012, while 11 cases of polio 2 virus were reported there, Baloch said. There were 73 cases of polio virus in 2011, he said. Four female health workers were shot to death in Karachi Tuesday morning, including two women killed after administering the vaccination to children, according to Naeem Shah, a senior police official. Two other women were shot while going house to house giving vaccinations in Peshawar, police official Javed Khan said.

"(CNN) -- For the people of Newtown and for people across the country, 9:30 a.m. was a time to stop, listen and remember. Bells rang in the Connecticut town and in churches and other buildings in multiple states Friday morning to remember the 20 children and six women who were gunned down at Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School at that hour a week ago. Standing in rain -- some holding umbrellas and others letting the water wash over their bowed heads -- people in Newtown gathered outside various locations and paused as multiple churches rang their bells, once for each victim. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy and Lt. Gov. Nancy Wyman stood with others under the awning of Newtown's Edmond Town Hall, listening to bells of a nearby church. People also paused elsewhere in town -- under a tent that covered the numerous flowers and stuffed animals left as a memorial -- and outside various churches. Some closed their eyes. Some put hands on their hearts. All stood nearly still as the bells rang. At least one Newtown church rang its bells 28 times, marking the deaths of the school's 26 victims; the gunman's mother, who was slain before the shooter went to the school; and the gunman himself, who authorities say committed suicide after the shootings. Three pastors at that church, Newtown United Methodist, took turns ringing the bell. In the state Capitol building in Hartford, a bell was rung for each of the school's 26 victims after their names were read. ""Amazing Grace"" was sung afterward. Bells were rung at the National Cathedral in Washington and the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Miami. Traders at the New York Stock Exchange paused silently for one minute before the opening bell. Earlier, in a letter to other governors across the country, Malloy noted how the shooting in his state has resonated nationwide. ""Mourning this tragedy has extended beyond Newtown, beyond the borders of Connecticut, and has spread across the nation and the world,"" he said. ""On behalf of the State of Connecticut, we appreciate the letters and calls of support that have been delivered to our state and to the family members during their hour of need."" At least 29 states declared a moment of silence for Friday morning, with flags flying at half-staff. People mourned on the Internet, as well: Some websites went dark at the urging of Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway, who came up with the idea at a Christmas party attended by Gabby Giffords, the former Arizona congresswoman who was wounded in a 2011 shooting that killed six. Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma suggested that residents wear green, Sandy Hook's school color. In Alaska, the Capitol's bell was scheduled to ring at 9:30 a.m. local time. The bell is a full-scale replica of the Liberty Bell. Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Texas Gov. Rick Perry called for residents of their states to pause to reflect one week after the shooting rampage. Perry also asked that churches ring their bells 26 times in honor of the victims at the school. In an open letter to the people of Newtown in Friday's Hartford Courant, first lady Michelle Obama wrote that she and President Barack Obama are ""holding you and your families in our hearts."" ""As a mother of two young daughters, my heart aches for you and your families. Like so many Americans, I wish there were something -- anything -- I could do or say to ease your anguish,"" Michelle Obama wrote.

"(CNN) -- In an industry known for elevating a certain look, prizing a certain age and sticking to the script, Jane Lynch is exceptional. At 52, the 6-foot-tall comedienne and actress has experienced more success in the last five years of her career than most actors could dream of for their entire life. Her role as Sue Sylvester on the hit television series ""Glee"" has won her critical praise and accolades including a Screen Actor's Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and Primetime Emmy Award. Likewise, Lynch's personal life is experiencing its own renaissance. In 2010, she married Dr. Lara Embry and in doing so became a second mom to daughters Haden and Chase. With the ease of a seasoned vet, Lynch masterfully balances bawdy with heart. If you missed her outrageous turn as a lesbian dog trainer in ""Best in Show"" or lampooning fellow funny lady Roseanne during a Comedy Central roast, you might have caught her as the voice of Calhoun in the recent Disney movie ""Wreck-It Ralph."" For her next adventure, Lynch moves from the screen to the page, hoping to entertain kids of all ages with the new holiday book ""Elfbot."" CNN: Tell me about ""Elfbot."" Lynch: Oh, it's great! It's an audio book that Barnes & Noble is offering. It's a great reverse Pinocchio story where the toymaker wants to become a toy. It's a lot of fun. We're hoping to start a holiday tradition. CNN: And I hear it's a family affair? Lynch: Yes, my daughter Haden is on it. Actually, we all know each other very well, and Kenny G is on it. The director is my best friend. CNN: Is it scary or exciting to see your child possibly getting into showbiz? Lynch: Scary. There's a part of me that had to find my own way. I started from kind of an obscure place, and I really wanted it. I think that adds to my level of professionalism. ... But, I just have to have faith in the goodness of my kids, and she's a great kid. I have this thing about me, because I came up from nowhere, that she should too, but you know what, that's not her path. CNN: You have come a long way, all the way from Dolton, Illinois, to the red carpets of Hollywood. Do you still pinch yourself? Lynch: Every day! And it's a plethora of things. I pinch myself every day, and there's a part of me that's always like, ""wow!"" CNN: When you hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" and went completely nude for that digital short, I remember thinking, ""this woman is fearless."" Was there a moment in your life when you just decided to be completely unapologetic for your creative choices? Lynch: Oh, absolutely. It was when I was doing improv at Second City. You're doing these sets afterwards, and sometimes it's like the bigger choice you make, the bigger you fall on your face. I think my work started to seem profound when I started making huge choices. Yes, some of them were too huge, where you lose people and you lose reality, but I think you have to go that far in order to know what you can do -- what's inside of you. CNN: I hope someone was recording those big moments. Lynch: I remember playing Queen Margaret in ""Richard III"" in Chicago's Shakespeare Company. Usually, that character is cut because she is so bombastic. Well, I wanted to keep her in! So I did and a review came out that said when I was finished, there was no scenery left! So yeah. CNN: Cleared the room, did you? Lynch: Exactly. It was huge. CNN: Sue Sylvester knows how to clear a room. What's going on over at ""Glee"" these days? Lynch: Well, we have these new kids, and I'm absolutely floored by their talent. I love the fact that we're following the gang in New York, you know, Rachel and the kids. The writers have really stepped up. It's a new show this year but with all the same principles. It's all about raising your voice in song and having each other's back, and I think that's why it's resonated so strongly. CNN: The show's diverse themes have been a lightning rod for praise and criticism. It reminds me of a modern ""All in the Family."" Do you ever feel like Ryan Murphy has taken the baton from Norman Lear? Lynch: You know, I hadn't made that connection, but I think that's really apt. Norman Lear was really ahead of his time. ""All in the Family"" was all about progress and was so groundbreaking. Why didn't things take off from there? But, I think you're absolutely right. Ryan is on the line and pushing people. We have a transgender character on ""Glee,"" and we're showing the realism in that -- the struggle with the kids and the parents to accept him. Ultimately, they do, and they cast him as Rizzo in ""Grease."" And, of course, I ruin it all! You know, it's Sue's own prejudice, her own fear that someone will be ridiculed, whereas the kids feel strong enough. CNN: You've become a role model to millions of people but especially gay women. Did you set out to champion gay rights? Lynch: It's not something I ever set out to do, but I'm glad I can. I really have to thank all those that came before me. They made it possible. People like Ellen and Rosie. There are so many people out there every day working for all of us. CNN: It sounds like the themes of acceptance and inclusiveness on ""Glee"" really line up with your own personal views. Lynch: Oh, very much! I always wished I had something like ""Glee"" when I was growing up. I'm glad there are kids living out there in not-so-friendly parts of the country who have ""Glee"" to watch. They can see that there is hope and that it does get better and that there are people who have your back. You just have to find them.","Lynch is providing the voice for new holiday book ""Elfbot""

"(CNN) -- Using a new ""Build and Battle"" game mechanic, ""Starhawk"" offers more than your typical third-person shooter, tapping ino the player's strategic thinking while creating an enjoyable ride. Lightbox Interactive founder Dylan Jobe wanted to take one of their old titles, ""Warhawk,"" and make it into something more enjoyable and more complete. ""Warhawk,"" released in 2007, was widely praised for its multiplayer action, but it had no single-player campaign. Jobe and his team took the best ideas from ""Warhawk,"" combined them with a new setting and single-player campaign, then added his a new mechanic that effectively creates what can be considered a new way to think about shooters. ""Build and Battle"" allows players to call down hardware from a ship circling high above the planet. When I say hardware, I don't mean a weapons cache full of ammo and guns. I mean large, physical structures and buildings that allow players to defend, attack and punish the enemy. Walls with turrets on top, garages with jet cycles inside, buggies, tanks and tall sniper towers complete with rifles -- all are at the players' command. These items and many more can be called down and placed on the battlefield for maximum damage or protection. Ground and air vehicles can also be called down and used. Jet bikes and Razorbacks (three-player combat buggies) handle a lot of the ground transportation. Ox Tanks can bring the pain with artillery shells and cannons. (As their name implies, they can take a lot of punishment but are slow to move). If you are looking for more speed and maneuverability, the Hawk is a transformer-like vehicle that switches from armored robot to nimble aircraft quickly. On the ground, a ""mech stomp"" wipes out scores of troops, while in the air, the jet has a range of specialized missiles and bombs at its disposal. Each one of these vehicles can be spawned from a garage summoned with the ""Battle and Build"" mechanic. As with the other buildings, planning must be utilized to determine prime placement as well as how each garage can be defended. The ""Build and Battle"" concept works seamlessley within combat and adds a strategic element to each battle. No longer do players have to think only about conserving ammunition. Now, they need create the environment around themselves while taking on waves of enemies. Do you use walls to block routes into your area? Or do you arrange them to funnel the enemy into a gauntlet of beam turrets? It is this flexibility of gameplay that makes ""Starhawk"" enjoyable and interesting. Plus, if a particularly large group of scabs (the enemy grunts) are headed your way, you can always just drop a building on them. Each structure costs ""rift energy,"" a universal source of power harvested from different planets, much like oil on Earth. Indeed, the single-player campaign has a Wild West feel and motif that could remind gamers of the great Oil Rush in the United States. Rifters want to capture the rift energy to sell it, while Outcasts believe the rift energy to be their lifeblood and want to destroy all who would take it. Emmitt Graves, the main character in the campaign, goes into the disputed areas to reclaim the rift from the Outcasts. The storyline is told through cinematic videos rather than actual gameplay and merely acts as rather weak glue between the combat set pieces. Despite trying to inject some connection between Emmitt and the leader of the Outcasts, characters in the story come across as emotionless and uncaring about anything other than getting the job done. But it's multiplayer mode where the game really shines. Up to 32 players can battle in four different scenarios and five different environments across two maps. More maps are planned as downloadable content (DLC), which Jobe says will be free to all. The ""Build and Battle"" mechanic is at its best in the Capture The Flag and Zones modes. Teammates work together to build walls, turrets and repair arms to defend their areas while others take vehicles out to seek and destroy the opposing side. Coordination is key and many battles have been won due to the combined efforts of teammates defending or attacking en masse. The more players per side, the more action and organized chaos there is across the battlefield. It truly is some of the best and most enjoyable gameplay I've experienced on the PlayStation 3. Overall, the combat in ""Starhawk"" is refreshing, thoughtful and very well done. The environments are as beautiful as the ""Build and Battle"" mechanic is unique. The breadth of weapons, vehicles and buildings make each playthrough different, and the multiplayer highlights the best of all that is available. While the campaign story is disappointing, ""Starhawk"" ends up being a game that shines in spite of its weak characters. In some ways, the ""Build and Battle"" system is the true star of the action, and that's just fine for gamers who enjoy thinking their way through a battle as much, if not more, than shooting their way through one. ""Starhawk"" is available now worldwide exclusively for the PlayStation 3. It is rated T for Teens due to blood, language, and violence.

"(CNN) -- When ""Sorcery"" was demonstrated during the Sony presentation at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2010, it was touted as the quintessential game for the new Move motion controller, showcasing how action can be directed with the new device. Fast forward two years, and ""Sorcery"" doesn't quite live up to expectations of what the Move system could be. Despite some controller issues, it still offers a fun experience though. In it, you step into the role of Finn, a young apprentice in the art of magic who is thrust into battle against the dark forces to save a faerie princess, Erline. The princess, by the way, is a cat with a very long tail. As the game progresses, Finn discovers the ability to cast new spells, which the player casts using the Move controller. A flick of the wrist helps you select your spell and target your enemies. The navigation controller keeps Finn moving while you blast bogeys and assassins with the wand controller. Spell selection is done by holding down the Move button, then making the appropriate gesture to select your spell -- down for an earth spell, counterclockwise for an ice spell and so on. Switching spells is quick and very responsive. Players can also combine spell effects for more powerful attacks. Using an ice spell three times will freeze an enemy and allow them to be shattered with a magic missile. A whirlwind can be created with an air spell, then using a fire spell will spew fire bolts all over the place. However, targeting your opponents gets a little tricky. Players are supposed to aim higher for foes located on a higher level than Finn, but those shots don't seem as consistent as level ones. Unfortunately, the foes on ledges and stairs seem to have no problem raining down shots on you. Also, when multiple foes start attacking, that flicking action can be a bit hard on the arm and shoulder. Take frequent breaks or else suffer the aches later. The player will collect raw materials to make potions that restore health and enhance spell abilities. There is also treasure to be found, and it can be used to buy more materials for those potions. Interestingly, once you create a potion and drink it, you never have to make that potion again. The only potions to be reused repeatedly are health potions, which can be bought or found but not created. The Move controller creates the potions. You are asked to go through the motions of grinding berries, sprinkling dust or pouring a liquid into a cauldron, and then must stir using the wand controller to mix the ingredients together. Despite being a role-playing game, there is no traditional ""leveling up."" Any advancement happens through the potions you create and quaff and the spells you find as the game progresses. The game's dialogue is funny and spirited. There are plenty of quips and one-liners but unfortunately no chances for players to retort. The voice actors for Finn and Erline project real emotions into the characters and help the players feel empathic to their fears, their jokes and their hopes. ""Sorcery"" should be the right game for the Move controller, and in many ways, it is. The action flows well, the story is easy to follow and the characters are noteworthy. It isn't a very deep game, but as an introduction of sorts to Sony's Move tech, it doesn't have to be. ""Sorcery"" is now available for the PlayStation 3, and only uses the Move motion controller, navigation controller and Eye camera. It is rated E 10+ for Everyone 10 years of age and older due to fantasy violence, mild blood, and mild suggestive themes.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- A car bomber hit outside a U.S. base in eastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, killing three people and leaving civilians injured, authorities said. The blast killed a security guard and two truck drivers delivering supplies, according to Abdul Qayoom Baqizoy, the provincial police chief. Six civilians suffered injuries, he said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred after a minibus stopped at the gate for a security check. Official: Shooter in insider attack is Iranian national . In an e-mail, a spokesman for the terror group said the attack was conducted ""when American soldiers were busy searching their Afghan servants"" at the gate of the base.

"(CNN) -- Iraqi President Jalal Talabani is headed to Germany under the care of a specialized medical team for medical treatment, Kurdish lawmaker Mahmoud Othman said Thursday. Talabani is in stable condition, his office has said. Talabani was rushed to a Baghdad hospital Monday night in deteriorating health because of hardening of his arteries, his office told the media. But Othman, who is close to Talabani, said earlier this week that the 79-year-old leader had suffered a stroke. ""His health condition is not very good,"" he said. Read more: Iraq's president in stable condition, office says . The president's office on Tuesday released a statement saying that Talabani was exhausted. ""Recently, His Excellency President Jalal Talabani spent exhaustive efforts in order to accomplish harmony and stability in the country. Due to fatigue and exhaustion, His Excellency had a health emergency,"" the office said. Talabani was elected president of Iraq in 2005, in the nation's first free elections in more than 50 years. This is not the first time he has dealt with serious medical issues. At times, the exact nature of his ailments has been shrouded in secrecy. In February 2007, he fell ill and was flown to Jordan for treatment, and there were conflicting reports about what prompted his hospitalization. A hospital source told CNN at the time that doctors performed a catheterization procedure on his heart, but his family and aides denied that. Talabani's doctor and a spokesman for the president's office said then that he was suffering from exhaustion and lung inflammation, and underwent tests they described as precautionary. He did not return to Iraq until March of that year. Two months later, Talabani left for medical tests and to lose weight, his office said. He did not return until June. In January 2012, he had spinal surgery in Germany. CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.","Jalal Talabani was hospitalized earlier this week in Iraq .

"(CNN) -- The company at the center of a deadly meningitis outbreak was warned by its own environmental monitors of bacterial contamination of its facility months before the first cases were reported, a government report said Friday. Mold, and in some cases, an overgrowth of bacteria was detected in different areas of the New England Compounding Center's two ""clean rooms"" nearly 90 times since January, the Food and Drug Administration report said. Clean rooms are intended to be sterile environments in which drugs are produced. FDA warns higher-risk patients amid meningitis outbreak . Despite the warnings from its own monitors, the FDA report says the compounding center did not investigate the reports of the contamination nor is there documented evidence it worked to decontaminate the affected areas. Tainted medications from the compounding center have been blamed for the outbreak of fungal meningitis that has caused 25 deaths and 338 illnesses. The FDA's preliminary findings were released following an inspection of the compounding center this month. In addition to documented reports of bacterial contamination, FDA investigators observed ""greenish black foreign matter"" and ""white filamentous material"" in vials of methylprednisolone acetate -- the steroid linked to the meningitis outbreak. Vials contain fungus linked to meningitis outbreak . The Framingham, Massachusetts-based compounding center acknowledged receiving the report Friday, but declined to comment beyond saying it will review the findings. ""We will follow the existing regulatory process and provide our comments to the FDA after we have had adequate time for a complete review of the report,"" the company statement said. The FDA report comes the same week that the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy voted to revoke permanently the compounding center's license to operate in the state as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists. A damning nine-page report released Tuesday by the same state board ""identified serious deficiencies and significant violations of pharmacy law and regulations that clearly placed the public's health at risk."" Federal authorities have launched a criminal investigation into the center's safety practices. Authorities were first alerted to the outbreak when a cluster of six rare fungal meningitis cases were reported in Tennessee on September 24. The patients shared several risk factors, including an epidural injection of a steroid -- methylprednisolone acetate 80 mg/ml preservative free -- that had been compounded at the center. Since then, the outbreak has grown to 18 states.

"(CNN) -- Pixar has an unparalleled track record when it comes to family entertainment, even if they did hit a bump with ""Cars 2"" last year. But like many other Hollywood studios, the company is guilty of ignoring the half of the population who aren't little boys at heart. At last, with ""Brave,"" it's the girls' turn to shine -- a bit behind the curve in this year of the Warrior Princess. The movie itself is no more than an agreeable lark. It's not in the same league as ""Up"", ""WALLE"" or the ""Toy Story"" films, but fun all the same. Set in sunny, ancient Scotland -- complete with warring clans, rampaging beasts, magical witches and supernatural will-o'-the-wisps -- the movie quickly checks off the expected sightings: kilts, haggis, caber-tossing and Billy Connolly. Nessie doesn't make the cut, but I wouldn't be too surprised if she showed up in a sequel. Gallery: 'Brave's' Merida and other animated heroines . Merida (voiced by Kelly Macdonald) is the eldest child to Fergus (Connolly) and Elinor (Emma Thompson). Headstrong, with cascading, blazing red locks, Merida is a tomboy. She'd rather be riding horses, scaling cliffs or hunting with her bow and arrow than sewing, singing and accepting her mother's mind on what behaviors befit a princess of their clan. Merida fits right in line with the dynamic damsels we have seen recently in warring ""Snow White"" films, ""John Carter"" and ""The Hunger Games."" It's refreshing that she's also foolhardy and no wiser than most teenagers. Mother-daughter relationships are still at a premium in big-budget flicks, and ""Brave"" observes their squabbling with an affectionate, even-handed familiarity that's nice to see. Merida's independent streak stiffens to all-out rebellion when Elinor announces it's time to marry. As tradition demands, the groom will be the son of a neighboring chieftain, whoever emerges victorious at the forthcoming games at the gathering of the clans. But Merida has her own ideas about that, and storms out in search of some means to change her mum's mind. Pixar has played coy about what happens next. It's the biggest and best surprise in a yarn that often feels a bit threadbare and shopworn, so we won't give it away here. Appealing as this left-field plot twist is, it's also daft. It's as if Merida has taken a stupid pill, and the plentiful coincidences that follow are almost as hard to swallow. Pixar likes to boast that it's all about the story, but this tall tale has more holes than a draughty sporran. The time scale feels off, and King Fergus in particular is left dangling for too long. That's not to say it isn't enjoyable. It's just that we've come to expect more from this brand. By anyone else's standards, ""Brave"" stands as a crisp, lively frolic, brimming with texture and color (all those follicles!). It's sure to appeal to the wee bairns -- and their mams too.","""Brave"" stands as a crisp, lively frolic, brimming with texture and color .

"LAHORE, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan President Gen. Pervez Musharraf swore seven of his allies into a caretaker government on Friday. Former chairman of the Senate Mohammad Mian Soomro was sworn in as prime minister. ""An old cabinet is gone and a new cabinet -- a caretaker government -- has been sworn in,"" Musharraf said to applause. ""Life continues, no body is permanent. One comes, one serves, tries one's best in the interest of the nation ... and then when they have to go, that is the way of nature. They have to leave, and this is what is democracy,"" he said. The event, carried live on Pakistani state-run TV, showed the new members taking an oath to ""bear true faith"" to Pakistan, among other pledges. The caretaker government will oversee the parliamentary process until national elections, which are to be held no later than January 9. Leading the interim cabinet is newly installed Prime Minister Mohammad Mian Soomro, who previously served as chairman of the Senate, a key post because the Senate chairman is acting president when Musharraf is outside the country. ""We are are creating history because I think never has Pakistan seen such a smooth transition of government,"" Musharraf said after the official ceremony. ""The ex-prime minister is sitting right in front of us. Never has such a smooth transition taken place before."" Musharraf had earlier pledged to include ""people of a neutral band."" A close Musharraf associate, Pakistani Senator Nisar Memon, was sworn in as interim information minister, a post he previously held in Musharraf's government. Abbas Sarfraz and Salman Shah -- both members of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Q party -- were appointed to the interim cabinet and previously served in Musharraf's cabinet. Another member of the ruling party, Dilawar Abbas, was appointed to the interim petroleum minister post. Other former cabinet members under Musharraf, Gen. Hamid Nawaz and Inam ul Haq, were appointed to the interim interior and foreign minister posts, respectively. Asked Wednesday if Musharraf would include members of the opposition in the caretaker government, Musharraf was vague in an interview with The Associated Press but said ""we are looking into names (from opposition parties)."" ""We will make sure that the caretaker government contains people of stature, people of a neutral band, and those that can perform government functions well,"" he added. Thursday marked the end of the term for Pakistan's parliament and provincial assemblies, which are scheduled to dissolve by November 20, according to Musharraf. Elections are to be held 45 to 60 days from that date, and Musharraf has said he would like to see the vote take place before January 9. The exact date will be set by Pakistan's Election Commission. Earlier Friday, police in Lahore lifted the house arrest against opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, allowing the former prime minister to go free for the first time since Tuesday. Bhutto has called on Musharraf to step down and said negotiations between her Pakistan People's Party (PPP) and him have hit a dead end. Her remarks came Tuesday after Pakistani police surrounded the house where she is staying to prevent her from leading a Lahore-to-Islamabad march. Her supporters were also arrested. Bhutto has entered into talks with her successor and rival, former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on forming an alliance against Musharraf. Sharif himself is exiled from Pakistan after Musharraf ousted him in a bloodless coup in 1999. Meanwhile, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte was scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on Friday for weekend meetings with Musharraf and other Pakistani officials. Negroponte will convey to Musharraf how seriously the United States views his imposition of emergency rule and will suggest he rescind it, senior U.S. State Department officials told CNN. Pakistani police Thursday continued to enforce Musharraf's November 3 emergency order by cracking down on opposition rallies and rounding up hundreds of protesters in Karachi alone. One rally there turned deadly Thursday when two youths were killed at a demonstration in support of Bhutto, police sources said. The circumstances are unclear; Bhutto said she heard a report that police killed two of her ""party people."" The deaths are the first to take place during rallies following the emergency order that suspended the country's constitution. Nearly all leaders of Pakistani opposition parties have been jailed or placed under house arrest and charged under anti-terrorism measures. Bhutto and other opposition leaders accuse Musharraf of imposing the emergency order so he could remain in power by avoiding an expected ruling from the previous Supreme Court that would have nullified his October election victory. Musharraf has since sacked nearly all of the Supreme Court justices and replaced them with his allies. He has said the emergency order was imposed to save Pakistan from governmental paralysis caused by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. He has said it improves stability and will foster peaceful parliamentary elections. E-mail to a friend . CNN's Mohsin Naqvi contributed to this report. Copyright 2007 CNN.

"(CNN) -- Clint Hurdle had lost his mind. What other explanation made sense, after the man chose the Pittsburgh Pirates when he might have been manager of the New York Mets? The Pirates? That once-proud franchise had just suffered through its 18th straight losing season, a record for professional sports teams in North America and perhaps any other continent. The Pirates were a blight on the ""City of Champions."" Kids were heading off to college with no memory of watching a winning baseball team. If you asked a Pittsburgher to talk Steelers or Penguins, he'd stay all day. Bring up the Pirates, he'd walk away. SI: Sports' perennial losers . The Pirates were the taboo topic, the crazy uncle of the local sporting scene -- and there was zero hope of snapping the streak this season. This team was 57-105 last year. It had one of the worst pitching staffs of the modern era and was bringing back four of the five starting pitchers! The big off season acquisitions in the field were journeymen Lyle Overbay and Matt Diaz. The payroll, as always, was going to be measured in pennies instead of dollars. Yet, on November 15, the day he was introduced to his new city, Hurdle, 53, seemed downright jovial. Either that, or downright delusional. ""We're going to get this done,"" he said. ""This is eventually going to turn. There's no doubt in my mind that it's going to turn. I wanted to get on board because I believe now is the time it's going to start turning."" Flash forward eight months, to Wednesday morning on Pittsburgh's ""Parkway,"" one the main thoroughfares leading to PNC Park. In the midst of a wicked heat spell, fans were honking horns and waving brooms out their car windows -- and not because they wanted to sweep away the remnants of another lost season. Rather, it was because the Pirates -- the 'Bucs' or 'Buccos' in local parlance -- had a chance to sweep the defending National League Central Division champion Cincinnati Reds in a three-game series and solidify their grip on first place. First place? Yes, the Pirates have spent time there this late in a season for the first time since 1997. They own their best late-July record (51-45) since 1992. Their 3-1 loss Wednesday, which pushed them a half-game behind the Milwaukee Brewers, hardly dampened the enthusiasm for this weekend's series against superstar Albert Pujols and the St. Louis Cardinals. It is the most-anticipated series in the history of 10-year-old PNC Park, widely regarded as the most beautiful ballpark in the major leagues. Tickets remain only for Sunday's series finale. If this keeps up -- if the Pirates somehow manage to make the playoffs -- it might well be the sport's most unlikely story since the 1969 New York Mets. The Amazin' Mets hadn't posted a single winning season before winning it all in '69. The Amazin' Bucs, with their $45 million payroll, have won series against the filthy rich Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Phillies and are talking about adding players before Major League Baseball's July 31 trade deadline. They are doing this despite a spate of injuries that took away their top three catchers and their promising third baseman, Pedro Alvarez. No wonder The New York Times and Sports Illustrated have scheduled reporters to cover this weekend's series. They will find all around them evidence of a deadened fan base sprung to life. Neil Walker used to be one of the tortured fans. A Pittsburgh native, he is now the Pirates' second baseman and leads the team with 62 runs batted in. ""What I'm seeing more often is the 20-something fan, young people at the ballpark who want to see us play,"" Walker said. ""A lot of people have said to a lot of us in here, 'Thanks for making us Pirates fans again.' "" For old-time fans, the team's resurgence has rekindled pleasant memories of the World Series titles of 1960, '71 and '79, part of a rich, 125-history in the National League. The franchise has won five World Series in all and have produced iconic players such as Honus Wagner, Roberto Clemente and Willie Stargell. SI: Everyone loves a Cinderella story; this year baseball has two . With attendance up nearly 20% from last season, the Pirates have a chance to attract 2 million fans for the first time since PNC Park opened. Television ratings are up 66% from July of last season and 40% overall -- including three of the top 10-rated games since 1994. The team soon will make its first appearances on national television since 2002. Sports-talk radio 93.7 The Fan is lined with Pirates callers all day. Sports merchandise stores are reporting unfathomable increases in Pirates-related sales. Trey Carlstrom can tell you about that. He is the Chicago-based owner of The Pittsburgh Fan, a sports apparel shop across the street from PNC Park. He has a similar store next to Wrigley Field in Chicago. He is giddy over the 51% rise in Pirates-related sales. ""I wish we could turn Pittsburgh into the kind of atmosphere we have at Wrigley,"" he said. ""It helps if you have a good team, that's for sure."" Hurdle, who managed the Colorado Rockies to the National League pennant in 2007, can't go anywhere without people giving him advice. ""I carry a notebook,"" he says, laughing. Previous managers carried only the pain of constant mockery amid another disastrous season. It's a challenge trying to identify the low point of the 18-year losing streak, which started the year Barry Bonds left for San Francisco as a free agent. There have been so many, including a ticket-price increase after the 100-loss season that christened PNC Park (season-ticket prices have not been raised since) and the giveaway of homegrown third baseman Aramis Ramirez in 2003. But this one might top -- or bottom -- them all: The Pirates flew in Pittsburgh-born actor Michael Keaton to throw out the ceremonial first pitch at their 2006 home opener, only to see him rip ownership at a pregame news conference. ""I fear they will take advantage of the good will of the people who continue to show up,"" Keaton said that day. ""For my money, that's disrespectful. At some point, you either have to write the check or do something and not assume, well, we're OK and ultimately the franchise is valuable anyway, like Donald Sterling did with the Los Angeles Clippers."" The way the Pirates were going, the Clippers should have been insulted at such comparisons. By 2007, newspaper magnate Bob Nutting had replaced Kevin McClatchy as the club's principal owner -- and principle villain. He was viewed as a cheapskate interested only in the bottom line. That perception hasn't disappeared, but Nutting began writing some significant checks shortly after he took control. The Pirates have spent more on the amateur draft than any team in the majors over the past three years and have invested heavily in Latin America, most prominently in the construction of a $5 million training academy in the Dominican Republic. Where once Nutting was ridiculed on the streets, he now is praised. Sometimes. ""I said last year that fans deserved to be angry; I was angry, too,"" Nutting told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. ""There's nothing wrong with that. But I also can say that I believed from the beginning in the steps we were taking to restore championship-caliber baseball to Pittsburgh. Some of those have taken longer. Some are starting to bear fruit. And many of them aren't even here yet."" Meanwhile, general manager Neal Huntington and team president Frank Coonelly engineered a complete overhaul after Nutting hired them late in the 2007 season. ""The Plan,"" as locals call it, hasn't worked out perfectly, but Huntington brought some critical pieces to Pittsburgh, including All-Star closer Joel Hanrahan and starting pitchers Charlie Morton, Kevin Correia, Jeff Karstens and James McDonald. Homegrown players such as center fielder Andrew McCutchen and Walker have begun to blossom. New pitching coach Ray Searage has overseen a dramatic turnaround of the staff, the key component of the team's resurgence. Well, that and the hiring of Hurdle, who has created an atmosphere equal parts intense and relaxed. On one hand, Hurdle has not been afraid to instill discipline, such as when he benched the team's best player, McCutchen, for failing to run out a dropped third strike. On the other, players will tell you Hurdle has made the game fun again. They know they won't be punished for mistakes of aggression, and they know Hurdle's personality will not change from day to day. He will be energized and approachable. Decades in the game -- as a player, coach and manager -- have taught Hurdle that a 162-game season is a marathon, not a sprint. ""The attitude has changed,"" McCutchen said. ""We've been pretty much neutral when it comes to winning and losing. We're not down when we lose, and it's not like we're up that much when we win. We know what we have ahead of us."" If the season's first four months are any indication, the Pirates have ahead of them plenty of pressure-packed, fun-to-watch baseball. Ask a Pittsburgher about that. He'll talk all day.","The Pittsburgh Pirates are fighting for first place in the National League's Central Division .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- The family of one of the men who founded the Palestine Liberation Organization says they have always believed he was assassinated by Israel, and now they have proof. Israel's censor is for the first time allowing a newspaper to publish a 12-year-old interview with the now-dead Israeli agent who claimed he killed Khalil al-Wazir, widely known as Abu Jihad. Abu Jihad helped found the Palestine Liberation Organization, or PLO, alongside the man who became the symbol of the Palestinian struggle, Yasser Arafat. Abu Jihad was killed by gunfire in Tunisia in 1988, in a villa in Tunis. His wife witnessed the assassination. Murder inquiry launched in Arafat's death . The Israeli daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth obtained access to an interview done with operative Nahum Lev, who died in 2000. For 12 years the Lev interview -- done by reporter Ronen Bergman -- was kept from the public. The newspaper initially released a few of Lev's reported quotes, including one in which he said he shot Abu Jihad with no hesitation after reading the file that Israeli intelligence had on him. He said what he read connected the Palestinian leader to horrific acts against civilians. Two bodyguards and a gardener were also shot and killed in the raid in Tunis. The newspaper said Mossad, IsraelÂ¹s famed intelligence agency, oversaw the assassination and Israel's commando unit carried it out. The account by the Israeli operative gives an extremely rare glimpse into the details of an assassination and who was involved. More details of the interview are expected to be released. A family member of Abu Jihad who did not want to be identified told CNN, ""We already knew all the terrible details of his death. Knowing the name of the person who carried it out has no added value."" Abu Jihad was instrumental in the first uprising against the Israeli occupation known as the first Intifada, which began in late 1987. At the time of the assassination, the Israeli prime minister was Yitzhak Shamir. Ehud Barak who is now Israel's defense minister, was Israel's deputy chief of staff. The publication of the interview comes at an interesting time. This month French investigators are expected in Ramallah to look into the death of PLO leader Arafat. Arafat's wife believes he was murdered -- questions were raised about how Arafat died after traces of polonium-210, a highly radioactive element, were found on his personal belongings. Yasser Arafat died in a hospital in Paris, France in 2004.","Abu Jihad was a co-founder of the Palestine Liberation Organization .

"(CNN) -- A father and son in south Texas were charged Thursday with shooting an agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, federal authorities said. Pedro Alvarado, 41, and Arnoldo Alvarado, 18, are accused of assault on a federal officer and using a firearm during a crime of violence. ICE agent Kelton Harrison was shot Tuesday morning near Hargill, Texas, while he and other agents were conducting surveillance relating to an anticipated narcotics deal. According to a criminal complaint, Harrison was in a parked car when gunshots allegedly were fired from an approaching vehicle. Harrison started driving away and the other car followed and the occupants continued firing at Harrison's vehicle. The court document said Harrison finally lost control of his car and when other agents arrived on the scene they discovered he'd been shot in back. Harrison survived the shooting but underwent an operation and is still hospitalized. A search was conducted of a home in Hargill where the two Alvarados were found along with an unidentified minor. According to the court document, the younger Alvarado admitted that he and the minor fired shots at the agent's car while his father drove their vehicle. Pedro and Arnold Alvarado were arrested and had a court hearing before a magistrate judge Thursday and will remain in jail pending a detention hearing next week. The men requested the judge appoint counsel to represent them. A Justice Department press release said the minor involved in the case was turned over to state authorities. ""We are encouraged by this action to bring these criminals to justice,"" said ICE Director John Morton. ""We continue to keep the agent and his family in our prayers during his road to recovery.""","ICE agent Kelton Harrison was shot Tuesday morning near Hargill, Texas .

"(CNN) -- My heart aches for the children, parents and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School. Like them, I know what it means to have life turned on its head by unprecedented violence. On the morning of April 20, 1999, two senior students walked into Columbine High School and began a shooting spree. Someone pulled the fire alarm and I was able to escape my trigonometry classroom. While I didn't suffer any injury, people I knew and admired were killed. That awful day left a permanent scar on our community in Littleton, Colorado. But the Columbine shooting did not define us. We are defined by the acts of goodness that followed. People in our community bonded and helped each other get through the tragedy. Hundreds of comfort quilts were sewed and handed out to those who were trying to recover from the anguish and pain. Restaurants provided free meals in the days after the shooting. Strangers offered hugs to each other at the Clement Park Memorial for support. No one ever should experience a Columbine moment. No one wants to feel assaulted, offended or hurt by an inexplicable event. But sometimes, those things happen. The way we respond to those moments is crucial in how we build and rebuild our relationships, and more importantly, how we rebuild our lives. There are two ways we can respond to a traumatic experience -- as a victim or a survivor. Early on, I pitifully used Columbine to justify personal failures and shortcomings. Eventually, I realized that I owned the way I reacted to situations and how I engaged with those around me. More than a decade later, I still think about Columbine. I do not dwell on the grotesque details of the day. In quiet meditation, I think of the lives that were taken and the lessons that help me move forward. I appreciate the subtle and profound consequences that our thoughts and actions can have on others. I became slower to anger and quicker to love. The inconsiderate driver or long line at the post office doesn't spoil my day anymore. I share my story to offer hope to those impacted by violence -- those who wonder whether they'll be able to regain the life they once knew. The answer is no. Life won't be the same. But one can, over time, find happiness. When you are able to come out of a tragedy you'll be stronger with a greater capacity to love, more determination to serve others and desire to mend broken family ties. And you'll feel joy that comes from these actions. To those who are wading through a mountain of pain and sorrow right now, please know that it will be OK. Take time to grieve your loss. Talk through your feelings, even if it's no more than ramblings. Live your life in a way that honors the memory of the precious lives that were taken. Push out the anger and fill your mind with a positive outlook. I promise this approach will bring more peace and joy. There may be some people who are angry at God. I was not. In Columbine's aftermath, my faith was an essential part of my healing process. There's a scripture passage that I take comfort in: . Ye cannot behold with your natural eyes, the design of your God concerning those things which shall follow after much tribulation. For after much tribulation come the blessings. I believe in God and trust that He has a plan for our lives. His added measure of strength always comes at the moment when we've exhausted our best effort. When tragedies like Columbine or Sandy Hook happen, we are reminded of the fragility and precious nature of life. This gives rise to the question, what will you do with the time you have? Choose faith, choose charity, choose hope. Then, life will be livable again. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Liz Carlston.","Liz Carlston: My heart aches for the children and parents at Sandy Hook .

"(EW.com) -- Justin Timberlake hasn't released an album since 2006â€²s ""FutureSex/LoveSounds,"" mostly because he has been distracted by the business of being Justin Timberlake. That tends to fill one's day with acting in Oscar-winning films, dropping into the occasional SNL sketch, hosting a golf tournament, sometimes going to the Marine Corps Ball and being engaged to Jessica Biel. It's a busy life, which is why our eyebrows raised when we saw these quotes from a producer named Jim Beanz, who claims to be working with Timberlake on a series of songs for a ""crazy"" new album. Considering JT's stature and the types of people he has worked with in the past, why would he hook up with a dude nobody has ever heard of? It turns out... he wouldn't. According to Timberlake's publicist, there are currently no plans for a new album, though JT is working with Timbaland on tracks for ""Shock Value 3"" (he appeared on each of the first two installments of the series). But as for other music, ""That's it,"" said the spokesperson. That makes a lot more sense for Timberlake, who's now pretty much entirely focused on acting. In fact, he's currently in Puerto Rico with Ben Affleck filming the movie ""Runner Runner,"" which would certainly get in the way of his being in the studio. So while the idea of a new JT album is titillating (especially for those of us still obsessed with ""FutureSex""), it will have to remain a fantasy for now. But it does bring up a good question: What other musicians have walked away on top the way Timberlake did? While he hasn't been completely invisible (he has dropped in on tracks for Madonna, T.I., Jamie Foxx, Timbaland and Esmee Denters, among others, since the release of ""FutureSex/LoveSounds""), he has pretty much put the idea of an album on the back burner â€” though he may be dipping his toe into the world of film scores.

"(CNN) -- Violent protests have rocked the Egyptian capital, Cairo, in recent weeks following President Mohamed Morsy's decision to expand his presidential powers last month. The president and his supporters from the powerful Muslim Brotherhood and Islamist factions have argued that the move was essential to protect the country's recent revolution. However anti-government protesters viewed the move as a power grab, and have clogged the city's streets fighting pitched battles with pro-government demonstrators ahead of the country's vote on its new constitution on December 15.

"Sake, Democratic Republic of Congo (CNN) -- Anti-government rebels on Friday continued their march through the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, withstanding an army counterattack to maintain control of the strategically important town of Sake. The town is on the road to Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, and a group of fighters started to march in its direction, journalist Phil Moore told CNN. Moore and U.N. spokesman Kieran Dwyer said the M23 fighters held Sake after two days of battling government troops in the town they first entered Wednesday. The United Nations, which supports the Congolese army, as well as Britain have condemned the rebel campaign intended to overthrow the government. Read more: Rebel leader in Uganda for Congo crisis talks . On Friday, the Congolese army was near the town of Minova, about 15 miles south of Sake, according to Moore. Residents fled ahead of M23's progress, Moore said, and a second group of M23 fighters was heading north to the town of Masisi. The fighting continued despite a joint statement Wednesday from the leaders of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda that called for M23 to halt its rebellion and enter talks with the Kinshasa government. Read more: Rebels threaten wider Democratic Republic of Congo conflict . ""The M23 rebel group must immediately stop its offensive and pull out of Goma,"" the statement said, adding that the Congo government committed itself to addressing rebel complaints. The latest unrest continues a cycle of violence and misery in Eastern Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. The political leader of M23, Jean-Marie Runiga Lugerero, flew Thursday to the Ugandan capital of Kampala for talks with President Yoweri Museveni, who is hosting a conference of regional leaders Saturday aimed at ending the crisis in Congo. Dwyer said the Kampala summit, which also will include Congo President Joseph Kabila and Rwandan President Paul Kagame, would be scrutinized for any political impetus to stop the violence on the ground. ""There does need to be political solutions to this,"" he said. ""I don't think battlefield solutions are going to be the answer in and of themselves."" The United Nations and some donor countries have accused neighboring Rwanda of backing the M23 by providing it with arms, support and even soldiers. Kagame has repeatedly denied the allegation. On Tuesday, the rebels gained control of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, though U.N. forces continued to control the airport. At a rally at Goma's stadium, an M23 officer declared the group's military goals. ""We will push on to Bukavu, then Kisangani, and finally take Kinshasa and overthrow the government,"" Lt. Col. Vianney Kazarama said to enthusiastic cheers from a crowd of several hundred, according to a Congolese reporter there. Read more: Can we end rape as tool of war? Mark Simmonds, the UK minister for Africa, arrived in Kigali, Rwanda, on Thursday and immediately issued a statement saying ""there can be no attempt to unseat the legitimate government of the Democratic Republic of Congo."" He called on the Congolese government to ""address the underlying causes of the conflict."" ""I call on the M23 to stop its advance and to withdraw from Goma immediately,"" Simmonds said. Oxfam, which is monitoring humanitarian conditions in the area, warned Thursday that the fall of Goma to the rebels poses ""a very real risk of complete collapse of state authority and the humanitarian crisis reaching new depths."" It estimated that 120,000 people were in urgent need of help, with many sleeping in the open or in schools and other buildings without humanitarian aid. Tens of thousands of Congolese, already displaced by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region, have fled camps around the edges of Goma, according to UNICEF and the medical charity Doctors Without Borders.

"Washington (CNN) -- The nation's capital was blanketed by downed trees and power lines Saturday after a killer storm with furious winds whipped through. Bruised and battered, the District of Columbia was reeling from damage as skies cleared and the temperature began to soar again. A man died in the city, electrocuted by a downed power line, police said. His wife was in critical condition. In neighboring Virginia and Maryland, seven people were killed by fallen trees, authorities said. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell declared a state of emergency Saturday morning. Traffic flowed through major arteries, but smaller roads were a different story. Trees were down in every ward, said D.C. City Administrator Allen Lew. In 19 intersections, the traffic lights were knocked out. Saturday afternoon, more than 67,000 Washington residents still had no power. Another 1 million were in the dark in Virginia. In hard-hit Fairfax County, nearly half of all residents had no electricity. That meant no fans. No air-conditioning. No refrigerators. Authorities encouraged people without power to head to public recreation facilities or libraries to stay cool. But some of Washington's libraries were without power, too, Lew said. McDonnell said 911 emergency systems experienced problems statewide, with entire grids down in Fairfax County and Prince William County. Officials are urging residents to contact their local police and fire departments if in need of help. Much of the problem was due to the trees -- some old and huge -- that snapped in winds gusting at 80 miles per hour. Pepco requested 1,000 crews from around the nation, but it could take them a few days to arrive, said Joseph Rigby, president of the energy company. So far, he said, he has secured 200 crews. But even with the manpower, Rigby urged patience. More erratic weather could hamper recovery speed. There was a possibility of a new line of thunderstorms Saturday night, the National Weather Service said. And then, there was the heat. The Washington area hit 104 degrees on Friday, topping a record of 101 reported in 1934, the weather service said. And it was blistering again Saturday with the heat index topping 100 degrees. The power outages were so great in Fairfax County that officials gave up on the idea of cooling centers. Go to malls, they told people, or other public places that were air-conditioned. In Maryland, the state's emergency management agency reported the opening of cooling centers in Montgomery and Hartford counties. Pepco's Rigby said some areas in and around the capital could be without power for a week. That meant a lot of people will again have trouble sleeping at night. 3 states declare emergencies as heat, deadly storms bring misery to millions .","8 people are killed in the Washington area .

"London (CNN) -- Britain's celebrated landscape is set to be changed forever as an incurable disease threatens the existence of one of its most familiar trees. But a group of environmentalists have come up with a high-tech solution to try to tackle the crisis in the countryside. The detection of ash dieback disease, believed to have most likely been transmitted via fungal spores carried on the wind from continental Europe, has prompted environmental authorities to warn it will not be possible to eradicate the disease from Britain's ""green and pleasant land."" Experts fear vast numbers of Britain's 80 million ash trees, the country's fourth most abundant tree specimen, will be lost from its parks and forests. In a sign of how seriously the British government is taking the presence of the disease, Chalara fraxinea, it has held meetings of the government's crisis committee COBRA -- more commonly convened for national security emergencies -- in response. There is no cure or vaccination for ash dieback, although some specimens are exhibiting some resistance to the disease. When ash dieback hit Denmark, 90% of its ash trees were affected. Efforts to respond to the disease are focused on tracking and containing its spread, resulting in the destruction of more than 100,000 infected trees to date. To that end, a group of environmentalists has devised its own solution to help the public help authorities track the spread of the disease. ""AshTag"" is an app which allows members of the public to report likely sightings of the disease to authorities, along with precise location coordinates, using their smartphones. Members of the public can photograph the tree in question and log the report with the service, and the details will be sent to the Forestry Commission to investigate. Sightings will be plotted on a map, using different colored pins denoting whether the specimen is unchecked, uncertain or likely. ""We made it in a weekend -- a lot of late nights, a lot of coffee,"" said Toby Hammond of the University of East Anglia's Adapt Group, which is behind the initiative. ""It's a huge task to map this disease -- if you were to do it thoroughly, you'd have to look at every ash tree in the UK,"" he said. A much more effective approach, he says, is to use ""crowd sourcing... by getting involved all the people who are out walking their dogs or may have an ash tree in their garden that they are concerned about."" The response has been strong. The app has been downloaded almost 10,000 times in a week, resulting in more than 500 possible sightings being uploaded. People without smartphones can still use the service using their computers. Infected ash trees develop lesions on their bark, and dieback and browning of their leaves, which can be harder to spot during autumn months. The app allows for smarter use of resources by allowing staff to filter out unlikely sightings and direct the attention of authorities to the most likely cases to investigate. Sadly, it has not been able to provide any relief for people like Robert Crowder, whose family business, Crowders Nurseries, has run since 1798, and who estimates the company's losses to ash dieback to be worth about $320,000. His nursery was recently ordered to burn 50,000 ash saplings -- a loss Crowder believes could have been avoided had the government acted sooner to try to prevent the spread of the disease when it appeared in Western Europe. ""We had seen evidence of the disease in nurseries in Denmark, Germany and Holland and we told the government in 2009 and they chose to do nothing about it,"" he said. ""We have now had a financial loss as a result of their indecision."" Britain's ecosystems have suffered from serious tree diseases in the past, with as many as 30 million elms lost to Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. Jim C. Smith, an urban forestry adviser for the Forestry Commission, said ash dieback was ""at least as serious"" as Dutch elm, ""but we don't know how it will actually spread in the country."" It is hoped that Ashtag can play a role in preventing the spread of ash dieback -- and potentially any of the nearly 20 tree diseases in the UK -- to those proportions.","Ash dieback, an incurable tree disease, has been detected in the UK .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Justice Department and Portland, Oregon, have reached an agreement for the reform and monitoring of the city's police department after an investigation determined that police often used excessive force, including Tasers, on the mentally ill in situations involving low-level offenses. The Justice Department said Monday the two sides filed a proposed agreement in federal court that would be court supervised if approved. The plan calls for changes in the Portland Police Bureau's training, policies and supervision. The agreement also provides for an independent compliance officer and community liaison who would examine data about the department's use of force and report to the Justice Department, the city council and the public. The public also would be able to give feedback on whether the police are meeting the provisions of the agreement. The proposed agreement was filed on the same day the Justice Department filed a civil suit under the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, charging there were violations of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which guards against unreasonable searches and seizures. According to the suit, the Portland Police Bureau ""engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force on individuals with actual or perceived mental illness in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and other laws of the United States."" If the agreement on court-monitored reforms is approved, the Justice Department and the city of Portland would ask that the suit be dismissed. According to court documents, Portland police authorities disagreed with the findings of excessive force but were willing to enter into the agreement with the Justice Department ""out of a mutual desire to protect the constitutional rights of all members of the Portland community, to continuously improve the safety and security of the people of Portland, to keep (Portland Police Bureau) employees safe, and to increase public confidence in PPB, all in a cost-effective, timely, and collaborative manner."" The Justice Department began its investigation into whether Portland's police engaged in a pattern of using excessive force in June 2011. ""I am confident that the reforms mandated by this agreement will result in a Portland Police Bureau that provides police services in a constitutional manner and that better protects the community,"" said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division.","Justice Department, Portland police agree on reform, monitoring .

"(CNN) -- A South Carolina high school student was arrested Monday morning after school employees found a revolver, knives, axes and dozens of rounds of ammunition in his car, police said. Investigators have no reason to think that the 17-year-old junior at Easley High School planned to attack anyone, Easley police Maj. Tim Tollison said. But the student was charged with possession of a firearm on school property. ""He told school officials he uses the stuff for hunting, and he just forgot to take it out of the car,"" Tollison said. The teen was released on $30,000 bail Tuesday morning, Tollison said. The junior was arrested after a concerned student told school workers that someone had weapons in a vehicle outside the school of roughly 1,600 students, police said. In the vehicle were a loaded .22-caliber revolver, nine knives, two axes, a stun gun, handcuffs, and more than 200 rounds of ammunition, according to police, who said they believe the weapons belonged to the student's family. No guns matching the ammunition -- shotgun shells and rifle and handgun rounds -- were in the vehicle, Tollison said. The Pickens County school district released a statement saying it appears ""that the gun and ammunition (were) left in the car after being used for hunting ... and were not taken to the school with the intent to harm anyone."" ""However, bringing weapons on school grounds violates state law, and the school district has a zero-tolerance policy towards weapons on school grounds,"" the district said. ""The timing of this incident is extremely unfortunate, but there is no indication that there was ever an intended threat to the school."" District spokesman John Eby said it's not clear what the handcuffs and stun gun were for, but he said officials don't believe they were for an attack on the school. The incident came three days after a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, claimed the lives of 20 children and six adults. In addition, the gunman killed his mother and himself. In accordance with district policy, the arrested student will be recommended for expulsion for at least a year, the district said. CNN's John Fricke and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.","Easley High School junior, 17, charged with possession of firearm on school property .

"(CNN) -- A bright red casket with butterflies on it was center stage in a packed Los Angeles auditorium Wednesday as thousands of mourners bid farewell to Mexican-American singer Jenni Rivera. Brassy music rang out in the Gibson Amphitheatre, which holds 6,100 people. Photos showing Rivera with her family flashed in the background. Fans chanted her name, waving white roses in the air. ""Jenni made it OK for women to be who they are,"" longtime manager Pete Salgado said, choking back tears and drawing cheers from the crowd. ""Jenni also made it OK to be from nothing with the hopes of being something."" Rivera, whose soulful ballads sold out concert halls and made her a household name to many, died in a plane crash in a remote, mountainous area in northern Mexico on December 9. The crash killed everyone aboard the small plane, including Rivera's publicist, lawyer and makeup artists. Read more: Rivera crash puts spotlight on charter jet safety . Family members called Wednesday's ceremony a ""graduation to heaven,"" saying the singer's powerful spirit would live on and urging fans to keep her memory alive. ""I am sure that my sister is singing now,"" said Juan Manuel Rivera, one of her brothers. Another family member, Gustavo Lawrence Rivera, asked crowds to applaud for ""Jenni, the eternal diva."" Nicknamed ""La Diva de la Banda"" or The Diva of Banda Music, Rivera was a musical powerhouse with her Spanish-language performances of regional Mexican corridos, or ballads. Rivera sold 15 million records, according to Billboard, and recently won two Billboard Music Awards, including favorite Mexican music female artist. She was reportedly on the verge of a crossover with an English-language sitcom inspired by the success of ""I Love Jenni,"" a Spanish-language reality TV show on Telemundo's mun2 network. 'Perfectly imperfect' The singer was also known for her tumultuous personal life -- something her friends and family acknowledged in Wednesday's ceremony. Both Salgado and one of Rivera's daughters described her as ""perfectly imperfect."" Pepe Garza, the singer's godfather, said her honesty and openness made friends and fans adore her. ""Above all we love her for her imperfections,"" he said. ""It was her blunders that made us know that she was one of us."" Born in Long Beach, California, to Mexican immigrant parents, Rivera released her debut album in 1999, according to her website. She followed that up with two more albums, including the 2003 album ""Farewell to Selena"" -- a tribute to slain Tejano star Selena Quintanilla -- that increased her popularity. She was nominated for Latin Grammy Awards in 2002, 2008 and 2011. In October, People en EspaÃ±ol named her to its list of the 25 most powerful women. Rivera became a single mom at the age of 15 and was the mother of five children, all of whom spoke at Wednesday's memorial. In 2009, Rivera made headlines when she was detained at the Mexico City airport with tens of thousands of dollars in cash. A year later, she made headlines again with the marriage to former baseball pitcher Esteban Loaiza, who played for the New York Yankees and the Los Angeles Dodgers. They later divorced. It was her third marriage. Her over-the-top lifestyle was chronicled in ""I Love Jenni"" on Telemundo. The show began airing on mun2 last year, and featured her life on the road, balancing the duties of motherhood and stardom as she toured Mexico and the United States. ""My mom would fight any battle for us and for her honor, even if there was no one to fight,"" her son, Trinidad ""Michael"" Angel Rivera recalled Wednesday. ""Sometimes it seemed like she was just waking up to fight the day, to prove that in those 24 hours, she could make 35 hours worth of work."" He asked audience members for 27 seconds of silence in honor of the victims of last week's shooting rampage in Connecticut. ""I know my mother would have been heartbroken to hear about something like that,"" he said. ""Because even though for me, it was a tragedy to lose my mother at 27 years old, there were mothers who lost their children before they got the chance to find out who they were going to be, whether they were going to be singers or doctors. ... They didn't have a chance to live."" Read more: America missed out on getting to know Jenni Rivera . Plane company investigation . Rivera performed at a concert in Monterrey on December 8 before boarding the Learjet early the next day. It lost contact with air traffic controllers about 60 miles into the trip. The small plane was 43 years old, the state-run Notimex news agency reported, citing the Mexican director of civil aviation. The Drug Enforcement Administration is investigating the company that owned the plane. Court records showed that the aviation company, Starwood Management, had two planes seized this year. The DEA declined to give further details, citing an ongoing investigation. But it confirmed that the company was in a dispute with insurance firms over accusations of of falsehoods. Starwood and its representatives have not responded to repeated CNN requests for comments. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board said it is helping with the investigation. U.S. records show the airplane was substantially damaged in 2005 when it struck a runway marker near Amarillo, Texas. At the time, the plane's pilot reported losing the ability to steer while landing the plane. As the investigation into what caused the crash continues, family members said Wednesday that they were grateful to fans for their support and were committed to honoring Rivera's legacy. ""The best thing you ever taught me is when you fall, you get back up,"" daughter Jacqie Melina Campos said. ""So that's what I'm going to do."" As the ceremony drew to a close, confetti fell onto the stage, and family members and fans covered Rivera's casket with white roses.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- City workers in Southern California discovered a backpack Monday filled with grenades and other explosive devices, a sheriff's spokesman said. The municipal employees came across the backpack in a storm drain in Placentia around 9 a.m., Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman Jim Amormino told CNN. Police and bomb squad personnel subsequently responded and located six grenades, blasting caps, fuse igniters and some white and black powder, according to Amormino. These were discovered in the backpack as well as buried in dirt nearby. It appears the explosive devices were put in the area intentionally, according to the sheriff's department spokesman, who added that he believes they had been there for some time. FBI agents were on scene Monday afternoon helping sheriff's department members in their investigation, as is routine when explosive or suspicious items are found, said Ari Dekofsky, a spokeswoman for the bureau's Los Angeles office. There was no immediate threat to the public's safety, added Dekofsky. By 2:45 p.m., all the explosive devices had been safely detonated, said Amormino. Placentia is a city of about 50,000 people located just north of Anaheim and 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.","City workers in Placentia found the backpack in a storm drain, a sheriff's spokesman says .

"(Rolling Stone) -- With 2012 halfway done, Adele's 21 and Gotye's ""Somebody That I Used to Know"" (featuring Kimbra) are the biggest selling album and digital song of the year in the U.S. respectively, Billboard reports. ""21"" has continued its amazing run a year after its initial release, selling 3.69 million copies through the sales week that ended July 1, the mid-year point for tracker Nielsen SoundScan. It was the best selling album halfway through last year as well, with 2.5 million copies sold. This is the first time in SoundScan's 21-year history that the same record has been the top seller in the first halves of any two years. If ""21"" continues to fly off the shelves at this rate, it could be the first record in the SoundScan era to top the year-end charts twice. ""21's"" midway-point sales figures also mark another first in the SoundScan era -- it's the first time just one album has sold over a millioncopies in the year's first six months. The runner-up, Lionel Richie's ""Tuskegee,"" has moved 912,000 copies. To cap it all off, Adele's 2008 record, ""19,"" finds itself as the tenth-highest selling record so far this year with 539,000 sold, making her the first artist to have two albums in the top 10 since Justin Bieber scored a pair halfway through 2010 with ""My World 2.0"" at No. 2 and ""My World"" at No. 9. As for Gotye's ubiquitous ""Somebody That I Used to Know,"" that track has a digital sales figure of 5.50 million for the year to date, according to SoundScan. Odds are looking good that the track will become the first to sell six million downloads in a year. ""Somebody"" also marks the first time a song has sold over 5 million in the first half of a year, though Gotye's smash wasn't alone in that feat, joined by Fun.'s ""We Are Young"" (featuring Janelle Monae), which has sold 5.09 million. A quick rundown of the top selling albums this year finds breakout British boy band One Direction's ""Up All Night"" sitting at third with 889,000 copies sold.

"Washington (CNN) -- After three Canadian employees were exposed to yellowcake uranium last month when a lid blew off a pressurized 55-gallon drum, a uranium mining company has informed U.S. nuclear regulatory officials it has found additional drums possibly susceptible to the same problem, CNN has learned. Canadian-based Uranium One sent a letter Monday to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission after the NRC demanded the company take action after the June 23 incident. The NRC and Canadian nuclear officials are investigating drums shipped from a Willow Creek, Wyoming, mining facility operated by Uranium One to an Ontario processing plant where workers opened them, including the one that ejected the powder. The three employees were overcome by a cloud of yellowcake uranium that had unexpectedly become pressurized. The worker closest to the drum and two others in the area, who were not wearing respirators, were exposed to airborne uranium, according to the NRC. ""Any adverse health effects to the workers would likely be caused by chemical, rather than radiological effects,"" the NRC said in a letter to Uranium One. Yellowcake is the byproduct of uranium ore that is mined, crushed and milled until concentrated. It is a key component in manufacturing uranium fuel for nuclear reactors. NRC officials gave Uranium One until this week to identify whether any other drums had become pressurized during manufacture or shipment. A letter from Uranium One's president, Donna Wichers, to the NRC, and obtained by CNN, said the company had inspected all remaining drums and found nine that needed to have holes drilled in them to release pressurization. Wichers said six drums appeared to show ""very minor"" pressurization and have been isolated for further investigation. ""It should be noted that Uranium One personnel inspected all drums prior to shipment ... and no drums were observed to exhibit any obvious signs of pressurization,"" Wichers said. Other drums shipped to the Canadian facility containing yellowcake were found to be bulging from internal pressure, the NRC said. Yellowcake uranium can be highly toxic but does not contain significant radiation, according to the World Nuclear Association. It is transported from mines to conversion plants in drums within normal shipping containers, and the World Nuclear Association said no radiation protection is required to prevent exposure. The Canadian uranium processor has stopped opening containers of yellowcake from Uranium One's Wyoming facility until officials have determined they are safe. The NRC said that Uranium One has suspended all shipping from its Willow Creek facility until it determines how the drums became pressurized.","Three Canadian workers are exposed to yellowcake when drum lid blows off .

"(CNN) -- An Iranian citizen and an airline pilot from Kentucky pleaded guilty to violating U.S. export law on Monday through a scheme to send aircraft and parts to Iran for civilian use. Hamid Asefi, an Iranian citizen, and Behzad ""Tony"" Karimian, a U.S. citizen who also has an Iranian passport, each face up to 40 years in prison and a $500,000 fine when sentenced in March. Asefi, 68, was identified in court documents as the principal officer of Aster Corp Ltd, which is described as an Iranian company that also had an office in Britain. Karimian, 53, was identified as a pilot for Mesaba Airlines, a regional carrier. The two were arrested in June. An August indictment was unsealed on Monday just before they entered guilty pleas in federal court in Louisville. According to the two-count indictment, the men conspired to and also actually violated U.S. law by exporting aircraft or parts to Iran. Prosecutors said Asefi used his company's office in Britain as a point to get goods from the United States and ship them through third parties. The indictment said Asefi sent requests to Karimian to buy aircraft and parts in the United States. Karimian placed orders and helped make purchases on behalf on Asefi and people in Iran. Court documents said Asefi and Karamian violated the Iranian ban by arranging sales of Bell Helicopters and aircraft engines produced by General Electric from September 2009 through April 2010. Prosecutors said the helicopters and engines were intended for civilian use. Prosecutors said Asefi and Karimian were well aware they were violating an embargo on sales to Iran. The indictment quotes a 2007 e-mail Asefi sent to Karimian about working together. The e-mail said in part ""... remember that, only US Embargo has brought this chance and benefit to us, to get involved in these deals ...""","Iranian citizen and a pilot for U.S. airline plead guilty in Kentucky .

The $220 million web-slinging flick, which Sony expects will earn between $110 and $120 million over its first six days, has already taken in $50.2 million overseas, and it seems to be off to a healthy start domestically. ""We had a fantastic start,"" says a rep for the studio. Comparisons are somewhat difficult given ""The Amazing Spider-Man's"" unconventional Tuesday release â€” ""Spider-Man 3"" earned $7.5 million during its Friday midnight debut on the way to a $151 million opening weekend, although that film was not presented in price-jacking 3-D/IMAX, and midnight screenings were less popular five years ago than they are today. Another film from five years ago that opened on a Tuesday, ""Transformers,"" earned $8.8 million on Monday night sneaks and took in $155.4 million through Sunday night.

"New York (CNN) -- A New York City man and woman have been arrested in Manhattan, accused of possession of an explosive substance and a sawed off shotgun, authorities say. The pair also had a document that appears to be titled ""The Terrorist Encyclopedia,"" according to court documents. Aaron Greene, 31, and Morgan Gliedman, 27, are charged with felony possession of an explosive with intent to use, and felony criminal possession of a weapon, the district attorney's office said. Shortly after her arrest, Gliedman went into labor and gave birth to a daughter, whom she named Melody, according to Deputy Commissioner Paul Browne. Police say officers discovered the explosive substance at the couple's Greenwich Village apartment while serving a warrant related to four counts of felony grand larceny against Gliedman involving credit card theft in February. In addition to a plastic container found in the living room containing ""a white powdery substance,"" officers also found the sawed-off shotgun and multiple rounds of ammunition, police said. There also were numerous written items containing instructions on making explosive materials and bombs, police said, including the collection of pages that had a cover page saying ""the terrorist encyclopedia."" Fearing the substance to be an explosive material, police evacuated several buildings in the area Saturday morning. Sgt. Michael DeMarfio of the New York Police Department Bomb Squad later tested the powdery substance and confirmed that it was 7 grams of hexamethylene triperoxide diamine, or HMTD, which, according to court documents, is a highly explosive substance used in bombs. According to her Facebook account, Gliedman has an impressive educational pedigree. She claims to have attended The Dalton School, an Upper East Side Manhattan private prep school; the Gallatin School of Individualized Study at New York University; and the School of The Art Institute of Chicago, where she earned a master's degree in creative writing. Police said Greene has had four prior run-ins with law enforcement, including a 2005 assault case for which he was sentenced to a year in jail and an arrest in February for alleged possession of a rifle, heroin, marijuana, prescription drugs and drug paraphernalia. On the latter occasion, Gliedman also was arrested and charged, police said. According to the district attorney's office, Greene was arraigned Sunday afternoon and has a Friday court date. Gliedman is awaiting arraignment. Greene's attorney, Lisa Pelosi, declined to comment Monday morning.","NEW: After her arrest, Gliedman gives birth to a daughter, a police official says .

"(Rolling Stone) -- ""All Is By My Side"" -- the Jimi Hendrix biopic currently being shot in Ireland, starring Outkast's Andre Benjamin (a.k.a. Andre 3000) -- will feature new recordings of Benjamin covering the Beatles, Muddy Waters and more, producers tell Rolling Stone. The film will not, however, include any songs written by Hendrix, the rights to which are controlled by the late guitarist's estate. Last month, Experience Hendrix LLC, which oversees the Hendrix estate, issued a statement regarding the movie, which has been in production for four months. The company, which is run by Hendrix's sister Janie, said that it ""has made it known many times in the past that no such film, were it to include original music or copyrights created by Jimi Hendrix, can be undertaken without its full participation."" Instead, the film -- set in London in 1966 and 1967 -- will include Benjamin's new versions of covers that Hendrix performed during those years, shortly before the release of his landmark debut, ""Are You Experienced."" Audiences will see Benjamin singing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"" (which Hendrix famously performed in a London club with members of the Beatles in the audience), ""Wild Thing,"" ""Hound Dog,"" Muddy Waters' ""Mannish Boy"" and Elmore James' ""Bleeding Heart,"" plus two songs, ""Future Trip"" and ""Driving South,"" that Hendrix played as a backup musician for Curtis Knight and the Squires. The remakes were cut in Los Angeles by a session-legend power trio including Waddy Wachtel (who's played guitar for Keith Richards, Stevie Nicks and Linda Ronstadt), Leland Sklar (bassist for James Taylor, Jackson Browne and Phil Collins), and Kenny Aronoff (former John Mellencamp drummer). Danny Bramson, a longtime music supervisor who won a Grammy for his work on the ""Almost Famous"" soundtrack, oversaw the music. ""All Is By My Side"" is currently shooting in Dublin, Ireland, where co-producer Sean McKittrick says it was ""easier...to recreate 1967 London."" Principal photography is expected to wrap this week, and producers then hope to take the film to Sundance in early 2013 for possible release next year. A soundtrack album featuring the Benjamin-sung covers is also in discussion. ""Andre has been Jimi for four months now,"" McKittrick says. ""He speaks and walks like Jimi. He dropped a ton of weight. The transformation has been amazing."" If the movie were to include songs Hendrix wrote, like ""Purple Haze"" or ""The Wind Cries Mary,"" the producers would have needed permission from Experience Hendrix, which owns the copyrights to the material. But according to McKittrick, the film was always set in Hendrix' pre-fame era, so neither he or his team ever approached the Hendrix estate. ""This is the story of Jimi being discovered as a backup musician and how he went to London and became Jimi Hendrix,"" says the producer. McKittrick says that focusing on early stories about Hendrix -- like the times he jammed with Cream and met Eric Clapton -- is preferable to a biopic about Hendrix's full life story. ""That would be like making a movie about Kurt Cobain,"" he says. ""We all know how that story ends."" A spokesperson for Experience Hendrix tells Rolling Stone that the company had no idea the movie would include non-Hendrix songs. ""They want to make a Jimi Hendrix movie without Jimi Hendrix music,"" says the estate representative. ""It would be like making a movie about Lincoln without being able to use the Gettysburg Address."" Music industry sources confirm that the filmmakers are legally in the clear as long as licenses are in place for the non-Hendrix songs. ""They're absolutely in the right as long as they got the licenses for those songs,"" says Conrad Rippy, a music business lawyer who represents the estates of Elliott Smith and Jeff Buckley. ""They don't need to get the approval of the Hendrix estate for that."" See the full story at RollingStone.com.

""It's pushed back because too many people are releasing those weeks, and we don't want to step on their release dates,"" said Tyler. ""So we said, 'You know what, we got the goods -- ain't no doubt about [it]. We'll wait a couple months.'"" ""Music From Another Dimension"" will be the band's first LP since 2001's ""Just Push Play."" The group debuted the record's first single, ""Legendary Child,"" during the season finale of ""American Idol"" last month, but the song has failed to gain traction on both the Billboard and iTunes charts. Tyler also mentioned on-air that Sony will release two more singles before the album drops in November. One of those tracks could be the blues-tinged rocker ""Oh Yeah,"" which the band debuted last week at the Minneapolis kick-off of their Global Warming tour, which finds them trekking across North America alongside Cheap Trick throughout the summer. ""We accomplished what we set out to do, which was write some stuff so we could represent who we were in the old days,"" Tyler told WMMS.

"(CNN) -- When District Attorney Carol Chambers last tweeted about a shooting in Aurora, it was about a man found guilty of a killing at a liquor store. Chambers touted the success of her office in convicting Anthony Jahmar Gillespie for shooting to death Benigno Morales-Ramirez. Few outside Colorado probably knew Chambers' name then -- her Twitter account only has 62 followers. But that was a month before the cinema killings. Before James Holmes, the man with orange hair who called himself ""The Joker,"" was arrested for spraying a movie theater audience with gunfire during an early morning screening of the new Batman movie. He stands accused of killing 12 people and wounding 38 others. Official: Package at university mail room apparently sent by Colorado suspect . Now Chambers finds herself handling America's next big case, all eyes upon her to deliver justice. She appeared in a dark pantsuit before a horde of reporters and clicking cameras on Monday, the day Holmes first appeared in court. Some who know her believe this case presents the moment she has long awaited. She's a veteran prosecutor who has rarely drawn attention beyond the local limelight. This could be her last hurrah as head of the 18th Judicial District -- term limits on her office force her to step down later this year. She's known for being tough. She's known even more for not caring how she or her actions are reflected in public. She told The Denver Post once that she was ""not motivated by people to like me."" Rick Kornfeld, a defense lawyer in Denver who has known Chambers for years, said she is someone who believes strongly in what she is doing and doesn't care if she garners negative publicity. ""That is to be respected,"" he said. But it has also made her a controversial figure in the world of Colorado courts. Alan Prendergast, a journalist for Denver's Westword newspaper who has covered Chambers since she took office in 2004, called her a maverick who is well acquainted with controversy. Threats before, after other 'Dark Knight' showings, authorities said . Prendergast has doggedly written about how Chambers has turned her office into a ""conviction machine."" From seeking the death penalty in a state that does not embrace it to pursuing harsh habitual-criminal charges against chronic but low-level offenders, she has earned a reputation as a hard-ass. ""As far as prosecution is concerned, you probably couldn't be in a better jurisdiction,"" said Todd Whelan, who worked in Chambers' office before she was elected district attorney and later, as a defense attorney, butted legal heads with her in court. A 2008 Westword article was headlined ""The Punisher: Censured but defiant, Carol Chambers goes after habitual criminals -- and cops, judges and lawyers -- like no other district attorney. But at what cost?"" The cost was that these low-level offenders were being put away on absurdly long and costly sentences when the prison system was overloaded and rehab programs were grossly underfunded, wrote Prendergast, citing Colorado defense attorneys. Residents return to building where suspect set boobytraps . Chambers, said Whelan, goes after the most minor offenders with gusto. ""There's no deference given to any defendant whatsoever,"" he said. Chambers is the only state district attorney in Colorado to seek the death penalty in the past five years. Two of the three men on Colorado's death row were prosecuted by Chambers. That makes her an anomaly in a state that fell one vote short in 2009 of abolishing capital punishment. ""That jurisdiction is very enamored with the death penalty,"" Kornfeld said about Arapahoe County. ""And this is a state that uses it very sparingly."" Many of the Aurora cinema shooting victims' family and friends are demanding death for the suspect. In this case, they will have a prosecutor who is not shy about seeking the harshest punishment. ""If there ever was a case for the death penalty, this is probably that case,"" Kornfeld said. ""What's a more extreme case than this?"" Colorado shooting: Stories of survival . Chambers told reporters this week that her office had a lot of work to do in the investigation. ""I would say there's no such thing as a slam-dunk case,"" she said. ""We're still looking at the enormous amount of evidence."" She will get to decide whether Holmes' case will be a capital one. But by the time the trial progresses, which Kornfeld said could take years, Chambers will be long gone. ""Chambers is a very successful prosecutor,"" said a profile of her this week in the Atlantic magazine. ""She has the experience, talent and intellect necessary to prosecute the coming Holmes case in a productive way. But she doesn't necessarily come to her most famous case, her legacy case, with completely clean hands."" She is tainted perhaps by allegations of questionable ethics -- including providing benefits to prosecution witnesses and a tight management style that has led to a backlog of cases, Kornfeld said. She was even publicly censured recently, Prendergast said. And, she has been known to scuffle with judges, police officers and other public officials. A Chambers spokeswoman said she would not comment because of a gag order placed on the Holmes case, but she has always denied the allegations against her and stood firmly in her convictions. Even some of her detractors call Chambers a fair person who tries to do the right thing. Kornfeld called her when he was defending Greg Kolomitz, the Colorado governor's former campaign manager who was accused of mishandling funds. He recalled her saying: I know what it's like to be a victim of a political witch hunt. We will investigate. Kornfeld said Chambers was fair. She is a Republican who was dealing with a Democratic scandal. But after looking into it, Chambers cleared Kolomitz of wrongdoing. Kornfeld said he believes Chambers' past comes into play in her role as a prosecutor. Court appearance fuels theories about Colorado shooting suspect . She was raised in a small town in Ohio, the daughter of a Presbyterian pastor, according to her official biography. Her grandfather worked for the church as did her three uncles. ""So needless to say, my childhood centered around the church, which was our extended family,"" she wrote in her biography. She earned a nursing degree from Texas Christian University and then moved to Denver, where she worked in the emergency room to put herself through law school at the University of Denver. ""During the two years I worked in the ER at Denver General, I saw the results of homelessness, poverty, drug abuse, sudden and unexpected death, Alzheimer's, suicide, disabilities, mental illness, chronic disease, severe alcohol addiction, victimization, violent crime, sexual assault, child abuse, elder abuse and driving under the influence,"" she wrote. How to help the victims . Kornfeld believes Chambers' nursing experience makes her extremely empathetic and solicitous of crime victims. ""As all DAs should be,"" he said. ""But she comes at it from a different background."" Chambers worked in medical malpractice defense but wanted to be a prosecutor in criminal cases. She joined the 18th Judicial District, which covers four Colorado counties. Kornfeld said he understands why Chambers has a blemished reputation. But she's not necessarily as inflexible as people make her out to be. ""If you ask her constituents, she's done an effective job as a law enforcement officer,"" he said. She married Nathan Chambers, who defended the most notorious criminal perhaps in contemporary America -- Timothy McVeigh. He was even there to witness the execution of the Oklahoma City bomber. In Kornfeld's mind, that makes Carol Chambers not a zealot, after all. Now all of America will be able to see her, judge her, as Coloradans have done for years -- as she prosecutes a man suspected in another heinous act that will also be a part of modern American history.

"(Rolling Stone) -- Jonathan Demme can't get enough of Neil Young. The Academy Award-winning director recently completed ""Neil Young Journeys,"" his third feature-length documentary on the iconic folk-rocker, which mingles footage of Young alone onstage at Toronto's Massey hall with moving scenes of him driving through his childhood home of Omeeme, Ontario. It opens on Friday, June 29, in New York and Los Angeles, then rolls out across the country all summer. Demme is the acclaimed director of a long list of dramatic films, including 1991's horrific ""Silence of the Lambs"" and 2008's ""Rachel Getting Married"" -- but music is never far from his mind. He collaborated with David Byrne on the classic Talking Heads concert film, ""Stop Making Sense,"" in 1984, and music is a crucial part of his dramatic movies, including 1993's ""Philadelphia,"" which features deeply emotional original songs from Young and Bruce Springsteen. In 1995, Demme and Young followed their ""Philadelphia"" collaboration with ""The Complex Sessions,"" a five-song short film with Crazy Horse. Between 2006's ""Heart of Gold,"" 2009's ""Neil Young Trunk Show"" and now, ""Journeys,"" they've completed a trilogy of feature-length films that capture different phases of Young's work. Demme, who just finished shooting an adaptation of Henrick Ibsen's ""The Master Builder"" with Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory (""My Dinner With Andre""), spoke to Rolling Stone about his love of music, Young's film director alter-ego Bernard Shakey and his long journey through the past with Young. Rolling Stone: When did you first become aware of Neil Young and his music? Jonathan Demme: In the Sixties, when Buffalo Springfield came out. Like most young people, I was very engaged with contemporary music, especially because of the Beatles, which made everybody listen that much closer to everything. It was such a thrilling moment in popular music. And now, here's Buffalo Springfield, and they're great. And there's one particular individual in there -- he wasn't singing too many of the songs, but he was writing these amazing songs, singing a little bit. I remember the Neil Young brand hitting me very hard immediately. He wasn't an acquired taste. I loved him immediately. Rolling Stone: Buffalo Springfield broke up pretty fast. Demme: They only put out three albums. I kind of despaired a little bit: ""Oh, what, no more Springfield?"" Then, bam, here comes the solo album, which was so amazing. I was a rock critic at that point. I lived in London and was a writer for a Boston-based alternative newspaper called Fusion. I reviewed Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young at the Albert Hall in '69. I read that [review] fairly recently, and I was very turned off by David Crosby talking too much, but then I was very turned on by Neil Young. Rolling Stone: It seems like the last 20 years of his career are the most documented ones. Journeys is your third feature-length film with him. Demme: The first one we did, ""Heart of Gold,"" really turned out well, and we got to know each other aesthetically and personally quite well. ""Trunk Show"" was not conceived as a movie. He had a great tour going, great lighting, great set, great song list, great band. That's a concert film. I don't think ""Journeys"" is a concert film -- it's a performance film with a strong documentary component to it. A couple of years later, he's touring with the [""Le Noise""] show. I was struck immediately by the magnitude of the sound in the context of one man, this grizzled maestro with electric guitars and other things, filling up these halls with this amazing music. And I thought, ""There's never been a performance film like that before."" So it became an opportunity to do something completely different from what we'd done before. And maybe we can add this other travel dimension to it. He's a great artist, a great entertainer, and endlessly desirable to see and hear. Rolling Stone: Are you a fan of Bernard Shakey's work as a filmmaker? Demme: I have a lot of respect for Bernard Shakey. I love Greendale. It's a wonderful American independent movie. It's fantastic. When David Byrne and I were getting ready to do ""Stop Making Sense,"" we were looking at concert films and trying to figure out how we could do a film that was different from all the rest, and also would be really good. For David, ""Rust Never Sleeps"" was the one he wanted to be as good as. Rolling Stone: You do a lot of driving with Young in ""Journeys."" How is he behind the wheel? Demme: He's good. I don't know if you've driven a pre-power steering car lately, but those things are hard, man. They're physically demanding, and they don't respond really well. We started in little towns with serene back roads. We wound up on the freeway, and what was cute and charming in a Crown Victoria back in Omeeme, now becomes this bizarre relic amidst a stream of modern speeding cars. It wound up kind of poignant. I never thought I'd say to myself, ""Oh, poor Neil."" By the time he's in downtown Toronto in his charming old car, he looked really vulnerable. Rolling Stone: For anyone who has listened to Neil Young's music, to actually see the ""town in North Ontario"" that he sings about in ""Helpless"" was fascinating. Demme: I know! Whenever you heard that line, didn't you always picture something? It was very beautiful, whatever it was. And it was kind of amazing to get to that town in North Ontario and see, what do you know, it is gorgeous. It is dreamlike. And, amazingly, it's still here. Rolling Stone: There is also a scene where you go to a childhood home of his, and all that's left is the lawn. Demme: Yeah, and the symbolism of actually seeing the earthmovers right at work even as he's driving away. It's almost like, ""You better get out of there, Neil, before they gobble you up like that old house."" Rolling Stone: How do you explain the powerful connection between film and music? Demme: We're raised on these two incredible treats. We hear music coming over the radio first; we fall in love with music. We see television, and we fall in love with the moving image. A music film is what takes these two separate, wonderful experiences and marries them. I felt from time to time that shooting live music is the most purely cinematic thing you can do. Ideally, the cinema is becoming one with the music. There is little artifice involved. There's no acting. I love it. Rolling Stone: It's also a big part in your dramatic films, like your use of the song ""Goodbye Horses"" in ""Silence of the Lambs,"" when the serial killer Buffalo Bill is primping in the mirror. Demme: That song wasn't in the script. The first time I heard that song, I was doing the final mix on a ""Sun City"" video with Little Steven and [producer] Arthur Baker. We finished it up, and there was a blizzard going on in New York. Arthur and I got in a cab, and after we drop him off, the driver says to me, ""Are you in the music business?"" ""Uh, not really."" So she puts on ""Goodbye Horses"" going through a blizzard, and, ""Oh my God, what is this and who are you?"" She was an unsigned singer Q Lazzarus, and that song ended up in Silence of the Lambs. And I asked her to sing David Byrne's song ""Heaven"" at a party scene in Philadelphia. Rolling Stone: It added so much depth to the moment. Demme: Music has that potential. It can be like something that saves you in a scene that isn't working that great -- the right music can make a weak scene acceptable. It can also add a whole other dimension to a scene. It can send it right into the ozone. See the full story at RollingStone.com. Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Jonathan Demme recently completed ""Neil Young Journeys""

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai said Saturday that a suicide bombing targeting the country's spy chief was planned in the Pakistani city of Quetta, and that he expects to raise the issue with Pakistani authorities. The attack occurred Thursday in one of the intelligence agency's guesthouses in Kabul, seriously injuring National Directorate of Security Asadullah Khalid -- who is expected to recover -- while leaving others wounded or dead, officials said. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the bombing, but Karzai says he believes otherwise. ""The reality is that such a complicated attack and a bomb that was hidden inside his body, this is not the work of the Taliban,"" he told reporters. ""It's a completely professional and thoroughly engineered type of attack. The Taliban are not capable of that, and therefore there are bigger and professional hands involved in this. ""We will be seeking a lot of clarifications from Pakistan,"" Karzai said, though he avoided blaming Pakistan directly and pledged that it would not derail the peace process. Cross border raids from Pakistan into Afghanistan and accusations that Pakistani intelligence support Afghan insurgents have long fueled discontent between the two nations. But Pakistan is also considered a key regional power broker needed to settle the more than decade-long Afghan conflict, particularly as NATO's 2014 withdrawal nears. While it remains unclear how the bomber smuggled the explosive device into what is expected to be a high-security location, Thursday's strike highlights looming safety concerns and the difficulty of marrying them with the rigors of religious and cultural guidelines in a country where modesty is often a prime concern. Last year, the mayor of the restive southern city of Kandahar -- considered the Taliban birthplace -- was killed during a city hall meeting when explosives detonated inside the turban of his attacker. On Saturday, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautioned Karzai against the suggestion of Pakistani culpability in Thursday's attack while raising questions about security lapses. ""Before leveling charges the Afghan government would do well if they shared information or evidence with the government of Pakistan that they might have with regard to the cowardly attack on the head of NDS,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""They would also do well by ordering an investigation into any lapses in the security arrangements around the NDS chief."" The Ministry added that ""Pakistan is ready to assist any investigation of this criminal act."" But the attack has since raised questions about top Afghan officials' vulnerability to assassination attempts and the effect they could have on broader peace negotiations. Known as a staunch Karzai loyalist and practiced anti-Taliban fighter, Khalid was tapped as Afghanistan's intelligence chief in September. He drew attention in Kabul and across the region for his experience and at times heavy-handed tactics, particularly in the country's volatile south, serving as Kandahar's governor in 2005 and later as minister of tribal and border affairs where he oversaw southern security forces. Considered an ambitious man despite dropping out of Kabul University, Khalid joined famed Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, known as the ""Lion of Panjshir,"" before the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. Largely viewed as a well-connected senior official critical to the president's inner circle, Thursday's attack against Khalid drew comparisons to last year's assassination of Berhanuddin Rabbani, an Afghan leader spearheading the reconciliation process with the Taliban. Rabbani, a former Afghan president and chairman of the High Peace Council, was killed in a suicide attack at his home on September 20, 2011. ""The attack against (Rabbani) was formulated in Quetta, and now the attack on Asadullah Khan Khalid has also been organized in Pakistan,"" Karzai said Saturday. Quetta is the provincial capital of Baluchistan, a volatile Pakistani province that borders Afghanistan, where a Taliban leadership council known as the Quetta Shura is believed to have been based since the U.S.-led invasion in 2001. It was formed after coalition forces toppled the Taliban-led government, prompting senior Taliban leaders to escape to Pakistan, which has been at times blamed for harboring the group. Though U.S. officials say it is not clear if the group still remains in Quetta. CNN's Masoud Popalzai in Kabul and Nasir Habib in Islamabad contributed to this report. David Ariosto is in New York.","The attack occurred in one of the intelligence agency guesthouses in Kabul .

"(CNN) -- The deadly church and mosque attacks in Nigeria and Kenya, and the deaths of Ghanaian and Ethiopian leaders dominated sub-Saharan Africa headlines in 2012. But lost in the midst were a series of positive stories. For every conflict, there was a milestone. For every violence, there was reconciliation. For every setback, progress. Here are the top 5 positive stories out of the continent, as chosen by those who call it home: . The rise of African women . This year saw three African women take on key leadership roles. Malawi appointed a female president, Joyce Banda, as Liberia re-elected Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Since taking over the task of stabilizing a shaky economy, Banda has earned plaudits for financial reforms, including selling the presidential jet, downsizing the government's car fleet and cutting her own salary. In another milestone, South Africa's Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma was inaugurated as the chief of the African Union. The former minister took the reins of a male-dominated organization facing funding woes and challenged it to reduce its reliance on aid. Her election could ease tensions between the body and the International Criminal Court, which also picked an African woman as its top prosecutor. Critics have accused the court of focusing on African nations and overlooking opportunities to investigate abuses in other countries. Gambian lawyer Fatou Bensouda took over as the court's top prosecutor, a move welcomed by critics as a major step in healing relations between the two organizations. The three were the first women to assume their respective positions. Growing economies, middle class . Africa is home to some of the fastest-growing economies in the world. And the thriving, burgeoning middle class is one indication of that. The number of middle-class Africans tripled over the past three decades to 313 million, or about 34% of the continent's population, the African Development Bank says in its latest report. The figure is a marked improvement from previous years. Middle-class earners are described as people spending between $2 and $20 a day, a threshold criticized by some analysts as too low. The report says that the overall number of people defined as middle class includes a ""floating class"" -- those with expenditure levels of $2 to $4 per day, a group considered at risk of sliding back to poverty levels. Though the report also warns of the growing number of income inequality, it also notes that the middle class is crucial in anchoring African economies. ""It's a call to say 'look, please invest in Africa, there are good returns,' "" says Mthuli Ncube, chief economist and vice president of the African Development Bank. Analysts have warned that the current boom in a middle class is not generating much employment. New Somali government . Though progress is fragile at best, Somalia got its first central government in about two decades. Parliament members picked a political newcomer as president, who then named another political novice as prime minister. Somalia also adopted a provisional constitution and selected parliament members -- all in recent months. The new leadership marks a milestone for the nation, which plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown 21 years ago. Clan warlords and militants battled for control after his ouster, sparking a civil war and mayhem. In another recent achievement, Somali and African Union troops forced out Al-Shabaab militants from Mogadishu, sending residents frolicking to the beach as life in the capital trickled back to normalcy. Once out of the capital, the militants retreated to the port city of Kismayo, a strategic location for their lucrative coal shipments. Coalition forces forced them out of that city as well. It was the last major town under militant control. Ghana elections . Ghana lived up to its ""mature democracy"" reputation again this year, a political feat that has eluded most nations in Africa. Long hailed as a beacon of democracy and progress in the continent, the nation re-elected the incumbent, who beat his closest contender with a razor-thin margin. Despite the narrowness of the victory, no violence erupted, unlike elections in nations such as the Ivory Coast, where both the incumbent and the winner clung to power after the results of the 2010 poll. A series of other African nations have also descended into violence after elections, making Ghana a noteworthy exception. While there was some bickering from the losing sides, the nation maintained peace for the most part. President John Mahama served as vice president under his predecessor, who died this year. In another move highlighting the solidity of its democracy, Ghana immediately swore in Mahama to avoid a power vacuum. Zambia's emotional win . Zambia won its first African Cup of Nations -- nearly two decades after a plane crash killed its team, coaches and crew members. The win was sentimental because it occurred in Gabon, the same country where the tragic crash happened in 1993. And it was a major triumph because the team was not favored to win against the star-studded Ivory Coast. In the end, Zambia hoisted the Cup of Nations after beating Ivory Coast 8-7 in a dramatic penalty shootout. Throngs of supporters danced and wept at the airport when the team arrived home. Did we leave any out? Let us know in the comment section below.","This year saw three African women take on key leadership roles .

"(CNN) -- Despite headlines saying that it lost Tuesday's vote, the fate of California's proposed $1-a-pack tax hike on cigarettes is still in limbo, and state officials said late Thursday that a final result is likely weeks away. The tax increase, known as Proposition 29, would raise an estimated $735 million a year, with roughly three-quarters of that money going to cancer research. Initial results showed Prop 29 being rejected by a margin of roughly 65,000 votes, out of nearly 4 million cast -- a margin of 50.8% to 49.2%. However, the results don't yet include a vast number of mail-in ballots and provisional ballots. As of Thursday night, at least 829,863 votes were yet to be counted, according to figures posted by California's Secretary of State. The real figure is likely much higher, as the official ""uncounted"" number leaves out several counties that have yet to send their data. ""We've asked counties to report their number of unprocessed ballots, but it's voluntary, so there's no way to know the exact number,"" said Allie Schembra, a spokeswoman for the Secretary of State's office. State law requires county elections officials to report final vote tallies by July 6. California Secretary of State Debra Bowen then has until July 13 to certify the results. As more results trickled in by Thursday night, the margin had shrunk to less than 53,000 votes. Or as one Bay Area Weekly joked, ""Proposition 29 results are close enough to make you want to chain smoke."" ""Supporters of Prop 29 are not conceding defeat,"" vowed Doug Ulman, CEO of the Lance Armstrong-founded Livestrong organization. ""We will closely monitor the counting of late absentee and provisional ballots... This race is still too close to call, and we remain hopeful that the victory will ultimately be ours."" Proposition 29 was the subject of a fierce advertising campaign, playing out on Californians' television screens for weeks ahead of the vote. Opponents of the tax spent nearly $47 million, most of it coming from tobacco companies. They argued that Prop 29 would create a large, unaccountable bureaucracy. Supporters, including Livestrong, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, spent about $12 million.","State officials say decision for tax hike on cigarettes is weeks away .

"Johannesburg (CNN) -- A novel skin graft treatment appears to be working for a 3-year-old South African girl burned over 80% of her body in January, a spokeswoman for her family said Tuesday. A medical team led by reconstructive surgeon Ridwan Mia spent four hours Monday night removing wrappings from Isabella ""Pippi"" Kruger's body, according to spokeswoman Ilze Rabie. They found that 90% of the skin graft -- cloned in a U.S. laboratory and then rushed to South Africa last week -- appears to be taking, she said. The little girl, who was burned in a New Year's Eve barbecuing accident at home, remains sedated, said Rabie, who is representing the family and Genzyme, the Boston company that produced the cloned skin graft that's being used to treat her. The plan is to gradually wake Pippi and remove her from a ventilator by Thursday, Rabie said. While complications and other setbacks remain a possibility, Rabie said Pippi could be well enough to begin physical therapy and rehabilitation by next week. Pippi's ordeal began on New Year's Eve when she was playing outside as her father, Erwin Kruger, prepared a barbeque using a highly flammable liquid gel. As he lit the gel, its container exploded and covered Pippi's small body. She screamed as her skin burned and ""bubbled,"" according to her mother, Anice Kruger. The toddler suffered third-degree burns on 80% of her body. Afterward, she was struck with four cardiac arrests, kidney failures, collapsed lungs and multiple infections. Her critical condition eventually stabilized under the care of Mia and others at the Netcare Garden City Hospital in Johannesburg. But the Krugers were uncomfortable with their options for healing her skin: temporarily using skin from a cadaver or from a pig, or taking her small portion of undamaged skin and grafting it elsewhere. ""Please don't take the perfect skin, just give me a week to find something else,"" Anice Kruger begged of Mia. After days on the Internet and hours reaching out to reconstructive specialists in the United States, Pippi's mother discovered Genzyme, whose specialty is growing layers of human skin by cloning a 2-square-centimeter sample from a patient. Doctors in the United States performed the process -- called a cultured epidermal autograft -- more than 100 times in last year, according to Genzyme. However, because the new skin must be administered within 24 hours of leaving the lab, the procedure hasn't been attempted much farther away. It had never before been attempted in South Africa. The procedure, which is being covered by local medical coverage and donations, cost $82,000.

"(CNN) -- In ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World,"" the plot is simple: An asteroid headed for Earth is ready to wipe out life as we know it. But the film isn't just a rehashing of the doomsday plots you might be familiar with from movies like ""Deep Impact"" or ""Armageddon."" Instead, the film follows Dodge (Steve Carell) on a last-minute road-trip with his neighbor, Penny (Keira Knightley), as they drive from New York to Delaware in search of Dodge's high school girlfriend -- ""the one that got away."" Along with Carell and Knightley, the film has a stellar supporting cast, including Connie Britton, Adam Brody, Rob Corddry and Patton Oswalt, to name a few. The story mixes a range of emotions -- regret, spite, fear and love -- through this backdrop of pending doom, balancing humor and sadness with dread. Written by Lorene Scafaria, whose work includes the 2008 adaptation of the novel ""Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist,"" ""Seeking a Friend"" also marks her directorial debut. CNN spoke with Scafaria from her home in Los Angeles about the origins of ""Seeking a Friend,"" directing Carell and who would be the first to let loose in the world's last days. CNN: ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"" is about the annihilation of Earth by an asteroid. Is the doom of the human race something you've pondered a lot? Scafaria: I've definitely been thinking about it a long time (laughs). Most of my nightmares that jolt me awake either involve the cosmos or something completely out of human control. In reality, I worry more about nuclear war, or war in general. I've been more ""world weary"" in the last 10 years than before. But even still, in a way, I saw (the film) as a way to explore human emotions. I wanted that epic backdrop, but to keep the storytelling very intimate and character driven. CNN: The beginning of the film is very funny and sarcastic -- but it becomes sad. How do you find the balance between those sentiments? Scafaria: When you go through something like this, if it is a death or divorce, you have to find ways to cope with it -- to see humor in the worst situations. I do think there's a fine line between comedy and (tragedy), and sometimes both are happening at the exact same time. It's something I've lived through and I've always tried to laugh through those dark times. In writing the script, it was something I kept in mind. Steve Carell has always been one of those people who's great at finding that tone. (His ""The Office"" character) Michael Scott was a tragic-comic character. So much pain behind the smile. CNN: When watching this movie, a lot of questions go through one's mind about what they'd do in this situation. Some people act crazy, and some people continue to have yard sales, or work their job at the deli. Scafaria: Right, right. I do think people would go about their business. Routine is part of coping. 9/11 was something where we all had to go back to work on Monday. ... Some people would do it because they're creatures of habit, some people would do it because it's what they love. CNN: The other theme that's prevalent, and is utterly devastating throughout, is regret. Are you a regretful person? Scafaria: I'm not, but I have them anyway. I try not to dwell. I feel very much like (Knightley's character) Penny in that sense, where I try to live my life to the fullest. But by doing that, you still end up missing out and spreading yourself very thin. I've spent holidays with ex-boyfriends and felt like I missed out on Christmas Eve with my family. Those were huge regrets. I'm a person that thinks time is very precious and our only commodity. ... It's so upsetting when I feel like something has wasted my time. CNN: You hate the DMV don't you? Scafaria: I haven't had to go there too many times in my life, so it's not the worst place on Earth. I'd say the Rite Aid on Sunset and Fairfax, where I live, is hell on Earth. CNN: This was Steve Carell's first film that he did after leaving ""The Office."" What did you notice about how he works? Scafaria: He never stops working. He's always thinking, always present. He's really collaborative. He trusted me for some reason, which was so lovely, and yet we'd watch playback together -- he's the kind of guy who looks at his tapes and learns from it -- and for the most part, we just agreed on what we both liked. He isn't the kind of comedian who is ""on"" all the time. And in that way, he's so funny and comfortable to be around. CNN: The apocalypse has been a serious news topic lately. Did you research how different cultures view the end of the world before writing this? Scafaria: I looked a little bit into it. I've been obsessed with doomsday for a long time -- the idea that different cultures respond to it differently, and religions will change people's outlook on it. There is a bit of that in the film -- different cultures, different classes of people represented. A lot of thought was put behind how different people would react to the news. CNN: In the beginning of the film, there's a lot of straight-laced adults letting loose because they have nothing to lose. Is there a type of person who's going to be doing heroin in their final days? Scafaria: In the script I wrote, ""the most normal-looking couple enters with heroin."" I think (it's) the most buttoned-up (who) would want to cut loose the most.","Screenwriter Lorene Scafaria makes directorial debut with 'Seeking a Friend'

"(CNN) -- One of the heroes of the French Resistance against Nazi occupation, Raymond Aubrac, has died in Paris at the age of 97. With his passing, France has lost one of its few remaining links to an era that brought both humiliation and inspiration. French President Nicolas Sarkozy paid tribute to Aubrac Wednesday. ""These heroes of the shadows who saved France's honor at a time when it seemed lost are disappearing one after the other,"" he said. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also spoke admiringly of Aubrac. ""His commitment, his courage, his refusal to give up, his attachment to the pride of France,"" Juppe said, ""made him a hero of the Resistance -- notably alongside his wife, Lucie Aubrac."" Aubrac was a Jew of Polish origin whose real name was Raymond Samuel. Born in 1914, he studied at Harvard before joining the French army. The Germans took him prisoner in 1940 but he escaped and with Lucie applied for visas to live in the United States. But they reconsidered the decision. ""We changed our minds: Could we really leave our families and our friends behind while our country was occupied?"" she later wrote. Hanna Diamond, an expert on wartime France and professor at the University of Bath in England, says Raymond and his wife were important in the Resistance as founding members of a group called Liberation-Sud, based in Lyon. Diamond met the Aubracs and wrote ""Fleeing Hitler: France 1940."" She said that many like-minded people fled to the unoccupied part of France and used the relative freedom they had there to organize. Among them was Jean Moulin, a charismatic leader credited with bringing together different groups of the resistance. In June 1943 Moulin and Aubrac were captured, along with other resistance leaders, by the Lyon Gestapo, led at the time by the infamous Klaus Barbie. Barbie interrogated Moulin, and he was tortured to death. In a BBC interview earlier this year, Aubrac recalled that fateful day. ""I was sitting beside Moulin and when the Gestapo burst in, he told me: 'I have a piece of paper in my pocket. Make it disappear.' ""So I put my hand in his pocket and took out the paper and swallowed it - which is not easy. I have no idea what was written on it. ""After the war, I came back to the house in Caluire -- and there on the mantelpiece in the waiting room was my pipe. Exactly where I had left it when the Gestapo came!"" Months after the arrests, Lucie -- though pregnant at the time -- organized one of the most dramatic rescues of the Resistance. She persuaded the Germans that she was pregnant by Raymond but not married to him (which was untrue). The ruse worked and he was taken to the police headquarters in Lyon for a marriage ceremony. On the way back to the jail, Resistance fighters ambushed the detainees' truck. Raymond and 13 other prisoners fled. Barbie was put on trial in Lyon in 1987. He was charged with crimes against humanity for organizing the mass deportation of Jews from Lyon, as well as ordering massacres and carrying out torture. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison and he died behind bars. Lucie died five years ago. Her fictionalized account of the couple's wartime exploits, translated into English as ""Outwitting the Gestapo,"" was turned into a film in 1997, directed by Claude Berri. In the chaotic aftermath of the liberation in June 1944, Aubrac became the commissioner of the new Republic in the port of Marseille. It was a time of nightmares, he recalled, with summary executions and retribution, a lack of government and no rule of law. For many years after the war Aubrac talked to schools about the Resistance and its goals. His message, he told the French newspaper Le Monde last month, was this: ""One thing always guided us -- optimism, the conviction that through what we were doing we could bring change. That's what I tell young people. If you begin feeling beaten, you will achieve nothing. If you fight you will perhaps have a chance of achieving something."" But just who did what in the Resistance has frequently been a source of heated debate in France where there's been much agonizing about collaboration with the Nazis and ambivalence about the Resistance. Diamond says there was also something of a backlash in France about the Aubracs' celebrity. And in their waning years the role of the Aubracs was questioned because their accounts contained inconsistencies. A book published in 1997 even implicated the couple in the arrest of Resistance leaders at their meeting in June 1943. The book included allegations from Klaus Barbie himself, who asserted that the Aubracs were the double agents who had informed him of the meeting. The couple later successfully sued the author. But Diamond says the allegations deeply wounded them. Another source of regret for Raymond Aubrac was his failure to persuade his parents to leave France for the safety of Switzerland even though he had secured false papers for them. ""My mother wanted to leave,"" he later recalled, ""but my father paradoxically still had faith in Marshal Petain"" -- then the ruler of Vichy France, the part unoccupied by Nazi forces. His parents were later captured by the French Milice (French Militia) and handed over to the Gestapo, and then transported to the concentration camp at Auschwitz where they died. To the very end, Aubrac preferred thinking of the present and the future rather than his storied past. In his interview with Le Monde last month he recalled studying at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937 under the great economist Joseph Schumpeter who had taught that technological change transformed civilizations as well as economies. ""There is now a generation of young people for whom there is nothing on offer,"" he said. ""They don't feel that society needs them, that they should prepare to play a role. When they tell me they will be unemployed, whatever they do, I find that very troubling."" Asked what he was most proud of, he replied his decision to be with Lucie. They were married for 68 years. ""In life, you know, there are three or four fundamental choices. The rest is a matter of luck.""","Raymond Aubrac was a hero in the French Resistance against Nazi Germany .

"Washington (CNN) -- Air traffic control towers staffed by private contractors are cheaper and provide the same level of safety as towers staffed by government controllers, a new government audit concludes. Contract towers, as they are known, cost on average $537,000 a year to operate, compared with $2 million for comparably busy towers staffed by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the Department of Transportation's Office of Inspector General. In addition, the contract towers had a ""significantly lower number and rate of safety incidents,"" the report said. Currently, 251 of the nation's 374 towers are staffed by contractors who must meet FAA standards and are overseen by FAA managers. Restricted to lower-volume airports, contract towers nonetheless handle 28 percent of all domestic airport operations. The OIG report likely will give ammunition to Republican lawmakers who favor the privatization of everything from airport control towers to security checkpoints. But it is unlikely to result in an expansion of tower contracting, coming on the heels of the re-election of a president with strong public sector support. The current hybrid system of contract- and government-staffed towers is a result of the decision by President Ronald Reagan to fire the striking Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization controllers in 1981. After they were fired, the FAA moved its staff and managers to the busiest control towers, leaving smaller towers vacant. The next year, the FAA started the Federal Contract Tower Program, placing contractors at five low-activity towers. The program expanded gradually. Of the 251 contract towers in operation today, about half were previously staffed by FAA controllers, and half are new towers built by communities, typically to promote economic development. The new OIG audit compares 30 randomly selected contract towers to 30 comparable ""low activity"" FAA towers. The report notes a large difference in operating costs mainly due to lower staffing and salary levels at contract towers. Contract towers had an average of six controllers, while FAA towers had 16. A typical contract controller near Tampa, Florida, received a base salary of $56,000 per year compared with a base salary ranging from $63,000 to $85,000 a year for an FAA controller in Sarasota, Florida, the study said. Contract towers also had a ""significantly lower number and rate of safety incidents,"" the report says. For example, 240 contract towers referenced in the review had 197 safety incidents, compared with 362 incidents at 92 similar FAA towers. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, which represents FAA controllers and controllers at 63 contract towers, said it is wrong to conclude that the lower rate of safety incidents at contract towers means those towers are safer. FAA controllers fall under a non-punitive reporting system that encourages controllers to voluntarily report errors. ""The FAA has a true safety culture, where all controllers and employees are encouraged to report all safety issues, including errors, while contract towers are dictated by a punitive culture that discourages controllers and their supervisors from reporting errors,"" said Sarah Dunn, a spokeswoman for the NATCA. An advocate for contract controllers disagreed that contract controllers were less likely to report errors. ""The culture is that you're fired if you don't report and it's found out,"" said J. Spencer Dickerson, executive director of the U.S. Contract Tower Association. But he also said it is ""a stretch"" to conclude that contract towers are safer. He said the two systems have ""comparable levels of safety."" ""The irony of the program is a lot of controllers are retired FAA controllers,"" Dickerson said. FAA controllers must retire at age 56, but contract controllers have no such mandatory retirement age. ""So it's a great opportunity for FAA controllers who do their 20 years and want to stay in the business,"" he said. The ""vast majority"" of contract controllers are former FAA or former military controllers. They must be certified by the FAA and must meet the same medical requirements and are subject to the same drug testing. But contract towers are ""definitely more cost-effective to the taxpayers,"" Dickerson said. Airports that have contract towers ""are very positive of the program,"" he said. ""The reports are that it's seamless. Pilots will tell you they can't tell the difference between an FAA tower and the contract towers, and that's our goal.""","Contract towers have lower costs, same safety levels as FAA-staffed towers, study finds .

"(CNN) -- Traveling to Rio de Janeiro for a two-day tournament last year, professional golfer Amanda Blumenherst couldn't catch a break. The Arizona-based golfer's flight to Dallas was detoured to San Antonio because of bad weather. Blumenherst, who joined the Ladies Professional Golf Association in 2010, slept in San Antonio and flew on to Dallas the next day. That day, a seven-hour delay for her flight to Rio turned into a cancellation and another night in a hotel. Two hours into the Rio flight the following day, ""there was a medical emergency and we had to turn around,"" she said in an e-mail. ""The plane was too heavy from the fuel that wasn't used and 'broke' the wheels, canceling that flight."" When the next flight finally reached Brazil, it had to land in another city and wait for bad weather to clear in Rio. Blumenherst's flight did finally arrive -- just 72 hours after starting the trip. And that's just one tournament in her 30-week-a-year travel schedule. Hotels ready for the end of the world . The professional athlete's life seems so glamorous and full of jet-set travel. And for professional athletes whose teams rent chartered planes, book fine hotels and take care of transporting their luggage, it may be. Not so much for the rest of the professionals who play sports for a living. Some travel relentlessly hoping to break through to achieve even more. Others are happy for another season in a country far from home, playing the sport they love. These road warriors have their travel routines figured out and know what they need to make it through another trip. Light luggage for water polo . Professional water polo player Tony Azevedo, who serves as captain of the men's U.S. National Water Polo Team and has competed in four Olympics, travels more than 90 days a year. Azevedo plays for a Croatian team during the professional water polo season (from August through May), flying commercial all over Europe. During the summer, he trains with Team USA and travels around the world for tournaments. ""The only equipment we need to take are caps, and the team usually takes these (or gives them to the youngest team members to transport),"" he wrote in an e-mail from the road. ""We are all in charge of bringing our own robes, sandals, suits and any other gear we need."" ""I wear my Intelliskin shirt and pants to help with posture and circulation, and then any team gear that I have chosen for the trip (as captain),"" writes Azevedo, who doesn't check his baggage. He also makes sure to bring his fully loaded iPad, headphones and a neck pillow. 4 must-sees for military buffs . A little extra for a professional basketball player -- and mom . Professional WNBA basketball player Candace Parker, who plays for the Los Angeles Sparks during the summer, doesn't have to pack any basketball uniforms or equipment. That's handled by the team. But she does have to pack a little bit extra. The WNBA requires that the players dress ""business casual"" after the game. And her daughter, 3, also comes on trips and requires her sippy cups and a bag of toys. When Parker plays in the United States, which is usually May until October, she travels for about half of the five-month season. The other half of the year she plays professionally in Europe. On either side of the Atlantic, her most crucial items are her iPad and the sippy cup and coloring gear for her daughter. In the U.S., she also knows she can pick up any toiletries she might have forgotten to pack. But in Europe, she's more careful about packing cosmetics and other items she might not find in the smaller cities on her away schedule. ""I pack a lot, and my husband (former Brooklyn Nets player Shelden Williams, who now plays for French team Elan Chalon) tells me that I overpack,"" she says. ""He tends to travel lighter, but he forgets things."" A runner with a laundry regimen . Runner's World editor Bart Yasso has learned the art of minimalist packing, traveling for running events more than 40 weekends out of each year. If he has to bring nice clothes, he'll wear those on the plane. (He also wants to look nice if he gets upgraded.) And he prefers to pack lightly and use a backpack, so he can literally run to make any tight connections. If he's going to run four times on a trip, Yasso will pack one pair of broken-in running shoes and three running kits. He can't sleep on planes, so he'll work if there's a Wi-Fi connection, watch movies and eat a light meal. Key to his travel enjoyment is adjusting immediately to the local time. ""When I get in, I eat the meal that makes the most sense, adjust and get on that time line immediately,"" he says. ""I don't want to know what time it is back home. You want to live in the time zone you're in. Get the most sleep you can (at night) to feel the best you can."" Preferring not to have a stinky bag of sweaty clothes when he gets home, he always washes his running gear in his hotel sink before repacking his gear. A golfer with particular tastes . Professional golfer Blumenherst doesn't have to pack golf balls, gloves, hats and golf shoes. Nike, her sponsor, delivers that gear to each tournament in advance. ""I have to pack everything else: golf clothes, pro-am party dresses, workout gear, clubs, practice tools, etc.,"" she wrote in an e-mail. Her gear adds up: One golf club travel bag, one large suitcase, one carry on and a duffel bag. For good luck, she brings a bag of hair ribbons to match her outfits each day. ""They have to match."" Another key ingredient in her routine is reduced-fat peanut butter, which is hard to find outside the United States. ""I do not leave for a tournament without a jar."" With her peanut butter, plus bread and bananas she buys on the road, she's set with her go-to food of choice. Once aboard, ""I try to sleep as much as possible, drink a lot of water and stretch on the plane,"" she said. ""This helps time pass and also helps me adjust to the time, making jet lag much better."" Travel on the cheap: Five times to go . Eight mistakes weekend travelers make .","Travel isn't as glamorous as you'd think for professional athletes .
Many pack most of their own gear, just like the rest of us .
Team USA water polo captain packs light, doesn't check bags ."

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Halle Berry went to court Tuesday as her young daughter's nanny asked a judge for a restraining order against the 3-year-old's father, saying she feared Gabriel Aubry's ""dangerous and aggressive behavior."" Alliance Kambem, who has been Nahla's nanny since June, accused Aubry of violently pushing her while she held Nahla in an incident last Wednesday, according to her sworn statement released by the court. A Los Angeles County judge rejected Kambem's request, calling her grounds for a restraining order ""insufficient and speculative."" ""If there are concerns they should be resolved in family court,"" the judge wrote on the denial sheet. ""You can proceed with any personal criminal charges against Mr. Aubry."" Kambem said she filed a police report and ""I believe there is a criminal investigation."" Aubry and his lawyer have not commented on the allegations. Berry's visit to court Tuesday was brief and private. The public is usually not allowed in hearings involving disputes between parents involving children. Kambem's statement, public because it was not part of the family court case, is a rare look at the tensions between Berry and Aubry. The couple's split in April 2010 launched a bitter legal battle that ended a year later with shared custody of their child. The nanny's duties are written into the custody order, she said, . ""I believe that Mr. Aubry resents the court order requiring that he have a nanny, and that his resentment has developed into dangerous and aggressive behavior towards me, particularly when I am in the presence of Nahla,"" Kambem said. ""I am truly fearful he will hurt me and in the process hurt Nahla as well."" Aubry has been ""verbally abusive and aggressive towards me,"" she said. ""He would say things to me like, 'What are you doing here?' 'You are a spy,' 'You report everything I say,' 'You're not even doing your job.' 'Nahla doesn't like you, she doesn't want you here,' an 'I don't need a nanny, I don't want you here,'"" her statement said. Her sworn declaration describes an incident last week when she went to Aubry's apartment in Los Angeles to pick up Nahla. ""As I was opening the door with the key he opened the door from inside,"" she said. ""Nahla was all dressed and ready to go. I again expressed my concern to Mr. Aubry regarding the lack of communication about Nahla."" That's when Aubry began screaming at her, she said. ""While he was screaming at me Nahla reached up her arms to me for me to pick her up, which I did. Nahla put her head on my shoulder. Mr. Aubrey violently pushed me, while I had Nahla in my arms, against both my shoulders with both of his hands,"" she said. She noted that Aubry is 11 inches taller than her. ""I was thrown in to the wall behind me while still holding Nahla,"" she said. ""I was terrified. The push was so forceful that if there had not been a wall behind me to stop the force of my movement I would have fallen down with Nahla in my arms. He then slammed the door. I got away with Nahla as quickly as I could."" Kambem's statement also described clashes with Aubry in Spain where Berry was shooting a movie last September. ""While there, for a week consistently, every time Nahla would be playing on the floor with me, he would walk over and violently grab/take Nahla away from me,"" she said. ""In the night, I would hear Nahla crying and asking for me, but he would not let Nahla come to me, nor me to her. He repeatedly told me to 'Shut up,' and that 'I didn't know anything' and other degrading remarks.""","Judge rejects nanny's request for restraining order against Gabriel Aubry .

"(CNN) -- Brad Pitt clearly has a great deal going on. Between being dad to six children, a fiancÃ©, an activist and a perfume pitchman, he still manages to squeeze in some time acting. The movie star recently sat down with ""Showbiz Tonight's"" A.J. Hammer to talk about his latest project, the mob film ""Killing Them Softly,"" and that nagging question of when he plans to marry partner Angelina Jolie. A.J. Hammer: Brad, we've got a mob movie and I believe the first one we've seen that has political campaign speeches throughout it. Brad Pitt: I like to mix it up. Hammer: Was this -- for you -- as much about making a mob movie as it was about sending a political message? Pitt: This is a good friend of mine, the writer and director, Andrew Dominik, he's from Australia, and his view of America was very interesting to me. His feeling in some way oppressed and that we get caught up in trying to sell the idea that the image is more important than the actual substance. This is what he was trying to tell with this story. He finds this book about a crime syndicate, and he makes these comparisons to -- not politics, per se, or not just politics, but ... the financial crisis itself, and it was a good subject matter. Hammer: I know, and timely! The idea of the mob dealing with corporate concerns or falling off a fiscal cliff. How timely is that coming off this political season? Pitt: Absolutely! And how much are we really dealing with -- the issue's always at the image of the issue, and oftentimes, a scapegoat is found, but it's not really solved. This is what our film is about. It's about get the games going again, get the perception that the machine's running again so everyone can feel confident, have market confidence and get on with the game. Hammer: I want to ask you specifically ... about an issue that's been at the forefront for you and Angelina, and that is the issue of marriage equality. That is something that you guys have obviously done a phenomenal job moving forward and getting the message out about what should be done. You've talked about perception versus what happens in reality sometimes. When and why did that become so important to you guys? Pitt: It's one of our last big issues of equality. What makes this nation great is our freedoms and the idea of equality, the true idea of equality -- and in that definition, there's a certain faction of our society that is not being included. And that time ... it's time! Yeah, it's time. Hammer: You guys have once famously said you would hold off on getting married until everybody could get married. And I know now you're engaged. You said you're doing it for the kids, which obviously everybody's excited about. Pitt: And ourselves, but they prompted it. Hammer: Are they pressuring you at all to set a date? Are they getting on you about this? Pitt: No, not necessarily. Hammer: Do you think it's something you'll make public? Because obviously there's a huge interest, demand, people want to feel like they're a part when you guys actually get married. Pitt: We don't know. We haven't gotten that far yet. Hammer: You cannot turn on the TV without seeing the Chanel ad. Obviously, Brad, you know that got such a huge reaction. Did you get a kick out of the reaction? Pitt: I say fair play! Hammer: Absolutely. I say they got their money's worth. I mean, the number of times it got played from people talking about it. Pitt: You know, I'm not a part of that side of the marketing, but fair play! Hammer: Last thing: I want to flash back. We're going to have a little fun. I just want you to take a quick look at this guy here. (Pitt watched clip of himself from ""Thelma and Louise."") Pitt: Was that? Really? I don't even recognize that guy! Was this -- what year? Hammer: You had just gotten out to California maybe six months prior. What advice would this guy in the chair across from me give that guy there? Pitt: I think that guy did all right. I think he figured it out quite fine. I don't think I need to tell him much.","Brad Pitt plays a mob enforcer in his new film, ""Killing Them Softly""

"(CNN) -- It seems today that a new stage of life has opened up. Sociologists call it ""emergent adulthood,"" Time magazine termed it ""the Twixter years,"" and author Kay Hymowitz referred to it as ""pre-adulthood.""

They bounce from job to job and relationship to relationship, live with parents at home or in a house with five friends, watch ESPN and play video games (the boy-men) and read ""Twilight"" and ponder whether he's just not into you (the girl-women), while all of them sprinkle ""like"" and ""'n stuff"" and ""ya know"" in their speech. Adolescence used to be a condition you escaped as soon as you could, but these 20-somethings want to prolong it. We need to counteract them, to restore embarrassment to adolescent habits, and books are a key weapon. After all, books have the power to fortify attitudes. For instance, the ""Harry Potter"" books, a wonderful phenomenon for tweens and early-teens, offered so compelling a world of heroic, beset youth and hostile adults that readers clung to Harry well past the proper age. In fact, quidditch matches have spread to more than 200 college campuses. ""Twilight"" has had a similar impact, intensifying the ordinary shenanigans of teenagers to luridly high melodrama. Why grow up when adolescence contains so much romance and suspense? Clinging to such young adult fantasies, pre-adults think that grownup content is a sensation, like ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" a book so poorly written as to be beyond parody. Only a 14-year-old sensibility could read this passage when Miss Steele first encounters Christian without laughing at the witlessness of the words. I open the door and stumble through, tripping over my own feet and falling headfirst into the office. Double crap -- me and my two left feet! I am on my hands and knees in the doorway to Mr. Grey's office, and gentle hands are around me, helping me to stand. I am so embarrassed, damn my clumsiness. I have to steel myself to glance up. Holy cow --he's so young. Now, who trips over her own feet and falls headfirst to the floor? And the callowness of ""Double crap"" and ""Holy cow"" couldn't be more phony. Young women loved it, though. And so did many older women, apparently. This is bad for our 20-year-olds and bad for our culture. Let us hope, then, that 2013 will unveil a new book about the young, but one that halts the creep of adolescence into adulthood. Yes, there are several superb recent novels about teens and 20-somethings by talented writers, like Jeffrey Eugenides' ""The Marriage Plot"" and Gary Shteyngart's ""Super Sad True Love Story."" But they have too much sympathy for the emerging adult, too much understanding of young love and companionship, to do the work of correction. It will take an altogether different book to explode extended adolescence; specifically, a frolicking comic novel that submits the interests and longings of pre-adults to whimsy, burlesque and farce. Not gentle humor, but all-out comedy or satire that casts the whole experience and habitat of pre-adults as both ludicrous and avoidable. Not trite pratfalls that, supposedly, make the characters lovable inept and self-involved, but outrageous (and hilarious) situations such as those in Kingsley Amis' ""Lucky Jim"" and Philip Roth's ""Portnoy's Complaint."" Not sensitive and self-aware individuals coping with circumstances that afflict their whole age group, but memorable eccentrics like Ignatius J. Reilly from ""A Confederacy of Dunces,"" whose disdain for all things contemporary highlights the virtues and vices of modern life. This comic novel will amuse and sell well, for the better elements of our culture and our youth have grown impatient with the travails and aggrandizing of Twixter books, movies, music and TV. It will serve a larger purpose, too, the same one that motivated satirists from Aristophanes and Juvenal to Swift and Pope to Mark Twain and the creators of ""Dr. Strangelove"": to curb self-indulgence, deflate pretense, and expel stupidity. To take down a popular genre or a representative figure or a trendy pose, one good belly laugh works better than pages of strict criticism. H.L. Mencken chided middle-American backwardness at length, but his best weapon was a one-word comic label: the ""booboisie."" After Sarah Palin's nomination to the 2008 Republican ticket, intellectuals on the left attacked and on the right fretted, but the surest demolition came at the hands of Tina Fey's impersonation. When the catastrophe movies of the 1970s became too theatrical and clichÃ©d, the film ""Airplane!"" appeared and one could no longer watch the genre with a straight face. Let's have a comic novel do the same for emergent adulthood. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Bauerlein.","Mark Bauerlein: Today's 20-somethings want to stretch out their adolescence .

"(CNN) -- On the eve of a protest expected in Amman Friday, Jordan's king has dissolved the country's parliament and called for early elections close to the new year. This isn't the first time King Abdullah II has responded pre-emptively to a possible Arab Spring-inspired demonstration in the country. But it could foreshadow the seriousness of the rally, which is likely to echo the push for democratic reforms that have swept North Africa and the Middle East. Popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya ousted longtime leaders from power. In nearly two years, King Abdullah has fired four prime ministers. In February 2011, shortly before Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down following weeks of intense protest, Abdullah dismissed his government and appointed a new prime minister. The king ordered Marouf al-Bakhit to make ""genuine political reform,"" the country's royal court reported. The government, the king then promised, would ""take practical steps, quick and concrete, to launch a process of genuine political reform"" and ""comprehensive development,"" according to a letter from the king to al-Bakhit. The government would act to strengthen democracy, the letter said. New prime ministers were subsequently appointed in October of 2011 and May of 2012. On Thursday, government spokesman Samih al-Maitah framed the king's latest decision as a move he was planning as a part of his promised reforms. ""This was not a surprise decision,"" al-Maitah said. Parliamentary elections will be held, at the latest, early next year and will be overseen by an independent commission, the spokesman added. The parliament was elected almost two years ago. Several protests calling for change have been held in Jordan in the past year. Thousands protest for political change in Jordan . The Muslim Brotherhood is organizing Friday's protest. The religious and political group -- which was started in 1928 and counts Egypt's new president, Mohammed Morsy, as a member -- believes Islam is not simply a religion but a way of life. It advocates a move away from secularism and a return to the rules of the Quran as a basis for healthy families, communities, and states. The Brotherhood has repeatedly called for political reform in Jordan. A Brotherhood representative told CNN that a large group is expected to gather Friday afternoon and march from the Hussein mosque to Palm Square downtown. Loyalists to the king told reporters that, to keep the peace, they would not hold a counter-demonstration as originally planned. ""It's been expected to have the parliament dissolved by the king,"" said Nimer Assaf, the deputy general secretary of the Islamic Action Front, the Brotherhood's political wing. ""As far as we are concerned this is not the right step forward."" There should be democratic election law reform and ""real"" changes to Jordan's constitution, he said. Parliament should have the right to dissolve itself, he said, and the prime minister should be elected by the public. ""Through that we can fight corruption, which is really high in Jordan,"" he said. CNN's Kareem Khadder contributed to this report.","King Abdullah dissolves parliament Thursday; protests are expected in Amman Friday .

"(CNN) -- Police in Boise, Idaho, said late Monday that they have made an arrest in connection with a break-in at a local zoo and the death of a patas monkey there. Michael J. Watkins, 22, faces two felony charges, burglary and grand theft. ""I speak for many of us in the police department and the community who were angered and outraged over this senseless crime,"" said Boise Police Chief Michael Masterson. ""As usual, it was a combination of a citizen tip and good police work that led us to the arrest in this case."" Police were called to Zoo Boise early Saturday morning by a guard who reported a burglary in progress. The security guard saw two men, one inside the zoo and one outside. They ran. During an unsuccessful search for the man inside the zoo, police and zoo employees found a patas monkey that was seriously injured near an exhibit where the suspect was last seen. The animal died; the cause of death was determined to be blunt force trauma to the head and neck. Following citizen tips and information gleaned from the investigation, police arrested Watkins in Washington County, Idaho, where he remains in custody. He has injuries on his upper torso, but police have not yet been able to determine the cause of those injuries, Masterson said. The police chief declined to speculate on the suspect's motives. He said he does not expect the other man the guard saw at the zoo to be criminally charged. Zoo Boise still has one patas monkey that the staff is giving extra attention in the wake of the other's death. ""For the short time, he is OK being by himself, but that's not a long-term solution. Monkeys need to be housed in social groups, and so ... we are actively trying to find another patas monkey that we might be able to bring the zoo,"" said Steve Burns, the zoo's director. He said members of his staff were confused and angry when he first told them what happened. ""They kept asking why and I didn't have an answer for them,"" he said. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","Michael J. Watkins, 22, faces two felony charges, burglary and grand theft .

"(Rolling Stone) -- It didn't take long for everyone involved in the Rebecca Black story to start squabbling. Black -- whose song ""Friday"" hit Number 38 on Billboard's digital singles chart this week -- and her mother, Georgina Marquez Kelly, are accusing Ark Music Factory, which produced ""Friday,"" of copyright infringement and unlawful exploitation of publicity rights. A March 29 letter from Black and Marquez Kelly's lawyer Brian Schall to Ark Music Factory obtained by Rolling Stone alleges that Ark has failed to provide Black with the master recordings of her song and video; has been exploiting her likeness and her song on YouTube, iTunes, Amazon and Ark's website; created an unauthorized ""Friday"" ringtone; and has been advertising Black as an exclusive Ark recording artist on its website. Rob Sheffield: Why Rebecca Black is a Demon-Wizard Child Piper . In an interview with Rolling Stone, Ark Music Factory founder Patrice Wilson denied most of the allegations in the letter. ""I have met with Rebecca Black's mom and everything is fine,"" he said. ""She will get the masters and the song. They can have it all."" Marquez Kelly paid Ark $4,000 (not $2,000, as has been widely reported) to produce the song, and according to Schall's letter, the agreement that she signed with Ark in November stipulates that Black has 100 percent ownership and control of ""Friday,"" including the master recording and the music video. Black shot the video for ""Friday"" in January, and the Ark team finished it a few weeks later. It was uploaded to YouTube on February 10, but it only had around 4,000 views until it was posted on comedian Daniel Tosh's ""Tosh.O"" Comedy Central blog on March 11, and comedian Michael J. Nelson tweeted about it. Overnight, it had gotten over 200,000 views, and by March 15, it had over 5 million views on YouTube. And after her ""Good Morning America"" appearance on March 18, she had evolved from a meme to a celebrity. What You Need to Know About Teen Viral Phenom Rebecca Black . ""She's not our exclusive artist,"" said Wilson. ""Once an artist meets with us and once they blow up, they have a choice to retain us or move on if they can. Rebecca is now signed with someone else."" Wilson added that he will remove Black from the Ark Music Factory website. But Ark's lawyer, Barry Rothman, cast doubt on the validity of the November agreement. ""The agreement was not court-approved,"" Rothman said. ""They say they own the composition. Nothing could be further from the truth. If they go forward and license it or attempt to copyright it in their name, that would be copyright infringement and we'd act accordingly under the circumstances."" He added: ""We're not prepared to engage them in producing documents just because they want them, without a court order or litigation. We'd like to see Rebecca Black's career go forward and we're trying to accomplish that in the context of working through the legalities."" Wilson's Ark Music Factory partner Clarence Jey contended that Ark did act as a record label for Black, and distributed and promoted her with her mother's consent -- until it became clear that Black was going to make actual money. ""Now they are turning it around and saying they were exploited, but clearly that is not the case when they were thanking me for forwarding them all the interviews with Rebecca and all the positive comments from YouTube,"" said Jey. ""I was calling Australia on my cell phone pretending to be Rebecca's agent and setting up radio interviews for Rebecca while Georgina was right next to me. If she thought I was exploiting this, she could have said it."" Why Rebecca Black's Much-Mocked Viral Hit 'Friday' is Actually Good . ""Georgina's trying to get the rights to things she doesn't have the rights to,"" said Ark Creative Director Barry Wayne. Neither Marquez Kelly nor Schall returned calls for comment. Black is the first real success to come out of the Los Angeles-based Ark, whose website was registered in August 2010 by Wilson. Ark's biggest successes other than Black are the singer Alana Lee Hamilton's ""Butterflies,"" which has close to 6 million YouTube views, and Kaya Rosenthal's ""Can't Get You Out of My Mind,"" which has 1.7 million YouTube views. ""Suddenly, everyone is seeing big dollars and everyone is getting greedy and it sucks,"" said Jey, who claims that his team wrote the music and lyrics to ""Friday."" ""My team just needs to be looked after to some extent. They need to be compensated for something."" He argued that Black should own the master recording for her vocals, but that Ark should have copyright for the song and composition. ""We gave Rebecca 10 percent of the publishing, but she didn't even write a lyric. ""Good Morning America"" came over, I paid $400 for the make up artist and no one even thanked me for that."" And now it seems as though Ark's success may be its undoing. Wilson recently hired his own lawyer, and Jey alleges that Wilson won't give him access to the website. ""Yesterday we were supposed to have a meeting at my attorney's place. I didn't hear from him all day. He sent me a text message late at night saying, 'Sorry, brother, I've had a busy day.' In the meantime he's going around saying I'm not with Ark."" Copyright © 2011 Rolling Stone.","Marquez Kelly paid Ark $4,000 to produce the song .

"(CNN) -- The condition of Lana Kuykendall, the South Carolina woman infected with flesh-eating bacteria shortly after giving birth to twins nearly two months ago, is improving, her doctor said Friday. ""Her leg wounds are healing well, and she's making excellent headway on therapy,"" said Dr. Kevin Kopera, medical director for Roger C. Peace Rehabilitation Hospital in Greenville. The recovery for such infections typically requires four to six weeks of inpatient rehabilitation, followed by weeks of outpatient rehabilitation, he said. ""Her strength continues to improve daily,"" husband Darren said in a news release. He said she can walk up to 50 feet at a time with a walker. His wife undergoes physical and occupational therapy twice daily, her tracheotomy device has been removed, and she can speak normally, the release said. The 36-year-old mother's occupational therapy includes diapering and lifting a doll, and she can spend several hours per day with twins Abigail and Ian. Kuykendall was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis on May 11, four days after giving birth, and taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital. She has undergone 20 surgical procedures, including skin grafts. But she did not require any amputations, as recently occurred in the case of 24-year-old Aimee Copeland of Georgia, who lost her hands, a leg and a foot as a result of the infection. Kuykendall was moved last week to the rehabilitation hospital, where she was in good condition, hospital officials said. But she faces a long rehabilitation, said Dr. Bill Kelly, hospital epidemiologist for Greenville Hospital System, last week. Kuykendall, a paramedic, went to the hospital after noticing a rapidly expanding bruise on her leg, her husband, a firefighter, said last month. A variety of the bacteria, which are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections, can cause the disease. When they enter the bloodstream -- as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ridding the body of the bacteria. The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal in about 20% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimated that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise because doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities.","""Her leg wounds are healing well,"" says the rehab hospital's medical director .

"(CNN) -- Thousands of children in England have been sexually exploited by gangs or groups of men or are at high risk of sexual exploitation, according to a report released Wednesday. The report, which calls for urgent action to protect young people, comes amid wide public concern prompted by revelations of child abuse by a former BBC TV presenter, Jimmy Savile. Read more: Belittling kids as harmful as beating, study finds . There were 2,409 victims of child sexual exploitation in gangs or groups from August 2010 to October 2011, the inquiry by the Office of the Children's Commissioner found.

In a high-profile court case earlier this year, nine men were jailed for ""grooming,"" sexually abusing and raping five girls, one of them only 13, in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. The men were all of Asian origin and the girls were white, prompting questions over whether the perpetrators' ethnic origin was a factor in their actions or in the failure of local authorities to uncover the child abuse ring sooner. Read more: Retired bishop, priest arrested on child sex abuse charges . The report suggests better record-keeping is needed in order for the ethnicity of perpetrators in gangs, many of whom are never arrested or convicted for sexually exploiting minors, to be tracked. The victims come from a range of ethnic backgrounds but 28% are from black or minority backgrounds -- higher than previously thought, the report says. Of the 2,409 victims reported to the inquiry, 155 were identified as also being perpetrators of child sexual exploitation, in what the report describes as a ""deeply troubling"" overlap. Read more: Ex-Scout tells of abuse at hands of TV presenter Jimmy Savile . Atkinson, the Children's Commissioner for England, urged people to look out for the signs of sexual exploitation in young people around them. ""Each and every one of us owes it to all victims to be vigilant, to listen and to act to stop the sexual exploitation of children,"" she said. The report's list of warning signs includes children going missing from home, care homes or school; repeated sexually transmitted infections; committing crimes; misuse of drugs or alcohol; self harm and other physical injuries. Alastair Campbell: Despite its failings and our past clashes, I back BBC . The issue of child sexual exploitation is in the forefront of many people's minds following wide UK media coverage of a series of scandals. The furor erupted several weeks ago with the claims against Savile, who died last year but who police now believe sexually abused as many as 300 young women and girls, sometimes on BBC premises, in past decades. Two other men have been arrested in connection with the investigation. Read more: Police probe hospital abuse claims against TV host Jimmy Savile . Also in the past month, a BBC program looking into historic sex abuse allegations at children's homes in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s alleged that a Conservative, Thatcher-era politician, whom it did not name, had been among the children's abusers. Internet speculation over who that politician might be led to Lord McAlpine being falsely identified via Twitter. He is now planning multiple libel suits, and the BBC has already settled. A number of government inquiries have been launched as a result of questions over how past allegations were handled.

"(CNN) -- One of the founding members of Los Zetas, a ruthless Mexican drug cartel that began as a group of army deserters hired by a drug lord, has been sentenced to 35 years in prison, the federal attorney general's office said. Jaime Gonzalez Duran was in the upper echelons of the Zetas leadership and is one of the biggest captures authorities have made against that group. A judge in Tamaulipas state convicted Gonzalez of organized crime and kidnapping and handed down the sentence, which includes a fine equivalent to 2,251 days of minimum wage, the attorney general's office said. It is the third sentence against Gonzalez. In 2010, two other courts sent him to prison for 21 and 16 years. Federal police arrested Gonzalez in November 2008 in Reynosa, Tamaulipas. He had in his possession $150,000 and a military-grade weapon, the attorney general's office said. Before his arrest, he was a bodyguard and hit man for the leader of the Gulf cartel, the office said. The Zetas have since split off from the Gulf cartel and operate as their own cartel. Three others were sentenced alongside Gonzalez, prosecutors said Thursday. Benito Pena Gutierrez and Anselmo Rivera Alonso, both former police officers in the town of Guadalupe in the state of Nuevo Leon, were sentenced to 25 years for the kidnappings of four federal agents in 2007.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- More than 30 people have been shot dead in Nigeria, the head of Amnesty International said Friday, only a day after the rights group accused Nigerian security forces of committing serious abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant Islamist group Boko Haram in the region. The latest deaths occurred in the town of Maiduguri, in Borno state, which has been the scene of much of the violence as Boko Haram seeks to impose a strict version of Sharia law in the Muslim-dominated northern part of the country. Amnesty International Secretary General Salil Shetty said: ""We have certainly confirmed from our contacts that over 30 people have been killed -- summary executions, we understand; bodies found in the morgue."" Witnesses told Amnesty and CNN that security forces from the Joint Task Force, or military, carried out the killings. Opinion: Nigeria is a sinking ship, but we must not desert it . ""These are not isolated examples -- it's happening all the time,"" Shetty added. ""Ordinary citizens are simply caught in the crossfire."" Shetty appealed for the government to ensure the rule of law was followed by its own forces in tackling the militant groups. ""There's no way in which we can improve the security situation in the north, which we all want ... by increasing insecurity,"" he said. ""We cannot improve human rights by taking people's lives and for security forces to be themselves beyond the pale of the law is just simply unacceptable."" Lt. Col. Sagir Musa, a spokesman for the Joint Task Force, told CNN that the reported killings are under investigation. ""JTF doesn't condone or encourage infractions or indiscipline and where that happens we immediately visit sanctions accordingly,"" Musa said. Read more: Why Nigerians are no longer content with 'suffering and smiling' Meanwhile, the military blamed Boko Haram for killing retired Major Gen. Muhammadu Shuwa and a guest in Maiduguri Friday. Four gunmen entered Gen. Shuwa's house and opened fire on him and his guests, Nigerian military spokesman Lt. Col. Sagir Musa said in a statement. Nigerian troops located in the area immediately cordoned off the area and are searching for the assailants, he said. In its report Thursday, Amnesty International condemned the increasingly brutal attacks carried out by Boko Haram since 2009, but said Nigeria's security forces ""have perpetrated serious human rights violations"" in their response. Opinion: Could it finally be springtime for Nigeria? ""Hundreds of people accused of links to Boko Haram have been arbitrarily detained without charge or trial; others have been extrajudicially executed or subjected to enforced disappearance,"" the report said. ""At the same time, the Nigerian government has failed to adequately prevent or investigate the attacks or to bring perpetrators to justice; and victims have not received prompt and adequate reparation and remedy. ""The cycle of attacks and counterattacks has been marked by unlawful violence on both sides with devastating consequences for the human rights of the people trapped in the middle."" Read more: Facebook 'stalkers' face trial for model's murder . A spokesman for the Nigerian military, Col. Mohammed Yerima, rejected the allegations made in Thursday's report. ""We sincerely disagree with the report released by Amnesty International,"" he told CNN. ""We believe that their statistical data is unfounded. They didn't interview anybody from Boko Haram, and they didn't interview us; they seemed to have just spoken to people on the street."" He also dismissed allegations made in the report that the military participated in extrajudicial killings of suspects or used torture during interrogations. ""We deny that. What would we gain from killing people like that? We don't torture, we interrogate. If they are found not to be members of Boko Haram, we release them immediately, take them back to where we picked them up and we apologize,"" he said. Amnesty International said it had shared its findings with the Nigerian authorities before it published the report, as well as requesting further information on certain cases, but that it had received no response.

"(CNN) -- A group of more than 100 prominent Christians ranging from evangelical minister Jim Wallis on the political left to Nixon White House aide Chuck Colson on the right released a document Thursday calling for an end to the fight club tone of the national political discourse. Called the ""Civility Covenant,"" the document says that churches have too often ""reflected the political divisions of our culture rather than the unity we have in the body of Christ."" ""Members of Congress have been calling me saying 'It's never been as bad as it is now, but we can't do much about it because we're not credible to a lot of Americans,'"" said Wallis, who leads the progressive group Sojourners. ""They said to the faith community, 'please help us.'"" Wallis said the covenant is the result of those conversations. It has 114 signatories from a broad swath of Christian traditions, including the president of the National Association of Evangelicals, the head of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and the general superintendent of the Assemblies of God, a major Pentecostal denomination. The list also includes plenty of strange political bedfellows, from conservative Christian leaders like Harry Jackson -- who led the unsuccessful fight against gay marriage in Washington -- to Morna Murray, president of the progressive Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, which is close to the Obama White House. ""Anytime you have a document with Wallis and Colson signing, you're talking about a pretty unusual situation and a pretty significant marker,"" said John Green, an expert on religion and politics at the University of Akron in Ohio. ""It shows that there are some issues that transcend politics and ideology."" Quoting the New Testament, the new covenant urges Christians to ""put away from you all bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander, together with all malice, and be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ has forgiven you."" ""We owe a certain responsibility to each other as believers,"" said Colson, an influential evangelical Christian voice. ""This doesn't mean I haven't challenged some people's theology. But the document says we're not going to challenge each other's motives or engage in ad hominem attacks."" Wallis, who led the effort to draft the document and collect signatures for it, noted that the document comes at a time when members of Congress are complaining of physical threats against them because of their positions on the health care bill, which President Obama signed into law Tuesday. Wallis says he'll start collecting signatures from more pastors and rank-and-file churchgoers in coming weeks. The pastor publicly feuded with conservative television host Glenn Beck this month after Beck encouraged his fans to leave churches that preach economic and social justice. Wallis organized a boycott of Beck's show but says the timing of the covenant's release is incidental. Colson said the document ""wouldn't apply to Glenn Beck because we're talking about the conversation in the family of believers ... Glenn Beck is a Mormon."" Many Christians don't consider Mormons -- members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints -- to be Christians, though Mormons consider themselves Christian. The covenant is the latest in a series of faith-based efforts to soften the public discourse. Prominent evangelical PR executive Mark DeMoss, a conservative, and former Bill Clinton aide Lanny Davis launched the Civility Project last year.","Jim Wallis, Chuck Colson release a document calling for civil political discourse .

"(CNN) -- College basketball has a new record holder for most points in a game. Last week, Jack Taylor, a 5-foot, 10-inch guard at Iowa's Grinnell College, scored 138 points to lead Grinnell to a 179-104 blowout win over Faith Baptist Bible College, a nearby Iowa college. In setting his scoring record, Taylor made 52 of 108 shots from the field, including 27 of 71 three-point attempts and shot 7 for 10 from the foul line. Taylor's coach and teammates were happy to see him go all out. In the 36 minutes he played, Taylor did not have a single assist. Virtually every time he got the ball, he shot it. Taylor is not the first basketball player to go on such an outsized scoring spree. On February 2, 1954, Bevo Francis, playing for tiny Rio Grande College in Ohio, scored 113 points against Hillsdale College of Michigan. Francis made 38 of 70 shots and hit on 37 free throws in a game that ended with a 134-91 Rio Grande victory. Eleven days after Francis set his record, Frank Selvy of Furman College in South Carolina poured in 100 points in a 149-95 victory over Newberry College. No Division 1 player has ever done as well against a four-year college. Selvy, who finished his senior year with a 41.7 scoring average, had a spectacular shooting night, hitting 41 of 66 field goal attempts and 18 of 22 free throws. In the National Basketball Association, the scoring record belongs to the Philadelphia Warriors' Wilt Chamberlain. Fifty years ago, Chamberlain put up 100 points in a March 2, 1962, game against the New York Knicks, who were missing their starting center. Chamberlain, who at 7-foot-1 towered over his opponents, was never much of an outside shooter, but his ""Dipper Dunk"" was all he needed. He was unstoppable anywhere near the basket. Taylor's scoring feat is, nonetheless, different from that of the others. They were playing in games in which their opponent was outclassed but still in their league. That was not the case in the Grinnell game. Grinnell is, to be sure, a small college, but Grinnell is far from any small college. Like a series of elite Midwestern schools -- Kenyon, Oberlin, Carleton, Macalester -- Grinnell has an enormous endowment, a superb faculty and a national reputation. Faith Baptist Bible College's situation is very different. In contrast to Grinnell, which lists its undergraduate enrollment at 1,693, Faith Baptist Bible has just 302 undergraduates, and when it comes to endowment and facilities, the gap between the two colleges is even greater. Grinnell has an endowment of more than $1.5 billion and charges $41,004 in tuition and fees. All that Faith Baptist Bible College charges $14,478 in tuition and fees, and its endowment is listed in the U.S. News Best College report as N/A (not available). Jack Taylor's scoring binge came against a college that doesn't come close to having his college's resources. What the basketball players at Faith Baptist Bible College must be feeling about losing by 75 points doesn't seem to have entered anyone's head at Grinnell or in the media, which couldn't get enough of Taylor in the days following his scoring feat. Reporters barely mentioned the 70 points that Faith sophomore David Larson totaled in a losing cause. I grew up in the Middle West playing basketball at a prep school that often competed against tiny rural high schools to get ready for our games in an interstate league. When it came to running up the score, there was a code our coaches enforced. With a big lead, we slowed the game down. We stopped taking long shots that would get our supporters cheering, and with the game in hand, we brought in the second team, and after them, anyone still on the bench. When we left the gym, we wanted the other team to feel good about having played us. We didn't want their players hanging their heads in embarrassment, especially if we had a game scheduled with them for the following year. We knew these unspoken rules by 16. How could college players not know as much as we did as teenagers? Maybe it's the times. But I wish that the Grinnell players had had my old coach, who doubled as my math teacher. Coach would have made their ears burn for showing up an opponent as they did. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nicolaus Mills.","A Grinnell College player broke the record for most points in a game, with 138 .

"(CNN) -- From the Affordable Care Act to flesh-eating bacteria to celebrities and elected officials battling physical and mental illness, it's been a tumultuous year for all things health. Here is a look at the top 10 health stories of 2012, as chosen by the CNN Health staff. 1. Affordable Care Act upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court . In a 5-4 decision, the nation's highest court upheld the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, on June 28. Signed into law in March 2010, the sweeping law includes more than 90 specific changes to the nation's health care system. Some went into effect almost immediately, but the most dramatic changes won't take effect until 2014. What Obama's re-election means for health care . 2. Georgia woman's battle with flesh-eating bacteria . Aimee Copeland, a then-24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student, was visiting the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta, with friends when the homemade zip line she was holding snapped. She fell and got a gash in her leg that required 22 staples to close. But Copeland's struggles were only beginning. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis, an infection caused by the flesh-eating bacteria Aeromonas hyrophila. Copeland spent two months in an Augusta, Georgia, hospital, and doctors amputated her hands, leg and foot. She returned home in August to a 1,956-foot wing specially built for her. Video: Bacteria survivor details recovery . 3. Multi-state meningitis oubreak linked to steroid injections . A 19-state outbreak of non-contagious fungal meningitis sickened 620 people and killed 39, according to the latest update from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The cases were linked to tainted steroid injections distributed by the Massachusetts-based New England Compounding Center. ""Several patients suffered strokes that are believed to have resulted from their infections,"" the CDC said. ""The investigation also includes other infections from injections in a peripheral joint, such as a knee, shoulder or ankle."" The FDA said the compounding center was warned by its own environmental monitors of bacterial contamination of its facility months before the first cases were reported. The Massachusetts Board of Registration in Pharmacy voted to permanently revoke its license to operate in the state as well as the licenses of the company's three principal pharmacists. Owner of firm linked to deadly meningitis outbreak takes Fifth before Congress . 4. West Nile Virus outbreak . While the case count of West Nile Virus illnesses was the highest reported through August 2012, this year's outbreak wound up falling short of levels seen in 2003, the worst-ever year for the virus. The year's last update from the CDC showed a total of 5,387 cases of West Nile Virus and 243 deaths. Cases were reported in all lower 48 states, as well as the District of Columbia. In 2003, 9,862 illnesses and 264 deaths were reported. Texas was by far the hardest-hit state in 2012, with 954 cases and 76 deaths. Fast facts on West Nile Virus . 5. Robin Roberts' bone marrow transplant . ""Good Morning America"" host Robin Roberts, 51, revealed in June that after overcoming breast cancer, she was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome. Roberts found a bone marrow match in her sister, Sally-Ann. Twenty-one days after undergoing a bone marrow transplant, Roberts was discharged from the hospital in October. ""I know it is your prayers and warm thoughts that have gotten me this far,"" she wrote in a post on ""GMA's"" website to her fans. ""Each day I get stronger and stronger ... (E)ven in some dark moment, of which there are still a few, I now see that light at the end of the tunnel. This too really shall pass."" Robin Roberts feels the love on 'new birthday' 6. Hantavirus at Yosemite . Warnings were sent to Yosemite National Park visitors from 39 other countries in September after a potentially deadly hantavirus sickened some visitors to the park. In all, eight people were infected and three died. Most became ill after staying at the park's popular Curry Village ""tent cabins."" The carriers of hantavirus are deer mice, cotton mice, rice rats and white-footed mice, according to the CDC. The virus can be present in the rodents' urine, droppings and saliva, and is spread to people when they breathe in air contaminated with the virus. The virus is not communicable from person to person. Another Yosemite camper dies in hantavirus outbreak . 7. Former Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. and bipolar disorder . Jackson, a congressman from Illinois, look a leave of absence in June to be treated for what his office initially called a ""mood disorder."" In August, the Mayo Clinic said he was responding well to treatment for bipolar II disorder. The disorder, less severe than bipolar I, includes periods of depression alternated with hypomania, a mild form of mania that may include elevated mood and irritability. The depression periods usually last longer, the clinic said. Despite winning re-election, Jackson -- who has been the subject of several investigations -- resigned from office in November, citing health reasons. ""For the past several months, as my health has deteriorated, my ability to serve the constituents of my district has continued to diminish,"" he wrote in his resignation letter. Video: Behind Jesse Jackson Jr.'s resignation . 8. Spike in autism cases . The number of children with autism nationwide continues to rise, the CDC announced in March. The agency released its most recent data from 2008, showing that 1 in 88 American children has some form of autism spectrum disorder -- a 78% increase compared to a decade ago. Boys with autism outnumber girls 5 to 1, according to the CDC, which estimates in 54 boys have autism. More children are being diagnoses with autism because of ""better diagnosis, broader diagnosis, better awareness, and roughly 50% of 'we don't know,'"" Mark Roithmayr of the advocacy group Autism Speaks said at the time. With autism, no longer invisible . 9. Actress Kathy Bates' double mastectomy . Actress Kathy Bates underwent a double mastectomy in September after being diagnosed with breast cancer in July, a publicist said. Bates, 64, was nominated for an Emmy for her lead role in the TV drama series ""Harry's Law."" She is best known for winning an Academy Award for Best Actress for the 1991 movie ""Misery."" She battled ovarian cancer eight years ago. ""I don't miss my breasts as much as I miss Harry's Law. ;-) Thanks for all the sweet tweets. Y'all kept me going,"" Bates tweeted after her surgery. Why Kathy Bates kept her cancer private . 10. Ex-hospital worker accused in hepatitis C infections . A man who worked as a traveling medical technician on a contract basis for hospitals in Arizona, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania was arrested in July and accused of spreading hepatitis C, sickening more than 30 people. Authorities allege David Kwiatkowsi, 33, injected himself with syringes of fentanyl, a powerful painkiller, that he stole from patients who were scheduled for surgery. He then filled the syringes with saline and replaced them for use in the medical procedure. ""Instead of receiving the prescribed dose of fentanyl, patients instead received saline tained by Kwiatkowski's infected blood,"" federal prosecutors said. Kwiatkwoski was indicted last month by a federal grand jury in New Hampshire on fraud and product-tampering charges. Controversy surrounds health care contract workers .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods fired Nike to the forefront of the golfing world -- now he could be clubbed away to make room for the new kid on the block. Rory McIlroy's announcement that he will not renew his contract with Titleist and FootJoy parent company Acushnet has accelerated speculation that the Northern Irishman will join Woods at Nike. While Nike has not yet confirmed a move for the 23-year-old, it is expected that the world No. 1 will make the switch in a deal which will net him up to an estimated $20 million a year. Scott: 'McIlroy can dominate like Tiger' In a statement, McIlroy said: ""I would like to thank Wally Uihlein and all of the tour staff and employees at Titleist and FootJoy for everything they have done for me since I turned professional in 2007. ""I have enjoyed five very exciting and successful years with the company and I will always appreciate the contribution Titleist has made in helping me become the player I am today."" McIlroy beats Woods in chaotic 'Duel of Jinsha Lake' McIlroy moved to the top of the rankings earlier this year, finishing top of the PGA Tour money list after winning his second major title, and he leads the European Tour's Race To Dubai standings -- all of which has enhanced his reputation as one of the most desirable brands in the sport. ""We wish Rory all the best,"" said Acushnet CEO Wally Uihlein. ""He has been a great ambassador."" McIlroy's success and lifestyle have made him a firm favorite with golf fans, while his burgeoning romance with tennis ace Caroline Wozniacki has also boosted his profile. But Woods, who joined Nike after turning professional in 1996, propelled the company onto the world stage by taking the sport to a new level. The 14-time major champion now faces a struggle to hang on to his status as Nike's No. 1 client, as McIlroy's success shows no signs of abating. McIlroy and Woods have built up a friendship in recent months, playing a much-hyped 18-hole exhibition match in China on Monday. McIlroy even managed to snatch one of Woods' Nike clubs and take a few practice swings, which did nothing to dampen the speculation. Woods, McIlroy 'too tired' for $7M Chinese tournament . Meanwhile, both men were criticized for their decision not to play this week's HSBC Champions event in China. Seven of the world's top 10 players will be competing for the $1.2 million top prize but the absence of the leading duo has left the sponsors irate. ""I'm very realistic,"" Giles Morgan, the Global Head of Sponsorship and Events for HSBC told the UK Press Association. ""These type of promotional TV events happen and have a benefit for the sport -- the more publicity the better. But what used to happen was that the players would make their schedules around big events and fit in what they could outside them. ""That type of thing is fine, but these are the real test of golf. Outside of America and the UK this is the biggest event of them all. ""What makes this compelling is the strength of the field and it almost feels like they are missing out. This is the flagship event in Asia. ""These guys make their own decisions, but this feels bigger than it ever has before and there will be a great winner.""","Rory McIlroy announces he will not sign new deal with Titleist .

"(Travel+Leisure) -- Mysteries come in many forms: ancient, modern, unsolved and unexplained. But the world's most mysterious buildings are a physical force to be reckoned with. They've become popularized on websites such as abandoned-places.com, weburbanist.com and the granddaddy of them all, atlasobscura.com, an exhaustive user-generated and editor-curated database of the unusual. Our list of mysteries doesn't trot out cliched write-ups of the Bermuda Triangle and the Egyptian pyramids, nor is it promoting the usual suspects of PR-pushed haunted hotels. These peculiar structures are original, lesser-known and often arcane. Mystery, after all, must be authentic. ""In an age where it sometimes seems like there's nothing left to discover, our site is for people who still believe in exploration,"" says Atlas Obscura co-founder Joshua Foer, whose own favorite mysterious buildings include a murder mansion in Los Angeles and an art house in Centralia, Washington. Our definition of mysterious is broad and varied. Some buildings on our list are being eaten alive by the Earth, such as a sand-swallowed lighthouse in Denmark's Jutland and a lava-buried church in the remote highlands of Mexico. Others have design elements that seem to defy logic or were mysteriously abandoned by their people centuries ago. New York's shadowy Renwick Smallpox Hospital has more recent traces of human life -- and an eerie energy that lingers. We've got the photo proof. The world's strangest statues . Renwick Hospital, Roosevelt Island, New York City . This abandoned Smallpox Hospital, replete with granite veneer, corbelled parapets and mansard roofs, is a reminder of Gotham's grisly past. Its 100 hospital beds once hosted quarantined immigrants suffering from the gruesome disease. A $4.5 million restoration project will open Renwick to the public in 2013, kicking off with an art project that includes giant butterflies hovering over the site. Mystery: Renwick is illuminated at night by an anonymous patron, who purportedly has a view of it from an Upper East Side penthouse. Visit: The American Institute of Architects and Classic Harbor Line offer architecture-themed cruises around Manhattan with lectures on Renwick and other mysterious city sites. Loretto Chapel, Santa Fe, New Mexico . The imposing Gothic Revival church's spiral staircase is a woodwork masterpiece that somehow connects the choir loft to the ground-level pews without a central column for stability and with wooden pegs instead of nails. Mystery: Legend has it that an anonymous carpenter built the staircase in 1878 then disappeared without pay. Visit: Just around the corner is La Posada de Santa Fe, a three-story Victorian mansion turned art-stuffed hotel. Suite 100 was the bedroom of previous owner Julia Staab, and her spirit is said to haunt it. Kolmanskop Diamond Camp, Skeleton Coast, Namibia . Bushmen considered Namibia's Skeleton Coast ""The Land God Made in Anger,"" while the Portuguese called it ""The Gates of Hell."" Though the coast received its name because of beached whale bones that scattered its shores during the heyday of the whaling industry, today skeletal remains of more than 1,000 fog-sacked ships and abandoned diamond camps earn it the title. Among the detritus being taken over by desert sands is Minenvewalter, the manager's house at abandoned diamond mine Kolmanskop. Mystery: Diamond miners purportedly haunt Minenvewalter; their ax-pick-punctured skulls were allegedly found here in the 1960s long after the colony departed. Visit: Wilderness Safari's Distinctive Namibia circuit includes lion and cheetah treks in the rusty dunes but also a scenic three-hour flight over the wreck-strewn Skeleton Coast. Skara Brae, Orkney Islands, Scotland . Previously thought to be a Pictish village, this massive and mysterious Orcadian village on the Bay of Skaill is still being excavated -- and changing everything we know about Europe's pre-Celtic era in the process. The 5,000-year-old site predates the Egyptian pyramids. Mystery: Even though the village was deserted thousands of years ago, the buildings at Skara Brae remain in good condition. Archaeologists don't know why the last inhabitants left, although many theorize it was abandoned because of an apocalyptic event. Visit: Hurtigruten's ""In the Wake of the Vikings"" cruise calls on ports in the ancient Orkneys, as well as the Shetlands, Hebrides and Faroes. Woodchester Mansion, Cotswolds, England . Stone gargoyles festoon this 19th-century neo-Gothic mansion topped with turrets and built of iconic honey-colored Cotswold limestone. It was abandoned midconstruction in 1873 after its devoutly Catholic owner died. Seek out the mansion amid a deeply secluded valley for bat tours, Halloween parties and paranormal nights. The world's creepiest attractions . Mystery: During World War II, the house was used as a temporary morgue for Allied troops. Rumors persist of uniform-wearing spirits and 1940s music echoing in the hallways. Visit: Twenty miles away in Cheltenham, the newly opened Ellenborough Park is a gorgeous 16th-century Tudor-style manor with all the posh benefits of your own mansion. Therme Vals, Vals, Switzerland . High in the Swiss Alps at the end of a terminal road in a Romansh-speaking pocket of Canton Graubünden is this stark thermal bath designed by Pritzker laureate Peter Zumthor. Slabs of Valser quartzite create a watery labyrinth that's by turns minimalist and quasi-industrial, but consistently eerie. Mystery: The grottenbad (acoustic chamber) is accessed by a narrow tunnel and allows bathers' vibratos to bounce off the walls, creating a delightfully haunting aural experience. Visit: Earn some soak time in the bath with Country Walkers' self-guided Walk of the Valais and Goms Valley. Yaxchilán, Chiapas, Mexico . This obscure fourth-century site, along the Usumacinta River at the Guatemala border, draped in thick strangler vines and echoing with shrieking howler monkeys, is a tourist-free standout among Mexico's many ruins. Visitors approach by boat, then enter through El Laberinto (The Labyrinth), a limestone building with painted stucco panels and topped with decorative cresterías dedicated to ruler kings such as Moon Skull. Mystery: Yaxchilán was mysteriously deserted in the ninth century, but pilings along each side of the river suggest that it was the site of a sophisticated suspension bridge. Visit: Travel like Mayans, by water, on Mountain Travel Sobek's Chiapas Wildlife Adventure, which includes whitewater-rafting runs along the Rio Santo Domingo and stops at Yaxchilán and other ancient ruins. Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse, Hjørring, Denmark . Jutting out from a desolate dune called Lønstrup Klint (cliff), this ghostly sentinel was built in 1900 but abandoned in 1968 after sands and sea began to devour it whole. The sturdy 75-foot-tall building will likely collapse from shifting sands and coastal erosion in the next decade -- and it makes you wonder what other Viking relics lie beneath the sand. Mystery: The tower was built on a dune-less cliff 656 feet from the sea and nearly 200 feet above sea level, yet, despite rescue attempts, the elements slowly swallowed it over the years. Visit: Twenty miles north is a Danish Modernist country house steps from a more tranquil beach. The world's strangest prisons . San Juan Parangaricutiro, Michoacán, Mexico . In 1943, an explosive volcano in Mexico's remote mountain state of Michoacán began spewing lava, eventually burying the villages of San Juan Parangaricutiro and Paricutín under a coal-black layer of chunky lava. Mystery: The crucifix-topped bell tower of the San Juan Parangaricutiro Church just so happened to be spared from the destructive lava, while the vacated church's altar, at the other end of the church, is also entirely intact. Visit: Abercrombie & Kent's tailor-made Mexican Colonial Splendors trip takes you to the lava-buried site from the Purépecha mountain village of Angahuan, 30 minutes away. Coral Castle, Homestead, Florida . Made from 1,100 tons of limestone boulders -- bigger than those at Stonehenge -- this structure, located just south of Miami, was built from 1923 to 1951 by a single man, a tiny Latvian immigrant named Edward Leedskalnin, as his home and an homage to the love of his life who left him the night before their wedding. Mystery: How did he do it? The jilted man claimed he knew the secret to the pyramids' construction. Other details -- no mortar, precise seams, physics-defying balancing acts -- have also stumped scientists for decades.

"(CNN) -- Facebook is holding a news conference on Tuesday, where it is expected to announce that the company is moving operations to Menlo Park, California. Perhaps no one is more excited to learn of Facebook's plans than the city's mayor. Facebook has reportedly signed a deal with a real estate agency for employees to move into offices in Menlo Park. Facebook is outgrowing its current headquarters near Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. An invitation to a Facebook event next week, set to take place at Menlo Park City Hall, went out to reporters on Friday. Menlo Park Mayor Rich Cline received the same e-mail, with no further explanation. ""I have yet to hear them tell me they're moving here,"" Cline said in an interview Friday afternoon. ""I don't have any documentation signed saying they're moving in here."" A Facebook spokesman told CNN that Tuesday's event set to take place in Menlo Park is ""regarding a campus that will fit our long-term business needs."" Next week's announcement follows talks with city officials and real estate managers that have gone on for months. Discussions between Facebook and Menlo Park officials have been ""extensive,"" Cline said. The move would be a coup for Menlo Park over neighboring Palo Alto. But Cline said he did not try to aggressively appeal to Facebook's decision makers due to a Silicon Valley agreement discouraging attempts to poach high-profile businesses. Whether Facebook will designate Menlo Park as its headquarters or will continue to keep core assets in Palo Alto is unknown. ""They'd love to stay in Palo Alto, and they've indicated that they plan to keep a presence in Palo Alto with a lot of their core engineering,"" said Pat Burt, a Palo Alto council member and former mayor. ""We will miss whatever portion of them that we lose, which will be most of their growth, certainly."" Last summer, Facebook began expressing interest to Palo Alto officials in obtaining more office space there, Burt said. Failing that, the company had to look elsewhere. The location in Menlo Park that Facebook is planning to move into is close to the former offices of technology giant Sun Microsystems, Cline said. Having a hip, affluent tenant could improve the economics in the area's nearby impoverished community and help spark a much-talked-about revival of that section, he said. ""We have the richest of the rich and some of the poorest in the same town,"" Cline said. ""There's a lot of potential for that area to redevelop."" But Cline, who also runs a public relations agency, is tempering his expectations. He joked that Facebook could hold an event at his city hall, and say, ""We brought everybody down to say ... we're staying in Palo Alto!"" ""They've been very careful,"" Cline said. ""Anything can happen in a four-day period.""","Facebook is in talks to relocate its offices from Palo Alto, California, to Menlo Park .

"(CNN) -- On January 1, the nation will commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, which legally freed slaves in the secessionist Southern states. Meanwhile, thousands of theaters will still be presenting the film ""Lincoln,"" portraying the soon-to-be-martyred president's efforts in January 1865 to persuade the House of Representatives to pass the 13th Amendment, outlawing slavery throughout the nation. Coming at a time when many Republicans are seeking to rebrand their party, these commemorations of the first Republican president raise this question: Why not refashion the Grand Old Party in the image of the Great Emancipator? Steven Spielberg's historical drama, as well as the biography upon which it is based, Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln,"" both remind today's Americans that Lincoln was not only a moral leader but also a practical politician. The political identity that Lincoln forged for the fledgling Republican Party -- uniting the nation while defending individual rights -- was a winning formula for half a century, with the GOP winning 11 of 13 presidential elections from 1860 through 1908. Moreover, support for civil rights persisted in the party throughout the last century. Among the Republican presidents of the 20th century, Theodore Roosevelt famously hosted Booker T. Washington at the White House. Dwight Eisenhower ordered federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to enforce school desegregation. Richard Nixon expanded affirmative action. And George H. W. Bush signed the Americans with Disabilities Act into law. Brazile: A turning point for freedom in America, 150 years later . In the U.S. Senate, such prominent Republicans as Edward Brooke of Massachusetts (the first African-American senator since Reconstruction), Jacob Javits of New York and Everett Dirksen of Illinois were strong supporters of civil rights, as were governors such as Nelson Rockefeller in New York, George Romney in Massachusetts and William Scranton in Pennsylvania. Former California Gov. Earl Warren served as chief justice when the Supreme Court issued its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, ordering the desegregation of the nation's schools. As recently as 1996, the Republican national ticket consisted of two strong civil rights advocates, former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole and former New York Rep. Jack Kemp. Unfortunately, by 2012, the Republican Party had veered far from its heritage as the party of Lincoln. Prominent Republicans supported statewide voter suppression laws that hit hardest at vulnerable minorities or called for the ""self-deportation"" of immigrants and their families. While some Republican senatorial nominees needlessly offended women, leading moderates such as Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and Ohio Rep. Steven LaTourette opted for retirement. In what I hope was rock bottom, 38 Senate Republicans rebuffed their former presidential nominee Bob Dole -- a wheelchair-bound war hero -- to block an international civil and human rights treaty for people with disabilities. 150 years later, myths persist about the Emancipation Proclamation . Not surprisingly, the GOP in the presidential race lost the black vote by 87 points, the Asian-American vote by 47 points, the Latino vote by 44 points and the women's vote by 11 points, according to CNN exit polls. As Republicans reflect on their path forward with minority voters and persuadable whites, there are opportunities to advance civil rights. While the GOP has increasingly promoted diverse candidates, it has not yet begun to reflect the values of our diverse nation. Fiscally conservative officeholders can fight for civil and human rights. Just a few years ago, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions championed a reduction in the sentencing disparity between people charged with possession of crack and powder cocaine. These are two forms of the same drug, but crack cocaine is used more by minorities and carried much harsher punishments for possession. Working with Sessions, civil rights advocates pushed to reduce this disparity significantly -- among the greatest advances in criminal justice reform in decades. Looking forward to the 113th Congress, there are several civil rights initiatives that would fit conservative values. They need congressional champions. Conservative lobbyist Grover Norquist and conservative strategist Richard Viguerie have called for criminal justice reforms that would reduce the number of prisoners in U.S. prisons. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has joined the civil rights coalition's call for federal initiatives to narrow the educational achievement gap between minority and white students. And more Republicans are joining Jeb Bush's support for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship for long-term, law-abiding residents. Most importantly, the GOP must embrace one of Lincoln's most enduring legacies, the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed the right to vote regardless of race. The GOP must stop trying to suppress voters and begin to champion electoral reform that shortens lines and helps more people to vote. Opinion: What Obama can learn from Lincoln .

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich cruised to a 5-0 win at Dusseldorf on Saturday to set a new Bundesliga record for most consecutive wins at the start of the season. Two goals from Thomas Muller and one each for Croatia's Mario Mandzukic, Brazil's Luiz Gustavo and Rafina ensured Bayern made it eight wins from eight -- one better than the previous record they held jointly with Mainz, who racked up seven straight wins two seasons ago. Frankfurt continued their chase of the league leaders by beating Hanover 3-1 to register their sixth win of the season. Goals from Algeria midfielder Karim Matmour and German defender Sebastian Jung put Frankfurt 2-0 up inside the opening 20 minutes before Hanover pulled one back through Mohammed Abdellaoue two minutes before the break. But an Alexander Meier header eight minutes from the end means Frankfurt are now five points behind Bayern. Schalke consolidated third place with a 2-1 win at fourth-placed Borussia Dortmund. A volley from Dutch midfielder Ibrahim Afellay put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute before Marco Hoeger doubled the lead three minutes into the second half. Polish striker Robert Lewandowski got one back for Jurgen Klopp's side seven minutes later but an equalizer never materialized. Schalke are now seven points adrift of Bayern while Dortmund now trail the leaders by 12. In Saturday's other games, Freiburg beat Wolfsburg 2-0 while Bayer Leverkusen drew 2-2 with Mainz.","Bayern Munich beat Frankfurt 5-0 to extend 100% start to the Bundesliga season to eight games .

"(CNN) -- A Chinese woman has been sentenced to a year in a labor camp for retweeting a Twitter post that mocked Chinese protesters who smashed Japanese products during a recent demonstration, her fiance said Thursday. On October 17, Cheng Jianping, under the username wangyi09, added a few words to a message written by her fiance, before resending it on Twitter. Eleven days later on the day the couple had planned to marry, Cheng's fiance, Hua Chunhui was taken away by the police from his office in the southeastern city of Wuxi. Although he was released 5 days later, Hua hasn't seen Cheng since. He learned from her family that she was taken away by the police from in front of the couple's apartment on the same day as his arrest. Cheng, 46, was sentenced to one year in a Henan Province labor camp for disturbing social stability. Cheng also has supported imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Liu Xiaobo on Twitter. Hua said that the tweet was simply meant to be satire, with no intention of inciting anti-Japan sentiment. The Twitter message mocked young protesters who smashed Japanese products during a recent demonstration and suggested they smash the Japan Pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo. ""This is ridiculous and a typical case of censorship jail,"" Cheng's lawyer Lan Zhixue said. ""People should not be put in jail due to their sarcastic words."" Lan Zhixue and Hua have appealed Cheng's case to the Henan Provincial Department of Justice and People's Court, asking for medical parole for Cheng, who suffers from high blood pressure. The appeal also asks that she be removed from the labor camp. CNN's Jackie Huang contributed to this report.","Cheng Jianping goes by the Twitter username wangyi09 .

"New York (CNN) -- A furry feline named Willow, who was last seen five years ago in Colorado, was found this week roaming the streets of New York. Country kitty turned metropolitan cat, Willow was discovered by a pedestrian on East 20th Street in Manhattan over the weekend and brought to Animal Care and Control of NYC, according to Julie Bank, the animal shelter's executive director. Willow tested positive for a microchip, and her Colorado owners, Chris and Jamie Squires, were later contacted, according to Bank. ""Willow is in good health, kind of chunky,"" Bank said. ""Clearly she has been taken care of or enjoying the New York City food."" How Willow traveled from Broomfield, Colorado, a suburb of Denver, to New York -- a distance of more than 1,600 miles -- over a span of five years is a mystery. ""Someone maybe picked her up in Colorado and brought her here; sometimes animals get here oddly, like on the back of a truck,"" Bank said. ""Some people are joking that she is a city girl and wanted to see the sights."" Calls to the Squires were not immediately returned. As for Willow, plans are being made for her to reunite with the Squires, Bank said. For now, she will stay with a foster family until health certificates are filed and she can make the journey back home, though perhaps not as memorable as her travels to the Big Apple.","Cat taken to animal shelter, microchip found and owners contacted .

"(CNN) -- Members of the Westboro Baptist Church, known for its radical stance against a myriad of issues including homosexuality and the war in Iraq, said Thursday it will picket Elizabeth Edwards' funeral in Raleigh, North Carolina. Edwards, the estranged wife of Democratic presidential candidate John Edwards, died Tuesday after battling breast cancer. According to the Church's press release, members of the Kansas-based congregation are planning to gather at 12:15 p.m. to rally against Edwards for issues relating to her personal life deemed offensive by the church. The Church -- monitored by anti-hate groups such as the Anti-Defamation league and the Southern Poverty Law Center -- is known for its extremist opposition against homosexuals, Jews and other groups. Westboro members often hold protests against the war in Iraq, many at funerals held for U.S. service members. Led by Pastor Fred Phelps and his family, the church has drawn controversy for targeting soldiers' funerals and asserting that the soldiers' deaths are God's punishment for America's ""sin of homosexuality."" Phelps is the leading patriarch at the Topeka, Kansas-based congregation which is made up mostly of his family. Launched in 1955, Phelps' church and his family have made a name for themselves by showing up at high-profile events, preaching their hate-filled brand of Christianity. They blame homosexuals for the destruction of America. He describes himself as an ""old-time"" gospel preacher who says, ""You can't preach the Bible without preaching the hatred of God."" In 2006, two days before a funeral held in Maryland for a Matt Snyder, a young lance corporal who served in Iraq, members of the Westboro church advertised its intent to appear and picket, prompting a heavy police presence including a SWAT team. The protest, led by Phelps, did not result in any confrontations or arrests. But the corporal's father, Albert Snyder, sued the church, claiming defamation and invasion of privacy, after reading an online ""manifesto"" the Westboro Baptist Church posted after that protest, where the Phelps family said Albert Snyder and his wife raised Matthew ""for the devil"" and that ""God killed Matthew so His servants would have an opportunity to preach His words"" at other venues across Maryland. ""They are very sick individuals,"" said Snyder. ""It comes down to dignity. No one should be buried with what the Phelps did. Everyone deserves to be buried with dignity.""","Members of the Westboro Baptist Church announce they will picket Elizabeth Edwards' funeral .

"Beijing (CNN) -- It is a striking image that in an instant crystallizes the passions and anger on the streets of Beijing. A man is leaning out of the sunroof of a car driving down a six-lane freeway, holding a massive Chinese flag in one hand and, in the other, a portrait of Mao Zedong. ""The islands are ours,"" he yells, referring to China's claim on what it calls the Diaoyu islands. He denounces Japan, and others in the car raised clenched fists, threatening to go to war. Protests have flared for another day across the country. This is not just any day, it is the anniversary of the incident that set off the Japanese invasion of China in 1931. The wounds of history run deep amongst generations raised on stories of the brutality of Japanese occupation. The row over the islands is tearing at those old scars. These are indeed confused times; old-style Maoism, anti-Japanese hatred, ancient territorial claims and a rich nation's hunger for national resources are fueling passionate and at times violent protests aimed at the Japanese. The islands dispute is a magnet for a grab bag of competing agendas. Japanese plants close amid Chinese fury . The open displays of anti-Japanese fury, say some China watchers, is a convenient distraction for the Communist Party as it grapples with a fraught leadership transition marked by political scandal, murder, ""disappearances"" and infighting. The appearance of the iconic Mao images lends a revolutionary fervor to these protests. The father of China's Communist Party is not seen as synonymous with the new economic powerhouse. He harks back to a more brutal time. But this is not just about anger and pride, it is about money. Lying beneath the uninhabited islands are vast natural resources. China is hungry for oil and gas to power its economy. But most of the argument here is framed around history; unfinished business with Japan and China's rising economic significance in the world. Chinese analysts like Guo Xiangjiang, the Deputy Director of the China Institute of International Studies, say there should be no question about who owns the islands. ""There shouldnÂ¹t be any discussion on Diaoyu island. It has always been a part of China,"" he says. China says its claim on Diaoyu extends back hundreds of years. Japan says China ceded sovereignty when it lost the Sino-Japanese war in 1895. Japan's surrender in World War II clouded the issue again. How a remote rock split China and Japan . But in 1972, the United States returned Senkaku to Japanese control as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. China refuses to recognize these agreements. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesman, Hong Lei, has effectively told the U.S. to keep out of the issue. ""We hope that the U.S. can earnestly honor its principle of not taking positions on the Diaoyu issue,"" he said. On the streets it is all about Japan. Thousands marched outside the Japan embassy in China Tuesday. ""Kill Japan!"" one woman yells. Another turns the question on us. ""Would you not fight for Hawaii? Would you not fight for Washington D.C? Of course we will fight for Diaoyu,"" the protester asks. China normally clamps down on protests like this. Public displays of anger are not allowed. But this is different: this is Japan. Nationalism works for the party right now, Mao images and all; better to keep the people focused on an enemy outside than the enemies within.","Passion and anger merges in Chinese street protests .

"Baghdad (CNN) -- At least 16 people were killed and dozens were injured in attacks across Iraq Monday amid an apparent uptick in sectarian tensions. Most of the attacks targeted Shiites, including bomb blasts that injured pilgrims traveling to shrines just days before a religious celebration. Four Shia pilgrims were killed and six were injured when a car bomb exploded in Baghdad's Karrada district, Iraq's Interior Ministry said. Read more: One year later, Iraq war's legacy remains unclear . And four Shia pilgrims were injured when three car bombs exploded simultaneously in the town of Balad Rouz, said Muthana Altimimi, head of the security and defense committee in Diyala province. Thursday will mark 40 days after Ashura, which commemorates the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson. Shiite pilgrims often mark the occasion by traveling to shrines. Violence also erupted outside Baghdad. Seven people were killed and four were injured after their houses were bombed in the city of Mussyab, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) south of the Iraqi capital, the Interior Ministry said. It was unclear who was responsible for the blast or why the houses were targeted. Monday's attacks come amid rising sectarian tensions, as tens of thousands of Sunni demonstrators nationwide protest what they say is second-class treatment by Iraq's Shiite-led government. Sunnis largely boycotted Iraq's 2005 elections, leading to the emergence of a Shiite-led government. The move left the once-ruling minority disaffected, which contributed to years of bloody insurgency and sectarian warfare. Read more: Clashes erupt at Iraqi protest as sectarian tensions flare . The arrest of a group of bodyguards for Iraq's Sunni finance minister fueled a surge in protests last week in Ramadi, about 110 kilometers (70 miles) west of Baghdad, and in several other Iraqi cities. At least five people were injured Sunday when bodyguards for a top Iraqi official opened fire on stone-throwing Sunni demonstrators, the country's Interior Ministry said. The clashes broke out after Deputy Prime Minister Saleh al-Mutlaq, who is Sunni, arrived to address crowds protesting in a plaza in Ramadi. In the wake of the protests, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has defended his government. ""Nobody in Iraq has privilege over others,"" he said Friday, calling for increased dialogue. ""When we want to express an opinion, we have to do it in a civilized, humane and patriotic manner,"" he said.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- I mentor a student who is a senior in a low-performing high school. About 50 percent of the students at his school drop out, while less than 25 percent go to college. His parents didn't graduate from high school, and his father earns about $14,000 a year. His grade point average is good enough to qualify him for admission at a few University of California schools. His parents clearly cannot afford to pay his way, so how much debt should he incur to get a college education? And how many tax dollars should go toward supporting that education? Such questions were on the minds of the thousands of students who demonstrated last week against cuts in public education funding in California. As the state government has struggled to balance its budget -- it faces a shortfall of $20 billion over the next 18 months after having cut an even greater amount in the past two years -- student fees have continued to rise. Last fall, U.C. regents approved a 32 percent fee increase for incoming UC freshmen. Tuition will be more than $10,000 next year. The cost of an education at a California State University campus or a community college has also jumped significantly. The protesting students believe these budget-balancing attempts have harmed public education and made it even more difficult for students such as the one I mentor to get an education. I'm not so sure. Fifty years ago, when its coffers were flush, California devised a master plan for higher education that made it possible for anyone who wanted a college degree to obtain one, mostly at taxpayer expense. The assumption was that a college degree was not only beneficial for the individual who earned it (better job prospects) but also for the state that subsidized it (an educated work force that would ensure economic growth). Fifty years later, the state is broke. Costs to operate California's higher education system have sharply risen. Some critics say this is because university and college administrations are too bloated and enjoy too many perks. Others, including last week's student protesters, aim their ire at the legislature and governor for not being more supportive of students and faculty. What no one seems to accept, however, is that the whole system is broken. California's taxpayers don't want to pay higher taxes. In the face of less revenue, the legislature will continue to cut the higher-education budget where it can. The result: declining enrollments, fewer class offerings, teacher furloughs, staff layoffs and a decline in quality. California's higher-education crisis comes at a critical juncture in its history. President Obama has repeatedly remarked that the United States is no longer among the top industrialized nations in terms of college participation and graduation rates. To reverse the decline, he says the country needs to add 1 million more college graduates a year. For California, that translates into graduating about 100,000 more students a year over the next 10 years. But its public education system is projecting a 300,000-student cutback because of all the budget cuts. So, how can California contribute its share of adding to the number of college graduates? If voters continue to resist higher taxes, then students fees and tuition will have to continue to go up. Raising fees to match the real price of a U.C. or Cal State education is not necessarily bad if individuals who cannot afford to pay for college receive grants and loans. Anyone who gains a college degree should be willing to accept some debt load, but not so much that he or she is forever burdened. The student I mentor will still get grants to attend a U.C. institution, but his loans are also going to increase. He is hesitant, but willing, to accept those debts. But how much more should he have to accept? What seems crazy, however, is keeping the cost of college below market cost. That, in effect, gives discounts to those individuals who can afford to pay. Most individuals, for example, assume that U.C. Berkeley and Stanford are equivalent institutions but the cost of tuition, room and board this year is roughly $25,000 at Berkeley and $50,000 at Stanford. Why should someone who can afford the cost of Stanford get a price reduction for going to school at Berkeley? Californians can't have it both ways. If they want a system that effectively subsidizes a free college education for all who qualify for one, it needs a tax structure that pays for it. If voters are unwilling to raise taxes, then those who can afford to pay for college should, and scarce tax dollars should go to those who would otherwise will be blocked from attending. The student I mentor should receive financial help to attend college, and he will benefit from having a college education because he will earn higher earnings. The state will also benefit because he will pay higher taxes. That is a master plan for the 21st century. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William G. Tierney.","Students have protested increases in public university tuition fees .
William Tierney says taxpayers are balking at paying more to finance colleges .
He says that means more affluent students will have to pay more .

"London (CNN) -- When I was informed last year by police that my phone had been hacked by News of The World, I was very angry, but not altogether surprised. I was by then all too familiar with the way that tabloid newspapers thought nothing of invading my privacy, if they thought there might be a story in it. I am best known in the UK as a presenter on the BBC TV show, ""Crimewatch,"" a crime-fighting factual program, similar in purpose to America's ""Most Wanted."" I was on ""Crimewatch"" between 1990 and 2006, but before, during and after my TV stint, I was also a detective with the Metropolitan Police. CNN iReport: Share your view on phone-hacking scandal. Up until 2002 my experience of the press was generally positive. On ""Crimewatch,"" I witnessed first hand the enormous benefits of working in partnership with the media to solve crime. That's not to say there weren't times when the different agendas conflicted, but that has to be expected. That was all about to change. My then husband, a detective chief superintendent, appeared on ""Crimewatch"" to appeal for information in the unsolved 1987 murder of private detective Daniel Morgan, whose business partner Jonathan Rees was alleged to have supplied News of the World's parent company News International with illegally obtained information. It was a gruesome case: a man killed with an ax outside a south London pub. Soon after, the Met received intelligence that suspects in the case intended to make life difficult for him. The Met took the threat so seriously we were placed under the umbrella of the witness protection unit. Morgan's business partner and two other men were eventually charged in the killing, but the murder case against the three collapsed last year and the charges were dropped. In 2002 ""Crimewatch"" was sent an email suggesting that I was having an affair. Strangers phoned my husband's work, attempting to find out our home address and other personal and financial details. Two vans stationed outside our house followed my husband taking the kids to school. By this stage, we feared we were being stalked by the people responsible for the murder. We took our house off the market, and warned our daughter's headmistress of the risks of strangers hanging around the school. I became very distressed and anxious. The stress that we endured over the subsequent years contributed to the eventual breakdown of my marriage. The two vans were eventually traced back to the News of the World. The Metropolitan Police sought an explanation from the newspaper about the surveillance and the reason given was simply unbelievable. They said that they were investigating suspicions that my husband and I were having an affair with each other! We had by then been married for four years, together for 11 and had two children. Our marriage was public knowledge -- we'd even been pictured in Hello Magazine. In 2011, officers from Operation Weeting, a police investigation into phone hacking, informed me that private information about me, including home address, phone numbers and detailed history had been found in the notebooks of Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator who was jailed in 2007 for intercepting phone messages of members of the royal family. Read a timeline of the hacking scandal . In July 2012, prosecutors said Mulcaire would face four charges relating to the alleged hacking of the phones of murdered teenager Milly Dowler and three other people. He issued a statement denying the latest charges. The dates on the entries suggested that our phones were being hacked around the same time as the other surveillance was going on. You only have to listen to the stories coming out of the inquiry to know that this kind of harassment wasn't restricted to News of the World. It was widespread across the industry. There was a culture that led some of the papers to behave as if the law did not apply to them. And they got away with it because of self regulation. In 2011 I gave evidence to the Leveson inquiry into press ethics about our experiences. What I hope to see coming out of the inquiry is independent regulation, backed up by statute, that has genuine repercussions for anyone who starts to play fast and loose with the system again. I, and other victims of press harassment -- and I would like to stress that most of us are regular members of the public, not celebrities -- don't want to have to go through this again in a few years' time. This is an important moment in history, a chance to reassert a clean and accountable press that we can all be proud of again.

"(CNN) -- A Texas judge denied a Planned Parenthood request for a temporary restraining order Monday that would have extended the organization's ability to participate in the state's revamped Women's Health Program. A law going into effect Tuesday requires the state to fully fund women's health clinics with the exception of those that are affiliated with abortion providers. Previously, such establishments obtained 90% of their money through the Social Security Administration and other federal funding. Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions at some of its clinics, and fellow plaintiff Marcela Balquinta of McAllen, Texas, had filed the request for a temporary restraining order seeking exclusion from the new law, arguing the organization provides preventative women's health care not associated with abortions to nearly 50,000 Texas enrollees annually. ""I have denied the request for a temporary restraining order at this time,"" Judge Gary Harger said. ""I did not find that there would be an irreparable harm in waiting nine days for the injunction hearing."" A full hearing is scheduled for January 11 before U.S. District Judge Stephen Yelenosky on whether to grant Planned Parenthood a temporary injunction. Texas Gov. Rick Perry issued a statement welcoming the move. ""Today's ruling finally clears the way for thousands of low-income Texas women to access much-needed care, while at the same time respecting the values and laws of our state,"" he said. ""I applaud all those who stand ready to help these women live healthy lives without sending taxpayer money to abortion providers and their affiliates."" With the temporary restraining order denial, women may not be able to access care through the Texas Women's Health Program at Planned Parenthood clinics, pending the result of the January 11 hearing. ""It is shocking that once again Texas officials are letting politics jeopardize health care access for women,"" said Ken S. Lambrecht, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. ""This case isn't about Planned Parenthood -- it's about women like Marcy Balquinta who rely on us for basic, preventive health care."" He added, ""Regardless of what happens in the courts, Planned Parenthood will be here for our patients. Our doors remain open today and always to Texas women in need.

"(CNN) -- Jen Wang of Short Hills, New Jersey, took her first SAT when she was in sixth grade, long before she would start filling out college applications. Wake Forest University recently announced it would no longer require the SAT for admissions. ""My family thought it was very important for me to do well on this test, and I basically obtained nearly every SAT study guide out there by the time I was a junior in high school,"" she said. ""For Christmas one year, I received an electronic device that allowed me to practice the SAT's 'on-the-go.' "" After all that preparation, she ended up attending a school that has made the SAT Reasoning Test, generally known as the SAT, the most widely used college admissions exam in the United States, optional. Her school, Connecticut College, is one of a growing number of colleges and universities that are making the SAT optional in the admissions process. In May, two highly selective schools -- Smith College in Massachusetts and Wake Forest University in North Carolina -- decided to drop the SAT and ACT, which some students take as an alternative to the SAT, as requirements for admission. Wake Forest made the move as part of its efforts to increase socioeconomic, racial and ethnic diversity in the student body, said Martha Allman, director of admissions. Research has shown that SAT performance is linked with family income, and that the test by itself does not accurately predict success in college, she said. Making the test optional ""removes the barrier for those students who had everything else,"" like scholastic achievement and extracurricular activities, but who ""maybe didn't do as well on a specific test,"" she said.  Smith College also cited the correlation between test scores and income as a motivation for making the exam optional, as well as a desire to take a more well-rounded view of applications. The changes at Smith and Wake Forest take effect for applicants seeking to enroll in the fall of 2009. Several colleges and universities went test-optional in the 1990s amid concern that the test was a barrier to equal opportunity for minorities, women and low-income students, said Robert Schaeffer, public education director for FairTest. Some schools also dropped the test as a requirement with the explosion of test coaching, which gave upper-income kids an advantage. Today, about 30 percent, or nearly 760 colleges and universities out of the approximately 2,500 accredited four-year institutions across America have made at least some standardized tests optional for some applicants, according to the nonprofit advocacy group FairTest. Some of those schools, such as George Mason University in Virginia, still require the tests for prospective students who do not meet a particular GPA requirement in high school.  But Alana Klein, spokesperson for the College Board, which owns the SAT, said this is not a trend. While the news media have focused on recent moves to make the test optional, schools have been doing this for decades, and SAT test volumes are up 2 percent from last year, she said.   The poor performance of some low-income and minority students has to do with their lack of access to quality education, which is a national problem, but does not relate to the test itself, Klein said. The SAT is a fair test for all students, she said, and any test question that shows bias is removed. ""Not only is the SAT a critical tool for success in college, but also in the workforce and in life,"" she said. At Bowdoin College, which hasn't required the SAT since 1969, the biggest benefit of the test-optional policy is the school's ""unusually supportive community"" where students don't compare scores, said William Shain, dean of admissions and financial aid. But at this small liberal arts college in Maine, which admitted about 18 percent of applicants this year, more than 80 percent of applicants submit scores anyway, he said. One of the downsides of keeping standardized tests optional is that it's harder to evaluate a large pool of candidates who all have high GPAs, he said. Richard Atkinson, former president of the University of California, recommended in 2001 that the school system no longer require the SAT Reasoning Test for admission. He cited the concerns of African-Americans and Hispanics that these groups tend to perform worse on the exam than students of other ethnicities. ""The real basis of their concern, however, is that they have no way of knowing what the SAT measures and, therefore, have no basis for assessing its fairness or helping their children acquire the skills to do better,"" Atkinson said in 2001. The University of California system still requires the test today.  Several other schools dropped the test requirement for admissions after the revised SAT came out in 2005, after seeing that the new version did not address concerns about access and poor predictive value, FairTest's Schaeffer said. Since spring 2005, 34 colleges and universities have made standardized testing optional for all applicants, according to FairTest. Four others made the requirement optional for students with a lower GPA, FairTest's data showed.  About 25 percent of liberal arts colleges have made a move in the test-optional direction, said Jack Maguire, chairman and founder of Maguire Associates. His consulting firm has advised certain colleges to become test-optional.  ""I do think it improves a school's image,"" he said. ""It shows what's important to schools, if they're really interested in increasing diversity."" Wang, who just finished her freshman year at Connecticut College, said she is torn on the SAT debate -- the test sharpened her vocabulary and test-taking skills, but preparation took up a lot of time that could have been spent doing other things. ""Applicants may take too much time on prepping for this test and their time can be better spent dedicating themselves to other activities that could show colleges what the applicants really find meaningful in their lives,"" she said.","Smith College and Wake Forest University no longer require the SAT for admissions .

Police will submit charges against at least five of the accused men before a new fast-track court in Saket, a southern district of New Delhi, CNN affiliate IBN reported. It was unclear if the men would appear in the closed court session Thursday. A sixth male alleged to have participated in the attack is believed to be a minor and may appear before a juvenile court, but police were carrying out a bone marrow test to try to determine his exact age, IBN reported. The victim, whose name has not been released, died Saturday in a Singapore hospital, where she received treatment after being airlifted from New Delhi. The men are accused of assaulting the woman and her male companion on a bus in the Indian capital on December 16, robbing them of their belongings before dumping them at the side of a road, police said. The male companion was eventually discharged from a local hospital. Authorities plan to seek the death penalty for the accused, IBN reported, with many calls for the men to be hanged, including from the victim's family. If the sixth accused is confirmed to be a minor, he could be sent to a children's home for a maximum of three years, according to IBN. The 11 lawyers who make up the executive board of the Saket Bar Association on Wednesday vowed not to represent any of the accused assailants because of the nature of the crime. In addition, the bar association has appealed to its 7,000 members to also refrain from representing the accused, said the association's president, Rajpal Kasana. ""We are not taking this case on the grounds of humanity,"" he said. The boycott by the bar association does not mean the accused will not have lawyers. Attorneys from other districts or ones appointed by the court will likely fill that role. Opinion: End culture of rape in 2013 . The call for local lawyers to avoid defending the accused is unprecedented, but justified because ""everyone is emotionally attached to this case,"" Kasana said. Lawmakers are weighing a proposal to toughen the country's anti-rape law. Some have suggested a new law should be named after the woman, while others have said it's illegal to reveal her identity. The victim's father told IBN that he supported naming a new law after his daughter. ""All I ask is that the law is the toughest it can be,"" he said. ""The death penalty is compulsory for a crime so grave the assailants must be hanged. The courts must give these men the death penalty."" Misogyny in India: We are all guilty . India's Supreme Court on Thursday will hear a petition asking it to suspend all lawmakers who face charges for crimes against women. The petition was filed in the aftermath of the brutal gang-rape, which sent thousands of outraged protesters to the streets for days. ""This unfortunate episode has galvanized the nation,"" said Jagdeep S. Chhokar, an official with the Association for Democratic Reforms, which tracks political candidate's criminal records. Chhokar said six Indian state lawmakers are facing rape charges in unrelated cases, and two people in the federal parliament are also facing charges of crimes against women that fall short of charges of rape. The group says that in the past five years, political parties across India have nominated 260 candidates facing charges of crimes against women such as assault and outraging the modesty of a woman.","NEW: The accused men are expected to be formally charged in a New Delhi court Thursday .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a New Year's stampede during a church vigil at an Angolan stadium rose to 16 Wednesday, state media said, as details emerged of how the tragedy unfolded. The deadly crush at the gates of the Cidadela Desportiva stadium, in Angola's capital, Luanda, came Monday evening as tens of thousands of people flocked to an event staged by the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. Three children, aged three and four, were among the 16 people killed, according to state-run newspaper Jornal de Angola. Angolan state news agency Angola Press reported 10 deaths in the stampede as of Tuesday. Meanwhile, Ivory Coast is beginning three days of national mourning for at least 60 people crushed to death after they left a New Year's Eve fireworks display in the West African country's biggest city, Abidjan. Read more: Ivory Coast mourns 60 killed in New Year's stampede . President Alassane Ouattara has ordered a speedy investigation into the circumstances and cause of the tragedy, his office said in a statement Tuesday night. Ouattara went to the scene of the stampede, in Plateau, the city's central business district, Tuesday and has ordered the government to take care of the injured, his office said. The dead in Abidjan included 26 children, 28 women and six men, Youth Minister Alain Lobognon said via Twitter. Interior Minister Hamed Bakayoko said 49 people were injured, two of them seriously. In both incidents, many of the victims died as a result of being trampled or suffocated by the surging crowds. In Luanda, the crisis came when many more people turned up for the vigil than the 70,000 who were expected by the organizers, according to Angola Press. People had been arriving at the stadium since the morning, the Jornal de Angola reported Wednesday, leaving no space for those who arrived later in the day. Witnesses said all the gates were open and that people could also watch the service on big screens placed outside, the newspaper reported. However, anxiety led people to push through a set of the gates into the stadium, causing a stampede, it said. Witnesses told the newspaper the situation was aggravated when bags of holy water by the gates burst in the confusion and created a dangerously slippery surface on the entrance slope. The deaths occurred as a result of crushing and asphyxiation, Angola Press reported, quoting Angola's national firefighters' department spokesman Faustino Sebastiao. Another 120 people were injured, the news agency said. The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God was founded in Brazil in 1977 and has since expanded to more than 100 countries around the globe, according to its website. Its first church in Africa opened in Angola in 1992. Watch: Angola's ghost town: A new town, with few residents .

"(CNN) -- While most eyes were focused on Harry Redknapp's return to Premier League management with Queens Park Rangers on Saturday, it was two of Manchester United's unsung heroes who grabbed the spotlight. With former Tottenham boss Redknapp watching from the stands after being confirmed as Mark Hughes' replacement, it appeared the English top flight's only winless team might pull off a major upset after taking the lead at Old Trafford. However, second-half substitute Anderson inspired yet another comeback by Alex Ferguson's side as United returned to the top of the table with a 3-1 victory and bounced back from last weekend's shock defeat by Norwich. ""Anderson changed the game,"" said manager Ferguson said of the Brazilian midfielder, who has started only five matches in all competitions this season. ""We played for about 10 or 15 minutes, that was the sum total of a real performance for Manchester United. ""Queens Park Rangers had a surge of determination and belief, they worked really hard and that's what you expect when a team loses its manager. We saw that again today."" Redknapp returns to EPL management . The match marked Darren Fletcher's first Premier League start in more than a year following a chronic bowel complaint which threatened to end his career, and the Scotland midfielder capped it by heading United in front following Jonny Evans' equalizer. ""Everyone is delighted for him. It has been a long road back,"" said Ferguson. ""It is the first time he has played twice in one week. He didn't let us down again. He never does. It is lovely to have him back like that."" United went behind for the 13th time in 20 games this season, and the fifth in a row, as forward Jamie Mackie scored for QPR in the 52nd minute from Kieron Dyer's low cross. Sculptor shows softer side of formidable Ferguson . However, center-back Evans leveled with his third goal this season after Danny Welbeck headed on a corner by Wayne Rooney, who provided another set-piece for Fletcher to score his first league goal since the 6-1 hammering by rivals Manchester City 13 months ago. Striker Javier Hernandez, another halftime replacement, wrapped up the victory with his ninth goal this season to put United two points clear of City -- who on Sunday travel to a Chelsea team under the guidance of new manager Rafael Benitez. Chelsea dropped to fourth place following West Brom's 4-2 victory at Sunderland on Saturday, which gave Steve Clarke's team a fourth successive win in the top division for the first time since 1980. ""We have had a lot of plaudits and the players deserve it because so far, we have been a really good team,"" said Clarke, in his first managerial role after being assistant at Newcastle, Chelsea, Liverpool and West Ham. ""But you don't get carried away in the Premier League. We are still this side of Christmas, there are a lot of games to be played, a lot of points to be fought for. Our focus is on Wednesday night, that's as far ahead as we look."" Everton stayed fifth despite being held 1-1 by Norwich, as Sebastien Bassong 90th-minute header canceled out Steven Naismith's first-half goal for the Merseyside team. Norwich moved up to 13th in the 20-team division, extending the team's unbeaten run to six matches. Arsenal announced a $240 million sponsorship extension with Emirates on Friday, but the London club remained sixth after being held 0-0 away to an Aston Villa team that moved out of the bottom three. Reading dropped into the relegation zone after losing 3-2 against Wigan, with Jordi Gomez netting all three goals for the 15th-placed home team. Stoke moved up to 11th with a 1-0 win over ninth-placed Fulham, as former Liverpool midfielder Charlie Adam scored the only goal.","Manchester United return to top of EPL with 3-1 win against Queens Park Rangers .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- An investigation is under way into a horrific collision in Hong Kong that resulted in the deaths of two visiting chefs from Heston Blumenthal's famous British restaurant, The Fat Duck. Lotus PR, which represents The Fat Duck, identified the two chefs as Jorge Ivan Arango Herrera, known as Jorge, and Carl Magnus Lindgren, who went by Magnus. ""They were both senior members and great and dear friends,"" according to a statement by The Fat Duck. ""Two uniquely talented young chefs that were loved by everyone who worked with them. They will be sadly and deeply missed."" The purpose of the trip to Hong Kong was for a private event, according to Lotus PR. Also killed was the chefs' taxi driver. Blumenthal, who was also in Hong Kong, identified the bodies of the two chefs, according to a local newspaper, The Standard, which featured a photograph of him with police on Wednesday. According to the Hong Kong Police Force, the accident occurred Monday morning when a bus was traveling downhill and hit two cars, crossed into the other lane and crushed the chefs' taxi against another bus. In addition to the three deaths, 56 people were injured, including the driver of the other bus, a baby and a 90-year old, according to police. The driver of the first bus was arrested for dangerous driving that resulted in death and was released after posting HK $5,000 (US$645) bail, according to a police spokesman. The operations head of the bus company, New World First Bus, cited security video recordings as showing its driver fainted and that the bus went out of control for more than 10 seconds, according to South China Morning Post. The paper said the driver joined the company in 1998, had a good driving record with a few minor accidents and passed his medical check in July. The Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong confirmed that the two chefs were guests of the hotel. ""We are deeply saddened by this tragic event and our hearts and prayers are with their families and loved ones,"" said Nina Colls, the hotel's communications director, in a statement. A menu by Blumenthal, whose restaurant has been awarded three Michelin stars, with recipes that date from the 16th century has been offered at the Mandarin Oriental in London's Hyde Park. In an interview with a Hong Kong culinary magazine, Crave, Blumenthal expressed his desire to open a Fat Duck at the Mandarin Oriental Hong Kong. The news of the accident was greeted by sadness in the culinary world. The French Laundry, owned by chef Thomas Keller in California, tweeted: ""Today we have a heavy heart... Thoughts and prayers go out to the entire team of The Fat Duck & their families on this most difficult day.""

"(CNN) -- The CW's '80s-set ""Sex and the City"" prequel doesn't premiere until January, but series star AnnaSophia Robb has already proved she's every bit as stylish as her character. Robb, who plays teenager Carrie Bradshaw on ""The Carrie Diaries,"" said New York Fashion Week ""was an incredible introduction to the fashion world,"" as she prepares to fill the iconic character's Manolos. Despite a shared emphasis on fashion, however, Robb said the show is very different from ""Sex and the City,"" which featured Sarah Jessica Parker as Bradshaw for six seasons and two films.

"(CNN) -- Nine years ago he was an electrician. Six months ago, he was worth some A$1.18 billion ($1.22 billion) Australia's mining boom having turned him into the country's richest person under 40 years old. Now, coal baron Nathan Tinkler, 36, is facing a mountain of debt. His wealth has plummeted to A$400 million, thanks to slowing demand and falling coal prices, while his debts to a variety of creditors mount, reportedly hitting A$638 million. On Tuesday, his personal holding company was liquidated. Tinkler has had the Midas touch on his way to the top of the rich list and -- until Tuesday -- on the way down, too, staving off the liquidation of several of his companies. He now faces credit debt surrounding his horse racing empire, troubled sports franchises and repossession of his personal jet. While creditors have been circling for months, it was a Tuesday decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court to wind up Tinkler's Mulsanne Resources over an unpaid A$28.4 million dollar debt that suggests the former electrician's luck may have run dry. On Wednesday, the Federal Court place his thoroughbred horse racing and breeding empire, Patinack Farm Administration, into liquidation with a debt of A$2 million. Patinack Farm's cash flow problems were reported to be so severe, Tinkler was trying to stem the bleeding by downsizing operations in Victoria and South Australia and selling horses at bargain base prices to settle a state debt. He recently settled a A$16.6 million dispute with Mirvac over a failed land purchase in Sydney and a A$2 million debt to the publicly listed contractor, Sedgman Ltd. Tinkler's woes have impacted the Australian sporting world too. His Hunter Sports Group has reportedly fallen behind in meeting player salaries for his two prized clubs -- the A league Newcastle Jets football team and the Newcastle Knights league club. But Tinkler has come up with enough money to partially pay a significant, unpaid bill for the rent of stadiums used by the teams. And he has avoided the reported repossession of his personal jet worth A$40 million. GE Capital is said to have issued Tinkler an instruction to leave the French made Dassault Falcon 900, replete with Italian leather seats, a conference room and bar, at a regional Sydney airport. Instead, he flew it to Singapore where he and his family now live in two adjacent homes, reportedly with a Maserati and Porcshe in the driveway. And in August with coal prices flailing, Tinkler abandoned plans for a A$5.3 billion take over Whitehaven Coal, one of Australia's largest coal producers with exploration assets in Queensland. Tinkler's Aston Resources, however, remains the largest shareholder in Whitehaven Coal with a 19.4% stake. Navigating the downside of Australia's commodities boom is proving to be a wild ride for Nathan Tinkler. As a result, the unlikely rich lister is in the business pages of Australian newspapers almost daily. And he doesn't much like the attention. ""There has definitely, absolutely, been a spirited media campaign to get me,"" Tinkler told Sydney's Daily Telegraph earlier this month. Seeking to sooth the doubters, he added, ""I would say the noisy few have made a lot of people nervous and there is no need to be."" The order to liquidate his personal investment vehicle would indicate the nervousness is not a fiction of a media campaign. But Tinkler is accustomed to wild rides. The ride to the top for Australia's fastest self-made billionaire was not only wild. It was a gamble. As a teenager, he headed for the rich coalfields of the Hunter Valley, north of Sydney, according to a 2010 profile. There, he found work in the mines as an electrician, though a A$400 a week take home salary held little appeal. By 26, he'd formed his own mine machinery maintenance business, servicing coalmines, which were burgeoning and booming as Australian commodities fueled the expansion of China's infrastructure. Then came his big break. In 2006, he raised a A$1 million loan against his home and business for a deposit on a coal tenement in central Queensland. All he needed to do was raise another A$29 million to finance the deal. ""I knocked on every door in Australia and many overseas to raise the funds. Finally I succeeded after wearing out a lot of shoe leather, "" he told CNBC in 2010. Investors came on board when exploratory drilling turned in heaven sent results - high grade coal samples. Sitting on a promising asset, Tinkler sold it not once but twice -- first to Macarthur Coal for A$275 million plus a 10% stake in the company and a year later, in 2008, with world coal prices soaring, he sold his stake in Macarthur to global steel giant ArcelorMittal. His A$1 million gamble turned into a multimillion dollar pile of cash with which he went on a buying spree -- football and rugby league clubs, horse studs, as well as property. He also formed Aston Resources, a mining development vehicle, floated in 2010. The Aston Resources merger with Whitehaven Coal was his great hope and even diminished by weak coal prices, it remains his main asset. If the former electrician can't pull another rabbit out of his hat, faith in the Midas touch may be all that remains to stave off bankruptcy.","Billionaire Nathan Tinkler's rags-to-riches story in peril as his debt woes increase .

"(CNN) -- Penn State has rejected a CNN public records request for a copy of a 1998 campus police report tied to sexual misconduct allegations made against then-assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, a lawyer for the school told CNN. Amy Elizabeth McCall, an assistant general counsel, asserted in a letter to CNN that Penn State is ""a state-related institution"" and not a ""state school"" like some in other states, and therefore does not have the same public records requirements as other public institutions. ""Because the 1998 investigation did not result in any criminal charges, it is not criminal history information and the university's police are thus required by law to keep that information within the police department,"" McCall wrote. According to a grand jury's report released in early November, the mother of one of Sandusky's accusers -- identified as Victim 6 -- came forward and said the coach had showered with her son and hugged him. Two campus police detectives eavesdropped on conversations in May 1998 when the mother confronted the coach, who retired a year later from the Nittany Lion program. Police later monitored a second conversation that month, in which the mother told Sandusky to stay away from her son. ""I understand. I was wrong,"" Sandusky said, according to the grand jury report. ""I wish I could get forgiveness. I know I won't get it from you. I wish I were dead."" No charges were ever filed in that instance, and local and state law enforcement authorities did not look deeper into those and other allegations against Sandusky until years later. He now faces at least 50 charges related to alleged sex abuse perpetrated against young boys over a 14-year period. He has plead not guilty to all charges, saying in interviews that while he may have ""horsed around"" with children he never sexually assaulted them. CNN had asked for a copy of the Penn State campus police report of that 1998 investigation, citing Pennsylvania's ""Right-to-Know Law"" that offers access for citizens and media to ""public information."" University officials to face trial . Unlike many commonwealth agencies, Penn State and three other schools that receive state funds don't fall under Pennsylvania's right-to-know law, according to Terry Mutchler, the executive director of the state's Office of Open Records. In 2007, state lawmakers considered a change that would have included the school under the open records law. But Penn State President Graham Spanier -- who lost his job days after the grand jury report came out this fall, after initially supporting two school officials accused of covering up a 2002 eyewitness allegation against Sandusky -- testified against the move before the House State Government Committee. Spanier told the legislature he was concerned about the cost and compliance of Penn State being subject to the law. He also said that there were competitive reasons for keeping records private. ""Nobody would argue the point that the public has a right to know how public funds are spent,"" he said at the time. ""But these proposals will fundamentally change the way we operate, the way our trustees govern, and the way the university administers their policies.""","A Penn State lawyer says CNN cannot have the police report tied to a 1998 probe .

"(CNN) -- Hector ""Macho"" Camacho, the flamboyant boxer who awed fans with his quick hands and ring antics, was shot and critically wounded in Puerto Rico Tuesday, authorities said. Camacho was shot Tuesday in front of a bar in Bayamon, Puerto Rico, police said. Camacho, 50, was in the passenger seat of a car and next to him was a man who was shot twice and killed, police said. Camacho was rushed to a nearby hospital, said Dr. Ernesto Torres, of the Centro Medico of Rio Piedras. Torres told CNN affiliate WAPA TV the bullet appeared to have entered the left side of the boxer's face and is now lodged in his right shoulder. If Camacho survives his injuries he may have trouble walking in future, Torres said, because the bullet fractured two vertebrae in his neck. Camacho was born in Bayamon and raised in New York. He fought professionally for more than 25 years and last fought in 2010. During his career he beat such legendary boxers as Roberto Duran and Sugar Ray Leonard and he held several championships. No one has yet been arrested over the shooting. The former star of the ring was sitting in the passenger seat of a black Ford Mustang outside the ""Azuquita"" bar when the shots were fired, WAPA TV reported. Capt. Rafael Rosa, of Bayamon Police, identified the driver killed in the attack as Adrian Mojica. He received one shot to the neck and another to the lower back. The suspects are two men who are believed to have been traveling in a gray vehicle, said Lt. Wilfredo Rivera, of CataÃ±o Police. They escaped after a shootout with police at a residential complex, WAPA TV reported.","Camacho was found shot near a bar in Bayamon .

"(CNN) -- English Premier League club Liverpool began its New Year shopping with the signing of Chelsea forward Daniel Sturridge on Wednesday, in a deal worth an estimated $19.6 million. The 23-year-old, who has won four international caps for England, could make his debut on Sunday against non-league side Mansfield in the FA Cup. The former Manchester City striker said he is looking forward to teaming up with Luis Suarez, having signed a long-term deal with the mid-table Merseyside club. Suarez, who has scored 16 goals so far this season, has often been left to lead the Liverpool attack on his own but Sturridge is confident that he can strike up a partnership with the Uruguay international. Fantasy football: Pedro Pinto's team of 2012 . ""To have him as a teammate is great,"" Sturridge told the club's official website. ""He's a very good player, very talented and rated as a one of the best players in attacking positions in the world right now. ""It's good to be part of a team with him in and I'm sure we'll be able to play well together."" Sturridge, who began his career at Manchester City before joining Chelsea in July 2009, has found his chances at Stamford Bridge somewhat limited. Following a successful loan spell at Bolton, where he scored eight goals in 12 games, he found his path into the Chelsea team blocked by the arrival of Fernando Torres. After initially being given a chance by Andre Villas-Boas, albeit often out wide instead of his preferred central striking role, he was a peripheral figure under his successor Roberto di Matteo -- and Chelsea's current manager Rafael Benitez has let him leave. ""I am humbled and happy to be here,"" Sturridge said. ""Brendan Rodgers said he sees me here for a long time -- and I also see myself here for a long time. I've not signed here to play for a couple of years and then move on. ""I've signed to be here for as long as possible. It's a humongous club -- for me, one of the biggest in the world -- and to have the fans and world-class players we have here is amazing."" Lampard double inspires Chelsea . Meanwhile, with Sturridge's departure confirmed, Chelsea stepped up its bid to lure Newcastle striker Demba Ba to London. Newcastle confirmed on Wednesday that Chelsea had triggered the player's release clause, thought to be worth around $12 million. ""Newcastle United can confirm that Chelsea Football Club has made an official offer for Demba Ba which has triggered the release clause in the player's contract,"" the club's website reported. ""The club has given the player permission to speak to Chelsea FC and therefore he will not be included in the squad for tonight's game against Everton."" The 27-year-old, who will play in this month's African Cup of Nations with Senegal, has scored 13 league goals so far this season -- exactly half of Newcastle's total. Manager Alan Pardew told Sky Sports: ""There is no swift resolution, it's done, he will go to Chelsea with our blessing. He has done fantastically for us, it's a big club, good luck to him. ""For us, it's not a bad thing because of all the uncertainty of whether he was going to stay is now done. We can move on, we're a massive club here. This club is bigger than any player for sure.

"(CNN) -- Liangqiao, a small collection of huts and farms in southern China, is known as a cancer village. Zhu Chun Yun lost her husband to cancer and now worries for her daughter's health. It is where Hu Xiaoping, a husband and father and a farmer, died an agonizing death at age 30 one year after being diagnosed with colon cancer. His widow, Zhu Chun Yun, blames his death on the brown and rust-colored water from the river, which farmers use to irrigate their crops. ""The doctor in the hospital told us not to live here,"" she told CNN through an interpreter. ""He said don't eat the rice and don't drink the water."" Residents of Liangqiao say their river is polluted because of the iron-ore mine about 35 miles away, which is run by a nationally owned company. Mining for iron-ore exposes naturally occurring heavy metals like arsenic and cadmium, which are both carcinogens. Without proper water treatment facilities, water contaminated with high levels of these metals is hazardous and can possibly cause cancer. Jingjing Zhang, an environmental lawyer who is working the villagers who want to sue the government, said the Dabaoshan mine has been polluting the Hengshui River for decades. ""I always had a dream to live in a place where there's a clean river I can swim in, but this dream seems very difficult to achieve in China now,"" she said. Twenty-eight people in this village of 400 have died over the last 10 years from cancer -- a rate much higher than the rest of country. The overall mortality rate for 2006 was 137 deaths per 100,000 residents. Pollution is a serious problem throughout China. The Chinese ministry of health reported that increased pollution has made cancer the leading cause of death in the country. China, along with the United States, is a leading emitter of greenhouse gases, which experts say can contribute to global warming. In terms of total emissions, China is projected by the International Energy Association to become the world's leading greenhouse gas producing country this year. It can also impact the U.S. food supply. The amount of food imported from China has grown dramatically in the past decade. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the United States imported $4.1 billion worth of seafood and agricultural products from China in 2006. In 1995, it was $800 million. In June, the United States banned five types of fish and shrimp from China because inspectors found traces of cancer-causing chemicals and antibiotics in the products. Small villages like Liangqiao have little recourse against big companies that might be polluting their air or water. CNN talked to the mine's director who acknowledged environmental issues with the mine, but said it wasn't a problem that could be solved overnight. He said some of the smaller, privately owned mines should share blame for the problems. The mine has given the villagers some compensation. About 1,700 Yuan ($200) for the whole village, Zhang told CNN. Zhang continues to build her case against the mine, trying to win compensation for medical testing, health care and damage to the village's rice crops. She hopes to go to trial next year. Water tests from Huanan Agricultural University have concluded the Hengshui is indeed too toxic for any human use, in stark contrast to what Jingjing said the government told the villagers. They told her ""we already meet all environmental standards,"" she said. China is trying to address its pollution problem. In September, the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration shut down 400 companies for water-pollution violations and suspended 249 other businesses, according to China Daily. And last week China announced a joint campaign with the European Union to clean up China's two largest river basins. The government hopes to have a dramatically cleaner country by August, when it will be host to the Olympics. It is too late for Zhu's husband. She said that after he got cancer he was unable to work and he reluctantly went for medical treatment. ""He didn't want to go to the hospital because he worried we didn't have enough money to bring up our daughter,"" she said. Zhu told CNN she doesn't have time to be sad. All she worries about is caring for daughter and her small plot of land. The villagers have figured out a way to pipe clean drinking water down from a nearby mountain, but they still use the dirty water to irrigate the crops. ""They have no other choice,"" Jingjing said.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Wearing aviator sunglasses and a selection of thigh-high tights and frilly skirts, 72-year-old Liu Qianping has caused quite a stir in China. In the past few weeks, images of the former farmer from Hunan province have appeared on Taobao, the Chinese version of eBay, marketing clothes for Yecoo, a business set up by his granddaughter Lv Ting and four of her friends. Lv told CNN she invited her grandfather to visit her in the southern province of Guangzhou earlier this month, and while unpacking boxes of clothes to sell, he pulled out -- and slipped on -- a hot pink cloak. Struck by how well he wore it, a friend assembled some amateur lighting and starting taking photos that were later posted online. There's Liu in a white tights, a pink skirt and a fur-lined red polka dot coat. In other images, he's posing demurely in bright green leggings, clutching a handbag and wearing a layered pink shawl. Sometime he wears a wig, sometimes not, but the aviator glasses are always present. Liu has attracted a lot of attention on Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

But others aren't so sure: ""Is he crazy, being weird and mess around like this?"" @GuYue adds: ""Neither fish nor fowl, inappropriate."" Lv told CNN that her grandfather is loving the attention. ""My grandfather is happier than before, he enjoys being interviewed; he calls our relatives at our hometown about his experiences here in the city,"" she said. Liu's fame has also translated into higher sales for the fledgling company, which only launched in May. Sales have surged fivefold since his image appeared on the site, an unforeseen benefit according to Lv, who says the photos were just taken for fun. ""I wasn't intended to raise the sales. It's just for fun, for both my grandfather and me. I'm surprised that this went viral online,"" she said. Lv said she had no intention of hiring any other ""older"" models. And no, he wasn't paid. The range of clothes Liu models has now been dubbed ""Grandpa style."" And they'll take more photos, Lv says, as long as Liu enjoys it. When fashion and reality collide .

"Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- You think it's wild being a fan when a basketball-obsessed state encounters the biggest rivalry meeting in its history? Try being a politician. Hours after the University of Kentucky punched its ticket to a Final Four meeting against the University of Louisville, Kentucky governor Steve Beshear's office was asked for a reaction. That was on Sunday night, but it took until Monday morning before it came. Let's just say the game plan from the Democratic governor was conservative: ""The best thing about this game is that a team from Kentucky will play for the national title."" (Kansas plays Ohio State in the other semifinal) Imagine the high-fives among the staff for walking that non-committal tightrope. Others in the state have been less cautious. In a state defined by its basketball loyalties perhaps even more strongly than its political allegiances, the jump circle and political circle sometimes merge. John Yarmuth and Ben Chandler are Kentucky Democrats who sit on the same side of the aisle in Congress, but will be on decidedly different sides of this rivalry. ""The teams are both so good, I'm sure that whoever prevails, it will be the experience of the teams' seasoned upperclassmen that leads the way,"" said Yarmuth, whose district includes Louisville. Boom. Kentucky has only one seasoned upperclassman who plays regularly. Chandler, whose district includes Lexington, issued his own subtle jab, saying, ""I think it's great that everyone in Kentucky can be a part of the Wildcats' journey to another championship."" Boom. That's not exactly a part that Louisville fans will relish playing. When it comes to basketball, Kentucky is both a red (Louisville) and a blue (Kentucky) state. The state's most iconic architectural features, the Twin Spires at Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby illustrate the split. One is lit red, the other blue, for the entire week. SI on Kentucky-Louisville . The latest poll conducted by the Louisville Courier-Journal found that about 65 percent of the state's largest city identified themselves as Louisville fans. Out in the state, that number was 91 percent who backed Kentucky hoops. But wherever they are this week, there is conflict. On Tuesday, in a dialysis clinic in Georgetown, Kentucky, police were called when two patients got into a fistfight over the game. Ed Wilson, 69, was actually hooked up to a machine when he heard Charles Taylor, 72 and a Louisville fan, ""start to run his mouth,"" Wilson said. Taylor said he was talking to another fan when Wilson, ""told me to shut up and gave me the finger."" So, dialysis machine or no dialysis machine, Taylor went over and hit Wilson -- and this longtime rivalry added another chapter to its lore. The rivalry, of course, has roots that run much deeper than sports. Louisville, the state's largest city, has always had a contentious relationship with the rural rest of the state. And basketball has played a major role in the identity of this state, has always been a point of pride for a population often on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. For much of their basketball histories, the teams did not play. Legendary Kentucky coach Adolph Rupp didn't believe in playing the smaller state schools. An example of Rupp's influence: He once raised his hands in practice and said, ""Lord, please send me a man who is worth a damn!"" At that moment, then-governor (and once commissioner of baseball) Happy Chandler entered the gym. When Chandler laughed, Rupp told him he didn't care if he was the governor, if he couldn't be quiet, he'd have to leave. The University of Kentucky called the shots, and these teams did not play for 24 years until the NCAA Tournament threw them together in a 1983 regional game dubbed ""The Dream Game,"" by fans in the state. Before that, all Kentuckians could do was argue over which team was better. Someone manufactured a board game with dice and player cards that could be used to simulate a contest. But resentment seemed to fester. In a vintage 1983 video before the NCAA Tournament, Kentucky coach Joe B. Hall tried to end an on-camera interview when he was asked about why the Wildcats wouldn't play the Cardinals. Louisville's Denny Crum, young and confident, took great pleasure in baiting Kentucky and its fans. Once Louisville won that contest, the teams agreed to a yearly series, even as the state legislature was moving to force them to play. But none of the subsequent meetings has had as much at stake as Saturday's game -- a trip to the national championship. NCAA.com: Inside the Final Four . The rivalry between the coaches -- Rick Pitino at Louisville and John Calipari at Kentucky -- only intensifies matters. Pitino coached Kentucky to a national championship in 1996 and his name hangs in the rafters at Kentucky's Rupp Arena, while Calipari is seeking his first national title. The two men have been polite this week. It's unlikely their state will follow suit. It's hard to describe to those outside the state how this rivalry is woven into its very fabric. A handful of weddings have been rescheduled. People wear UK or U of L T-shirts under their clothes to church. Businesses will close early on Saturday. One local high school Hall of Fame had to reschedule its ceremonies because inductees were going to miss it to watch the game. Early in the week, on Craigslist, a man claiming to be a Kentucky fan offered his wife in exchange for a Final Four ticket. It might've been a joke. It's testament to the particular brand of March Madness in this state that no one is really sure. From the statehouses to the coffee houses, time is going to stop on Saturday night, and one fan base is going to dread going back to work on Monday morning.","Saturday's game pits the University of Louisville against the University of Kentucky .

"(WIRED) -- Google is making plans to turn its +1 button into a crowdsourcing tool that helps it re-order search results and fight web spam. While not surprising, the move would bring Google's search engine into the social networking era, while simultaneously creating a new avenue for blackhats to manipulate search results and potentially incurring the wrath of trust-busting authorities. Google confirmed its plans in an e-mail to Wired.com. ""Google will study the clicks on +1 buttons as a signal that influences the ranking and appearance of websites in search results,"" a spokesman wrote. ""The purpose of any ranking signal is to improve overall search quality. For +1's and other social ranking signals, as with any new ranking signal, we'll be starting carefully and learning how those signals are related to quality."" But these plans are a touchy subject for the search giant, especially given the scrutiny that Google is under from regulators in Washington and Europe over complaints that the company's results favor its own products over those of other companies. As if to underscore that point, Google prefaced its admission of the +1 search integration project to Wired.com with a statement downplaying its potential significance: ""There are more than 200 signals that we use to determine the rank of a website, and last year we made more than 500 improvements to the algorithm."" Introduced in March, the +1 sharing button debuted with little incentive for web surfers to click on it. If you +1-ed a story on a website that embedded the button, your profile picture would display next to the URL when a friend of yours ran a search with results that included that URL. WIRED: Google+ button lets you share, finally . But last week, the button entered adolescence, and can now be used to post stories to friends and followers on Google+, much as the Like button functions for Facebook. So the next step of using what people are liking, sharing and buzzing about online to rearrange search results is obvious enough. Google dipped its toe into these waters with Twitter by licensing its stream of Tweets, but that agreement ended before Google got so far as to figure out how to do more with the fire hose of real-time information than just decorate pre-computed search results with Tweeters' profile pictures. And as for Facebook? Google would love to get at its data -- the way that Bing is already -- but the two companies go together like toothpaste and orange juice. Facebook will likely never let Google anywhere near its data stream, which meant that Google had to build in its own social network. But therein lies the rub. If Google's search results become heavily dependent on social signals from Google+, then there's going to be heavy pressure on the net's websites to embed the Google+ button. And depending on where you work -- say, Facebook or the Justice Department -- that could look like Google is unfairly using its search engine might to boost its Facebook alternative. That might explain why Forbes killed a story by Kashmir Hill entitled ""Stick Google Plus Buttons On Your Pages, Or Your Search Traffic Suffers"" which was seemingly based on information from a meeting with Google ad representatives. On August 18, Hill wrote, ""the message in this meeting was clear: ""Put a Plus One button on your pages or your search traffic will suffer."" Hill followed up with Google's press team. which gave Hill the same carefully couched answer it gave Wired. But the story quickly disappeared from Forbes' website and from the Google cache, though it was noticed and saved by the Raven Tools SEO blog. One guesses the tone of the post -- and its headline -- rankled someone somewhere. Forbes, Hill and Google all declined to talk on the record about the post that disappeared into the memory hole. WIRED: How Facebook could beat Google and win the net . That silence says as much as you need to know about the touchiness involved in integrating a Google +1 button with Google's search box. But Google's biggest weakness is the possibility that someone will figure out how to build a better search engine -- and there's many who bet the way to do that is to make search involve more of a human touch and less of a machine's. indeed, Google's interest in incorporating +1s into its search ranking algorithm might also explain Google's hard line position in the so-called Nym wars. Google is being adamant that users of its new social networking tool use their real names. In its zeal to root out fakers and people using pseudonyms, Google has deleted legitimate profiles and raised the ire of those who defend the need for pseudonyms on the internet's identity platforms. But if Google's going to start using those +1 votes, the company is virtually inviting the world's spammers and blackhat SEO magicians to flood its social networking system with fake profiles and fake votes -- potentially ruining it and possibly making the problem of search spam even worse.

"(CNN) -- For me, predicting the future is a family business. My grandmother was a professional clairvoyant (called, unimaginatively, Madam Clair) and used to offer palm readings and crystal ball gazing in her living room. Growing up around tarot cards and horoscopes has left me a bit cynical about making firm predictions, if only because they always seemed to be ""You will meet a tall, dark stranger."" But it's not impossible to make some intelligent guesses about the political world in the coming months based on the information we already have. Here are five of them. 1. The 2016 presidential election will start very early. In fact, it sort of began before the last election even ended, when Vice President Joe Biden told reporters that he didn't think 2012 was the last race he would run. In recent weeks, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, have laid out some philosophical visions, and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has tried to brand himself as the Republican Party's Mr. Sane. We can expect some casual visits to Iowa or New Hampshire by outgoing Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, but an outsider candidate worth watching will be Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland. He has yet to establish himself on the national stage, but he has a strong reputation among grassroots liberals. What Americans want in 2013 . 2. Guns will become a big legislative issue. We're not going to see the kind of action that Piers Morgan wants, but the tragedy at Sandy Hook has certainly started a debate that should be continued by the new Congress. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, has promised to introduce legislation on Day One that will be similar to the federal assault weapons ban, which passed in 1994 and expired in 2004, and she has likely support from the White House and conservative Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. But we'll see tough opposition from Republicans. 3. No, the tea party won't go away. It's true that the anti-government movement has had a very bad year in 2012 and that it has been somewhat sidelined by House Speaker John Boehner, but that doesn't spell the end. First, the tea party has planted some strong roots in online activism and fund-raising: The big conservative event of 2013 will be CPAC, and only the tea party has the resources to dominate it. Second, Boehner might find his leadership challenged on January 3 and be forced to accept the movement's continued influence within the GOP. Third, the issue agenda remains favorable to the tea party. Tax cuts, balanced budgets and gun control are exactly the kind of mobilizers that are likely to revive the right. The tea party disappeared from view in 2012 only because it was eclipsed by the drive to elect Mitt Romney. Now that the debate has moved back from the party/personal to the substantive/legislative, the tea party will capitalize. A big year for issues in the courts . 4. Gay marriage will return as a big talking point in the summer. In June, the Supreme Court will likely make a decision on the fate of California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act. My instinct is that the justices will make decisions that satisfy no one, perhaps ruling against DOMA but accepting Proposition 8. Certainly it feels unlikely that they'd want to give a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of gay marriage, which would mean pushing the law in a direction that very few state governments seem willing to go. Either way, President Barack Obama's victory in 2012 didn't end the culture war; it just evened the odds a little. From the perspective of a European, America remains a remarkably socially conservative country that has yet to be sold on marriage equality. Opinion: America on the cusp of social change . 5. We will come to miss Newt Gingrich. One of the real joys of the 2012 race was covering the campaign of ""The Newtster,"" a man with a chin for every insult he delivered. He jumped to the front of the nomination pack in early 2012 partly because GOP conservatives had few other options (one South Carolina operative described him to me as ""an imperfect vehicle"") but also because of the sheer strength of his personality. And while the rest of the party limited itself to discussing petty matters such as health care or the federal budget, Newt's plans ranged from getting school kids to work as janitors to building mines on the moon. He seemed genuinely surprised that the cash-strapped voters didn't buy his idea of conquering the galaxy, but a prophet in his own land is always without honor. In a hundred years time, when the American colonists of Sirius 3 are still debating gun control, don't be surprised if Newt isn't revisited as a man before his time. Perhaps he'll make the back of the $10,000 bill. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.","Tim Stanley: There are a few reasonable political predictions that can be made for 2013 .
For one thing, he says, the 2016 election will start early; Biden already dropping hints .
He says gun control and gay marriage will be big issues in coming months .
He says the tea party will rise again, and we will all realize we miss Newt Gingrich ."
"(TIME.com) -- For many Americans, the passing of Thanksgiving means it's time to buckle down on Holiday shopping—but for cinemaphiles it's time to go to the movies. As studios seek to capitalize on the availability of audiences during the holidays and to get their films released, at least in limited distribution, in time to be eligible for the Academy Awards (nominations for which are due Jan. 3, according to the Los Angeles Times), movie theaters tend to fill up with some of the most Oscar-friendly fare of the whole year. Here's your super-condensed guide to which holiday-season movies are shaping up to be contenders, including a lesser-known film that's already a proven winner. Movie: The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey . In Theaters: Dec. 14 . Directed By: Peter Jackson . Starring: Martin Freeman, Benedict Cumberbatch, Hugo Weaving, Ian McKellan, Richard Armitage, Andy Serkis . Oscar Potential: Warner Bros. has announced that the movie based on the Tolkien classic is vying for nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Actor (Freeman), Best Supporting Actor (McKellan, Armitage, Serkis), Best Supporting Actress (Cate Blanchett), Cinematography and pretty much every technical award possible. If The Hobbit lives up to the precedent set by the Lord of the Rings trilogy (which finished off with a 11 Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, for Return of the King), that long list of goals doesn't seem so outlandish. The movie promises an epic quest plot and the visual beauty we expect from LOTR movies—plus even more of Andy Serkis' impressive but not-yet-Oscar-winning motion-capture acting work as Gollum. Movie: Zero Dark Thirty . In Theaters: Dec. 19 (limited) Directed by: Kathryn Bigelow . Starring: Chris Pratt, Jessica Chastain, Joel Edgerton . Oscar Potential: Sony Pictures is also putting forward Zero Dark Thirty—the movie about the hunt for and eventual capture of Osama bin Laden, the release date for which was pushed back after some said it would boost President Obama's chances in the election—for almost every award for which it's eligible, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor (with seven different actors to be considered for that last category). The story of how the movie was made involves confidential secrets and top-level access, but the story it tells is even more extreme: Chastain plays a CIA operative who is convinced that she'll be the one to bring down bin Laden, and the screenplay packs years of complicated diplomacy and tracking into a tight and suspenseful package. Bigelow surprised many in 2010 when her The Hurt Locker beat out Avatar and took home the Best Picture and Best Director awards, but it wouldn't too much of a shock if she did it again. Movie: The Impossible . In Theaters: Dec. 21 . Directed by: Juan Antonio Bayona . Starring: Naomi Watts, Ewan McGregor . Oscar Potential: This movie tells the true story of a family torn apart when the 2004 tsunami struck during their family vacation to Thailand and how they found each other again. It's a tearjerker with an impressive backstory, and director Bayona could pull out a nomination, but the more likely recipients of Oscar nods would be the two stars—particularly Watts, playing the mother whose quest made The Impossible possible and on whose survival the story hinges. The special effects that bring the tsunami to life, creating a wall of water and debris that batters the characters, may also be found worthy of recognition. Movie: Les Misérables . In Theaters: Dec. 25 . Directed by: Tom Hopper . Starring: Anne Hathaway, Hugh Jackman, Amanda Seyfried, Russell Crowe, Helena Bonham Carter, Sacha Baron Cohen . Oscar Potential: Universal Pictures wants Academy members to consider the film version of the classic stage musical (and even more classic Victor Hugo novel) about 19th-century French student revolutionaries and a convict-turned-mayor for Best Picture, Director, Actor (Jackman), Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Adapted Screenplay, technical awards and Best Original Song (for ""Suddenly,"" the token new song that most stage-to-film musicals tack on). The movie has been getting lots of attention for the groundbreaking tactic of actually letting the actors sing live rather than having them lip sync to a recording of their own voices—visually and vocally, it's a winning combination that leaves the movie with strong chances in the major all-around categories. Movie: Django Unchained . In Theaters: Dec. 25 . Directed by: Quentin Tarantino . Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Jonah Hill, Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Foxx, Kerry Washington, Christoph Waltz . Oscar Potential: Tarantino takes on history in his latest movie, featuring Jamie Foxx as a slave named Django whose freedom is bought in exchange for his services as a bounty hunter. DiCaprio plays the plantation owner who still has Django's wife in his possession. The movie won a screenwriting award at the Hollywood Film Festival and could do so again. The actors are all Oscar-level performers—best picture's not out of the question either. Movie: Amour . In Theaters: Dec. 19 . Directed by: Michael Haneke . Starring: Isabelle Huppert, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Emmanuelle Riva . Oscar Potential: So Amour isn't getting the mega advertising push that the other holiday movies will. And it's been out, at festivals, since May. While it does hit some theaters Dec. 19 in a limited release, it may take a while for it to get to your town. Still, don't underestimate this one. The movie—about an elderly couple whose love is strained by illness—premiered at Cannes, where Haneke won the Palme d'Or and the movie won major acclaim from critics. Even though the film is in French, expect it to break free from the foreign-language category. (And even if you don't get a chance to see Amour before the year ends, check out the parody Michael Haneke account on Twitter for some Cannes-inflected laughs...and only a modicum of spoilers.)

"Washington (CNN) -- Chief Justice John Roberts is warning leaders in the other two branches of the federal government that the pending ""fiscal cliff"" would ""inevitably result in the delay or denial of justice for the people the courts serve."" In his annual year-end report on the federal judiciary, Roberts on Monday said the federal courts have already made significant cuts in their funding, representing only about two-tenths of 1% of the entire federal budget. He said a prolonged reduction would be extremely hard to overcome. ""I therefore encourage the president and Congress to be especially attentive to the needs of the judicial branch and provide the resources necessary for its operations,"" said the chief justice. ""Those vital resource needs include the appointment of an adequate number of judges to keep current on pending cases. At the close of 2012, 27 of the existing judicial vacancies are designated as presenting judicial emergencies."" Roberts made his remarks in a 16-page summary of U.S. courts, part of his role as head of the entire federal judiciary. President Barack Obama said Monday an agreement to avert the ""fiscal cliff"" of automatic tax increases and spending cuts appeared to be ""within sight."" Senate and House leaders were continuing to meet behind closed doors with White House officials, including Vice President Joe Biden, to reach at least a temporary tax and spending agreement. Roberts noted the judicial branch generally receives less attention when it comes to its spending, but an ""aggressive"" cost-containment strategy has been in place since 2004. ""Our country faces new challenges, including the much publicized 'fiscal cliff' and the longer-term problem of a truly extravagant and burgeoning national debt,"" Roberts said. ""No one seriously doubts that the country's fiscal ledger has gone awry. The public properly looks to its elected officials to craft a solution. We in the judiciary stand outside the political arena, but we can continue to do our part to address the financial challenges within our sphere."" The federal court system and its administrative offices operate on an annual budget of nearly $7 billion. That includes judges trying and hearing cases and appeals, both criminal and civil; managing pretrial, defender, and probation offices; and maintaining the bankruptcy court system. Most of the money -- about 62% -- goes for personnel costs. Social media users vent over fiscal cliff . Roberts said the Supreme Court itself requested a 2.8% decrease in its $75.55 million operations budget in fiscal year 2012. He added a 3.7% decrease is expected for fiscal year 2014. There currently are 75 judicial vacancies, according to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Thirty-two nominations by the president are pending, awaiting Senate confirmation. There are 874 federal judges, including the nine-member Supreme Court, the district and appeals courts, and the nine-member Court of International Trade. Past year-end reports from the current chief justice have focused on budget cutbacks, frozen salaries, rising caseloads, and court security. These summaries have been an annual tradition for about four decades. They were begun by the late Chief Justice Warren Burger as a way to speak to the executive branch and Congress, the judiciary itself, and the public at large.","A prolonged reduction in funding would be hard to overcome, Chief Justice Roberts says .

"(CNN) -- Ralph Verdi has been working for nearly 30 hours. You won't hear him complain. He says yes and no ma'am when a reporter stops him to ask him a question, even though he's helping lead the rescue effort of three New Jersey towns that are drowning. Verdi works for the police in Little Ferry, a town of about 10,000 people that was flooded Tuesday as water kicked up by Sandy barreled over a natural berm. It took only about 30 minutes for Moonachie, a town of about 2,700 residents in Bergen County along the Hackensack River, to be nearly 6 feet under water. It's also bad in another town, Carlstadt. Superstorm Sandy's toll: Mounting deaths, historic destruction, stranded residents . The surge floated rail cars onto the New Jersey Turnpike as railways were littered with trees and power lines. There are houses in the middle of Route 35, and much of FunTown Amusement Pier in Seaside Park is washed out. A woman waved and shouted for help from her front porch as rescuers scrambled to save people in Bergen County. Hundreds of people have been whisked from rising water in their homes, many who climbed into boats that have navigated the murky water. Some wore pajamas and were barefoot. Mothers carried diaper bags and crying kids. Thousands more remain stranded, local officials said, in as much as 6 feet of water. ""We're in search-and-rescue mode,"" said Jeanne Baratta, chief of staff to the Bergen County executive. There are some reported injuries, but no one has learned of any deaths, Baratta said. Gov. Chris Christie was as blunt as he's ever been. Christie told reporters that he didn't ""give a damn"" about the presidential election, which will happen in a week. He said his only concern was making sure New Jersey residents were safe. Sandy's devastation is ""beyond anything I thought I'd ever see,"" he said. ""The level of devastation at the Jersey Shore is unthinkable."" New Jersey officials are ""nowhere near"" allowing many residents to return to their homes in flooded areas, Christie said. Chris Christie: Jersey Shore devastation 'unthinkable' He plans to fly Tuesday to visit one of the most ravaged towns, but it's unclear if there will be a place for the plane to land due to all the damage. Christie also said that every rail line in the state has been severely damaged. The governor added he's confident that President Barack Obama and the federal government will work with New Jersey and that the state will rebuild. Obama will tour damaged areas of the state Wednesday, the White House said. While Christie spoke, rescuers in Moonachie charged up to second floors of homes, with helicopters hovering overhead. State police and the National Guard are helping. Rescue workers from Virginia are expected to arrive Tuesday afternoon, said Baratta, the Bergen County official. ""The rescue workers -- they're phenomenal,"" she said. ""They're pulling together."" A mother in Bergen told CNN that she and her two children were about to go to sleep when they heard a loud noise, looked outside and saw people running in the street. Google maps Sandy flooding, power outages . In an instant, water started rushing into their home. They didn't bother to pack anything up but yelled for each other and struggled out the door. The superstorm knocked out power along the Jersey City waterfront. CNN iReporter Marc Anderson, a photographer, said the power in his apartment building went out at 9 p.m. Monday and the basement filled up with about 8 inches of water. The sewers backed up, he said, and the smell was terrible. The neighborhood grocery store was a madhouse, he said, but everyone was just glad to be safe. Back in Moonachie, The Bergen Record spoke with Jan Gulino, who lives in a trailer park. She was among about 100 people at the Bergen County Technical High School shelter. She said she was watching TV at 1 a.m. when neighbors knocked on her door to tell her that her car was in deep water. Together, they managed to push the car to higher ground. A rescue crew arrived and ordered her out of her house because there was kerosene in the water. So Gulino grabbed her boxer, Max, and got on a boat, along with six neighbors. She was taken by truck, then bus, to the high school. She's just happy to be with Max. ""I wasn't going to go anywhere,"" she told the paper, ""without him."" How you can help .

"London (CNN) -- Celebrated ""Harry Potter"" author J.K. Rowling says she feels ""duped and angry"" over British Prime Minister David Cameron's response to a major inquiry into phone hacking and other abuses by the press. Rowling was one of hundreds of witnesses to testify to the Leveson Inquiry into media standards and ethics, set up in the wake of a phone-hacking scandal at Rupert Murdoch's now-shuttered News of the World tabloid. The judge who led the inquiry, Lord Justice Leveson, released his long-awaited report Thursday, in which he recommended an independent regulator be set up by the press, which would be backed by new laws to make sure it meets certain standards. Cameron, of the Conservative Party, supported Brian Leveson's call for an independent regulator but said he was not convinced that legislation is needed to underpin the new body. Rowling expressed her disappointment in the prime minister's decision in a statement posted Friday on the website of Hacked Off, a group campaigning for media reform. ""Having taken David Cameron's assurances in good faith at the outset of the inquiry he set up, I am merely one among many who feel duped and angry in its wake,"" she wrote. ""I thought long and hard about the possible consequences to my family of giving evidence and finally decided to do so because I have made every possible attempt to protect my children's privacy under the present system, and failed."" Rowling is concerned that members of the public who do not have the money to fight the press in the courts, over such abuses as invasion of privacy or libel, will continue to suffer. ""Those who have suffered the worst, most painful and least justifiable kinds of mistreatment at the hands of the press, people who have become newsworthy because of the press's own errors or through unspeakable private tragedy, are those least likely to be able to defend themselves or to seek proper redress,"" she said. ""Without statutory underpinning Leveson's recommendations will not work. We will be left with yet another voluntary system from which the press can walk away."" Rowling also questioned why millions of pounds had been spent on the inquiry if the prime minister did not intend to follow its recommendations. She urged people to sign a petition set up by Hacked Off if they agreed. The group has already collected more than 50,000 signatures from the public in support of the full implementation of Leveson's recommendations. Cameron will attend a meeting Tuesday between UK newspaper editors and Culture Secretary Maria Miller, a spokesman for 10 Downing Street said Saturday. Cameron and Miller will be pushing the press to set up an independent watchdog, as suggested in Leveson's report, the spokesman said. ""They will make it clear that they (the press) can't drag their heels,"" he said. Cameron's stance last week had caused immediate divisions within the country's coalition government. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who leads the Liberal Democrats in the coalition, said he believes new legislation is needed to ensure the regulator's long-term independence. Ed Miliband, leader of the opposition Labour Party, also said he favors full implementation of Leveson's recommendations, including the new legislation. In his report, Leveson said he had no desire to jeopardize the freedom of the press, which he acknowledged plays a ""vital"" role in safeguarding the public interest, but that changes are needed to tackle abuses. The British press has ignored its own code of conduct on ""far too many occasions over the last decade,"" causing ""real hardship"" and sometimes wreaking ""havoc with the lives of innocent people,"" Leveson said. The independent inquiry was first announced by Cameron in July 2011 in response to public outrage over a newspaper phone-hacking scandal. The trigger was the allegation that in 2002, the voicemail of missing 13-year-old Milly Dowler had been hacked by an investigator working for the News of the World before she was found murdered. The furor led to the closure of the newspaper, run by News International, a subsidiary of the Murdoch-owned News Corp. CNN's Per Nyberg contributed to this report.","""I am merely one among many who feel duped and angry,"" says author J.K. Rowling .

"(CNN) -- Muslims in Europe face discrimination in education, employment and religious freedom, an Amnesty International report said. ""Muslim women are being denied jobs and girls prevented from attending regular classes just because they wear traditional forms of dress, such as the headscarf. Men can be dismissed for wearing beards associated with Islam,"" said Marco Perolini, Amnesty International's expert on discrimination. ""Rather than countering these prejudices, political parties and public officials are all too often pandering to them in their quest for votes."" The report, titled ""Choice and Prejudice: Discrimination Against Muslims in Europe"" and issued on Monday, details the problem, with a focus on Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Amnesty International raised the issue, as it has done before, of restrictions ""on the establishment of places of worship and prohibitions on full-face veils."" The report said employers have been permitted ""to discriminate on the grounds that religious or cultural symbols will jar with clients or colleagues or that a clash exists with a company's corporate image or its 'neutrality.' ""Wearing religious and cultural symbols and dress is part of the right of freedom of expression. It is part of the right to freedom of religion or belief -- and these rights must be enjoyed by all faiths equally."" Perolini said. ""While everyone has the right to express their cultural, traditional or religious background by wearing a specific form of dress, no one should be pressurized or coerced to do so,"" he said. ""General bans on particular forms of dress that violate the rights of those freely choosing to dress in a particular way are not the way to do this."" There is legislation prohibiting employment discrimination in Belgium, France and the Netherlands, but ""it has not been appropriately implemented,"" the report says. European Union legislation ""prohibiting discrimination on the ground of religion or belief in the area of employment seems to be toothless across Europe, as we observe a higher rate of unemployment among Muslims, and especially Muslim women of foreign origin,"" Perolini said. The report said pupils haven't been allowed ""to wear the headscarf or other religious and traditional dress at school in many countries including Spain, France, Belgium, Switzerland and the Netherlands."" ""Any restriction on the wearing of religious and cultural symbols and dress in schools must be based on assessment of the needs in each individual case. General bans risk adversely (affecting) Muslims girls' access to education and violating their rights to freedom of expression and to manifest their beliefs."" Perolini said. The right to establish places of worship ""is being restricted in some European countries, despite state obligations to protect, respect and fulfill this right,"" Amnesty International said. For example, the Swiss Constitution ""has specifically targeted Muslims with the prohibition of the construction of minarets,"" it said. Muslims in the Catalonian region of Spain must pray outdoors ""because existing prayer rooms are too small to accommodate all the worshippers and requests to build mosques are being disputed as incompatible with the respect of Catalan traditions and culture."" ""There is a groundswell of opinion in many European countries that Islam is all right and Muslims are OK so long as they are not too visible. This attitude is generating human rights violations and needs to be challenged,"" Perolini said. Muslims from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds have migrated to or sought asylum in Europe over the decades and have ""often acquired the citizenship of the country to which they or their relatives have migrated."" Negative and stereotypical attitudes have emerged over what has been seen as the ""unwillingness by Muslims to integrate"" or the intention to ""impose values at odds with European identity,"" Amnesty said. ""At times, public opinion and political parties do not distinguish between practices clearly violating human rights, such as forced marriage, and other practices relating to the exercise of freedom of expression and religion or belief, such as the choice to wear a headscarf or others forms of religious and cultural symbols and dress."" the report said. After the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, ""perceptions worsened"" and ""a rising level of hostility"" unfolded. But the report said there also had been ""negative views"" before the attacks. Citing 2010 statistics, the report said ""Muslims made up less than 10 per cent of the population in any Western and Northern European country: 6 percent in Belgium, 7.5 percent in France, 5.5 percent in the Netherlands, 2.3 percent in Spain, 5.7 percent in Switzerland, 5 percent in Germany and 4.6 percent in the United Kingdom."" Almost half of the Muslim population in France and 55 percent of the Muslim population in Belgium hold national citizenship. In contrast, less than 1 percent in Switzerland hold Swiss citizenship. The report says the study ""does not imply that discrimination on grounds of religion or belief exclusively affects Muslims."" It said Christian evangelicals in Catalonia also cited barriers ""in establishing places of worship."" And, it said, ""Jews are also still discriminated against in Europe and violent attacks perpetrated with an anti-Semitic bias remain a matter of concern.""","The report focuses on Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland .
Political parties ""are all too often pandering"" to political biases, the report says .

"(CNN) -- There is rarely a dull moment in the career of Mario Balotelli but the controversial striker has at least been prepared to take his medicine in the latest spat with his club Manchester City. The Italian striker had appealed to an English Premier League tribunal after he was fined for a poor disciplinary record during City's title-winning season in 2011/12. Balotelli, signed from Inter Milan by City boss Roberto Mancini for $39.1 million in 2010, missed a total of 11 domestic and European games through suspension and was reportedly fined two weeks wages by his club as a result. The 22-year-old appealed the decision and his lawyers had been preparing to state his case at a Premier League tribunal on Wednesday. Manchester derby thriller marred by 'English disease' But a statement released by the club confirmed the Italy international had dropped his appeal after the two parties resolved their differences. ""After amicable talks between the parties, as a sign of respect for Roberto Mancini, the supporters and the club, Mario Balotelli has chosen to accept a two week fine levied upon him by the club and withdraw his disciplinary appeal, which was due to be heard by a Premier League panel,"" it read. ""Mario remains available for selection for all forthcoming fixtures."" Balotelli has infuriated his manager on several occasions during his two seasons at the club, Mancini stating only recently that the striker needed to train harder to get into the team. Twice Balotelli hasn't made City's 25-man squad in the Premier League this campaign and he was substituted at halftime in City's recent 3-2 derby defeat to neighbors Manchester United. Despite his disciplinary record, Balotelli did set up a goal for Argentina striker Sergio Aguero that secured City their first title in 44 years on a dramatic final day of last season. That came after Mancini said Balotelli may never play for the club again after he was sent off during a defeat at Arsenal that had seemed to spell the end to their title campaign. Balotelli played a key role in Italy's team as they made the final of Euro 2012, where they were beaten 4-1 by World champions Spain.","Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli settles his dispute with the English champions .

"(CNN)  -- As a player who has won African and Olympic titles with Cameroon and Spanish league and Champions League titles with Barcelona as well as three African footballer of the year awards, Samuel Eto'o expects to command respect. Barcelona star Samuel Eto'o is one of a number of top footballers who have spoken out against racism. Yet Eto's spectacular career in Spain, where his goalscoring prowess have made him one of the world's most feared and admired strikers, has been punctuated by incidents in which he has been the victim of sickening racist abuse. Memorably, Eto'o started to walk off the pitch in protest during a match at Real Zaragoza in 2006 after being taunted by home supporters chanting monkey noises only to be persuaded to return by his Barcelona teammates and the club's coach, Frank Rijkaard. ""I was leaving the field and if it wasn't for Rijkaard, my teammates and the referee, I would have done it,"" Eto'o recalls. ""In that moment you start thinking whether there is something wrong with being black, you know? But I think we are all humans, everyone's blood is the same color and we all have the same heart. I don't see any differences in skin color."" While Spanish football's reputation for sophistication and flair has made la Liga one of the most attractive and marketable competitions in world football, attitudes in the stands have not always kept apace with the cosmopolitanism on display on the pitch. Nor has positive leadership always come from the top. Real Zaragoza were fined just 9,000 euros ($13,800) for the abuse directed by their supporters at Eto'o. And in 2005, the Spanish national coach Luis Aragones -- currently steering Spain through Euro 2008 -- was at the center of controversy when he used a racist slur to describe French striker Thierry Henry, now a teammate of Eto'o's at Barcelona. Eto'o admits that racism is so widespread in Spain that he no longer dares take his family to matches. ""Racism can happen anywhere and I don't want them to see it,"" he told CNN. ""It's a sad situation in football. In my opinion the problem is getting bigger and the people that should come up with a solution are not doing it. So to protect my family, I don't take them to the game."" With black players regularly subjected to monkey chants in Spanish stadiums, Eto'o believes determined action is needed before verbal abuse spills over into physical violence. ""The authorities are working to find solutions. But they must find them. We can't wait until some crazy fan jumps from his seat and kills a black player before measures are taken. The players are revolted by it and we try to help each other. But the authorities must find a way to set an example."" One of the saddest aspects of racism in football is that many of those who participate in taunting colored players would never dream of behaving the same way on the street, at work or at home. But Eto'o fears attitudes in stadiums may reflect wider social attitudes which find expression amid the passion, emotion and anonymity of the football crowd . ""Football stadiums are just a reflection of what is going on in society,"" Eto'o says. ""Many times in stadiums people just feel more relaxed and say what they think when they're somewhere else."" He believes the Spanish media has a key part to play in tackling racism in football, not just by highlighting incidents of abuse but in creating an environment in which racism in the stands is no longer quietly condoned. ""I don't make the decisions, but something needs to be done. Right now, the media here pays attention to the incidents of racism, but doesn't discuss solutions. That's the tragedy. They use these images to create an impact rather than to identify racism as a problem and to urge people to find a solution. TV has a lot of weight on public opinion and what the industry must do is make people feel a social responsibility to stop this kind of behavior.""","Samuel Eto'o: ""We can't wait until some crazy fan kills a black player""

"(CNN) -- James Bond - licence to kill. Cristiano Ronaldo -- licence to thrill. One has brought down tyrants, saved Queen and country and entertained generations of fans for over 50 years. The other has produced moments of magic which have defied all logic with a right foot more deadly than Bond's Walter PPK gun. But neither 007 nor CR7, have worked out a way to combat their latest enemy - an invasion of privacy. It's a topic which has left Daniel Craig, the man who produced a stellar performance as Bond in the recent Skyfall epic, both shaken and stirred. Craig, who first played Bond six years ago in Casino Royale, has seen his life change irreversibly with his public life now constantly afflicted. Culture shock . While Ronaldo may enjoy a life of glamor, the fact that he cannot even pop out to his local McDonalds without being bothered continues to irk him. His very public relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk, a celebrity in her own right, has brought extra attention to one of the football's most famous faces. Both men have their photos plastered across billboards worldwide, their pictures on television commercials broadcast around the globe and their private lives played out on the internet. So why do the likes of Craig and Ronaldo, who make millions of dollars from their public image, believe they deserve privacy? For the 27-year-old Real Madrid superstar, who hails from the quiet and picturesque island of Madeira, it has come as something of a culture shock. Ronaldo admits perceived arrogance has cost him . ""Yeah, of course,"" Ronaldo told CNN after being asked whether he wished he could lead a normal life. ""Not just now, but the last five, six years. ""Sometimes I wish to go somewhere, shopping, McDonalds... not a great example, or to have coffee and people recognize me. ""We are famous and we have to deal with that."" Smart phones . With the advanced technology of smart phones and the advent of Twitter and other social media networks, stars are far more cautious when stepping out of their front doors. For Craig, who undertook huge lengths to keep his wedding to fellow film star Rachel Weisz a complete secret, the right to privacy is key. ""How could I go into a pub and have a few pints of Guinness and get a bit rowdy and sing a few songs when some tw*t's going to film me and put it all over the internet?"" Craig was recently quoted as saying in the British media. ""The difference, and this has changed rapidly in about 10 years, is smart phones. ""They are the f***ing bane of my life. I get people who just take pictures of me with their camera phone while I'm having dinner. I want to get violent and I can't. 'Skyfall' is Bond resurrected and reinvigorated . ""They think it's their right to take a photo of me and I find that incredibly intrusive. But every phone has a camera on it, so how do we stop it? We can't."" Risk . It seems as if nobody in the world of celebrities is untouchable with the Duchess of Cambridge just one of the most recent high profile scandals. The Princess, who was on vacation in France at the time, was snapped by a paparazzo while topless with the photos eventually being published in a French magazine. That case caused a furore and brought up the question of whether those in the public eye have the right to privacy. British privacy should start with British press . The Leveson inquiry, which looked into the culture, practices and ethics of the press, allowed celebrities such as Hugh Grant and Sienna Miller to reveal the harassment they had encountered while in the public eye. But there are those who believe that celebrities can still live a normal life without being encroached upon. ""You can avoid it if you don't crave the attention,"" said PR guru Max Clifford. For every sports star like Ronaldo, there is a Paul Scholes or Xabi Alonso, both of whom manage to stay out of the media eye with little fuss. The key, according to Clifford, is awareness and caution. ""Everyone out there now has phones and can take pictures, in a way, everyone is the press now but you've just got to be sensible,"" he added. How a publicist heads off damaging claims against celebrities . ""If you don't want to be seen with somebody, then don't take the risk. ""I've told clients over and over again, you can't expect the media to build you up and help your career and then turn around and complain about the attention. ""For famous people, it's part of life and you just have to get used to it and deal with it."" Havoc . Dealing with it sounds simple but it can prove far more difficult, depending how high up you are on the fame scale. Even the 'Special One', Jose Mourinho, has found it difficult to cope with the intrusion into his private life since leading Porto to Champions League glory in 2004. Mourinho's world has been turned upside down by the constant attention on Real both in Spain and abroad since moving to Madrid in 2010. 'I hate my social life,' says Mourinho . It has wreaked havoc on his personal life and that of his wife and two children. ""I hate my social life,"" Mourinho told CNN in an exclusive interview. ""I hate not to be a normal father who goes with his son to the son's football match and being there with the other 20 fathers there watching the game. ""I'm at a football match of kids and I have to be there. The people have to come for photos; the people have to come for autographs; the people have to come to insult me; the people have to go behind the goal of my kid and insult my kid of 12. ""So, you know, I would love to be with my family in the street as a normal person and I can't, so I am a completely different person in my private life."" But for now Mourinho, like Ronaldo and Craig, must endure, as they continue their constant battle to secure a right to privacy.","Cristiano Ronaldo struggling to protect his right to privacy .

"La Junta, Colorado (CNN) -- That morning in March 1968 played out like a Hollywood movie: A secret CIA radar station on the top of a mountain in Laos, manned by a small group of Air Force airmen, is overrun by Vietnamese soldiers. One by one, Americans are killed until only four remain. As the sun peeks above the jungle, an American helicopter drops a rescue sling while hovering over the remaining airmen. Chief Master Sgt. Richard Etchberger loads the wounded Americans one by one into the chopper before climbing in himself. As the helicopter roars off, a stray bullet pierces it and hits Etchberger. The men he saved would make it home, but Etchberger wouldn't. He died on the floor of the chopper as it headed off to safety. Fade to black. Roll credits. Except that is where this story really begins for John Daniel. In his last memory of that day, Etchberger is alive and hoisting Daniel, who was shot in both legs, into the helicopter. Daniel passed out, and it wasn't until he woke up at Udorn Air Base in Thailand that he learned that his friend Dick had died saving his life. Today, Etchberger posthumously received the Medal of Honor, the military's highest award for bravery.  His family accepted the award from President Obama at a White House ceremony. Daniel has struggled to make sense of the randomness of that day. ""It's a matter of inches. It could have been anybody, or nobody,"" he said.  ""When a round comes through the bottom of a helicopter, it doesn't know who it's going to hit."" But it was Dick Etchberger and not John Daniel who died that day, and ever since, Daniel has wondered why fate spared him. ""It was a burden,"" he explained.  ""You say, 'Why me? Why am I still alive? The rest of them are dead, how did I manage to make it out alive?' ""You never know who is going or who is not going, but I know I would have gone if it hadn't of been for Dick getting me onto that chopper."" Now 71, Daniel has lived a good life. He stayed in the Air Force until 1979, then spent a few years in the electronics business before opening a bar and doing some accounting. Now he is mostly retired. He was present at the White House on Tuesday when Obama gave the Medal of Honor to Etchberger's family. He lives in a tidy home in small-town Colorado with his wife. He has three grown kids, 13 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. ""I have one grandchild to carry on my status. He's in the Air Force, active duty,"" he said. A framed photo of that grandson, Airman 1st Class Jerry W. Daniel, sits on a shelf in the living room alongside a painting depicting his grandfather being hoisted into the helicopter as Etchberger looks on: an artist's rendering of his last memory of Etchberger. Daniel knows that if not for the bravery of Etchberger 42 years ago, it could easily be someone else sitting in this living room, living this life. ""I don't know why me, but it is,"" he said.  ""And Dick's presence is in my life every day."" He said he thinks back often to his last moments with Dick Etchberger. ""I said 'Dick, Dick, we're not going to get out of here!' and he says, 'I know, say your last prayers, that's all you can do.' "" Daniel's prayers were answered that day in Laos. Today, he prays for the wisdom to make good on a debt he can never repay. ""It has to be that God is not done with me on the face of the earth yet. Thanks to Dick Etchberger, I'm still alive to do something,"" he said.","Richard Etchberger lost his life in 1968 saving fellow airmen, including John Daniel .

"(CNN) -- Dear 2012, now that you're gone, please take these lame words with you: trending, spoiler alert, bucket list, superfood, guru and job creators. Oh yeah, and don't forget yolo. That's the message from scholars at Lake Superior State University. For the 38th straight year, the tiny state college tucked away in Michigan's Upper Peninsula unveiled on Monday its list of useless, overused or misused terms: 12 words or phrases the school wants ""banished"" from the English language in 2013. ""I'm in the word banishment business,"" admits university PR director Tom Pink, who helped whittle down the list from thousands of nominations submitted to the school's website. ""There's a slightly serious side to this, but mostly we're trying to have fun with it."" Sure it's fun. But it also makes you wonder why some new words stick and others don't. English warmly welcomes some new words into its family for generations. But other words are treated like one-night stands. We love 'em and leave 'em. Here's the list: . 1. Yolo, an acronym for the phrase ""you only live once"" Who needs ""carpe diem"" when you've got yolo -- branded on Twitter, in pop song lyrics and in celebrity tattoos. Now it looks like yolo's in trouble. Twitter hashtag #In2013NoMore includes Tweeters swearing off yolo forever. Yolo is annoying because it encourages ""wannabe Twitter philosophers who think they've uncovered a deep secret of life,"" wrote Brendan Cotter of Grosse Pointe Park, Michigan, who nominated the word for the list. Sadly, poor little yolo's story is all too common, says Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist who teaches at the University of California at Berkeley School of Information. ""These words that are often very effective and attractive have very short half-lives because everybody picks them up at once, and they lose their punch,"" says Nunberg, who calls this phenomenon the ""nine-day wonder."" ""If the words even last nine days at all."" Related: 'Twitterverse' among annoying words of '12, poll says . The list takes shots at serious words, too: . 2. Fiscal cliff, a media term to describe expiring federal tax cuts and across-the-board government spending cuts which are set to become effective 12/31/2012 . ""Just once, I would like to hear it referred to as a financial crisis,"" wrote a nominator from Johnstown, Pennsylvania. Appropriately, her name is Barbara Cliff. ""Journalists always like cliffs,"" Nunberg jokes. ""There's more pressure to use phrases like that, because if you soft peddle things, nobody's going to read the story."" Two other politically tinged phrases made the list. 3. Kick the can down the road, a metaphorical phrase that describes the concept of substituting a short-term fix in place of a final decision . 4. Job creator/creators, a person or business directly responsible for adding employed workers to the economy . Words like ""job creators,"" Nunberg says, represent an entire set of phrases that bubbled up during the 2012 presidential campaign. These words reflect recent changes in the way Americans talk about differing economic and social classes. ""It's the '47%,' the 'moochers,' the 'makers and takers.'"" These kinds of words, Nunberg suggests, fuel the fire of class warfare in American life. The list is peppered with words embraced by corporate culture, Nunberg says. 5. Passion/passionate, an intense devotion to an idea, thing or endeavor . The popularity of this word results from the ""bloating of the language of corporate life,"" Nunberg says. ""People are expected to manifest a kind of emotional attachment and investment in their jobs that wasn't required back when jobs were a lot more secure."" 6. Superfood, a nonscientific word for food with extremely high nutritional benefits . It's a term which Nunberg says shows how influential the explosion of marketing has become in our culture. Another food word on the list: . 7. Boneless wings, small hand-held pieces of processed chicken without bones which are often enjoyed in sports bars . ""Can we just call them chicken (pieces)?"" pleaded John McNamara, of Lansing, Michigan, who nominated the word. 8. Trending, currently popular . ""There are lots of ways to say it, but none in as few as eight letters,"" jokes Nunberg. ""It's a little trendy."" Here's one that Pink says has lost its meaning: . 9. Bucket list, a personal list of experiences people desire before they die, also known as ""kicking the bucket"" This one has got to go, says Pink. There was a time when it could mean something like climbing a mountain, he explains. Now a bucket list can include less-lofty pursuits -- like catching a two-for-one sale at the mall. Rounding out the rest of the dozen: spoiler alert, guru and double down. Words and phrases that almost made the list -- but failed: ""wheelhouse,"" ""skill set."" Also, Pink singled out an annoying phrase that fell under particular consideration. That phrase was, ""I know, right."" Says Pink, ""That one came close."" What do you think? Here are some suggestions from CNN commenters: . ""Banish 'Mother Nature' from weather references FOREVER!"" writes snowdogg. ""I would like to request that the words 'epic', 'chillax', and 'splitsville' also be removed from the world's vernacular,"" suggests Daniel. Also this gem, from gemurray: ""The author uses one of the words that drives me crazy in the last couple of paragraphs - 'Interwebs' has got to go too! It's either 'Internet' or 'World Wide Web', there is no such thing as '""interwebs!'"" F-word and A-word . The F-word and the A-word are often nominated for the list, but Pink says offensive words aren't considered. ""We try to keep it lighthearted."" Nunberg's book, ""Ascent of the A-Word,"" follows a**hole from its invention by WWII GIs to today, where the word has become a ""basic term that a lot of us use all the time in our emotional and moral lives, for example when somebody cuts us off on the highway."" In fact, Nunberg says words from the 1940s -- like the A-word -- are more likely to survive than words invented in the '90s. ""You'd think more of the older words would be obsolete now, but no."" More words are being invented now than ever before -- partly because of easy and fast communication on the interwebs. (Sorry, gemurray) ""But the more words that are produced increases the competition,"" says Nunberg. There's a kind of process of natural selection. The words that survive often ""become signs of important social movements or changes,"" he says. The loser words will die -- never to be spoken again by countless mouths of future generations. Hey little yolo, if you're reading this, you better find some new friends. And fast. If you know what's good for ya.","NEW: CNN commenters suggest epic, chillax and interwebs .

"NEW YORK (CNN)  -- She was a promising college student, a young woman with talent whose brutal killing shocked a campus community. Her name is Samantha Michelle Nance. Unlike the recent high-profile homicide of Yale University graduate student Annie Le, the death of the 20-year-old Dallas woman, known as Shelley to her friends, has captured virtually no media attention outside Texas. Nance, a third-year student at the Art Institute of Dallas, was found stabbed to death Saturday in her apartment. She was majoring in animation, with about a year to go before getting her bachelor's degree, said Sarah Stockton, public relations director at the school. The institute is ""a design, media arts, fashion and culinary post-secondary school,"" according to its Web site. ""She was a very talented animation student,"" Stockton said. ""She actually won a scholarship for her work when she was still in high school."" Nance beat out about 60 other applicants to win the partial scholarship to the institute, Stockton said. She was a fan of Vincent van Gogh and author Frank Beddor, according to her personal Web page on the deviantArt site. Her apartment was in Dallas' northeastern Lake Highlands neighborhood in a building complex home to dozens of students from the institute. ""They have security there,"" Stockton said. Dallas police said officers were asked to investigate after Nance had not been seen for several days. Sgt. Eugene Reyes said officers entered her apartment Saturday and found her body. ""She had multiple stab wounds,"" Reyes said. The police report indicates Nance was ""stabbed with an unknown cutting tool."" Nance, who was from Italy, Texas, will be laid to rest Thursday. The school will hold a memorial service Friday. In a statement, the institute said that ""Samantha made many close friends during her time at the Art Institute, and she will be missed very much by students, faculty and staff."" Reyes said officers are in the process of interviewing people. ""We have a couple of people we are pretty interested in,"" he said. ""We are waiting for DNA."" He also revealed that while police haven't identified a suspect, homicide detectives believe the killer knew the victim. The Art Institute is making grief counselors available to students, noting, ""This is a hard time for everyone and there can be a range of emotions that are felt."" Stockton added a bulletin board has been set up for anyone to post memories of Nance. She said the remembrances will be given to her family. ""She was a great student, always came to class, always involved on campus,"" Stockton said. ""It's just a tragedy.""","Samantha Michelle Nance, 20, stabbed to death in Texas .

"(CNN) -- The Royal Dutch Shell oil drilling barge that ran aground off southern Alaska this week is sound and ready to be towed to safe harbor, a company official said Saturday, adding there is no evidence of any sheen in the vicinity. The 266-foot-diameter Kulluk remains upright and there is no apparent threat to its stability, said Sean Churchfield, the incident commander and operations manager for Shell Alaska. The fuel tanks appear intact, and naval architects report the vessel is sound and fit to tow, he said. The Killuk ran aground off uninhabited Sitkalidak Island, about 200 miles south of Anchorage, on Monday night. The current tow plan calls for the barge to be towed 30 miles to the north to Kiliuda Bay for safe harbor and a more detailed assessment. ""The exact timing of a potential towing activity will depend on weather, tides and operational readiness,"" Churchfield told reporters in a news conference. As much as 150,000 gallons of ultra low sulfur diesel and approximately 12,000 gallons of other petroleum products are on board the Kulluk, which had been working in the Beaufort Sea, off Alaska's North Slope, until October. The vessel was being towed back to its winter home in Seattle when it ran into a severe storm off the Alaskan coast. The Coast Guard evacuated the Kulluk's 18-man crew Dec. 29, and it drifted for 10 hours the following day after the tug that was towing it lost power. Monday night, tug crews had to cut the rig loose during a storm that whipped up 24-foot waves. That led to its grounding in an area where water depth is 32 to 48 feet. The Kulluk is a blue and white circular rig with a helicopter landing pad and a tower in the middle. The steel vessel is double-hulled and designed for drilling in Arctic waters. Most of the nearby shore is owned by a native Alaskan corporation on adjacent Kodiak Island, said Steven Russell, of Alaska's Department of Environmental Conservation. State officials are working with residents to watch for any environmental impact caused by the grounding. Shell's Arctic exploration plans caused widespread concern among environmentalists and were held up after BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell says it's working at far less depth and lower pressures than the BP well that erupted off Louisiana, killing 11 men aboard and unleashing an undersea gusher that took three months to cap. The fuel on board the rig is used to power equipment and is not the result of the drilling operations Shell conducted off the North Slope, on the opposite side of the vast state from where the Kulluk now rests. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates more than 90 billion barrels of oil and nearly 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas may be recoverable by drilling. And the shrinking of the region's sea ice -- which hit record lows in 2012 -- has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region. Climate researchers say that a decrease in sea ice is a symptom of a warming climate, caused largely by the combustion of carbon-rich fossil fuels. The science is politically controversial but generally accepted as fact by most scientists. CNN's Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Shell says there is no evidence of any sheen in the vicinity .

"(CNN) -- Harry Redknapp is hoping to perform another Premier League rescue act after being confirmed as the new manager of bottom club Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. The 65-year-old, who kept both Portsmouth and Tottenham in the English top flight, has replaced Mark Hughes. The Welshman was fired on Friday after 11 months in charge, having failed to win a league match this season. Redknapp, who was interested in becoming coach of the Ukrainian national team, was at Old Trafford on Saturday for Rangers' game against Manchester United. Winless QPR sack Hughes . Redknapp has been out of work since being sacked by Tottenham five months ago, having taken the London club to fourth in the Premier League but missing out on another Champions League campaign after Chelsea's Munich triumph in May. ""I'm delighted to be back in the managerial hot-seat at QPR,"" said Redknapp, who won the English FA Cup with Portsmouth in 2008 after returning the club following a controversial move to neighboring Southampton, who were relegated in 2005. ""When I spoke to the shareholders and they told me about their plans I knew this was too good an opportunity to turn down. ""There's no doubt there's a lot of ability in the squad, but for one reason or another things haven't gone as well as everyone expected since the start of the season. ""I can't wait to get to work and get the results necessary to kickstart our season."" Redknapp was named Premier League manager of the year for 2009-10 after taking Spurs to Champions League qualification for the first time, and he guided the team to the quarterfinals in Europe the following season. He had taken over with the club bottom of the Premier League in October 2008 with just two points from eight games, but guided Spurs to eighth place. The former West Ham manager was favorite to take over as England boss when Fabio Capello quit in February this year, but -- although he was cleared in a high-profile tax court case -- missed out to Roy Hodgson and was then sacked after a poor finish to the season. ""Harry was our number one target, the unanimous choice of the board and we're delighted we've been able to attract him to the club,"" QPR chairman Tony Fernandes said. ""He has a proven track record in the Premier League and has all the characteristics we were looking for to get us out of the current situation we find ourselves in. ""His man-management skills are second to none and we are confident he is the right man to lead us away from the bottom of the table."" Redknapp said on Friday he had been ""close"" to filling Ukraine's vacant coaching role. ""It was a job which excited me. We met the people and they were fantastic,"" he said. ""It was exciting and something I'd never done in my life and something I was really up for. ""But when Mark left the job it changed everything. Yesterday, I was almost on my way to Ukraine. But when I got the phone call it changed everything around.""","Harry Redknapp replaces Mark Hughes as Queens Park Rangers manager .

"(CNN) -- Negotiating teams from Sudan and South Sudan have agreed to end a dispute on oil payments to allow the resumption of southern oil exports through Sudan's territories, Sudan's state-run Ashorooq TV reported early Saturday, citing official sources. The negotiating teams met in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with the head of the African Union, the state-run TV station said. Both countries still have to discuss when to resume southern oil exports through the north. Sudan's economy has suffered since the separation of South Sudan last year, which took with it nearly 75% of the country's oil wealth. While most of the oil wells are in the south, the pipelines and port to export the oil are in the north. The agreement covers how much the landlocked South Sudan will pay to use those facilities. South Sudan halted oil production in late January after accusing Sudan of stealing $815 million worth of its crude. Sudan said it had confiscated the oil to make up for unpaid fees. The negotiating teams agreed that Sudan will receive $25.80 per barrel that passes through pipelines from the south to the north as an export tax and refining cost, Ashorooq TV reported. The teams are expected to meet later Saturday to discuss territorial disputes. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the deal Saturday, saying it ""reflects leadership and a new spirit of compromise on both sides."" ""The Government of Sudan deserves credit for taking this step,"" Clinton said in a statement. ""If Sudan would now also take the steps to peace in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile, and Darfur, and if it will respect the rights of all citizens, it can likewise give its people a brighter future."" Border clashes have brought the countries to the brink of war and left South Sudan coping with a massive humanitarian crisis as people flee the fighting. The South Sudan state of Upper Nile has been flooded with refugees crossing the border from Sudan. In total, aid agencies estimate that at least 150,000 refugees from Sudan are currently in South Sudan. Regarding two areas in the Blue Nile and Nubia, the government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North, a rebel force in the border region, agreed to a partial cease-fire so humanitarian aid could reach victims of hostilities, the state-run TV station said.

"Editor's Note: In our Behind the Scenes series, CNN correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind events. John Blake, who helped write the CNN.com special report ""Black in America,"" is author of the 2004 book ""Children of the Movement,"" which profiles the children of the civil rights movement's leading figures and of segregationists. Martin Luther King III, second from left, says he yearned for his father's advice while he was growing up. (CNN) -- The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was a civil rights icon, but for one man, he's something else: the father he barely remembers. King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, was 11 years old when his father was assassinated. His family broke the news to him by saying: ""Daddy is going to go home to live with God."" King's memories of his father are now fragmentary: kissing him when he returned from his frequent travels, tossing a softball, riding a bicycle with him. He learned to accept his loss, but there were moments when it hurt. ""When I was growing up and I wanted to talk to my father to get advice, and no one was there, it hit then,"" he said. ""It hit me when my mom would say, 'Your father would be so proud of you today.' That was painful."" Most people know how the civil rights movement changed the nation. I had another question: How did it change the families of the movement's biggest leaders -- and the families of their segregationist foes? The stories I heard from people like King helped me answer that question. King was one of 23 ""children of the movement"" I talked to over a two-year period starting in 2002. I wanted to know what they could tell me about their parents that didn't make it into the history books. What were they doing with their own lives? What happened to the movement's leaders after April 4, 1968? King, as expected, talked about the pressures of being the son of a civil rights icon. What surprised me, though, was that so many other children of these famous leaders had a far different problem -- they didn't know that their parents were famous civil rights leaders. Malcolm X's daughter, Ilyasah Shabazz, comes to mind. When she first attended college in upstate New York, she became a campus celebrity. Her classmates gathered around her and asked her to share stories about her father. She had none to share, though. Shabazz knew that her father was a civil rights activist, but her family never talked in detail about that side of him. She actually had to take a history class and buy ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" to learn more about her father. The children of other important movement leaders would tell similar stories. One woman said she didn't know her father was a civil rights hero until she ended up studying him in social studies class. One learned that his father was important when he saw him flee from a mob in a civil rights documentary. ""He was just a father,"" Stokely Carmichael's son, Bokar Ture, said when I asked why he didn't know that his father -- who coined the term ""black power"" -- was a symbol of black militancy. ""He never told me what he did, really. He just told me what was good to do: 'Work for your people.' "" I wondered why this was happening. Then some movement scholars helped me understand. The problem was me. I had not understood how brutal the movement was. I saw it as a Disney movie -- people marching in the sunshine, King speaking, and victory. But it was war. Many of these front-line activists lived under the constant threat of death. Several lost friends. Some were tortured in jail. Several were disowned by their families. Their memories were too painful to share with their children. Yet their reticence put their children in a bind. After they became adults, strangers would approach them and ask: ""How are you going to fulfill your parent's legacy?"" How could they answer when they didn't even know what that legacy was? These activists faced another emotional hurdle besides their painful memories. How do you top being part of a history-making movement? Many of them experienced a massive emotional letdown after their time in the movement. The Rev. James Zwerg gave the movement one of its most unforgettable images. A photographer snapped a shot of him after he was almost beaten to death by a mob at an Alabama bus station. Zwerg was part of an interracial group of college students who attempted to integrate interstate bus travel during the ""Freedom Rides."" But Zwerg struggled to find his way after that photo made him famous. He entered therapy and even contemplated suicide. He could never find a cause that made him feel so alive. ""It's a tremendous downer,"" he said. ""You look for it everywhere. I've never experienced it since."" The difficulties their parents experienced had another unexpected effect on their children: It turned some away from activism. There's no retirement plan for civil rights activists. No health benefits. A few movement leaders found ways to parlay their experiences into political careers, but many of them struggled financially. Their children grew up with the sense that their parents had given too much and received too little in return. They weren't going to make that mistake. The son of Andrew Young, King's close aide and the former mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, was one such person. Andrew ""Bo"" Young III scoffed at the idea of becoming a politician or activist. He's an entrepreneur who wants to be a millionaire. When I asked him about integration, he was interested in only one kind: ""I want to integrate the money."" The biggest surprise came from the children of the segregationists. They seemed to experience the least amount of conflict over the lives of their parents. Each of them said their fathers weren't racists and were great politicians. The daughter of George Wallace -- the Alabama governor who once boasted that segregation would last forever -- said her father had to be a segregationist to get elected. ""It wasn't that he hated blacks,"" Peggy Wallace told me. ""He treated everybody ... who cooked and cleaned for us at the Governor's Mansion like his own family. I saw it and swear to it. He would never mistreat one of them."" My favorite moment during these interviews, though, came when someone shared a question with me. I was talking to Ericka Abram, the daughter of Elaine Brown, the only woman to lead the Black Panther Party. She talked about growing up surrounded by armed men in black leather jackets and having a bodyguard accompany her at all times -- even when she went to the ice cream truck. Despite the danger, she marvels at the idealism of her mother and Panther leaders. They were going to try to change the world, even if it meant dying for their cause -- and many did, she said. She, like so many children of the movement, now wonders if their parents' pain was worth it. ""If you've been told all your whole life that you were born for revolution,"" she asked me, ""what do you do with your life when the revolution never comes?""","Martin Luther King III: It was painful to hear mom say dad would be proud .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Marta Umbelina pulled up in front of her house with her 11-year-old daughter. When she stepped out of the car, she was shot 10 times in the back. Umbelina was an office worker at Sao Paulo's Military Police Northern Command -- and she is one of nearly 100 cops murdered in Sao Paulo this year, roughly 50 percent higher than 2011. Most were ambushed while off duty, part of a deadly battle between police and Brazil's biggest criminal gang, the First Command of the Capital or PCC by its Portuguese acronym. ""Marta was my friend, my colleague, she knew everything about me,"" said Simone Mello, a police officer who worked with Marta at a desk job. ""Why her? Why Marta? We're just very sad,"" she said. Police raid Brazilian slums . In a bid to rein in the PCC, Sao Paulo launched Operation Saturation at the end of October. The government sent at least 500 police troops into the city's biggest shantytown Paraisopolis, or Paradise City. They arrested dozens of alleged gang leaders, confiscated arms and drugs and even found a list with the names and addresses of 40 military police on it. But police aren't the only casualties in this escalating war. The number of homicides in Sao Paulo has jumped to almost 1,000 so far this year, largely concentrated in favelas or slums. For January to October 2011 there were 869 homicides, according to Sao Paulo government figures. Some police are also being investigated for execution-style murders. ""Poor neighborhoods are caught in the crossfire,"" said Camila Nunes Dias, a professor at the Center for the Study of Violence at Sao Paulo University. ""They suffer the consequences and we know that a lot of innocent people are being killed."" She said she believes the spiral of violence began in May when the Sao Paulo state government took a more aggressive stance against the PCC and drug gangs. The PCC got its start in Sao Paulo prisons and often controls the country's drug trade from jail cells. The Justice Ministry recently offered to send in Army troops to help quell the violence, as it has in done previously in Rio de Janeiro slums. But the Sao Paulo government declined the offer. Instead they agreed to have alleged gang leaders transferred to more secure federal prisons and share intelligence more efficiently. In the meantime, Operation Saturation has spread to other slums. Police traverse the steep hills and sprawling shantytowns on horseback and motorcycles carrying out raids. On a recent incursion into the northern favela, Brasilandia, police formed a human chain as they climbed the steep hills with their guns drawn. They frisked young men and pulled over motorcycles, suspected of carrying anything from drugs to hired killers. Residents of Sao Paulo's slums are divided. ""It's a relief, it's very quiet now,"" said an older woman on her way to work. But another woman carrying her baby said: ""Now that it's full of police, I get very scared. I get worried about a shootout or confrontation."" Many argue that when the police leave, things will revert to the brutal status quo unless far-reaching community projects are introduced to improve public access to services like schools and hospitals. ""It's not just a question of sending in police,"" said Joildo Santos, a spokesman for the Paraisopolis Residents Association. ""You have to have public works that give young people opportunities, alternatives.""","Police strike back after about 100 cops killed by gang in Sao Paulo, Brazil .

"(CNN) -- Uganda isn't known for being a big player on the baseball field, but one man is hoping for a home run with his documentary about the sport. An American filmmaker has made what he describes as 'a love letter to the game sent from a place you'd least expect.' Jay Shapiro hopes that his snap shot of youth baseball in the East African country will raise the profile of the sport in a part of the world where he says it means so much to its players. ""I'm constantly dissatisfied with the way people react to Africa and the third world in general, and that sort of became my goal to shift the way people think about Africa,"" Shapiro explained. ""What better way to shift the way Americans think about Africa better than baseball, the game they love and I love, too,"" he continued. His documentary, called Opposite Field, focuses on Uganda's Little League Baseball network. A sport that may still be in its fledgling stages but is growing bigger by the day. Shapiro explains that he ended up in Uganda when he was doing commercial work for Major League Baseball. It was there that he met a man from Staten Island, called Richard Stanley, who was passionate about bringing the sport to Uganda. ""He showed me this stack of Polaroid pictures basically of a swamp in the middle of nowhere and he told me he's going to build this beautiful baseball facility,"" he said. It was a project that Richard Stanley began working on in 2002. Shapiro says that thanks to his hard work there are now two baseball fields in Uganda. But Shapiro says what really shocked him when he went to visit the fields was the kids. ""I was expecting to see some really basic baseball, kids just picking up a ball for the first time and learning how to throw or swing the bat, but that's not what I saw,"" he said. ""They were really good, they knew how to play."" Around 15,000 children are signed up to the league now but with about 700 gloves between them more funding is desperately needed. However, Shapiro says that it's the lack of money that produces such impressive players in Uganda. ""These kids just play, they don't even have a field to play on or a ball, they'll make a ball out of plastic bag that they singe and just throw it,"" Shapiro said. ""That's why they are so good; they play for the right reasons. If they play because they love it, they'll win,"" he said. The team Shapiro filmed did win. He followed a group of 11 and 12-year-old boys from the ghettos of Kampala, who became the first African team to ever qualify for the Little League World Series. Uganda youth baseball team denied U.S. visas over age discrepancies . The team was due to play in the tournament in Williamsport, Pennsylvania but issues with their visas meant they couldn't enter America. ""As everyone knows, documentation is a problem, not just for Uganda and not just baseball, but 1 billion kids in the world don't have documentation for who they are or how old they are,"" Shapiro said. Birth certificates are not routinely given out in Uganda and many people do not know the day they were born. In order to travel a certificate and passport is needed, but it's a costly process. A statement on the Little League's website says that if the problems can not be ironed out, Little League Baseball and Softball in Africa will only be for the wealthy. Shapiro hopes his film will address some of the challenges facing the sport in Uganda so it can continue to grow. ""It is baseball at its purest form, its baseball for the love of it, its baseball...where there shouldn't be baseball so you have to love it to make it grow."" The filmmaker says that it's this love of baseball that joins kids together against a backdrop of personal tragedy. One boy that features in the documentary is Ivan, who lives in an equipment shed with up to 8 people. Shapiro says that despite the daily hardships he faces, he is an incredible baseball player. ""He does a lot of things you can't teach, he has a natural hand-eye coordination, you just see, his story could end up somewhere special,"" he said. ""He strikes you as this shy, timid, quiet boy but when he gets on the field, he's the leader, he's the loudest one out there, holding huddles for the team, but he's the man, and I love watching that.""

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- In the midst of Wall Street's agonizing slide last week, there was at least one place in Manhattan where the liquor was flowing, the cigar smoke was billowing and the theme of the evening was simple: Work hard. Play hard. ""I was a crook,"" says Jordan Belfort, once a Wall Street fat cat who made $1 million a week before going to jail. ""It's like fiddling. Nero fiddled while Rome burned,"" said Thomas Graf, vice president and producer of Northmarq Capital. ""We're smoking cigars while we're losing our shirts, literally."" He was among hundreds of mid-level Wall Street executives and traders gathered for a party thrown by Cigar Report magazine, published by New York-based Doubledown Media. And if they seemed a little tone-deaf about how this kind of event could be perceived as millions of dollars were lost, at least on paper, most did not seem especially concerned. ""It is a great time,"" said Adam Marsh of Empire Capital Partners. ""I think for at least a couple of hours in the evening, we can kind of sit back, have a few drinks, forget what's facing us on the Street tomorrow."" Few of the men and women at the party earned millions in Wall Street bonuses on top of their salaries. But nearly all did very well, they say, at the top of the Wall Street bubble. And their bosses, along with those who managed Wall Street hedge funds, did even better. ""These guys were spending more than $250 billion a year,"" Robert Frank said. ""They bought mansions in Greenwich and Palm Beach. They bought art for $100 million a painting."" Frank, author of ""Richistan,"" says the enormous amounts of money earned by Wall Street elite made them practically a nation unto themselves. ""They just looked at the guy with the bigger house, the nicer Ferrari, the better artwork,"" he said. ""And it was all competitive spending."" One prominent example is the CEO of Lehman Brothers, Richard Fuld. In 2007 alone, according to the executive compensation firm Equilar, he earned total take-home compensation of more than $45 million in salary and bonuses. Congressional researchers said he earned nearly $500 million from 2000 through 2007. Fuld told Congress that the failure of his company centered on inaction on the part of government and a loss of confidence in the financial markets. ""This is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life, regardless of what comes out of this committee, regardless of when the record books get written,"" Fuld told Congress during a recent hearing. Not every Wall Street executive played by the books. Jordan Belfort was once chairman of a brokerage firm called Stratton Oakmont. In the early to mid-'90s, he called himself the Wolf of Wall Street. He was jailed on federal charges of securities fraud and money laundering. He spent 22 months behind bars and was released in 2005. ""I was a crook,"" Belfort said. At one time, he says, he was earning more than $1 million a week. Now, he has been ordered to pay back $110 million to his victims, and he said he is working on that. Even the man who first chronicled Wall Street excess to a national audience can barely believe what has happened. Oliver Stone, who wrote and directed the film ""Wall Street"" 21 years ago, says the main character in his story, unprincipled stockbroker Gordon Gekko, has been overtaken by reality. ""I never thought it would go to this level,"" Stone told CNN's Larry King. ""I thought the Gordon Gekkos of the world would die out. But they got worse."" So what exactly did the new Gordon Gekkos do to earn those fabulous sums? ""What they really did was to figure out new and clever ways of investing,"" Frank said. ""Of creating financial products that very few of us could understand."" ""On Wall Street, there's no cost. The only cost is the employees, the executives,"" said Andy Serwer, managing editor of Fortune magazine. ""So if a firm is creating a financial product that it can sell for $5 million, the person who sells it will get $2 million."" But people who earned relatively little on Wall Street are now paying the price as well. Win Hornig, a 25-year-old Minnesotan who worked at both Bear Stearns and J.P. Morgan, is now out of a job. He's launched a Web site called BankerGoneBroke.com to talk about it. ""My life was basically a disaster,"" Hornig said. ""I was working all the time, didn't have a lot to show for it. I came to the conclusion that there was more to life than money."" While it lasted, the good times on Wall Street made money for traders and, of course, for Americans who had invested in the stock market, mainly through their 401(k) contributions. But there is a ""new normal"" these days. ""The party is over on Wall Street -- until it comes back again,"" Serwer said. ""I've been around long enough to see that we have these cycles. These guys get their cigars and champagne. They have a great time. The whole thing blows up. But then they re-emerge years later. This one is a really, really bad one. But I don't think Wall Street is dead.""","Wall Street elite earned enormous amounts of cash, author says .

"(Financial Times) -- China is poised to produce more cars than Europe in 2013 for the first time, hitting a landmark in the country's rise in the automobile industry and underlining the difficulties for the European vehicle sector as it faces a challenging 12 months. China is in 2013 set to make 19.6m cars and other light vehicles such as small trucks compared with 18.3m in Europe, according to projections prepared for the Financial Times by five forecasting groups. The rise of China is even more striking considering the projections for Europe include not just the European Union but other nations such as Russia and Turkey. In 2012, on the basis of motor industry estimates, Europe made 18.9m cars and related vehicles, comfortably ahead of China's tally of 17.8m. The projections are based on data from the IHS, LMC Auto and PwC consultancies together with investment banks UBS and Credit Suisse. They paint a picture of only a slight recovery in 2013 for the world car industry, where output is expected to climb by a muted 2.2 per cent in the coming year, as against 4.9 per cent in 2012. With global sales valued at about $1.3tn a year, the car industry is one of the best bellwethers of world economic conditions. According to the data, Europe will in 2013 make just over a fifth of the world's cars -- a figure that is well down on the 35 per cent it recorded in 2001. In 1970 nearly one in every two cars made in the world originated from a factory in Europe -- which is generally recognised as the place where the global auto industry began with the unveiling of a rudimentary three-wheeler in 1885 by the German inventor Karl Benz. Car production in China in 2013 is likely to be 10 times higher than in 2000 -- when its share of global auto manufacturing was just 3.5 per cent as opposed to a likely 23.8 per cent in 2013. Scott Corwin, an automotive expert at the Booz & Co consultancy, said that even with relatively strong growth projected in vehicle output and demand in both the US and China, ""these markets alone won't do much to pull [the whole world] forward"". Mr Corwin also cautioned that even with a continuation of the recent rise of the car industry in China, many vehicle markers doing business there ""are struggling to make much money"" as a result of tough competition and the fact that the market is made up of large numbers of small cars, for which profit margins for manufacturers are small. Europe's expected fall in production is in response to a steep decline in car sales throughout the continent since the 2008/09 financial crisis, with the problems causing severe difficulties at a number of large vehicle makers, notably France's PSA Peugeot CitroÃ«n, which is cutting almost 10,000 jobs and is lining up a â‚¬7bn rescue package for its financing arm with the French government. Most car markers with strong positions in the European vehicle business are braced for a turbulent period ahead. Norbert Reithofer, chief executive of the German luxury carmaker BMW, said he expected conditions for selling cars in Europe would remain ""very challenging"" in 2013. HÃ¥kan Samuelsson, chief executive of Volvo Cars of Sweden, said: ""[As for] the [European car ] market, you can only pray."" © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","China is poised to produce more cars than Europe in 2013 for the first time .

"(CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama met with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday, the first top-level meeting between the two countries since the presidential election and a power transition in China. They met at the East Asia Summit in Cambodia, the third leg in Obama's Asian tour, which hopes to foster deeper political and economic ties in the region. Obama was keen to put the focus on trade issues, and ignored questions on a bitter maritime dispute that overshadowed discussions on the first day of the summit on Monday. He told Wen that China and the U.S. should ""work to establish clear rules of the road internationally for trade and investment which can increase prosperity and global growth."" In return, Wen pledged to cooperate in financial and economic matters ""to tackle the difficulties we have and resolve the differences and disagreements between us."" Both Obama and Governor Mitt Romney talked tough on China during the presidential campaign, particularly on trade and currency disputes, although Obama was more measured in his criticism. Wen congratulated Obama on his re-election and sent greetings from China's new leader Xi Jinping. Xi will officially succeed President Hu Jintao in March after he was selected as head of the Chinese Communist Party at last week's party congress. Obama also met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda and held discussions with leaders from ASEAN, a grouping of 10 southeast Asian nations. During the summit, ASEAN leaders clashed publicly about how to handle a bitter territorial dispute in the South China Sea and what role the U.S. should play in resolving it. China claims sovereignty over most of the waters, which are thought to contain oil and gas deposits, but Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan have made rival territorial claims. Cambodia's statement on Sunday that ASEAN's 10 leaders had agreed not to ""internationalize"" the South China Sea dispute by limiting the body to direct negotiations with China provoked an an angry rebuke by the Philippines, which said there was no consensus. Philippines President Benigno Aquino said he wanted the U.S. to get involved in discussions, according to the Philippines Daily Inquirer. ""Our region is very diverse and its harmony can easily be disrupted by sheer political, military, or economic might. Imbalance, as we know, may lead to instability,"" he said. ""While we are all aware that the U.S. does not take sides in disputes, they do have a strategic stake in the freedom of navigation, unimpeded commerce, and the maintenance of peace and stability in the South China Sea."" Alan Dupont, a professor at the University of New South Wales in Australia, said that the while U.S. was happy to push China to the table, it was unlikely to step directly into trying to resolve the issue. ""The U.S. is not a claimant in the South China Sea dispute but it does have an interest in maintaining freedom of navigation,"" he said. Obama and ASEAN leaders agreed to support the drafting of a regional code of conduct to manage disputes in the sea. China repeated its long-held position that the disputes should resolved through ""consultations and negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned."" Dupont said that China had conceded some ground by agreeing to discuss the dispute with ASEAN. ""But it made it clear it will do so in discussions with the ASEAN countries and not involve other parties, specifically read in brackets the United States,"" he said.

"(CNN) -- Doctors say Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is on her way to a full recovery after a blood clot was found in her head on Sunday night. She was discharged from New York Presbyterian Hospital on Wednesday after spending three days being treated, the State Department announced. Clinton's blood clot was located in the vein between the brain and skull behind her right ear, according to her doctors' statement. It is being treated with blood thinners and did not result in a stroke or any neurological damage. This type of blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare, said Dr. Mary Cushman, director of the Thrombosis and Hemostasis Program at the University of Vermont and chair of the American Society of Hematology's subcommittee on quality of care. A two-year study conducted in the Netherlands found cerebral vein thrombosis affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 people. In comparison, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 1 in 1,000 people are affected by deep venous thrombosis (DVT) -- a similar clot found most often in the leg. Clinton, now 65, suffered from a DVT in 1998. Anyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again. About one-third of people with DVT will have a recurrence within 10 years, according to the CDC. ""There are a handful of genetic conditions that predispose someone to these kinds of clots,"" Cushman said. ""That's why you might see two different (types of blood clots) in the same person."" It's unknown if Clinton has a genetic condition that may increase her risk. Other risk factors for DVT include smoking, use of oral contraceptives, age (the risk increases over age 65) and obesity. Blood clots: 4 things you need to know . A large long-term study published in the journal PLoS One in 2007 found the more frequently a person travels, the higher their risk of blood clots. The blood in veins is fighting gravity to get back to the heart, Cushman said, and needs the leg muscles to help push it along. When a person is sedentary for long periods of time -- especially on a plane or in a car where the legs are in the same position for hours -- the blood can start to clot. Clinton has logged many miles as secretary of state, in addition to the time spent traveling as a former presidential candidate and first lady. Although she plans to step down from the State Department soon, there is a lot of speculation about a run for president in 2016. Blood clots wouldn't deter her from campaigning if that's what she chooses, said Dr. Jack Ansell, an expert in thrombosis at Lenox Hill Hospital who is not involved in Clinton's care. ""Travel is potentially an issue for the secretary, but I would imagine that when she travels she's not sitting in a coach seat, cramped up and sitting still,"" Ansell said. Experts recommend anyone with a history of blood clots stand up and walk every couple hours during long trips. They should also avoid alcoholic drinks prior to traveling -- dehydration can contribute to the formation of blood clots. Doctors often recommend wearing compression stockings, which help move blood along in the legs by narrowing the veins. Clinton may remain on blood thinners for several months or for the foreseeable future, said Dr. Evan Lipsitz, chief of vascular surgery at Montefiore Medical Center, who is not treating the secretary of state. ""The current recommendations are for at least three months of treatment with a blood thinner following a clot. Each case much be individualized depending on the size and location of the clot and the risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment,"" Lipsitz said. Often patients on these medications are monitored closely, having their blood checked once a month or every couple of months to ensure the dosage is right. Lipsitz makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms (sudden pain or swelling in the limbs, or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs) so they can spot them and get treated quickly. Patients on blood thinners need to avoid physical trauma, Cushman said, but are otherwise fine. So while an NFL player or a construction worker would probably be out, Clinton's career going forward is still full of possibilities. ""I think her future is as good as her past,"" Ansell said. ""She should recover fully and get back to work.""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- It took a U.S. former president with global celebrity status to free two American journalists from a North Korea prison. Former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore greets freed U.S. journalist Laura Ling. Laura Ling and Euna Lee arrived back in the United States Wednesday morning with former President Bill Clinton, who flew to North Korea to negotiate their release after they were sentenced to a labor camp. Iain Clayton said Wednesday that his wife, Laura, told him through a telephone conversation that the North Koreans were willing to grant the two journalists amnesty if a high-level envoy, such as former President Clinton, were willing to travel to Pyongyang. But there was no shortage of envoys ready to travel to North Korea and negotiate the women's release. Some heavyweights were turned down by the North Koreans: former Vice President Al Gore, a co-founder of the media outfit the women were working for when they were arrested, and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations whose previous missions to North Korea included negotiating the release of a detained American. Lower-level envoys such as former U.S. ambassador to South Korea and current Korea Society Chairman Donald Gregg, Sig Harrison, an expert on North Korean nukes who has traveled there several times, and Han Park, a scholar at the University of Georgia, all offered their services. Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was also closely involved in coordinating efforts with the White House and State Department to free the women. According to sources intimately involved with the efforts, Sen. John Kerry -- chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee -- received an official invitation to visit Pyongyang to facilitate their release and open a larger dialogue on the nuclear issue after several weeks of quiet direct diplomacy between Kerry and his aides and North Korea. In the end, it was Clinton whom North Korea wanted. Two senior Obama administration officials described on background how Clinton's mission to Pyongyang to secure the release of two U.S. journalists imprisoned by North Korea evolved. Officials said that while President Obama never spoke directly with the former president about this issue, negotiations were under way within the administration. During the weekend of July 24-25, Clinton spoke with National Security Adviser Gen. Jim Jones about his willingness to take on this mission. Clinton ultimately agreed to go on the mission but made it very clear in every communication that this was purely a humanitarian effort. Clinton also wanted to make sure, based on the due diligence of the national security team, that there was a high likelihood of success if he went. ""We were convinced this would be the result, and based on that we could advise President Clinton that his trip was going to be successful,"" one official said. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Wednesday that ""we did our homework ... to make sure that if President Clinton did take this trip, that we would be able to ... win the freedom for these two."" Kelly said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also had a role in the mission, adding that ""The State Department was very involved."" More details, he said, will be released. Administration officials also said it was always made clear by Clinton and the national security team that this would be a humanitarian mission. ""We had one goal in mind, which was in the U.S. interest, which was to seek the release of these two U.S. Americans,"" one of the officials said. ""And it wasn't in any way about our disagreements with the DPRK with respect to its conduct, or with respect to our intention to vigorously enforce resolutions and to vigorously seek the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."" Clinton and his team engaged in a 75-minute meeting with President Kim Jong Il and then had a dinner which lasted a little over two hours. ""So the total amount of time that they were in meetings or agendas with each other was about a little over three hours and 15 minutes,"" one official said. Asked if the nuclear issue at least was discussed, the official said, ""I don't have an answer to that question. I'm sure President Clinton gave President Kim his views on denuclearization and his views are well known with respect to denuclearization."" While Gore was turned down by North Korea, he was, however, actively involved in this effort from the start, speaking often with the families and the Obama administration. On Wednesday, Obama thanked the former vice president, saying he ""worked tirelessly in order to achieve a positive outcome."" Clinton's humanitarian help was not lost on Obama -- who reached out to the journalists' families on Tuesday night. ""I want to thank President Bill Clinton -- I had a chance to talk to him -- for the extraordinary humanitarian effort that resulted in the release of the two journalists,"" he said at the White House. ""My hope is that the families that have been reunited can enjoy the next several days and weeks understanding that because of the efforts of President Clinton and Gore they are able to be with each other once again."" CNN's Dan Lothian, Ed Hornick and Elise Labott and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.","Former President Clinton talked with national security adviser before trip .

"(CNN) -- The SpaceX Dragon has splashed down in the Pacific Ocean after a three-week flight to the International Space Station, completing the first commercial cargo mission to Earth's orbit, NASA announced Sunday. The unmanned capsule came down about 250 miles west of Baja California at 3:22 p.m., the space agency reported. The craft was launched October 7, the first of a dozen flights to the space station planned under a contract with NASA. The craft carried nearly 900 pounds of supplies to the station and returned with nearly 1,700 pounds of freight, mostly used hardware and scientific research material. The reusable craft has been loaded onto a ship and was carried back to shore Sunday afternoon, SpaceX said. NASA chose SpaceX's Falcon 9 launch vehicle and the Dragon spacecraft to resupply the space station in 2008. The space agency has retired its fleet of space shuttles and plans to turn much of its focus toward exploring deep into the solar system. ""With today's mission, we've closed the loop and demonstrated that American industry is ready to step up to the plate and meet our needs for transport to low Earth orbit,"" NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said in a statement issued after splashdown. ""This work will transform our relationship to space, save money and create jobs. America remains the leader in space and technology development."" Another company, Orbital Sciences, is expected to launch its own demonstration flight to the space station within months under a contract with NASA. And SpaceX is one of three aerospace firms now vying for a contract for manned flights into orbit, along with Sierra Nevada and Boeing. The mission was completed despite the failure of one of the nine engines on the Falcon 9 booster rocket that carried it into orbit. SpaceX said the engine failed 79 seconds after liftoff, but the remaining engines kept the craft headed for the space station as flight computers made the necessary adjustments. However, a prototype communications satellite that the Falcon 9 carried as a secondary payload did not end up in its designated orbit. The satellite's builder, New Jersey-based Orbcomm, said controllers were able to successfully test the device's systems before it fell out of orbit and plans to launch two more of them aboard SpaceX rockets by 2014. SpaceX said it was studying flight data with NASA to figure out what happened, ""and we will apply those lessons to future flights."" Elon Musk: A pioneer in space and on Earth .
