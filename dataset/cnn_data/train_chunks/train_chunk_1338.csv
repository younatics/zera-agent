"The Food and Drug Administration is recommending an end to the nation's lifetime ban on blood donations from gay and bisexual men, a 31-year-old policy that many medical groups and gay activists say is no longer justified. The Obama administration's FDA said Tuesday that it favors replacing the blanket ban with a new policy barring donations from men who have had man-on-man sex in the previous 12 months. The new policy would put the U.S. in line with other countries including Australia, Japan and the U.K. Democrats in Congress quickly complained that the move didn't go far enough. Senator Patty Murray of the state of Washington, who will be Democrats/ ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee in January, called it 'a welcome step in the right direction.' Activists, however, questioned whether requiring a year of celibacy from gay men before a donation amounted to a significant policy shift. This 2003 file photo shows a Red Cross worker as she prepares to take blood from a male donor in California.  The Food and Drug Administration said on December 23 that it will move to ease a lifetime ban on blood donations from homosexual men, allowing them to give but only after a year of abstaining from sexual activity . 'De facto lifetime ban': Gay males will be able to give blood in the United States, but only if they haven't actually had sex with a man in 12 months . 'This new policy cannot be justified in light of current scientific research and updated blood screening technology,' said David Stacy of the Human Rights Campaign, the largest U.S. gay rights group. Other activists said the new proposal would continue to stigmatize gay and bisexual men. 'This new policy does not require heterosexual blood donors to be celibate for one year. Some may believe this is a step forward, but in reality, requiring celibacy for a year is a de facto lifetime ban,' Gay Men's Health Crisis, a New York-based nonprofit that supports AIDS prevention and care, said after the announcement. Murray said she was 'disappointed that low-risk gay men are still being discriminated against with this outdated policy.' 'Healthy Americans who don’t engage in risky behavior, regardless of their sexual orientation, should have the opportunity to donate blood and help in the effort to save lives,' she said. Fellow Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin agreed. 'The Administration must continue to work towards implementing blood donation policies based on individual risk factors,' Baldwin said in a statement, instead of singling out one group of people and turning away healthy, willing donors, even when we face serious blood shortages.' The lifetime ban dates from the early years of the AIDS crisis and was intended to protect the blood supply from what was a then little-understood disease. But many medical groups, including the American Medical Association, say the policy is no longer supported by science, given advances in HIV testing. Gay activists say the ban is discriminatory and perpetuates negative stereotypes. The agency will recommend the switch in draft guidelines early next year and move to finalize them after taking comments from the public, FDA officials told reporters. FDA Deputy Director Dr. Peter Marks declined to give a timeframe for completing the process but said, 'we commit to working as quickly as possible on this issue.' Marks said some of the most compelling evidence for changing the policy comes from Australia, which put in place a one-year ban on donations over a decade ago. Recently published studies showed no change in the safety of the blood supply after making the switch. Additionally, studies conducted by the U.S. government suggest gay and bisexual men are actually more likely to abide by donation guidelines under a 12-month prohibition period. All blood donors take a questionnaire about their health and sexual behavior, but some gay men reportedly answer inaccurately to donate blood. The Food and Drug Administration made the announcement on Tuesday, bring muted applause from gay rights groups and congressional Democrats who want the agency to go further . All U.S. blood donations are screened for HIV but the test only detects the virus after it's been in the bloodstream about 10 days. Still, FDA officials said current research does not support reducing the donation ban below one year. According to government figures, men who have had sex with other men represent about 2 percent of the U.S. population, yet account for at least 62 percent of all new HIV infections in the U.S. The FDA's announcement follows years of government discussions re-examining the ban. Last month a panel of blood safety experts convened by the Department of Health and Human Services voted 16-2 in favor of doing away with the total ban. The panel recommended moving to the one-year ban that was formally proposed Tuesday. The FDA implemented the lifetime ban in 1983, when health officials were first recognizing the risk of contracting AIDS via blood transfusions. Under the policy, blood donations are barred from any man who has had sex with another man at any time since 1977 – the start of the AIDS epidemic in the U.S. The push for a new policy gained momentum in 2006, when the Red Cross, the American Association of Blood Banks, and America's Blood Centers called the ban 'medically and scientifically unwarranted.' Last year the American Medical Association voted to oppose the policy. Patient groups that rely on a safe blood supply, including the National Hemophilia Foundation, have also voiced support for dropping the ban.","Gay males have been prohibited from giving blood in the US since 1983 .
Originally the ban was meant to protect the blood supply from HIV/AIDS .
Australia changed its policy in the same way 10 years ago and hasn't seen a decline in the safety of its donor blood .

"Arizona officials said on Monday they have been cleared of any wrongdoing in an execution this year that lasted nearly two hours, but they are nevertheless changing the drugs they use to put inmates to death. According to a letter from Department of Corrections Director Charles Ryan to Gov. Jan Brewer, the agency no longer will use the drug combination used in the controversial July execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood. He was given 15 doses of the drugs and gasped over and over before taking his final breath. The letter said the department will stop using the mixture of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. Instead, it will try to obtain pentobarbital or Sodium Pentothal, the powerful sedative also known as sodium thiopental that was used in lethal injections in Arizona until it became difficult to obtain. Scroll down for video . Long execution: Iinmate Joseph Rudolph Wood was given 15 doses of drugs and gasped over and over before taking his final breath nearly two hours later . Pentobarbital has been successfully used dozens of times in Texas, Georgia and Missouri but also is in short supply. Records obtained by The Associated Press show Texas has enough pentobarbital to carry out the first five lethal injections scheduled there in 2015. If Arizona cannot acquire those drugs, it will use a three-drug combination that can include midazolam and potassium chloride, among others. That three-drug mix has been used successfully in eight executions in Florida, according to the report. The July 23 execution of Wood, convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend and her father, Debbie and Gene Dietz, called into question the efficacy of the drugs used in Arizona after it took nearly two hours for Wood to die. Wood's attorney, Dale Baich, says the execution was botched. But results from an independent investigation conducted by a group of former corrections directors and experts found no protocols were broken and the state properly trained its execution team. The findings released Monday also show Wood was injected correctly but did not react to the drugs as expected. Changing methods: Arizona Department of Correction Director Charles Ryan arrives to speak about the review of the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood and their plans to ensure nothing like that happens again . The three-member team recommended the changes to the drugs used. ""The report is clear that the execution of inmate Wood was handled in accordance with all department procedures, which, as the report states, either meet or exceed national standards,"" Ryan said in a statement. ""It was done appropriately and with the utmost professionalism."" But Baich was unsatisfied, saying the report failed to explain why the experimental drug protocol did not work as promised. 'The state should release all of the documentation and witness reports that went into this review,' Baich said. 'Only through discovery in a court of law will there be a truly independent and comprehensive examination of what went wrong during Mr. Wood's nearly two-hour execution.' Witness: Arizona Republic justice reporter Michael Kiefer describes what he saw as a witness to the execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood, at the state prison in Florence, Arizona . The state has put on hold all executions pending the outcome of a lawsuit stemming from Wood's execution. Arizona has put 37 inmates to death since capital punishment resumed in 1992 and has about 120 inmates on death row. The lawsuit was filed in June on behalf of Wood and other death-row inmates. It claims the inmates have a First Amendment right to know about specific execution protocols such as the types of drugs used in lethal injections and the companies that supply them. The independent investigation reviewed drug combinations and other execution protocols of several states, including Ohio, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri. The investigators compared Wood's execution with that of Clayton Lockett in Oklahoma on April 29. The same sedative was used in both, but Oklahoma officials have said the catheters were improperly placed on Lockett, restricting the drugs' flow. Lockett writhed, mumbled and lifted his head on the gurney during the 43 minutes it took him to die. A federal judge ruled Monday that Oklahoma's lethal injection protocols are constitutional, and said the state can proceed with the scheduled executions of four death row inmates early next year. The Arizona investigation found Wood did not feel pain. The lead doctor said he performed seven consciousness tests and found Wood was unresponsive. The doctor said he used a pin to prick Wood but got no response. 'The process and the implementation of the protocol was not 'botched' as has been described in the Lockett execution,' the investigators wrote. Pima County Medical Examiner Gregory Hess told investigators it's possible Wood was brain dead long before he died, and that gasps and snorting are 'normal bodily responses to dying,' according to the report. The autopsy findings in Wood's death have not been publicly released.","The Department of Corrections will no longer use the drug combination used in the controversial July execution of Joseph Rudolph Wood .

"Police Federation Vice-chairman Steve Evans had 'no choice' but to quit after verbally abusing a female colleague after a boozy festive lunch . A top official at the scandal-hit Police Federation has quit after verbally abusing a female colleague following a boozy Christmas lunch attended by senior officers. Vice-chairman Steve Evans became the union’s third high-ranking member to resign under a cloud this year. Insiders said he had no choice but to step down after having a heated altercation with the woman during which ‘very angry words were exchanged’. Mr Evans, who has led moves to improve ‘professional standards’ in the police, had been in the post for just seven months. In April, the Federation’s chairman and general secretary quit days after the Daily Mail revealed the union had hired a PR firm for a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the Government. The Mail has run investigations revealing how the Federation, representing 125,000 rank-and-file officers, had: . The latest shameful episode happened in the bar of its £26million HQ in Leatherhead, Surrey, last week when senior officials attended their Christmas lunch. It was described by sources as a boozy affair. Several officials retired to the bar but the mood turned when Mr Evans became involved in the ugly altercation with a female colleague. A source said: ‘Steve lost his temper. He said things he should not have done. It was not sexist or racist, just completely inappropriate. It was witnessed by a number of people and he had no choice but to resign.’ Another told the Mail: ‘In days gone by, this sort of incident would probably have been brushed under the carpet. But in the new era of reform, it could not be tolerated.’ Mr Evans joined Derbyshire Police in 1987 and worked as a patrol officer for a decade. Later he became a Federation representative and was appointed secretary of its Sergeants Branch Board. His profile on the union website says his interests ‘were always centred on discipline issues and within a short time he became discipline liaison officer where he gained a great deal of conduct experience’. Mr Evans’ leading role in professional standards led to him being elected vice-chairman in May. Last night his resignation was confirmed by chairman Steve White in a statement released to the Mail. ‘There was a relatively minor incident between the vice-chair and a member of staff last Monday evening after the staff Christmas lunch had finished,’ he said. ‘All parties involved in the disagreement had consumed alcohol and while the incident was relatively minor, the vice-chair felt he should offer his resignation. ‘On a personal level. I would say that Steve’s contribution to the Federation during a period of unprecedented change had been exemplary and will be missed.’ Mr White added that the union ‘has moved on significantly’ since setting up an independent review by former Home Office mandarin Sir David Normington last year. ‘We will not accept any behaviour which could be perceived to undermine the professional standards we uphold,’ he said. Mr Evans has declined to comment but the union said he plans to retire in April and join his wife in the Caribbean where she works. The Federation’s then chairman Steve Williams and general secretary Ian Rennie quit in April after the Mail’s PR revelations. Both knew of the decision to award a minimum £10,000-a-month deal to a public relations company to oppose Coalition plans to change police pay and reform. The plan was agreed weeks before the Plebgate clash in 2012 between then chief whip Andrew Mitchell and a policeman in Downing Street. Critics argue the Federation mercilessly exploited this in its campaign against ministers.","Steve Evans is third high-ranking member to resign under a cloud this year .

"A diabetic motorist who caused the death of a cyclist after suffering a medical episode at the wheel has been jailed. Police said Charles Maxted - a Type 1 diabetic most of his adult life - had been 'significantly lax' in his daytime testing regime. The family of his victim criticised Maxted for his 'complacency' as they called on all diabetic drivers to check their glucose levels before every journey. Type 1 diabetic Charles Maxted, 53, (left) has been jailed for 15 months after he admitted causing the crash which left cyclist Graham Epps (right) dead . Maxted, 53, was driving a Vauxhall Meriva when he crashed into cyclist Graham Epps on the A2 at Boughton, Kent, at around 7.40pm on August 3 2012. Mr Epps was declared dead at the scene. Maxted, of Glen Walk in Yorkletts, near Whitstable, pleaded guilty to death by dangerous driving at a hearing on September 1, Kent Police said. At Maidstone Crown Court yesterday, he was sentenced to a 15-month jail term and was disqualified from driving for 20 years. Mr Epps with his girlfriend Melanie Smith (right). His family criticised Maxted for his 'complacency' as they called on all diabetic drivers to check their glucose levels before every journey . In a statement following sentencing, Mr Epps's family said: 'Our Graham's death was most certainly an avoidable one. The ripples of the events from that evening were felt all around the world. 'It is every driver's responsibility not only to drive safely but to ensure they are fit to be behind the wheel before they drive. 'In our Graham's case, tragically, this did not happen. That evening Graham was given a life sentence. No sentence given to the driver involved would ever change the events of that evening. 'However, some things can and must change. 'Drivers with medical conditions have to be 100 per cent sure they are fit to drive before they get behind the wheel - something that is expected of all drivers, no matter what their circumstances. 'A driving licence is a privilege, not a right. We ask that all drivers respect that privilege. Maxted, 53, was driving a Vauxhall Meriva when he crashed into cyclist Graham Epps on the A2 at Boughton, Kent, at around 7.40pm on August 3 2012. Pictured are flowers left at the crash site . 'The complacency of one driver's actions that evening could so easily have been far more severe. So many lives are deeply affected by one such event, lives that will never be the same. 'We want to prevent this happening to others. In Graham's memory, we wish to raise awareness, so that one good thing can come from this tragic event. 'We want to say publicly: all drivers with diabetes must check their glucose levels before every journey and not think that it doesn't matter or rely on that they feel OK, because it certainly does matter. 'The consequences of not testing resulted in the death of Graham.' Around 10 per cent of all adults with diabetes have Type 1, which usually appears before the age of 40 and especially in childhood. It is treated by daily insulin injections, a healthy diet and regular physical activity. Inspector Martin Stevens, from the roads policing unit at Kent Police, said following sentencing: 'Maxted, a Type 1 diabetic for most of his adult life, had been significantly lax in his daytime testing regime. 'The sentence imposed should serve as a reminder to all driving licence-holders that the consequences of driving when not fit are truly devastating.'","Charles Maxted admitted causing crash which left Graham Epps dead .

About 5,000 residents from the East Kilmore and Kinglake area - in Victoria's north - who took part in the class action will share in $494.7 million. Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires broke out in 2009 and were the worst natural disaster in Australia's history. Victoria's Black Saturday bushfires broke out in February 2009 were the worst natural disaster in Australia's history . The survivors sued electricity provider SP AusNet, Utility Services Corporation Limited and the Department of Sustainability and Environment after 119 lives were lost in the fires on February 7, 2009. The class action was settled in July without admission of liability and approved by Victoria Supreme Court Justice Robert Osborn on Tuesday. Justice Osborn said the legal battle could have resulted in no outcome for group members. The settlement was reached after a trial that was fiercely contested for 16 months, and he said the settlement was a legally and commercially significant sum. Lead plaintiff Carol Matthews, who lost her son Sam in the fires, addressed media after the payout was approved . Class action was taken against SP AusNet, Utility Services Corporation Limited and the Department of Sustainability and Environment . Justice Osborn said in addition to the lives lost in the blaze, more than 1,000 people were injured, and 1,172 homes and properties were destroyed. There were only two relevant objections received from more than 5,000 group members, he said. Justice Osborn ordered that the legal costs of $60 million be paid by group members. Lead plaintiff Carol Matthews, who lost her son Sam in the fires, addressed media after the payout was approved. The 22-year-old died after their St Andrews home was engulfed in flames from the Kilmore East blaze. His parents were away on vacation at the time and he remained in the home because he thought the fire would not make it to their property, The Age reported. Almost 120 people died in the Black Saturday bushfires and destroyed more than 1,100 homes . 'We finally get to ease the financial struggle that so many people are facing on a day-to-day basis, and for that I am really thankful,' Ms Matthews said after the ruling was delivered . An emotional Ms Matthews said the agreement sent a warning to other companies to make sure nothing like the Black Saturday bushfires happened again. She said she was both relieved and comforted by the outcome, which help victims get their lives back on track. 'We finally get to ease the financial struggle that so many people are facing on a day-to-day basis, and for that I am really thankful,' Ms Matthews said, according to the Herald Sun. Every day of the court hearing she wore a symbol of her love for her son - a five-cent coin with the word 'to infinity and beyond' on it as well as the infinity symbol. She said it gave her strength during the difficult times. 'I've held on to it knowing that at some stage he would help us to get some justice for all those people that died,' Ms Matthews said. 'It isn't just about Sam, it’s about the other 119 people that died on that day.' Ms Matthews was on the phone with her son when the fire reached their home, the court heard when it was her turn to give evidence during the trial. 'Suddenly he went ""Oh my god, the tree's on fire ... oh my god it's just exploded"", then within seconds his whole tone of voice changed into a voice of panic and said ""Oh god there's fire everywhere"",' she said.","Black Saturday bushfires broke out in northern Victoria in February 2009 .

"In the frantic last-minute rush to buy presents and groceries before December 25, consumers are being warned not to fall for major Christmas rip-offs. Choice and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) have put out a list of retail traps they say shoppers should avoid this festive season. Christmas hampers, unnecessary warranties and misleading lay-by agreements are among the things shoppers should be on the lookout for. The ACCC has taken action against a number of companies in December for breaching consumer law in the lead up to Christmas. Choice and the ACCC have put out a list of retail traps they say shoppers should avoid this festive season . 1. EXPENSIVE CHRISTMAS HAMPERS . Before you buy a gift basket or hamper, make sure you check the quality of the ingredients inside and their individual prices. Choice spokesman Tom Godfrey said an investigation found that some hampers – including Chrisco's Traditional Christmas and Bonus Hamper – are over 20 percent more expensive than the items cost online at Coles and Woolworths. Choice also found hidden among great gifts such as chocolates and wine were mundane items like two-minute noodles and cans of spaghetti. 2. NEEDLESS EXTENDED WARRANTIES . When buying electronics, appliances and whitegoods don't fall for buying an unnecessary extended warranty. Shoppers are covered for the right to a refund, repair or replacement under consumer law. Mr Godfrey says to apply the 'reasonable person's test' – if a reasonable person would expect an item to last longer than 12 months or two years but it breaks before this time, then you are able to invoke your rights. This month, appliance company Fisher & Paykel was fined $200,000 for sending letters to customers who purchased dishwashers, saying they needed to pay up to $220 to extend the product's warranty beyond two years. Federal Court Justice Michael Wigney said the statement was 'false and misleading' because the company only included the correct part of consumer law in fine print on the reverse side of the letter. The ACCC alleges Christco Hampers' lay-by contracts  allowed the company to continue to take payments by direct debit after the consumer had fully paid for their lay-by agreement . The items contained in the Chrisco Bonus Hamper cost less if you buy them at Coles or Woolworths . 3. FAKE PARCEL COLLECTION . The ACCC has warned Australians to watch out for scammers who send emails posing as postal services and asking for money for parcel delivery. The con artists pose as Australia Post or FedEx, and send emails telling people they missed a parcel delivery at home. The emails say that information for retrieving the package is included in an attachment. But the file is actually and executable file (.exe) and once opened, will install ransomware on your computer. Ransomware is a type of malware that restricts access to the computer system that it infects, and demands a ransom be paid to the creator of the malware in order for the restriction to be removed. Other scams offer to redeliver the parcel at another time for a fee of up to $30. The ACCC has received 400 complaints about the issue from Australians this year who have lost a total of $100,000. 4. MISLEADING LAY-BY AGREEMENTS . On Monday, the ACCC started proceedings against Christco Hampers alleging the company included an unfair contract term in its 2014 lay-by agreements. Chrisco's 'HeadStart Plan' allegedly allowed Chrisco to continue to take payments by direct debit after the consumer had fully paid for their lay-by agreement. Under this term, consumers were required to opt out in order to avoid having further payments deducted after their lay-by has been paid for. It is also alleged that Chrisco charged consumers a lay-by termination fee in excess of Chrisco's reasonable costs in relation to those lay-by agreements. Misleading lay-by contracts and unnecessary warranties are among the things shoppers should be wary of . 5. NOT-SO-FREE-RANGE EGGS . Before you grab a carton of free range eggs to make that Christmas pavlova, double check that they really are free range. Choice found that Australians are willing to pay $3-$5 more per dozen for eggs that are free-range, but there is no legally binding definition of free-range so it is difficult to know if you are purchasing the real deal. Earlier this month, the ACCC took action against Darling Downs Fresh Eggs and Ecoeggs alleging their 'free range' claims were misleading. The ACCC alleges that from 31 December 2013 to 6 October 2014, Darling Downs Fresh Eggs labelled eggs as 'free range' when in fact the laying hens had been continuously confined to barns and had never had access to the outdoors. 6. EXPENSIVE COSMETICS . Many shoppers resort to lipsticks and other cosmetics as easy stocking-fillers, but Australians face a significant mark-up on most major make-up and fragrance labels. Choice suggests shopping on overseas websites using a virtual private network (VPN) to hide the fact you are shopping from Australia in order to access lower prices. Earlier this month, the ACCC took action against  Ecoeggs alleging their 'free range' claims were misleading . 7. GIFT CARDS THAT RUN OUT QUICKLY . Make sure you read the fine print of any gift cards you purchase and be on the lookout for unreasonable restrictions. Choice recommends cards that can be used at multiple retailers, with no expiry date. 8. CREDIT CARDS WITH HIGH INTEREST FEES . Choice research shows 48 percent of Australians don't know the interest rate they pay on their credit card. Before you rack up debt buying Christmas present and groceries, make sure you know what you will need to repay and that you can afford the payments. 9. DODGY ADVERTISED PRICES . Mr Godfrey said shoppers should be wary of airlines and hotels that advertise great deals, then drip in extra fees and surcharges as you go through the online checkout process.","Choice and the ACCC put out list of retail traps shoppers should avoid .

"A man who stormed off the set of a television program while wearing an Islamic State symbol is behind bars after he was charged with possessing documents listing potential targets for a terrorist attack. Sulayman Khalid, 20, from Regents Park in Sydney's west, was formally refused bail in Parramatta Local Court today after he and a 21-year-old Marsfield man were arrested in counter-terrorism raids overnight. The Marsfield man, who cannot be named, was charged with breaching a Control Order. He refused bail after a magistrate deemed him an 'unacceptable risk to the community'. It is also alleged he had plans to carry out guerrilla warfare in the Blue Mountains, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. The arrests followed raids around 1.30pm last Thursday where police seized a large number of documents outlining possible Federal and State government targets, a rifle and two shotguns. Scroll down for video . Sulayman Khalid, pictured on the SBS Insight program, has been charged with allegedly possessing documents outlining 'potential Federal and State government entities for an attack' Sulayman Khalid is pictured here during a court appearance earlier this year . Sulayman Kalid challenged Daily Mail Australia to a running race outside of court earlier this year . Deputy NSW Police Commissioner Catherine Burn said the men were arrested as part of an ongoing investigation into an apparent ring of 15 to 20 people. She said 11 people have been charged so far under the counter-terrorism operation, known by the codename Appleby. The same investigation conducted the largest raids in the nation's history on September 18, which involved more than 800 NSW and Federal Police. AFP Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan told reporters the men shared the 'ideology' of the Islamic State terror group. 'It is a group of people here in Sydney who we've been actively monitoring for a long time,' he said. 'Certainly their ideology is linked to [Islamic State].' Adam Houda, Khalid's lawyer, told Daily Mail Australia his client has been charged with a very serious offence. 'But I want to remind you that the authorities have got it wrong in the past many times,' Mr Houda said. 'I ask that the court process be respected and for this matter to be determined on the evidence and not by politicians and the media.' A 21-year-old man was arrested for breaching a Control Order . The largest terror raids in the nation's history were conducted earlier this year . Under the name Abu Bakr, Khalid appeared on the SBS program Insight earlier this year for a forum about the Federal government's cancellation of terror suspect's passports. The part-time labourer had his passport suspended last December. He stormed off the set after facing a grilling over his support for the Islamic State terror group. In a separate hearing, prosecutors alleged today that the Marsfield man breached the conditions of his control order by using a public telephone and a mobile phone which did not belong to him in the space of an hour on Monday evening. His lawyer, Arjun Chhabra, told the court the mobile belonged to his mother and said his age should be taken into consideration. Today's arrests follow an extraordinary pre-Christmas message from Prime Minister Tony Abbott, where he warned a terrorist attack remains 'likely'. 'The briefing from the security agencies today indicated there has been a heightened level of terrorist chatter in the aftermath of the Martin Place siege,' he said. He said security agencies would be 'highly visible' as the nation moves into the festive season. On December 15, crazed gunman Man Haron Monis held 18 people hostage for more than 16 hours at the Martin Place cafe. Barrister Katrina Dawson, hospitality worker Tori Johnson and Monis were killed on Tuesday morning as the siege came to a bloody end.

"California saw one of the worst droughts in history but Yosemite National Park's waterfalls are back adding a droplet of hope in the dry state. Following powerful storms in December the Yosemite Falls are back after having dried up in June and failing to flow again in November like they have in the past. Two major storms that moved through California revived the Yosemite Falls along with the Bridevall Fall and the Cascarde Fall, reports The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Flowing again: A general view of the Yosemite Falls flowing in Yosemite National Park in December after picture two days of heavy rains have re-invigorated the landmark falls . Dried up: This photo shows the famous Yosemite Falls minus the water this summer after drought in California dried up one of the state's most famous natural wonders . Park employee Ryan Sheridan told The Los Angeles Times that when he first saw water flowing off the rocks he was skeptical that the falls had actually returned. 'One day later, Yosemite Falls came back. I was riding my bike to work and I just stopped and kept looking,' Ryan Sheridan, an employee at one of the park’s restaurants, said . 'It's hard to miss. It's the essence of pure power.' Yosemite Falls is the parks most famous waterfall and is one of the tallest in North America. There are three separate waterfalls that drop a total of 2,425 feet. 'Hopefully we get a lot of snow and the falls come back with a vengeance,' continued Sheridan. 'I don't think it means the drought is over or that the climate isn't changing, but it's comforting to see a natural process greater than anything we can control.' Despite the waterfalls return, this month's rain isn't doing much to improve the drought afflicting the state. State Officials said on December 12 that consistent rains will be necessary to water California which is in its fourth year of drought. As a consequence of the drought, California saw some of its most violent wildfires including the Rim Fire of 21013, the worst fire in Sierra Nevada history. There was also a huge fire in September that forced officials to airlift 100 hikers from Half Dome in the Yosemite National Park. Park Employee Lucy Garces, 27, said that she found the sound of the falls comforting after an especially dry summer. 'I was a little terrified this summer. There were fires all around. Every time, they said it depended on which way the wind blew if there was going to be fire in the valley,' she said. ‘Now there are waterfalls surrounding us again.’ Dry summer: Following powerful storms in December the Yosemite Falls are back after having dried up in June (pictured) and failing to flow again in November like they have in the past .

"A window washer who fell 11 stories from a downtown San Francisco building onto a moving car last month wants to eventually return to work as his memory continues to improve, his wife said Monday. Pedro Perez is preparing to leave the hospital for a rehabilitation facility where he hopes to walk again. The 58-year-old man fractured his pelvis, broke an arm, ruptured an artery in his arm, and sustained severe brain trauma when he landed on the Toyota Camry after falling from the top of a bank building in San Francisco's financial district on November 21. Perez spent a week in a medically induced coma and still can't move his right arm and leg. The car's driver was not injured. But just a month after the fall, Perez has amazed doctors who originally said it would be months before he could leave the hospital, his wife, Maricela Perez told reporters on Monday. Scroll down for video . Family: Maricela Perez, 39, of San Leandro, California, the wife of window washer Pedro Perez, who survived an 11-story fall, lowers her head as her daughter Gaby, 11, listens during a news conference Monday . Survivor: Pedro Perez (seen left and right) fell 11 stories from a downtown San Francisco building onto a moving car last month . 'They are saying it's a miracle,' she said through a translator. Maricela Perez spoke in Spanish about her husband's recovery at his union shop in Oakland. She said he is in good spirits, complaining about the hospital food and even joking about returning to work down the line, although the couple has agreed it won't be as a window washer. She said she thought he was dead for the first hour after she heard about the accident. At first, her husband could not recognize members of their extended family, but his memory is slowly improving, she said. 'His eyes were shut for an entire week,' Marciela Perez said, according to Bay Area News Group. 'At first when he woke up, he could only say a few words and couldn't remember familiar faces, and his memory would fail him. But now he is calling us by our names and has conversations.' 'As a wife, I am very grateful to have my husband for the holidays,' she said. Plummet: Perez fractured his pelvis, broke an arm, ruptured an artery in his arm, and sustained severe brain trauma when he landed on the Toyota Camry after falling from the top of a bank building on November 21 . Accident: Nearly two dozen people ran to Perez, who was on his back after the fall. He was lucid, though he was bleeding . Horror: San Francisco's financial district was bustling at 10am on the day of the fall and witnesses described hearing the man screaming and seeing a blue streak and his shadow as he fell onto the moving car . Union organizer Colin O'Leary said worker's compensation would be expected to pay for the cost of Perez's hospitalization and rehabilitation. But without the man's income, the family needs money to help cover rent, utilities, food and school supplies for their two youngest daughters, ages 11 and 16. Marciela Perez, who works in a plastic factory in San Leandro, California, where the family also lives, said she is working extra hours and the couple's 19-year-old daughter has dropped out of college to help her family. 'It's not easy to be here asking for help,' the wife said Monday. 'But Pedro was always a very hard worker and he was the one helping us make ends meet.' San Francisco's financial district was bustling at 10am on the day of the fall and witnesses described hearing the man screaming and seeing a blue streak and his shadow as he fell onto the moving car, crushing its roof and sending shattered glass flying into the street. NBC Bay Area reported that Perez dropped 130 feet during the November incident. Nearly two dozen people ran to Perez, who was on his back. He was lucid, though he was bleeding.

"Triple J presenter and stand up comedian Matt Okine has revealed his girlfriend of nine years cheated on him with his best friend. The 29-year-old breakfast radio host told Pedestrian TV the long-term couple broke up right before he took up his new role at Triple J earlier this year.

'I found out she was having an affair with my best friend,' Okine said. 'At one stage we were all living together in the house, (it's) full on sort of TV s***. 'Fidelity is such a flimsy reality. So many people hide behind this idea of monogamy and it's all bulls***. I don't know a single couple that I'm friends with who haven't strayed. 'Sometimes you just sit around and you feel so silly – am I the only f***ing idiot who is faithful?'

"On trial: Wasila Tasi'u, 14, could face the death penalty for the alleged murder of her husband, 35 . A Nigerian child bride has 'admitted' murdering her 35-year-old husband with rat poison by signing a confession  she could not read - with her thumbprint. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for 14-year-old Wasila Tasi'u, whose farmer husband Umar Sani was found dead just days after marrying her in April. If she is found guilty, the teenager - who is from a poor and deeply conservative Muslim family and cannot write - could become the first child in Nigeria to be executed in 18 years. Human rights campaigners have expressed outrage over her treatment, saying she should be seen as a victim of abuse. But the case has prompted mixed reactions in her impoverished home state of Kano, where  Sharia (Islamic) law is in place alongside the laws of the government. That, claim some followers, allows child marriage - and 14 is a normal age for a bride. Gezawa High Court overflowed yesterday as prosecutors closed their case in the murder trial, with people peering in through the open windows and a crowd so large it spilled out of the gallery door. Homicide investigator Abdullahi Adamu revealed he translated Wasila's statement from her native language, Hausa, into English, which she did not speak. Despite being unable to read the document she then signed it, he told the court. She could not write her name so 'she had to use a thumbprint,' he added. One of the prosecution witnesses was the farmer's second wife Ramatu, who told how her 'co-wife' prepared him dinner before being due to go to bed with him. The court heard the murder victim had married Ramatu previously in the village of Unguwar Yansoro, which sits in a region where polygamy is widespread. Ramatu said she got along well with the 14-year-old and  the two had prepared  food together on April 5, the day Sani died. Scroll down for video . Outrage: Human rights activists are angry at the treatment of the 14-year old, who is pictured with one of her lawyers outside the court. If she is executed, it will be Nigeria's first reported execution of a child since 1997 . Because it was Wasila's turn to share a bed with her new husband, she was also entitled to serve him his meal. 'After putting the food in the dish I didn't see anybody put anything in it,' Ramatu said - but later she saw her husband foaming at the mouth and unable to walk. Previously a seven-year-old girl who Wasila allegedly sent to buy rat poison was called to give evidence. Identified only as Hamziyya, the young girl - believed to be Ramatu's sister - was living in the same house as the 14-year-old and her new husband at the time of his death. 'She said rats were disturbing her in her room,' Hamziyya told the court. Shopkeeper Abuwa Yusuf confirmed selling  poison to the girl, and neighbour Abdulrahim Ibrahim said: 'When [Sani] brought the food I noticed some sandy-like particles, black in colour'. Gezawa High Court (pictured) overflowed yesterday as prosecutors closed their case in the murder trial, with people peering in through the open windows and a crowd so large it spilled out of the gallery door . The neighbour ate four of the small balls made of bean paste but 'was not comfortable with the taste', he said, adding: 'It was only Umar (Sani) who continued eating.' Previous court reports suggested three other people had died after allegedly eating the contaminated food, but all four deaths had been combined into one murder charge. The case has raised the spectre of child marriage in Nigeria, where campaigners say almost two fifths of children are married off before their 18th birthday. Some 16 per cent are married before they turn 15, according to the campaign group Girls Not Brides - and the rates are the highest in the north, near where Wasila lived. Hussaina Ibrahim from the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA), who is representing the teenager, told The Guardian: 'We are against the trial. The whole process violates her fundamental rights. 'The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child says she should be in education. She should be in school'. Sani Garba, 55, holds a picture of Wasila, who is his daughter-in-law, at her abandoned matrimonial home in the village of Unguwar Yansoro. Polygamy and child marriage are widespread in northern Nigeria . But others including the 14-year-old's own relatives have rejected the notion she was forced into marriage. They have said that 14 is a common age to marry in the deeply impoverished region and that she chose Sani from among many suitors. A motion by defence lawyers to have the case moved to juvenile court was rejected, despite claims by human rights activists that she is too young to stand trial for murder in a high court. The use of Sharia law has also made the case more complicated, because there are no guidelines saying where Islamic law ends and state law begins. According to Human Rights Watch, Nigeria is not known to have executed a juvenile offender since 1997, when the country was ruled by military dictator Sani Abacha. The trial, in which a not guilty plea was entered for the 14-year-old, has been adjourned until February 16.","Prosecutors have sought death penalty for 14-year-old Wasila Tasi'u .

"The wife of a suspected jihadist has been cleared of buying supplies to help her husband to carry out terrorist attacks. Gerri Tahari was accused of using an account on auction website eBay to buy a variety of equipment to send to her husband Rabat, who was fighting in Syria at the head of extremist forces. However, she was acquitted today after medical reports suggested that she has been suffering from depression. Cleared: Gerri Tahari was accused of helping fund terror but the charges have now been dropped . The 45-year-old mother of two from Birmingham was first arrested in February this year. She appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court in March alongside Moazzam Begg, who spent three years as a prisoner at the  Guantanamo Bay military base. Mr Begg was accused of providing terrorist training and funding terrorism, but the charges were dropped in October when prosecutors were told he had links with MI5. Mrs Tahari, had been accused of sending her husband 72 pairs of Wellington boots, gloves, a soup kettle, Russian Cossack-style military hats, sleeping mats, long range walkie-talkies, eye goggles, a fleece, and a balaclava between April 2012 and November last year. Arrest: Mrs Tahari was originally arrested alongside Moazzam Begg, a former prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, who has also since been cleared . During her initial court hearing, a prosecutor said: 'Rabat Tahari is the defendant's husband, and the prosecution case is he was and remains a Syrian terrorist commander of a rebel group.' The fighter has apparently lost an eye and been left with permanent damage in his leg through his fighting in the Syrian conflict. But during a hearing at the Old Bailey today, the court heard that the Crown Prosecution Service would be dropping all charges against Mrs Tahari in the light of medical reports on her. 'We have had time to consider their content and effect,' said prosecutor Brian Altman QC. 'None of what they reveal was known at the time the charging decision was made. 'Now that we have them and having carefully considered their content the view has been taken both by the CPS and law officers that it is no longer in the public interest to continue with her prosecution. 'In the light of that we offer no evidence.' Judge Nicholas Hilliard QC formally entered a not guilty verdict on the single charge of entering into or becoming concerned with a terrorist funding arrangement. Mrs Tahari's son, Hemmo Moloud Tahari, 20, was accused of funding Rabat Tahari with his housing benefit before the case against him was dropped in July.","Gerri Tahari was accused of using eBay to buy clothes for husband Rabat .

"A 14-year-old mystery could finally be solved after a piece of clothing handed into police is believed to be the bodysuit worn by Cathy Freeman during the opening ceremony of the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. The iconic suit was donned by the former athlete when she lit the Olympic torch and disappeared from her dressing room at Stadium Australia in September 2000. It has not been seen since then but more than a decade later authorities have had a break-through. Cathy Freeman's bodysuit went missing in September 2000 from her dressing room at Stadium Australia . A Victoria police spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an item had been handed over to them by a representative of the Melbourne Cricket Club at the Melbourne East station. 'The article was alleged to have been stolen in NSW in the year 2000,' he said. 'Police are attempting to confirm the authenticity of the item and are liaising with the NSW Police.'

"Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended just three traders so far for allegedly rigging the £3.5trillion-a-day foreign exchange market. Yesterday the state-backed lender revealed it had made painstakingly slow progress since launching an investigation six weeks ago into more than 50 current and former traders. It was fined almost £400million last month by US and UK regulators for its part in one of the worst financial scandals in memory. State backed lender RBS has revealed only three traders have been suspended so far for allegedly rigging the £3.5trillion-a-day foreign exchange market . In total six banks – including HSBC – were fined £2.6billion for trying to manipulate the ‘wild west’ foreign exchange (forex) market to generate more profits and boost their bonuses. RBS yesterday said it had frozen the bonuses of 18 individuals and added that no one suspected of being involved in wrongdoing would receive a pay-out until its review is completed. The high street giant said it had also identified a number of supervisors and senior management from the forex business whose ‘responsibilities and accountabilities’ were being considered. But it said that just six employees had been placed into a disciplinary process so far, with three of them suspended. This is unchanged from its announcement last month. RBS yesterday said it had frozen the bonuses of 18 individuals and added that no one suspected of being involved in wrongdoing would receive a pay-out until its review is completed . Jon Pain, head of conduct and regulatory affairs at RBS, said: ‘This is a complicated process but also an essential one in order to identify culpability and accountability for this unacceptable misconduct.’ He added: ‘There is no place for any misconduct at the RBS we are building. We want to get these things settled so we can put these issues behind us and get on with rebuilding trust in this bank.’ Last week a former RBS trader was arrested at his home in Billericay, Essex – becoming the first to be snared by the Serious Fraud Office for his alleged involvement in the forex scam. The update from RBS comes after the Chancellor confirmed that manipulating foreign currency rates, as well as other markets such as oil and gold, will become a criminal offence carrying a jail sentence of up to seven years.","Royal Bank of Scotland launched investigation into currency rigging at bank .

"Border Force officials are investigating former staff at a scandal-hit care home, it was revealed yesterday. They were called in to Merok Park in Surrey after it was closed without notice following an inspection and the elderly residents moved. One 85-year-old man died within hours. But his death has been shrouded in secrecy with officials refusing to release his name. Border Force officials are investigating former staff at scandal-hit care home Merok Park, in Banstead, Surrey, run by Mauritian businessman Soondressen Cooppen, 51, (left) and his wife Maleenee, 42 (right) Members of the Home Office’s immigration law enforcement command are investigating whether staff at Merok Park, in Banstead, were working in Britain illegally. A spokesman for the Home Office said: ‘We take all allegations of illegal working seriously and will take action where we find it.’ The scandal surrounding Merok Park broke on December 11 when it was shut by inspectors who found 26 elderly and vulnerable residents living in appalling conditions. They were moved by ambulance, still in their pyjamas, on a bitterly cold night. The 85-year-old man was taken to a nearby nursing home but died within 48 hours. As the Daily Mail reported yesterday, his death has been cloaked in official secrecy, with the Surrey coroner, the registration officer, police, the county council and the local NHS trust all refusing even to release the man’s name. Guildford register office said it could not name the pensioner because of data protection rules – even though these do not apply to the dead. Yesterday Government sources signalled that ministers are unhappy with this failure to comply with the principle that deaths must be publicly recorded. Merok Park (pictured) was shut by inspectors earlier this month after they found 26 elderly and vulnerable residents living in appalling conditions . One said: ‘There is never any issue about releasing the names of people who die in tragic circumstances. So this case looks like using data protection for purposes that were never intended. Common sense should be applied. The sense of secrecy will just make a sad and distressing situation worse.’ While the secrecy row continued yesterday, the involvement of Border Force officials at Merok Park was disclosed by one of the three councils who used the care home and whose social workers have been dealing with the aftermath of the sudden shutdown. Sutton council, which was paying £500 a week for each of its six residents, said it was co-operating with the Border Force, police and the Care Quality Commission in an inquiry which features ‘significant interest’ in the way Merok Park was run. A council spokesman added: ‘We don’t believe this is the end of the matter.’ The closure of Merok Park came after CQC inspectors found an ‘overpowering’ smell of urine, patients forced to wash in cold water and a broken lift which effectively imprisoned some on the top floor of the building. They were also concerned that the home was employing untrained staff. Some had neither passed police checks nor received relevant training and were working up to 60 hours a week. Sutton council said it had raised concerns about two other homes in the borough operated by the owners of Merok Park: Grantley Court and Faygate House. Grantley Court has also since been closed while Faygate House – a residential home rather than a nursing home – remains open under the supervision of the CQC and social workers. All three homes were run by Mauritian businessman Soondressen Cooppen, 51, and his wife Maleenee, 42. The couple, who live in a £2million house in Cheam, are thought to have been earning £650,000 a year from each. Surrey Police said officers are working with a CQC board which is considering the Merok Park affair but there is no separate police investigation.","Officials called to Merok Park, Surrey, after it was closed without notice .

"Millions of online shoppers will log on today as the traditional Boxing Day sales start two days early. The clamour for the best deals began as early as 6am when the first major retailer started to slash its prices. Other stores were joining in during the day with deals of up to 70 per cent off in a battle for sales after an unexpected slowdown in spending. Millions of online shoppers will log on today as the traditional Boxing Day sales start two days early . The frenzy will continue through Christmas Day, when cyber-shoppers are expected to spend a record £636million – or £441,000 a minute – in the hunt for online bargains. The number of visits to internet stores tomorrow will soar to 142million, a 25 per cent jump from last year, Britain’s online retailer association the IMRG predicts. But industry experts warned the vicious discounting war could be bad news for struggling retailers as their profits fall. Debenhams’ sale went live from 6am, with John Lewis, Next, House of Fraser, Marks & Spencer and many more launching theirs throughout today. There are hundreds of half-price deals on everything from lingerie to furniture. Some shops are so desperate to shift winter stock, particularly coats, woollen clothes, hats and boots, that they are cutting prices by as much as 70 per cent. The Black Friday and Cyber Monday events did not encourage customers to spend more but simply brought forward much of the shopping normally done closer to Christmas, analysts said . Scenes from a Black Friday sale at an Asda store in Wembley, London, where shoppers desperately tried to grab bargains, such as a Polaroid TV for £139 . The biggest bargains include a Krups coffee machine worth £149.99 sold for half price at House of Fraser; a £1,499 LG television reduced by 47 per cent to £799 at Currys PC World; and a £200 ten-piece stainless steel pan set on sale for just £60, or 70 per cent less, at Debenhams. Stores have been shifting their bargains earlier each year and this year’s pre-Christmas discounts come as panicking high street shops try to bump up profits and shift stock after a disappointing December for many. The Black Friday and Cyber Monday events at the end of November, when many stores slashed prices for a short time, did not encourage customers to spend more but simply brought forward much of the shopping normally done closer to Christmas, analysts said. This means there have been fewer shoppers on the high street in recent weeks than this time last year. John Lewis revealed yesterday that its sales over the last week – normally a particularly lucrative time – were down by 2.4 per cent from the 2013 figures. It said a big fall in sales of home electricals, such as TVs, was a direct reflection of the impact of Black Friday. And chocolate chain Thorntons has issued a profit warning following a slump in orders of its products from supermarkets. Industry analysts Ipsos Retail Performance said there has been a total fall of 1.8 per cent in shoppers at non-food stores in the past week compared with last year. Other stores were joining in during the day with deals of up to 70 per cent off in a battle for sales after an unexpected slowdown in spending . Julie Palmer, of business consultants Begbies Traynor, said: ‘This negative trend spells bad tidings for retailers large and small who don’t have John Lewis’s brand and promotional budget to fall back on. ‘As Christmas shoppers move online for the best deals and appear to be buying less for less, all UK retailers have been drawn into a vicious discounting war, slashing prices and therefore profit margins in a bid to compete. ‘With John Lewis dampening down expectations and Thorntons announcing the sector’s first profit warning before Christmas trading has even concluded, I think it’s safe to say we can expect to see some high-profile casualties come 2015.’ John Lewis saw an annual increase in sales of fashion, homeware and small electricals such as Nespresso coffee machines, but it is banking on a last-minute rush to hit its Christmas sales targets. Retail director Andrew Murphy said: ‘We have seen a building trend of customers leaving their gift purchases right up until the last minute … Our partners are standing ready for a very busy final trading day before the festive break.’ The IMRG’s Tina Spooner said: ‘Some 70 per cent of e-retailers offered discounts and promotions over the Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend and we are likely to see a higher number launching sales over Christmas and Boxing Day.’","Cyber-shoppers expected to spend a record £636m on Christmas Day .

"Mortgage approvals have dropped by a fifth as the winter chill intensifies in Britain’s housing market. Figures from the British Bankers’ Association reveal tougher rules on lending have put the brakes on home loans. The number of mortgages approved on house purchases dropped to 36,717 in November – down for the fifth straight month and a 20 per cent slump on the same period last year. Mortgage approvals have dropped by a fifth as the winter chill intensifies in Britain’s housing market, it has been revealed ( file picture) Levels are now at their lowest since April last year, when the housing market was just beginning to heat up. Richard Woolhouse, the BBA’s chief economist, said: ‘Today’s figures show quite a sharp chill to the housing market in recent months – with house purchase approvals during November 20 per cent lower than a year before.’ Experts say the slowdown in the housing market has been driven by tougher affordability checks introduced in April as part of the Mortgage Market Review – designed to stop households overstretching themselves. In some cases applicants in their late thirties and forties are being refused mortgages because lenders feared they may be ‘too old’ to repay their loans into old age. In further evidence that the housing market is cooling, figures released this week indicated that property prices are falling all over Britain as the sector ends the year with a whimper. Average values fell in nearly a third of UK postcodes in the three months to November, according to property website Hometrack. In spring last year there were falls in fewer than one in five areas. There are also growing concerns that houses have become too expensive in areas such as London and the South East. A major shake-up of the Isa market has driven a dramatic increase in the amount of cash being tucked away in the tax free savings accounts. Savers ploughed £12billion into schemes in the year to November – up from £8.7billion on the same period last year, according to figures released yesterday by the British Bankers’ Association. Experts have attributed the 38 per cent surge on the launch of the new ‘super Isa’ in July – in which the annual cash allowance was raised from £5,670 to £15,0000. However, analysts last night said savers are still getting a poor deal, with interest rates at ‘all time lows’. The Bank of England says the average easy access cash Isa, where there are no restrictions on withdrawals, has a rate of just 0.82 per cent – below the current 1 per cent rate of inflation. A saver would earn just £123 in a year on an investment of the full £15,000. Even the best high street deals – by National Savings and Investments and the Post Office, offer rates of just 1.5 per cent. Santander’s Easy Isa and Halifax Variable Rate Isa saver have annual interest of just 0.1 per cent. Charlotte Nelson, of comparison website Moneyfacts, said initial hopes that reforms would herald better deals for savers have not transpired. She added: ‘Whilst it is great news that more savers are investing into Isas since the increase in allowance to £15,000, the fact remains that rates have slumped to all time lows.’ She said savers were paying a high price for government-backed home loan schemes and record low interest base rates. Despite the recent slowdown, overall house prices in Britain are still up on the same period last year. Office for National Statistics figures last week showed the average property is now worth £271,000 – up 10.4 per cent year on year. David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker London & Country, said: ‘The availability of finance had been limited by the Mortgage Market Review. There has also been a lot of talk about a housing bubble – which may have dented confidence.’ Bank of England governor Mark Carney is among those who believe the Chancellor’s radical reforms of stamp duty – unveiled in the Autumn Statement earlier this month – could inject new life into the housing market. The overhaul equates to a tax cut for 98 per cent of homebuyers, with only those buying properties worth more than £937,500 paying more. The number of mortgages approved on house purchases dropped to 36,717 in November – down for the fifth straight month and a 20 per cent slump on the same period last year . Mr Woolhouse added: ‘It will be interesting to see what impact the stamp duty changes the Chancellor unveiled in his Autumn Statement will have early in the New Year. They could prove a modest stocking filler for homebuyers and estate agents.’ Tougher rules on lending under the Mortgage Market Review were introduced in April to force lenders to prove their customers will be able to afford to pay off loans. Fearful of breaking the rules, banks are turning down older applicants who are likely to be making repayments in retirement when incomes are lower. A report last month warned that borrowers in their 40s are being shut out as the average age of a first-time buyer rises to 36.","Figures reveal tougher rules on lending have put the brakes on home loans .

"With his pinstripe suit, big cigar and Tommy Gun he could almost be a Chicago mobster rather than Prime Minister. The Germans seized on this wartime photograph of Winston Churchill to claim the great leader was no more than the kind of gangster who favoured the Thompson submachine gun. But Churchill’s purpose in posing for the picture was as deadly as the weapon he is carrying which, remarkably, has almost certainly been found after being thought lost following the Second World War. Scroll down for video . Morale boost: Winston Churchill with the Thompson submachine gun in the dark days of 1940 . Iconic weapon: Clive McPherson with the Tommy Gun on display at the Combined Military Services Museum in Maldon . The Prime Minister used the gun to inspire a beleaguered Britain during the dark days of the war. This photo was taken in 1940 when he visited troops to raise morale as the country appeared to be on the brink of invasion by Hitler. Many were calling for peace talks with the Germans in the face of the apparently unstoppable Nazi invasion of Western Europe. But Churchill ordered that Britain would fight on and toured the country to rally the forces manning defences. It was while inspecting troops near Hartlepool in July 1940 that Churchill posed with the Tommy Gun. The inspirational image survives, but the iconic weapon was thought to have disappeared – until now. A museum in Essex has laid claim to uncovering the gun which it received as part of a batch of more than 700 weapons for display from the Ministry of Defence. Churchill’s Tommy Gun can now be seen as part of the Donnington Collection at the Combined Military Services Museum in Maldon. The Donnington Collection shows weapons used and captured by the Army during the 19th and 20th centuries . MoD Donnington in Shropshire is the main weapons centre for the armed forces where used firearms are refurbished, sold or scrapped. The Donnington Collection shows weapons used and captured by the Army during the 19th and 20th centuries. Clive McPherson, military historian at the musuem, has painstakingly researched the Churchill Tommy Gun and is confident it is the one in the picture. He said: ‘The gun came to England from America in the first batch sent in early 1940 which were used for propaganda purposes. - A fully automatic Thompson submachine gun can fire up to 900 rounds per minute. - Designed by US General John Thompson, it was meant to replace the unwieldy rifle in First World War trenches, but production didn’t start until after the war. - The US postal service was an early customer – staff used the guns to fend off robbers. Its ease of use also made it the weapon of choice for Prohibition-era gangsters. - Nicknames, apart from Tommy Gun after its designer, included the ‘Chicago typewriter’ because of the hammering sound when fired. - One believed to have been owned by Bonnie and Clyde sold at auction in 2012 for £84,000. - The round magazine made them awkward to hide so mobsters carried them in violin cases. Al Capone hitman Sam Hunt kept his among his golf clubs, earning himself the nickname Golf Bag. - They were used during the Irish Civil War (1922-23) after being supplied by US sympathisers of independence, and also saw action in Vietnam. - More than 2.7million are thought to have been made. - The Queen Mother held one during the Second World War and remarked on how light it was. ‘When we realised we had it here in our possession it was an incredible feeling. The picture inspired the British people as it was Churchill saying ‘‘I will fight for this country in its darkest hour’’. The guns were moved around the country for photographs to give the impression that the troops were all carrying them but in reality there were only about 400 in the country.’ The museum holds two of the four thought to remain from that first batch. Mr McPherson added: ‘I am about 80 per cent certain it is the Churchill Tommy Gun. The gun he held would have been looked after and passed on to Donnington. It is difficult to say for certain, but it is more likely to be than not.’","Winston Churchill held the gun to inspire beleaguered British soldiers .

"An adorable dog who was facing her tenth festive season in a dog shelter has finally found a home - just in time for Christmas. Sophie, the corgi-collie cross, has been unable to find a home for almost a decade, but after her fate hit the headlines last week the shelter was overwhelmed with calls. And in her very own Christmas miracle she is now settled with a new family with a cosy place in front of the fire. Scroll down for video . An adorable dog who was facing her tenth festive season in a dog shelter has finally found a home - just in time for Christmas . Sophie, the corgi-collie cross, has been unable to find a home for almost a decade, but after her fate hit the headlines last week the shelter was overwhelmed with calls . The 11-year-old had been at Hilbrae Kennels, Shropshire, since she was just two-years-old and was regularly passed over for more fashionable breeds and younger dogs. But when dog-lovers Irene and Ken Duffy saw her smiling face and read her heart-wrenching story they knew they had to meet her. Retired Irene, 70, said: 'We knew as soon as we saw her that we wanted to bring her home with us. 'We've had our little Jack Russell Toby for seven years, and my husband did say 'No more dogs'. But when we both saw her little face we said 'Oh we will have her'.' The couple made the two hour journey from their home in Oldham, Manchester, on Saturday to the kennels to see if Sophie was the dog for them where they took her for a walk and got to know her. When they returned on Sunday a senior dog handler assessed the couple and decided they were the perfect fit. Irene said: 'After we heard that she had been in the shelter for nine years I called them straight away to see if we could meet her. It just snowballed from there. Staff at Hilbrae Kennels, Shropshire, including Leanne Breeze the kennel assistant pictured here, were overwhelmed with responses after they appealed for a new owner for Sophie last week . 'We went to the shelter in Shropshire on both days over the weekend to see if she liked us but we would have gone back again and again if that's what it took. 'We used to have a Lurcher, who was also called Sophie, but she died about five months ago so I'm glad that Toby has got a new friend. 'My husband Ken, 65, and I were both in the RAF for 22 years and it wasn't fair to have a dog who would need to be quarantined every time we moved abroad so now it's lovely to have a pet at home. New owner Irene, 70, said: 'We knew as soon as we saw her that we wanted to bring her home with us.' 'Sophie is quiet but a real charmer and her and Toby seem to be getting on well. 'She has already find a little place she likes to sit under the stairs and is getting used to cosying up in front of the fire place. 'We feel very lucky to have welcomed her into our family - she's a little Christmas miracle.' Kennel supervisor Claudia Churchill said: 'We were all sad to say goodbye to Sophie after so many years - I was in tears - but it's the best thing for her. 'The morning she was in the paper the phone never stopped ringing - people were desperate to come and meet her. 'But her new owners are a perfect fit and all being well, she'll have a loving family for the rest of her life. 'I can't believe she's got a home in time for Christmas - it's the best present.' Although Sophie has gone to a good home, the team are still looking for homes for more than 70 dogs. And this comes as another dog charity appeals for owners, as their kennels are filled to capacity. The Border Collie Trust is facing a 'bottleneck' in its waiting list this festive period, with all of its kennels full to the brim. The unique charity is at capacity in terms of housing abandoned collies and has to operate a 'one out, one in' system. The Border Collie Trust is facing a 'bottleneck' in its waiting list this festive period, with all of its kennels full to the brim . Ben Wilkes, a trustee of the Staffordshire-based charity pictured here with eight-year-old Dan, said: 'It's a bit like a conveyor belt - as one goes out there are five waiting to come in . Earlier this year a survey rating the attributes of each dog breed according to cost, intelligence, health, lifespan and ease of grooming placed the bordie collie in the number one spot. Ben Wilkes, a trustee of the Staffordshire-based charity, said: 'It's a bit like a conveyor belt - as one goes out there are five waiting to come in.We have 35 dogs at the moment and we usually have a waiting list, but it is very difficult to judge an average waiting list time because the situation changes every day. Earlier this year a survey rating the attributes of each dog breed according to cost, intelligence, health, lifespan and ease of grooming placed the bordie collie in the number one spot . 'We take as much care of them as we can' said Ben 'but such a loving and intelligent animal would be much better off in a home enviroment' Border collies were developed in the Scottish border region for herding livestock and are known for their unlimited energy and stamina. The centre, founded in the Seventies by Hazel Monk, has 11 staff who look after the dogs, taking them for walks and making sure they don't become distressed being in kennels. Ben added: 'There are 47 kennels but we don't like to have them all full because it would prevent us taking in emergency cases and it's too much for the dogs to cope with. The problem is something we see all year round. The phrase 'a dog is for life not just for Christmas' is a very apt one and I think it's maybe still true but in my 17 years' experience of rescuing it happens all year round. The Trust, based in Rugely in Staffs, takes collies of all ages who's owner circumstances mean they can no longer care for their pets, they also have puppies from farm litters where the farmer has no use for them . 'People take on dogs and then decide, for whatever reason, they can't keep the dog. The difficulty at this time of year is historically rehoming goes quieter. People are thinking more about Christmas than adopting a dog so we tend to get this bit of a bottleneck. 'When people see these surveys saying they're the most intelligent or the best breed they want them as a pet, but dogs are more than a pet, they are a companion and you can't just tell them to sit in the corner for eight hours because you're busy. 'But Collies are a fantastic breed. We need to try to break that stigma about rescue dogs, they don't all have problems. You just need to know what you're taking on.'","Corgi-Collie cross Sophie had been at Hilbrae kennels in Shropshire since she was two-years-old .

"Retired High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge said cohabiting couples should never be allowed legal rights over each other’s money and property . Cohabiting couples should never be allowed legal rights over each other’s money and property, one of Britain’s most senior family law experts said yesterday. Giving them the same rights as married couples would be naive and send out the wrong message, said retired High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge. His intervention comes amid fresh attempts – backed by many judges and lawyers – to push a law through Parliament setting out legal entitlements for those in live-in relationships. He said any law designed to give special rights to just one section of the population would be a mistake. And he criticised politicians – including Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg – who support a new law for ‘giving the impression that marriage doesn’t matter’. Sir Paul, who heads the Marriage Foundation think-tank, is the first senior judge to come out strongly against any cohabitation law. He had once supported such a move, he said, as it would protect women left penniless after the breakdown of a long live-in relationship. But yesterday he told the Daily Mail: ‘I have had a Damascene conversion. I used to be quite in favour of some form of legal protection. ‘But I have drawn away from a cohabitation law. It is a naive, lawyer-driven idea, and some leadership is needed.’ Sir Paul, who retired in April but still presides in the occasional family case, said that giving legal rights to cohabitees would be a signal of official approval of such relationships. ‘You have to look at the bigger picture,’ he said. ‘There are nearly two million children of these relationships and they are at a disadvantage because of that. I think that is fully established now. The Government should be unequivocal in its support for marriage. Half of all family litigation is a matter of family breakdown among the unmarried. ‘That means 20 per cent of the population but 50 per cent of family court workload. Can you imagine the effect on the courts if there is legislation to give rights to cohabitees?’ Sir Paul said the debate on changing the law had overshadowed arguments about the need to strengthen marriage and called for more attention to be paid to ‘the terrible problem of family breakdown and the divisions it is creating in society’. Sir Paul’s intervention comes as much of the legal profession and many politicians have been trying to build support for a cohabitation law.The most senior family law judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby, said in October that the lack of legal protection for cohabitees ‘is an injustice which has been recognised as long as I have been in the law’ ‘People think marriage is for the likes of them, it’s not for us. This is not helped by people like Nick Clegg and others who give the impression that marriage doesn’t matter and all relationships are the same.’ Sir Paul’s intervention comes as much of the legal profession and many politicians have been trying to build support for a cohabitation law. The most senior family law judge, President of the Family Division Sir James Munby, said in October that the lack of legal protection for cohabitees ‘is an injustice which has been recognised as long as I have been in the law’. He said: ‘Reform is desperately needed. Reform is inevitable. How many more women are to be condemned to injustice in the meantime?’ Liberal Democrat peer Lord Marks has tabled a Bill in the Lords that would give cohabiting partners rights after they had lived together for two years or after they have had children. That would see a cohabitee entitled to a share of the money, property and pension of their former partner in the event of a break-up. Lawyers have been calling for such a law for of years. However, critics point out that it would provide a new source of lucrative earnings for the legal profession. David Cameron rejected the idea of a cohabitation law shortly after the Coalition took power in 2010. There are nearly three million cohabiting couples in the country, with numbers rising. However, such relationships typically last only a third as long as the average marriage. And evidence also shows that children of cohabitees are less wealthy, less healthy and less likely to do well at school. Critics blame the rise of cohabitation for the increasing number of children in one-parent families.","Retired judge Sir Paul Coleridge is against any cohabitation law .
While once supporting it, he now thinks it is a  'lawyer driven idea'
Putting laws around such relationships gives them 'official approval'"
"Millions of children around the world are looking forward to getting a visit from Santa tomorrow night. But a recently unearthed historical document suggests that they may be disappointed - because Father Christmas actually died 450 years ago. The archive lists 'Father Christmas' as the name of a man buried in an Essex churchyard in May 1564. Record: This historical archive shows that 'Father Christmas' was buried in Dedham, Essex in 1564 . Discovery: The record was contained in a book showing all of the people buried in Dedham . The amusing note was discovered at the Essex Records Office in Chelmsford as researchers were looking up reports of people who had died in the early modern period. It is an extract from the burial record from the village of Dedham, dating to May 30, 1564. The entry reads in full: 'The 30th Day, Father Christmas was buried.' The exact identity of the dead man is not known, but he is likely to have been someone with the surname Christmas who was known as 'father' as a sign of respect for his advanced age. 'Christmas was not an uncommon surname in this area around that time,' a spokesman for the records office said. Resting place: The man, apparently an elderly person with the surname 'Christmas', was buried in Dedham . Found: The remarkable archive entry is contained in this book originating from the small town . 'It appears with some frequency in north Essex and south Suffolk and by 1881 the name was still largely concentrated in the south-east of England. 'The title ""father"" is most likely the usage given in The Oxford English Dictionary as ""a respectful title given to an old and venerable man"". 'To live to an old age was quite an achievement for Father Christmas in 1564 - only about one half to one third of people lived to see their 16th birthday, but if you survived that long you might live to see 50 or 60.' The surname Christmas, then spelt 'Cristemesse', was first recorded in Essex in 1185 as Roger Cristemesse appeared in court documents. Alive and well: Father Christmas, as depicted here by Richard Attenborough in Miracle on 34th Street, continues to deliver presents to children around the world . There was a firm of bailiffs called Christmas in Colchester around the year 1500, while other people bearing that name in the 16th and 17th centuries included a carpenter, a farmer and a brewer. These days Father Christmas is known as a figure who lives at the North Pole and brings presents to children after entering their houses through the chimney. However, he was originally the 'bringer of spring' at the English midwinter festival, and was dressed in green. The image of Santa as a jolly man dressed in red is linked to the Dutch Saint Nicholas - or 'Sinterklaas' - and was spread around the world with the help of Coca-Cola's branding.","Essex Records Office reveals archive record dating back to May 1564 .

Beard Baubles, an idea by creative agency Grey London, is part of a drive to raise the profile of Beard Season – an initiative which encourages men to grow a beard for December to raise awareness of skin cancer. While men around the world have been sporting the tiny festive ornaments in their facial hair - including one who wore his to the World Darts Championship in Alexandra Palace, north London, last night - dogs are also getting in on the action. From the UK to America, pets have been dolled up with Christmas baubles before posing for a photograph. Much like Movember, when men are encouraged to grow a moustache while raising money for prostate cancer, testicular cancer and mental health issues, Beard Season aims to raise awareness of melanoma. Although the multi-coloured festive baubles are intended to be used on facial hair, people around the world have been snapping up the Yuletide accessory – which costs £5 for a pack of 14 – and attaching them to their beloved dogs. Ollie Dearn, who works at Grey London, said: 'The product has been particularly popular with Brits. 'We've sold more than we ever expected. 'But Aussie, American, Kiwis, German and French customers have been purchasing Beard Baubles too.

All profits of the sale went to charity to help raise awareness and treat skin cancer. Pauline Ashford, one of the creatives at Grey London, said Beard Baubles had now sold out due to popular demand. She said: 'The interest has been huge, it seems bearded men (and dogs) all over the world have been neglected at Christmas time up until now. 'We physically couldn't make enough Beard Baubles to satisfy the demand and post them all out in time for Christmas. But we'll be ready next year. 'Because there was still massive interest after we sold out of Original Beard Baubles, ​we decided that we would create some Limited Edition packs, to raise even more money for melanoma research, and to stretch the skin cancer awareness campaign longer over the festive period, especially in Australia where it is summer. 'The Limited Edition packs went up for auction on eBay and one of the winning bidders was the owner of a Labradoodle in NYC. 'He put the Beard Baubles on his dog, called Stella, who was more than happy to pose for a photograph. 'We also got three artists involved to make their own hand-drawn versions and put them up for auction.'

"Meet the mouth of the NYPD's police union. As tense protests gripped New York streets before a gunman fatally shot two officers in cold blood, Patrick Lynch, the 51-year-old head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the NYPD's largest union, has been swift to assign blame. 'There's blood on many hands,' Lynch boomed the night that Officers Wen Jian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed by a man who referenced Eric Garner and Michael Brown in an Instagram post before the killing. Mouth: Patrick Lynch, the 51-year-old head of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association pictured at a speech in 2011, said there was 'blood on the hands' of the mayor after the killing of two police officers . 'That blood on the hands starts at City Hall in the office of the mayor,' Lynch said just after Bill de Blasio held a press conference where some NYPD officers literally turned their backs on him. It wasn't the first time  Lynch has refused to let a good crisis go to waste for his union. After the mayor gave a speech about telling his teenage son, who is black, of 'dangers he may face' from police following the grand jury decision not to indict the officer accused of killing Eric Garner with a chokehold, Lynch said de Blasio was 'throwing them under the bus.' 'That they were out there doing a difficult job in the middle of the night, protecting the rights of those to protest, protecting our sons and daughter,' he said, according to CBS. Lynch hasn't been shy about flogging mayors in public over pay or disciplinary disputes. The Associated Press reports Lynch said past mayors have critiqued police or been tightfisted with officer pay, but never both like de Blasio. PBA members held a 1 a.m. protest at the home of then-mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2004 seeking to sweeten pay, and Lynch later accused the mayor of 'stealing' pensions when he tried to curtail them in 2011. Union: Lynch joined the NYPD in 1984 and became the youngest officer to be president when he was first elected in 1999 . Memorial: Lynch laid flowers at a memorial for the two fallen officers, whose death he blamed on the mayor and on protesters . Lynch has also deflected  criticism and disciplinary control of the NYPD, even when it came from NYPD officials. The New York Post reports that Lynch called NYPD Internal Affairs a 'white socks' department while it pursued an investigation into a ticket fixing scandal. 'They’re unprofessional, they never prove a case,' Lynch railed. 'They don’t go after real corruption, they go out where the police officers are, wearing white socks, and then they fabricate from there. They’re not real professionals.' Before that, Businessweek reports, Lynch had defended the practice of officers making parking and traffic tickets disappear for friends as a 'courtesy' and said it was a 'long standing practice at all levels of the department.' The president even called for the resignation of former police commissioner Ray Kelly in 2004, after he said there appeared 'to be no justification' for the shooting of unarmed Timothy Stansbury, and suggested the real victim was the officer that shot the teenager. Lynch, who started working for the city in the Metropolitan Transit Authority, where his father worked as a motorman before joining the NYPD in 1984. He became an early fixture in the PBA, becoming a delegate before being elected president in 1999, the youngest officer to do so in the union's history. Still, there have always been factions of the PBA that think leadership doesn't go far enough. In 1997, during protests over a pay dispute with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a small group of police marched through Brooklyn shouting, 'Rudy's a liar, set him on fire!' Lynch faced a mutiny of Bronx members over the ticket fixing affair in 2011, with around 50 delegates calling for his resignation because he did not lend enough support to those accused, before walking out. As Commissioner Bratton says Lynch must stop the 'cheap shots,' the five-term PBA president Lynch states that he speaks for the rank-and-file patrolman on his force. 'These ideas and issues aren't created at PBA headquarters. They come from the ground up,' Lynch says, calling the anger 'palatable.'","Patrick Lynch, 51, said there was 'blood on the hands' of the mayor after a gunman shot two officers .

"A 10-year-old boy was mutilated and sacrificed in a witchcraft ceremony, police have reportedly said. An Indian worker is alleged to have told officers that he murder the boy, identified as Pranshu, a third year standard student, in a bid to help his wife become pregnant, the Times of India said. The body of the child was found by his father in a sugarcane field in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh with mutilated ears and heels two days after he went missing. The boy was mutilated and sacrificed in the witchcraft ceremony that took place approximately in Pilibhit in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh . When the grim discovery  was made in the village of Rooppur Kamalu, in Pilibhit, on November 23, it was initially thought he had been attacked by animals. Officers only launched an investigation after the post mortem examination revealed the boy had been murdered. Pranshu had been reported missing by his family on November 21. A local man, named only as Durgesh, who was said to have been a neighbour of the victim, was later arrested, the Times of India reported. The wife of the arrested man is due to be quizzed by officers, it has been said.

"A mother-of-three ended up with a $145 fine after being spotted by a police officer carrying out her threat to call Santa in a bid to force her children to behave . A mother ended up with a bit more than she bargained for when she carried out her threat to call Santa. With three brawling children in the back of her car the frazzled mother picked up her mobile phone and dialed Saint Nick. But the pretend call asking for her daughters, aged two, four and six, to be put on the naughty list landed the woman with a $145 fine. She was spotted explaining to Father Christmas that her girls' had been disrespectful by a police patrolman, who pulled her over for using her mobile. 'I'm guessing I'm the first person to ever get a ticket for talking to Santa Claus,' she told The Trentonian. The fed up mother, known only as Rachel, said that her two youngest were fighting and refusing to listen to her when she decided to carry out her threat. She was in mid-flow to Santa when she passed a police car hiding behind and church and threw her phone to the ground. Three miles later the mother, who had recently moved to Monroe, Louisiana, US, was pulled over by the officer. 'I told the officer my girls weren't behaving and that I had to call Santa Claus,' the woman told The Trentonian. 'I was trying to make him understand without giving it up. And he's just looking at me like I'm crazy.' It was only when the officer checked the call log that he realised the woman had not been using her phone to make a call. But she was not out of the woods. A second officer arrived at the scene in Helmetta, New Jersey, and discovered that she had missed a car inspection. The new officer initially wanted seize her car before being talked round by his colleague. The woman was allowed to leave with her car and a $145 ticket.

"A chilling new image has emerged showing a child wearing the uniform of an Islamic militia being used to fire rockets from a car-mounted missile launcher during fierce clashes with ISIS jihadis. Illustrating the way children are being increasingly sucked into the deadly violence engulfing vast swathes of Syria and Iraq, the child soldier - who appears no older than eight - wears full military uniform as he kneels down to detonate the explosive. Until now the majority of children engaged in the conflict have been forced to do so by ISIS militants in the Sunni militants' strongholds of Raqqa in Syria and Mosul in Iraq. However the young child in this latest image wears the uniform of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq - a Shia militia allied to the Syrian and Iraqi regimes and a sworn enemy of the Islamic State. Scroll down for video . Child soldier: This chilling new image shows a child wearing the uniform of a Shia militia being used to fire rockets from a car-mounted missile launcher during fierce clashes with ISIS jihadis . Different group: The young boy wears the uniform of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq (pictured) - a Shia militia allied to the Syrian and Iraqi regimes and a sworn enemy of the Islamic State . Children have been increasingly drawn in to the bloody conflict in the Middle East, with ISIS establishing a number of Sharia camps where young boys under the age of 16 are sent for a mixture of combat training and lessons in the terror group's hardline interpretation of Islam. Earlier this month chilling new images emerged from inside Islamic State-run terrorist training schools in Syria, showing child soldiers being trained to kill using assault rifles. Once the boys turn 16 they are thrown into the frontline alongside adult militants to wield massive assault rifles and rocket launchers in chaotic street battles against troops from the Syrian and Iraqi regimes, Kurdish forces, and rival rebel groups such as the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat Al-Nusra. There have, however, been numerous reports of ISIS forcing children into battle at a much younger age, with militants said to value the so-called martyrdom of children above that of adults. Until now, ISIS were largely believed to be only group using child soldiers in the conflict, but the emergence of the photograph showing a boy wearing the uniform of Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq has cast new light on the involvement of those under 16 waging jihad in Syria and Iraq.

Fighters: Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, the group the young boy in the latest photograph appears to be fighting for, is a Shia milita that considers the Islamic State among its deadliest enemies . Speaking to MailOnline about child soldiers, Steven Stalinsky, executive Director of the Middle East Media Research Institute, said: 'The indoctrination of children is an ongoing part of life [for ISIS]. There are camps for children, children are learning about jihad in schools and are actively fighting. 'They are fighting with their families, their fathers, uncles and brothers, and as orphans on their own. When they die they become martyrs and fighters tweet pictures of their bodies and they are praised online,' he added. Earlier this month new images emerged showing an ISIS training school where children little older than 10-years-old are dubbed 'Caliphate Cubs' and dressed in full combat gear as they struggle to hold weapons while standing in front of ISIS' infamous black flag. The photographs were released by official Islamic State media and apparently show a recently-opened school close to Damascus - the Assad regime-held capital of Syria where other preteen training camps are known have been operating in recent months.

There have, however, been numerous reports of ISIS forcing children into battle at a much younger age, with militants said to value the so-called martyrdom of children above that of adults . In one photograph a large group of masked and armed child soldiers crowd around a minibus decorated with the ISIS flag, holding their guns aloft and striking poses bearing a striking resemblance to the terror group's executioner in chief - the British militant known as Jihadi John. Another image shows a fair-skinned boy being handed a massive AK47 assault rifle by a grey-bearded ISIS general as he stands in formation alongside other young child soldiers. Other shots from the propaganda release show the children performing fitness tests and military drills designed to train them for the harsh realities of the frontline. In much the same way as the Nazi Germany preyed on its impressionable young citizens with the creation of the Hitler Youth, ISIS has long groomed children to take part in jihad. The practice was the subject of the second episode of VICE's groundbreaking 'Islamic State' documentary series, in which very young boys were seen being asked whether they want to be a suicide bomber or a jihadist, and were forced to repeat calls for the murder of Western 'infidels'.

The school images emerged just weeks after ISIS released a video entitled 'The Blood of Jihad 2' - the second installment of a video series revealing life inside the group's training camps. The video is believed to have been filmed in the ISIS-held province of Nineveh in, Iraq. The highly choreographed video opens with dramatic slow motion shots of of young boys firing AK47s as they advance in a line. All the boys are seen wearing matching military camouflage fatigues and chequered headscarves. The first part of the film, which appears to be shot in soft focus and is set to music, then shows the boys undertaking training in martial arts. One of the boys can be seen holding the black flag of Islamic State whilst another of the boys, wearing a headband with a slogan in Arabic, leads the martial arts drill.

The group is said to be controlled from within Iran, but the majority of its brigades operate in  Iraq. It even has a significant presence in the largely regime controlled areas of southern Syria, making it one of the most widely widely distributed militant groups engaged in the current conflict. The group emerged in the mid-2000s following a split with the Mahdi Army, which at the time dominated the Shia insurgency in Iraq. It has claimed responsibility for over 6,000 attacks on American, coalition, and Iraqi forces since that time. Despite its militant foundations, Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq had candidates running in the 2014 Iraqi parliamentary election under the banner of Al-Sadiqoun Bloc. Its campaign was marred by violence, however, with a series of bombs exploding at an early campaign rally in eastern Baghdad, killing at least 37 people. Al-Sadiquun Bloc ended up winning just one seat  in the Iraqi Parliament.","Child soldier wearing Shia militia uniform pictured firing missiles .

"Children around the world have been recreating the nativity in countless school plays during the build up to Christmas. But they may have to get rid of the cardboard donkeys and straw-covered floor next year if a theologian's claims are true. Minister and academic Reverend Ian Paul insists Jesus Christ was not born in a stable, but in a busy room in a  family home. Scroll down for video . The image of Jesus being born in a stable has adorned thousands of  stained-glass windows, paintings and Christmas cards, but a Christian scholar has suggested the idea may be a myth born of poor translation . He says the misconception comes from poor translation of the original Greek text, which made it sound as if the birth took place amid farm animals in a barn or stable. The Greek word 'kataluma', he says, was wrongly translated as 'inn'. In fact, he claims, the word means 'private room' or 'lodging'. He says the misunderstanding wrongly suggested Mary and Joseph were turned away from a hostel-like building, instead of, as he claims, being put up in communal area in the family home because there was no room just for them. In Rev Paul's interpretation of the Bible story, Joseph, returning to Bethlehem, would have been received by distant relatives. Because his relations' guest room was already full, the family would have stayed in the main family room, where Jesus was born, Rev Paul says. The traditional view of Jesus's birth surrounded by donkeys and cows has been recreated countless times . But Rev Ian Paul says the idea came from a mistranslation which made it sound like Mary and Joseph were turned away from an inn, so had to settle for a stable . The Reverend wrote on his blog: 'What does it mean for the kataluma to have ""no space""? 'It means that many, like Joseph and Mary, have travelled to Bethlehem, and the family guest room is already full, probably with other relatives who arrived earlier. 'So Joseph and Mary must stay with the family itself, in the main room of the house, and there Mary gives birth.' Research by YouGov released today found that 65 per cent of the British public believe Jesus lived. But a majority of people, 55 per cent, think that Jesus was not born to a virgin mother, compared to 24 per cent who think he was. The most widely believed detail of the Christmas story is that the new born baby Jesus was laid in a manger, which 47 per cent of people believe to be true compared to just 29 per cent who do not. The survey revealed just 37 per cent believe that the three wise men were guided by a star and brought gifts and 28 per cent believe an angel of the Lord appeared to the shepherds. He says the layout of homes at the time meant that animals were fed in manger-type arrangements at the edge of the family room. He added: 'The most natural place to lay the baby is in the straw-filled depressions at the lower end of the house where the animals are fed. 'The idea that they were in a stable, away from others, alone and outcast, is grammatically and culturally implausible. In fact, it is hard to be alone at all in such contexts.' Rev Paul, an Honorary Assistant Professor at the University of Nottingham, says the mistranslation is important, not just for children's plays, but because it can change the way the story is interpreted. He added: 'In the Christmas story, Jesus is not sad and lonely, some distance away in the stable, needing our sympathy. 'He is in the midst of the family, and all the visiting relations, right in the thick of it and demanding our attention. This should fundamentally change our approach to enacting and preaching on the nativity.' Father-of-four Rev Paul initially trained in maths at Oxford University and worked in business for Mars chocolate before training for ordination. Modern-day Bethlehem. Rev Paul says it is inconceivable that Palestinians in the time of Jesus would have allowed the family to stay in an out-building . Luke 2: 4-8 (New International Version) 4 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem the town of David, because he belonged to the house and line of David. 5 He went there to register with Mary, who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child. 6 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born, . 7 and she gave birth to her firstborn, a son. She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them.","Christ traditionally seen as having been born in a stable next to animals .

"South Korean prosecutors applied on Wednesday for an arrest warrant for Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-Ah, who delayed a flight with a tantrum over snacks in a 'nut rage' incident that caused a national uproar. The prosecutors' office said the 40-year-old daughter of the airline's boss faced charges including violation of the aviation safety law, coercion and interference in the execution of duty. 'Our office has sent a request for the court to issue an arrest warrant,' the office said. Cho Hyun-Ah (centre), the daughter of Korean Air's chief executive, is surrounded by media upon her arrival for questioning at the prosecutors' office in Seoul, on December 17 . Cho was accused of forcing the chief purser off a December 5 New York-Seoul flight and of compelling the taxiing plane to return to the gate so he could disembark. She took exception to being served macadamia nuts she had not asked for - and in a bag, not a bowl. A government investigation found that she had screamed and hurled abuse at a flight attendant and the chief purser, Park Chang-Jin. An arrest warrant is also being sought for an unidentified company executive on charges of destroying evidence from the incident. A court will hold a hearing early next week to review the warrant application. Cho has insisted that she did not physically assault the chief purser, but prosecutors said she had pushed the flight attendant, based on the testimony of passengers and other flight attendants. Park has claimed that Cho pushed him into the cockpit door and jabbed him with a service manual. Cho - one of three children of Korean Air (KAL) boss Cho Yang-Ho, the patriarch of business conglomerate Hanjin Group - has publicly apologised and resigned from all her posts in the organisation. Prosecutors are also investigating whether KAL officials coerced cabin crew to give false testimony to government inspectors to protect Cho. On Wednesday a transport ministry official was arrested for leaking some details of the ministry's investigation to KAL officials. The ministry has vowed to sanction the airline with a flight ban, most likely on the New York-Seoul route, that could last for up to a month, or with fines of up to $2 million. South Korean prosecutors applied on Wednesday for an arrest warrant for  Cho, who delayed a flight with a tantrum over snacks in a 'nut rage' incident that caused a national uproar .","Korean Air heiress Cho Hyun-Ah delayed flight with a tantrum over snacks .

"Furious Twitter users have rallied against a prankster who pretended he was best friends with latest police shooting victim Antonio Martin and watched him die at a gas station near Ferguson last night. Jesus Christo claimed he was there when the 18-year-old was killed and fabricated an account of how a police officer opened fire on Martin when he refused to lie on the ground. Under the Twitter handle, @DesJuanTheThug, Christo wrote 'I can't believe my best friend just died in front of me' - and the comment was retweeted more than 3,000 times. He then posted a series of tweets telling people to listen to his mixtape and add him on SoundCloud - an audio platform that allows people to promote their own music. Scroll down for video . Fake: Jesus Christo claimed he was best friends with latest police shooting victim Antonio Martin and watched him get killed last night . He had earlier told The Huffington Post how he and Martin were stopped by an officer at a Mobil gas station on North Hanley Road because they matched the description of robbery suspects. He claimed the officer then searched Martin and was quoted as saying: 'The officer then stepped back and pulled his weapon and pointed at Antonio and told us to lay on the ground. 'I laid down but Antonio refused. The officer then stepped back at us with his gun still aimed at us. He told Antonio to lay down again and when Antonio didn't lay down the officer opened fire. 'And when I tried to help my friend he screamed at me to stay down with his weapon still drawn.' Latest shooting: Antonio Martin, 18, was shot at a Mobil gas station in Missouri last night - prompting violent clashes between crowds and police . Lie: His vile lie was retweeted more than 2,000 times and he even fabricated an account of last night's shooting in an interview with the Huffington Post . The Huffington Post has since released a statement confirming the account was false which read: 'A previous version of this story included an interview with a man claiming to have been at the scene of the shooting and friends with the deceased. 'As police have released statements saying the second person involved in the incident has fled the scene, the source is now suggesting he was never there.' Christo's fake account of what happened has provoked fury on social media. Scene of the shooting: Angry crowds gathered at a Mobil gas station on North Hanley Road Berkeley, near Ferguson, Missouri last night and clashed violently with police . Plug: After being followed and retweeted by thousands of others on Twitter - Christo then told people to add him on soundcloud - an audio platform that allows people to promote their own music . One user, Cee, said: 'What type of a**hole lies about witnessing a murder. there's truly a special place in hell for you.' Another, Just Letrice, wrote: 'I'm angry! He could've put that officer's life in MAJOR danger based on lies!' Another wrote: '@DesJuanTheThug claimed he was at the shooting, and did a testimony to Huf Pos.... Ends up he's a liar and did it for RT's...? Wow.' Furious reaction: Twitter users expressed their anger after learning Christo had invented his harrowing account of watching his 'best friend' die . Christo is clearly unapologetic and has since posted: 'Tell the Huffington Post to do a better job of finding credible sources.' In another vile tweet, he boasted 'I pi**ed the whole country off' and 'I need two bad bi***es to help me grieve'. Following Martin's shooting, a large group of protesters gathered at the scene where police are believed to have used pepper spray on the crowd.

"Bright stars top Christmas trees in Christian homes around much of the world. The faithful sing about the Star of Wonder that guided the wise men to a manger in the little town of Bethlehem, where Jesus was born. They're commemorating the Star of Bethlehem described by the Evangelist Matthew in the New Testament. But is the star's biblical description a pious fiction or does it contain some astronomical truth? Bright stars top Christmas trees in Christian homes around much of the world (right). But is the star's biblical description a pious fiction or does it contain some astronomical truth? According to one expert, it is . The three wise men, motivated by this 'star in the east,' first travelled to Jerusalem and told King Herod the prophecy that a new ruler of the people of Israel would be born. King Herod, asked the wise men when the star had appeared, because he and his court, apparently, were unaware of any such star in the sky. These events present us with our first astronomy puzzle of the first Christmas: How could King Herod's own advisors have been unaware of a star so bright and obvious that it could have led the wise men to Jerusalem? Next, in order to reach Bethlehem, the wise men had to travel directly south from Jerusalem; somehow that 'star in the east' 'went before them, 'til it came and stood over where the young child was.' The three wise men, motivated by this 'star in the east,' first travelled to Jerusalem and told King Herod the prophecy that a new ruler of the people of Israel would be born. King Herod, asked the wise men when the star had appeared, because he and his court, apparently, were unaware of any such star in the sky . Now we have our second first-Christmas astronomy puzzle: How can a star 'in the east' guide our wise men to the south? The north star guides lost hikers to the north, so shouldn't a star in the east have led the wise men to the east? Astronomer Michael Molnar points out that 'in the east' is a literal translation of the Greek phrase en te anatole, which was a technical term used in Greek mathematical astrology 2,000 years ago. It described, very specifically, a planet that would rise above the eastern horizon just before the sun would appear. Then, just moments after the planet rises, it disappears in the bright glare of the sun in the morning sky. Except for a brief moment, no one can see this 'star in the east.' According to the timings, the star may in fact have been  Jupiter, which appeared and disappeared in the sky around the time of Jesus' birth. And we have yet a third first-Christmas astronomy puzzle: How does Matthew's star move 'before them,' like the tail lights on the snowplow you might follow during a blizzard, and then stop and stand over the manger in Bethlehem, inside of which supposedly lies the infant Jesus? What could the 'star in the east' be? The astronomer in me knows that no star can do these things, nor can a comet, or Jupiter, or a supernova, or a conjunction of planets or any other actual bright object in the nighttime sky. One can claim that Matthew's words describe a miracle, something beyond the laws of physics. But Matthew chose his words carefully and wrote 'star in the east' twice, which suggests that these words hold a specific importance for his readers. Can we find any other explanation, consistent with Matthew's words, that doesn't require that the laws of physics be violated and that has something to do with astronomy? The answer, amazingly, is yes. Astronomer Michael Molnar points out that 'in the east' is a literal translation of the Greek phrase en te anatole, which was a technical term used in Greek mathematical astrology 2,000 years ago. How could King Herod's own advisors have been unaware of a star so bright  that it could have led the wise men to Jerusalem? According to Professor David Weintraub, this may be because it disappeared briefly . It described, very specifically, a planet that would rise above the eastern horizon just before the sun would appear. Then, just moments after the planet rises, it disappears in the bright glare of the sun in the morning sky. Except for a brief moment, no one can see this 'star in the east.' According to Professor David Weintraub, if Matthew's wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king, the bright star didn't guide them; it only told them when to set out. And they wouldn't have found an infant swaddled in a manger. After all, the baby was already eight months old by the time they decoded the astrological message they believed predicted the birth of a future king. The portent began on April 17 of 6 B.C. with the heliacal rising of Jupiter that morning, followed, at noon, by its lunar occultation in the constellation Aries. It lasted until December 19 of 6 B.C. when Jupiter stopped moving to the west, stood still briefly, and began moving to the east, as compared with the fixed background stars. By the earliest time the men could have arrived in Bethlehem, the baby Jesus would likely have been at least a toddler. He claims Matthew may have written to convince his readers that Jesus was the prophesied Messiah. Given the astrological clues embedded in his gospel, he must have believed the story of the Star of Bethlehem would be convincing evidence for many in his audience. For background, virtually all the stars remain fixed in their places; the stars rise and set every night, but they do not move relative to each other. The stars in the Big Dipper appear year after year always in the same place. But the planets, the sun, and the moon wander through the fixed stars. Though the planets, sun and moon move along approximately the same path through the background stars, they travel at different speeds, so they often lap each other. When the sun catches up with a planet, we can't see the planet, but when the sun passes far enough beyond it, the planet reappears. And now we need a little bit of astrology background. When the planet reappears again for the first time, and rises in the morning sky just moments before the sun, for the first time in many months. That moment is known to astrologers as a heliacal rising. A heliacal rising, that special first reappearance of a planet, is what en te anatole referred to in ancient Greek astrology. In particular, the reappearance of a planet like Jupiter was thought by Greek astrologers to be symbolically significant for anyone born on that day. Thus, the 'star in the east' refers to an astronomical event with supposed astrological significance in the context of ancient Greek astrology. What about the star parked directly above the first crèche?  It refers to a particular moment when a planet stops moving and changes apparent direction from westward to eastward motion. This occurs when the Earth, which orbits the sun more quickly than Mars or Jupiter or Saturn, catches up with, or laps, the other planet. According to the timings, the star may in fact have been Jupiter, which appeared and disappeared in the sky around the time of Jesus' birth . Together, a rare combination of astrological events  would have suggested to ancient Greek astrologers a regal horoscope and a royal birth. Matthew's wise men actually undertook a journey to search for a newborn king, the bright star didn't guide them; it only told them when to set out. And they wouldn't have found an infant swaddled in a manger. After all, the baby was already eight months old by the time they decoded the astrological message they believed predicted the birth of a future king.

By the earliest time the men could have arrived in Bethlehem, the baby Jesus would likely have been at least a toddler. This article by Professor David Weintraub of Vanderbilt University in Nashville originally appeared in The Conversation.","According to the New Testament, King Herod, asked the wise men when the star had appeared, because he was unaware of any such star .

"SodaStream’s chief executive has hit back at Oxfam’s criticism that the Israeli company profits from illegal trade that harms Palestinians, saying the charity is being hypocritical in calling for it to close its factory in the occupied West Bank. Last week Hollywood actress Scarlett Johansson ended an eight-year role as an Oxfam goodwill ambassador after campaigners for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel criticised her sponsorship deal with the fizzy-drink machine manufacturer. Now the company’s chief executive Daniel Birnbaum has claimed SodaStream is being ‘demonised’ by activists who overlook the fact the factory is the largest private company employing Palestinian workers in the West Bank, all of whom he says receive the same pay as their Israeli colleagues.

He added that there were no financial incentives to base the company on the controversial Mishor Adumim and insisted Sodastream has no political agenda. He went on to say: 'We purchase special health insurance for our 500 Palestinian employees so that we can be sure they have coverage for things like emergency surgery and organ transplants'. In his defence of SodaStream, Birnbaum also claimed Oxfam gave money to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, which he says is being used 'to demonise and attack Israel.'

A Palestinian man uses a sling to hurl a stone during clashes with Israeli troops at a protest in the West Bank . Oxfam denied Birnbaum's allegations, saying its partnerships with BDS-linked groups did not mean it was actively funding their activities. Yesterday it was revealed that Johansson’s decision to honour her controversial contract with SodaStream at the expense of her role as ambassador for Oxfam may lie in her family’s struggle with money. The star of The Girl With The Pearl Earring and The Island admitted she hankers after wealth and squanders money. And while she commands huge fees for her film appearances, including a reputed £13 million for Avengers 2, she has also amassed a stable of sponsors, with top-brand firms paying her £3 million a year for acting as an ambassador for their goods. ‘It’s nice to have money. I didn’t grow up with it so it’s nice to have it,’ she told The Mail. ‘I’m not at all frugal and I don’t save – to my business manager’s dismay. I like to be generous. I can’t stand people who are tight with their money, it drives me crazy. ‘It’s different if you’re scrimping and saving because you need to, to save up for something.

"Scientists have carried out a post-mortem examination on a dead star that exploded in a nearby dwarf galaxy in an effort to better understand supernovas. They believe they have spotted a pulsar wind nebula appearing from the ashes of the dead stars, and also claim to have solved a mystery surrounding the unusual shape of its remains. The supernova, known as SN1987A, was first seen by observers in the southern hemisphere in 1987 at the edge of the Large Magellanic Cloud, 168,000 light-years from Earth. Scroll down for video . Scientists have carried out a post-mortem on a dead star that exploded in a nearby dwarf galaxy. Pictured is an outline of the and inner debris of the supernova's remains, as seen with the Hubble Space Telescope (green/blue contours), on top of Almaa observations of the remnant at 345 GHz (red/orange) More than 25 years after spotting the explosion, an Australian-led team has used radio telescopes in Australia and Chile to see inside the remains of a supernova. By combining observations from the two telescopes we've been able to distinguish radiation being emitted by the supernova's expanding shock wave,' said lead researcher Dr Giovanna Zanardo from the University of Western Australia. 'This is important because it means we're able to separate out the different types of emission we're seeing and look for signs of a new object which may have formed when the star's core collapsed. 'It's like doing a forensic investigation into the death of a star.' The observations with the Atca and Alma radio telescopes revealed signs of something never seen before, located at the centre of the dead star. 'It could be a pulsar wind nebula, driven by the spinning neutron star, or pulsar, which astronomers have been searching for since 1987,' said Dr Zanardo. 'It's amazing that only now, with large telescopes like Alma and the upgraded Atca, we can peek through the bulk of debris ejected when the star exploded and see what's hiding underneath.' More research published recently also attempts to shine a light on another long-standing mystery surrounding the supernova remnant. Since 1992 the radio emission from one side of the remnant has appeared 'brighter' than the other. In an effort to solve this puzzle, Dr Toby Potter, another researcher from UWA, has developed a detailed 3D simulation of the expanding supernova shockwave. A mosaic of images showing the latest observations of supernova remnant 1987A. The map on the bottom right of the mosaic is obtained by combining five images. This is used to investigate whether there is a pulsar wind nebula inside the remnant . Pictured are images showing different views of the supernova remnant. On the left is SNR1987A as seen by the Hubble Space Telescope in 2010. The middle panel shows SNR1987A as seen by the Australia Telescope Compact Array while the right image is a visualisation of the remnant showing the location of a pulsar . A supernova sends titanic shock waves rumbling through interstellar space. It leaves behind an ultra-dense neutron star in its wake, which spews out a blizzard of high-energy particles. SN 1987A was a supernova in the outskirts of the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby dwarf galaxy. It occurred approximately 51.4 kiloparsecs from Earth, or around 168,000 light-years - close enough that it was visible to the naked eye. The light from the supernova reached Earth on February 23, 1987, with its brightness peaking in May of that year. In the two and a half decades since then the remnant of supernova 1987A has continued to be a focus for researchers the world over, providing a wealth of information about one of the universe’s most extreme events. 'By introducing asymmetry into the explosion and adjusting the gas properties of the surrounding environment, we were able to reproduce a number of observed features from the real supernova such as the persistent one-sidedness in the radio images', Dr Potter said. The time-evolving model shows that the eastern side of the expanding shock front expands more quickly than the other side, and generates more radio emission than its weaker counterpart. This effect becomes even more apparent as the shock collides into the equatorial ring, as observed in Hubble Space Telescope images of the supernova. 'Our simulation predicts that over time the faster shock will move beyond the ring first. When this happens, the lop-sidedness of radio asymmetry is expected to be reduced and may even swap sides,' Dr Potter said. 'The fact that the model matches the observations so well means that we now have a good handle on the physics of the expanding remnant. 'We are beginning to understand the composition of the environment surrounding the supernova - which is a big piece of the puzzle solved in terms of how the remnant of SN1987A formed.'

It has been four days since gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu  as they sat in their patrol car. Brinsley fled after the shooting and turned his weapon on himself in a nearby subway station. On Monday, his mother extended her condolences to the dead officers' families and said she was 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions.

Threatening post: While he was travelling to New York, Brinsley posted this threat to police on Istangram . Dabre said that her son had struggled with mental illness his entire life but had refused attempts by the family to try and help him. Brinsley had a long criminal record, and a deep hatred for the police and the government and a history of mental instability that included an attempt to hang himself a year ago.

Officers at the memorial fell silent to honor them, as city leaders urged people around New York and the country to do the same. Yesterday, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, visited the site and laid flowers in a show of unity with the police force, which, have, in part said the mayor turned against them before the deaths. Guest: Mayor Bill de Blasio - who has faced criticism from some officers - came to the memorial with his wife Chirlane McCray. The pair laid flowers and later led a moment of silence . De Blasio also led city officials in a moment of silence at 2.47pm - the exact time Brinsley opened fire on the officers. Eric Garner's daughter has also expressed her condolences to the families of the two fallen NYPD officers on a visit to their memorial on Monday.

Police said the teen along with two friends spotted two men outside  — one of whom had just bought a pair of the sneakers — and pulled a gun. However, the shopper was also carrying a gun - and had a permit for it - and shot Jabbar, who died a short time later of a gunshot wound to his torso, authorities said. Miami Township police  are now studying mall surveillance video  in their investigation of the fatal shooting. Police Chief Ronald Hess said an initial investigation showed that the teens were outside on a sidewalk when the two men left the mall carrying newly bought shoes. Jabbar displayed a gun and demanded their merchandise, then the man with the concealed weapon permit pulled out his gun and shot him. No one else was injured. According to police, the two groups didn't know each other, but had all had gone to the mall south of Dayton, Ohio, for Nike Air Jordan sales offered by multiple stores. The stores had set up systems to avoid long, tense lines that have led to problems elsewhere when the popular brand has released new versions but the Middletown teens missed out. The other two teens involved in the shooting are being held in juvenile detention while the investigation continues. Scroll down for video . Miami Township Police: Seargeant Jay Phares spoke at a news conference in Dayton, Ohio, on Monday about the fatal shooting at the Dayton Mall on Saturday over Nike Air Jordans .

Police haven't released the identity of the man who fired the shot, and are still investigating his actions. 'We'll review the whole case with the county prosecutor, and if they determine he violated some law, then yes (he could be charged),' Hess said. Jabbar's shocked father, Wallace Jabbar, told The Hamilton-Middletown Journal-News he was 'obviously devastated' over his son's death as he had been out of town working. Jabbar was a student and athlete at Middletown High School, which is on holiday break. He was desperate to buy the Nike shoes named after retired basketball superstar Michael Jordan. The sneakers are so popular that they're often re-sold online for twice the purchase price by both athletes and collectors.

"Michael Sam, the NFL's first openly gay player, has told Oprah in a new interview  that other gay men in the league contacted him to give their gratitude and respect following his monumental coming out earlier this year, revealing: 'There's alot of us out there.' 'I'm not the only one - I'm just the only one that's open,' Sam adds in a clip for the interview, which will air in-full on Saturday after a 90-minute documentary produced by the OWN network about the inspirational athlete. The sit-down with Winfrey is the 24-year-old's first since being cut from the St. Louis Rams and then dropped by the Dallas Cowboys, and she presses him on the other men in the NFL who have chosen not to come out. Scroll down for video . Thankful: Michael Sam says that fellow gay players reached out to him during his tenure with the Dallas Cowboys and St. Louis Rams, following his historic coming out earlier this year . Cut: Sam has been without an NFL team since October 21 after he was cut from the Dallas Cowboys practice squad . Upcoming: In a preview that promotes the new interview, Winfrey is shown asking Sam to confirm that gay men in the NFL have reached out to him, to which Sam replies there are 'a lot' Sam refuses to give a number at how many other players are gay, but says a small number contacted him. 'Very few reached out to me and pretty much just told me their gratitude and how thankful they were that I had the courage (to come out publicly),' Sam said. 'They wished that they had the courage to come out. '(They) just showed their respect and admired my courage … It was very good.' In the full interview, Sam will answer a question from Winfrey as to whether believes being gay stopped him from getting on the NFL roster this year. When asked by TMZ why he thought he was not on the roster of an NFL team, Sam said; 'I think I was the SEC Defensive Player of the Year last year ... so I don't think it had to do with talent.' Earlier this month, Sam received a GQ Man of the Year award. He celebrated the accolade by kissing his partner, Vito Cammisano, on the photo wall at the event. In his cover story with the magazine, the former University of Missouri star also spoke of the other gay men in the league, and the belief that maybe others would have followed him. 'I said I'd take everything that came at me (after coming out), and I did,' he told the publication. 'But did I think it was gonna be that huge? No. 'I thought people would be just, ""Okay, he came out."" 'And that would be that. Some thought others would join me. I did, too.' When the interviewer told Sam that 'it' - other players coming out - 'may' happen, a defiant Sam answered: 'It will' Sealed with a kiss: NFL player Michael Sam kisses his boyfriend Vito Cammisano after being named GQ Man of the Year 2014 in West Hollywood .

Sam was named the 2013 SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Year and quickly became a front-running up-and-comer. In February he announced he was gay through interviews with ESPN and The New York Times. He later said that while he was comfortable with his sexuality, he believed that he was soon about to be 'outed' and wanted to beat anyone else to the punch. Sam was forced to wait until the 249th pick in the seventh round of the 2014 draft before being selected by the Rams, The Huffington Post report. However he failed to make the Ram's roster. He was then picked by the Cowboys' practice squad, but also failed to the make the cut. He was released by Dallas in October.

"A serial dieter has finally gone from fat to fit after beating the bulge to become a competitive bodybuilder. Cindy Garcia-Lister, from Evesham, Worcs, transformed her body to become a super-toned body builder after ditching the fad diets. Cindy, 31, now competes regularly and is hoping to win her first major title next year. Scroll down for video . Cindy once tipped the scales at 13st (left) but has managed to drop down to a very toned 8st after taking up weightlifting. She is hoping to win her first major bodybuilding title next year . She said: 'I can't believe how much my life has changed. 'I went from trying every diet under the sun, to going to spin classes and weight training almost every day. 'I feel so much healthier, and I absolutely love competing - when I look back at old pictures of myself, I find it hard to believe that it's me. 'I've also recently started my own personal training business to help people make a change like I did.' Cindy, who once tipped the scales at almost 13st, now weighs a 8st and has dropped from a size 16 to a size six. The toned brunette was slim as a child growing up in her native Costa Rica, but began to gain weight at university. She said: 'When I went to university, I stopped doing any kind of activity or exercise. 'I'd moved away from my family and I was just very down and lonely. 'I was stressed due to the work load, so when I did eat it wasn't anything healthy - it was chocolate and crisps - all the wrong kinds of food. 'I was very afraid of the scales but I knew I didn't want to be in such bad shape, so I started dieting.' Despite trying numerous fad diets Cindy was unable to shift her excess weight (left) before she began working out regularly and eating a balanced diet (right) Unfortunately, Cindy tried all the wrong diets and was unable to shift the weight. She said: 'I'd just go on the internet and see what magic diets people were talking about. 'I tried so many crazy things - cutting out certain foods completely rather than actually eating a balanced diet. 'It wasn't until I saw a picture of myself when I went home to see my family that I just thought, ""Oh my god, I need to do something"". 'That's when I realised that I needed to start exercising and getting my fitness up.' Cindy joined a gym, began weight training, and immediately noticed a difference. Cindy says she initially tried many different types of training in the gym before settling on weight training . She said: 'At first I tried lots of different methods of training, but it was the weight training that I loved the most. 'A lot of women are quite scared of weights but I thought they were great - and the fat just melted away. 'Every three months I was having to buy clothes in a smaller size. 'Soon, after chatting to people at the gym, I became interested in body composition and ways to make myself stronger. 'It's then that I learnt about body building. 'I was really sceptical about it at first - I'm quite a timid person and the idea of standing up in front of everyone in my bikini was pretty scary, but I knew it would be great motivation to get in even better shape. 'When I told people what I was doing, they were a bit unsure about it too. 'Everyone warned me not to get too muscular, but I think I have the balance right.' Cindy, who has now started her own personal training business, says women are wrong to be scared of weight-lifting and credits her training with transforming her body and her confidence . Cindy entered the bikini category for her first competition and fell in love with body building. She said: 'When I walked out onto the stage for the very first time it was really scary - I had so many butterflies. 'But I was over the moon when I came fourth - I had no idea I would do so well. 'A few months later, I entered another competition and I managed to win three trophies, it was such a buzz. 'Now I'm starting to prepare for a huge competition next year held by the UK Body Building and Fitness Federation - it will be my biggest competition so far, and if I win, it will be my first major title. 'I've also recently started my own personal training business, something I would never have imagined I'd do. 'Some times I can't believe how much my life has changed, but I'm so glad I did it. 'It has been a real rollercoaster, but you learn a lot about yourself- it has been amazing.'","Cindy Garcia-Lister was slim as a child but gained weight at university .

"DVD copies of Team America: World Police have sold out on Amazon and Walmart following the controversy surrounding fellow North Korean parody The Interview. The 2004 comedy, by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, uses a cast of puppets to poke fun at former North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and a host of Hollywood celebrities. The movie has now become a hit again - following Sony's cancelled and reinstated release of The Interview, a film based on an assassination plot of current North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. Scroll down for video . Rekindled interest: DVD copies of Team America: World Police have sold out on Amazon and Walmart following the controversy surrounding fellow North Korean parody The Interview . The movie's plot led to hackers targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment last month - breaching their computer systems and putting thousands of confidential and embarrassing emails into the public domain. The film drew immediate comparisons to Team America for being one of only a few films that mocked a living dictator. After Sony scrapped the release of The Interview, a number of smaller chains and independent movie theaters decided they would screen Team America around Christmas instead, reports Mashable UK. But Paramount has now weighed in -  banning theaters from following through with the plans, without releasing a statement explaining their actions. Likeness: The Interview, starring James Franco (L) and Randall Park (R) drew immediate comparisons to Team America for being one of only a few films that mocked a living dictator . One of the theaters, the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, said last week: 'Due to to circumstances beyond our control, the TEAM AMERICA 12/27 screening has been cancelled. We apologize & will provide refunds today.' In Team America: World Police, Kim Jong-il is impaled on a spike and then revealed to be an alien. The film earned $12million in its opening U.S. weekend - eventually grossing more than $52million in the box office. Since The Interview hit headlines, DVDs of the movie have sold out on Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart. And in a change of fortune, 300 independent US theaters have now confirmed they will in fact screen beleaguered Seth Rogen and James Franco film The Interview this week. North Korea called 'The Interview' and 'act of war' for portraying the assassination and violent death of its current leader, Kim Jong-un - who took over after his father's death . Reverse: Up to 300 independent US theaters have now confirmed they will in fact screen beleaguered Seth Rogen (R) and James Franco film The Interview this week . Despite announcing they would not distribute the controversial movie in the aftermath of a terrorist threat from hacking organization Guardians of Peace, Sony announced yesterday that the film will play in selected theaters and on video on-demand from Christmas Day. The major cinemas - who feared running the comedy would make them terror targets - still refuse to play The Interview, chopping down Sony's original release schedule from around 3,000 screens across the country to just over 300. The studio released a statement yesterday confirming the news, with both Rogen and Franco sharing their joy at the update and even President Obama applauding the move as artistic freedom. Obama had previously claimed he was disappointed with Sony for canceling The Interview during a press conference and went on to flub Franco's name. Excitement: Seth Rogen shared how happy he was on Twitter Tuesday afternoon . Alamo Drafthouse planned to make a stand against North Korea by showing Team America: World Police instead of The Interview - but was forced to pull the plug . '""The Interview"" starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco saved by President Obacco! I MEAN PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!!! Sorry!!!' wrote Franco on his Instagram. Obama had called the actor James Flacco, while calling Sony's decision to not release the film a 'mistake.' It would seem that he had confused the Hollywood heartthrob with Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco. Flacco found the entire incident hysterical, writing soon after on Twitter; 'Welcome to the family, brother. @JamesFrancoTV.'","Team America is a 2004 comedy produced by the creators of South Park .

"Jamie Carragher has revealed his all-time Premier League XI with fellow television pundit Gary Neville one of five Manchester United men getting the nod. Sportsmail's columnist chose his favourite players from the Premier League era, but expressed regret that he was forced to choose  former Old Trafford rival  Neville at right-back. The ex-Liverpool defender  opted for classics in his composite XI, including Thierry Henry and Ryan Giggs, and joked that he hopes Pablo Zabaleta can replace Neville in the near future.

Going through his selection one by one, Carragher added: 'My goalkeeper is obviously Peter Schmeichel. It would be very difficult for any keeper to ever surpass him. 'Left-back was a close decision between (Ashley) Cole, (Denis) Irwin and (Patrice) Evra, but I went for Cole as he's as good as anyone in the world in his prime. 'The best centre-back in the Premier League era for me is John Terry.' As his other centre-back, Carragher opted for Arsenal icon Tony Adams, who he said 'to play next to him is my hardest decision'. He continued: 'Roy Keane has to be in anyone's central midfield for his massive influence on Manchester United. Carragher blocks the ball from Manchester United and Premier League legend Ryan Giggs .

"After last weekend's stalemate at Aston Villa brought an end to Manchester United's six-match winning run, manager Louis van Gaal admitted that his side remain some way short of a force capable of winning the Barclays Premier League title. 'When you want to be a part of the title race, you have to win these games,' said Van Gaal, cutting straight to the point, 'I saw Manchester City's first half against Crystal Palace, they struggled but 3-0, that is the difference.' Following Chelsea's 2-0 victory at Stoke City on Monday evening, United fell 10 points behind Jose Mourinho's team. Given Mourinho's remarkable Yuletide record - on the seven occasions his side have been on top at Christmas, they have gone on to win the league title - it would take a considerable lapse of common sense to now back Van Gaal to negotiate a ten-point swing and secure the league title in his first season in charge. Radamel Falcao (centre) scored Manchester United's equaliser in Saturday's league draw at Aston Villa . Falcao (centre) celebrates his goal with his Old Trafford team-mates during their Premier League encounter . United boss Louis van Gaal admitted after the match his side are a long way off from winning the title . The Red Devils have lost three games so far this season - including an opening day defeat at home to Swansea . Cesc Fabregas (right) scored in Chelsea's 2-0 win at Stoke - a win that moves them 10 points clear of United . David Silva (centre right) scored twice as Manchester City defeated Crystal Palace 3-0 on Saturday . There is a need to tread carefully with such comparisons but, on the flipside, some may point out that Manchester United were only eight points off the pace at the same stage last season under David Moyes. It should, however, be noted that Moyes' tally of 28 points from 17 games would have left United 14 behind this season's pacesetters Chelsea. Regardless, very would argue that Manchester United, as a football club, were in a healthier position this time last year. Noetheless, for all Van Gaal's progressive work with this Manchester United squad, this Sportsmail study reveals that only once before have the Red Devils found themselves so far adrift from first place on Christmas Day, with the Dutchman equalling the 10 point deficit that Sir Alex Ferguson slumped to in the 1995/96 season. It may not, however, be the most distressing omen. For that season transpired to be one of the most memorable and dramatic in the modern era, as United reversed Newcastle's advantage - Kevin Keegan 'I would love it...' et al - and went on to be crowned Champions. Former Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan (right) saw his side lose a 12-point title lead to United in 1995-96 . Ex-United boss Sir Alex Ferguson (right) and assistant manager Brian Kidd hold aloft the 1995/96 league title . United supporters may also take hope from the fact that eight of their thirteen title triumphs under Sir Alex Ferguson came despite failing to achieve first place at Christmas. In 1992/93, for Ferguson's first title win, United were 5 points off the pace on Christmas Day, as they were in 1998/1999 when they went on to secure a Treble. Intriguingly, Van Gaal's 32 points from 17 games eclipses the 31 points that Ferguson's most celebrated squad in 1999 had taken from their opening 18 games. In 2008/09, a United squad featuring Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez were seven points behind Liverpool at Christmas, although they did have two games in hand. United lost 3-2  to Middlesbrough in December 1998 - a result that saw them five points adrift in the table . United's challenge this season, however, appears considerably more testing. Chelsea are made up of such mighty specimens, such powerful characters - Mourinho, Branislav Ivanovic, John Terry, Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa - that it is almost impossible to believe that doubt could corrode their resolve. Even if they were to slip up, it is then equally difficult to imagine Manchester City also allowing their neighbours a run at the title. And even if these unlikely events were to transpire, does anybody really believe this United squad - beset by deficiencies in defence and injuries throughout - has the potential to amass the necessary points? Diego Costa (left) and Nemanja Matic have been two of Chelsea's standout performers so far this season . Perhaps most ominous for United - despite their reputation for accelerating into gear in the second half of the campaign - is that they were rarely able to claw back Mourinho's Chelsea. In both the 2004/2005 and the 2005/2006 season, Ferguson's United were nine points behind Chelsea on Christmas Day. The first time around, United ended up 18 points off Chelsea by the end of the season while in the 2005/06 season, United could only cut the deficit to eight points come the final day of the campaign. It should, of course, be said that Van Gaal's principal target for this first season has always been Champions League qualification but the results of recent weeks might just have had some Manchester United supporters wondering. Last week at Aston Villa provided a dose of reality and all logic now points to a second consecutive season without the Premier League title at Old Trafford.

"A Brooklyn judge has allowed a man accused of posting a message on Facebook threatening to shoot police officers to be released without bail, it was revealed today. Devon Coley, 18, was arraigned Monday on a charge of making a terroristic threat just hours after officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed in an ambush by Ismaaiyl Brinsley who had signaled his planned attack online. The New York Post has reported that Coley — who also is facing unrelated gun possession and other charges — posted a photo of a gunman shooting at a patrol car with the caption '73Nextt.' Free: Known gang member Devon Coley, 18, was released without bail after being arraigned on a charge of making terroristic threats against police after Judge Laura Johnson said setting a bail for Coley's release would be a 'misuse of bail' Menacing: Coley posted a photo of a gunman shooting at a patrol car with the caption '73Nextt' The ominous status update posted on Coley's now-defunct Facebook account 'MH Flossie' was an apparent reference to the 73rd Police Precinct in his Brooklyn neighborhood of Brownsville. It is not clear where the photo used in Coley's post depicting a young black man firing into an NYPD car came from. His lawyer told Brooklyn Criminal Court Judge Laura Johnson Monday that Coley was not planning to follow through on the message. Prosecutors called the charges serious and sought $250,000 bail. Judge Johnson called Coley's posts inflammatory but released him without bail. Target: The ominous status update posted on Coley's Facebook account 'MH Flossie' was an apparent reference to the 73rd police precinct . Dennis Quirk, head of the state court officers union, has condemned the judge's decision to set Coley free. 'She should resign from the bench,' he told the paper.' She is not fit to be a judge.' On Sunday, police launched a search for Coley after becoming aware of his threatening Facebook message. The NYPD circulated a ‘wanted’ poster describing the 18-year-old as a known member of the Addicted to Cash/180HII street gang. Coley surrendered to police in the 73rd Precinct Sunday and reportedly confessed to writing the post. According to reports, the teenager came into the precinct accompanied by his mother and told detectives he felt bad and was sorry for what he had done. During his arraignment Monday, Coley's attorney, Daniel Ades, called his client a 'knucklehead.' Bad timing: Coley's post came just hours after officers Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) were gunned  down in an ambush by gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley . Vigilant: Police all throughout the city have been on high alert fearing copycat attacks on officers . Prosecutors argued that Coley's post went beyond youthful indiscretion, but Judge Johnson countered by saying that for her to set bail 'because of the current climate' would be a 'misuse of bail.' Police across the city have been on the lookout for possible copycat attacks on officers after the Saturday night ambush that took the lives of two of the colleagues, Liu and Ramos. Cop killer Ismmayil Brimsley posted several messages on Instagram while driving from Maryland to New York Saturday, including, 'I'm Putting Wings on Pigs Today.' The Police Benevolent Association has issued a warning telling officers they should respond to every call with two patrol cars and avoid making arrests 'unless absolutely necessary,' reported ABC 7 News. The head of the NYPD detectives' union instructed members to work in trios, wear bulletproof vests on the street and remain vigilant.","Devon Coley, 18,  posted photo of a gunman shooting at patrol car with caption '73Nextt' just hours after murder of two officers .

"Meet Switzerland's very own Father of Christmas. Johann Wanner counts the White House in Washington DC and the residence of the Monaco royal family as just two of the world's venues he has decorated in his unique Christmas style. The 78-year-old owns two shops in Basel, Switzerland – one he opened in 1969 and the other, due to increasing demand he set up two years ago. Johann Wanner, pictured with his wife Ursula in his Christmas shop, that sells every kind of decoration you could wish to buy . Johann's Christmas parlour offers shoppers the chance to rest their tired feet and indulge in some quality afternoon tea or perhaps a mulled wine . From angels to candles, action figures to desserts, Johann Wanner's shops cater for every seasonal taste . As well as his units selling everything you could ever dream of in terms of decorations, every one made by hand, it is the styling of Christmas trees that have seen him achieve worldwide kudos. What's more, Wanner's flagship grottos are open all year round. 'The way we celebrate Christmas is a mirror of society,' Wanner told MailOnline Travel. Only 5 per cent of the world's Christmas decorations are handmade. All Johann's decorations sold in his shops are handmade – highlighted by the fact that the shape of each are 'not perfect,' in his own words. Johann states green and red are the most popular colours of his UK clients. Basel's main Christmas tree outside the cathedral was designed by Johann, who used the surrounding architecture to sculpture his art. 'In summer we do Christmas because we have people who come from all over world. 'Christmas stays all year long. Union Jack decorations, Stars and Stripes, liberty balls, candy sticks, all made by hand, are wanted by people from all over.' While his shops are full of Christmas goodies that make even the discerning adult wide-eyed with excitement, it is his tree decorating that provides the greatest stories. Wanner is coy about revealing the identity of his clients, but as well as his trips to the White House being common knowledge, he has an interesting tale of a royal visit. 'One year I was called to decorate the royal family of Liechtenstein, I had to find out about the house, about the size of the room, the colours, everything. 'It was a fabulous scene, so much so that I was out playing golf with the head of the Liechtenstein royal family the next day.' The window of Johann's shops is enchanting; and this is notched up a level once inside . A treasure trove of goodies for all the family, Johann Wanner brings Christmas cheer all year round . Johann Wanner's shops are magical, however it is his Christmas tree decorating that has taken him all around the world, and right, pictured with MailOnline Travel reporter John Hutchinson . At this point, I asked how the course were over there, and was told that he would 'be able to arrange me a round,' should I ever be visiting. Not a bad addition to the contacts book. Wanner likens his role to that of a fashion designer – no time limit can be put on on decorating a tree, and much research goes into every project. 'It take lots of time,' added the passionate Swiss. 'People ask me how long it takes, I say an eternity. The important thing is to give yourself time to make it correct. The White House and its famous tree have been decorated by Johann Wanner . The Prince's Palace of Monaco has also been given a sprinkling of festive cheer by the 78-year-old . Johann invited MailOnline to the back room to see some decorating in progress, and right, a finished tree in the shop . Princess Charlene and Prince Albert II of Monaco attend a special Christmas Celebration at the Palace each year . Johann is well known not only and Basel and Switzerland, but also throughout the world for his Christmas decorating masterclass . 'From 0-95 per cent is easy. The last five per cent takes the same amount of time as the first 95. 'We work with the decorators of the famous people, there is a network of decorators worldwide. 'They send us descriptions of the people, or they send us colours and pieces of leather of the interior, and so the style we must know. 'My work is the same as like a fashion designer. The work is just the same. We have the natural colours, red, blue, green, gold and silver. But every year there are new colours, everything changes.' Johann Wanner is without doubt the 'Couturier of the Christmas tree' – the tree is the model and the decoration the fashion. And Wanner is the genius behind each operation. Fares from London to Basel start at £110 standard class return. All fares are per person and subject to availability. For bookings visit www.voyages-sncf.com or call 0844 8485848.

"An American mom who believes her daughter was murdered by convicted killer Joran Van der Sloot has said she was sickened by his wedding to a Peruvian woman in a prison ceremony in July. Beth Holloway's 18-year-old daughter Natalee disappeared in Aruba in 2005 and Dutchman Van der Sloot remains the chief suspect in her death. He is currently serving a 28-year sentence in Peru for killing business student Stephany Flores on May 30, 2010 - the fifth anniversary of Natalee's disappearance. Scroll down for video . Beth Holloway, left, said she felt sick when she heard that Joran Van der Sloot, the murderer wanted in connection with the 2005 disappearance of her daughter Natalee, right, had got married in a Peruvian prison . Van der Sloot has never been charged with Natalee's murder, but is due to be extradited to the U.S. in 2038 on charges of attempting to extort money from her mom Beth. In July, Van der Sloot married 25-year-old Peruvian trainee accountant Leidy Figueroa and she gave birth to his daughter, Dushy, three month later. 'When I hear it... It makes you sick,' Beth told Oprah Winfrey on Oprah: Where Are They Now? 'But I really try to focus on what I truly care about. And what I truly care about is information as to what happened to Natalee.' Oprah, who first interviewed Beth in 2008, told her it felt 'like a knife to me' when she heard that Van der Sloot had confessed to killing Flores in 2010. 'It felt like a knife to me, and I have no relationship with you other than interview,' said Oprah. 'When I hear it... It makes you sick,' Beth spoke with Oprah Winfrey for her Where Are They Now? show. The pair had originally spoken about Natalee's 2005 disappearance six years ago . Prior to killing Flores, Van der Sloot had been attempting to extort money from Beth claiming he could sell her her daughter's remains. 'At that time that that was all happening, Joran had reached out [to me],' Beth said. 'He was trying to extort money out of me, trying to sell me Natalee's remains, which... just shocks the conscious.' Van der Sloot had allegedly offered to reveal the location of the teen's remains in exchange for $250,000. Beth said the FBI was ready to step in and arrest Van der Sloot when he fled the country and went to Peru. She even made an unauthorized visit to Peru and confronted him in custody. 'I went there to reach out to the Flores family and to support them. I didn't go there with this plan [that] I'm going to see Joran,' she explained. 'I did [confront him]. I just wanted to get to Joran. I honestly don't know if I was going there to get information from him... For some reason, I needed some sense of how to begin to... find my way through this journey.' Van der Sloot is currently serving a 28-year sentence in Peru for killing business student Stephany Flores on May 30, 2010 - the fifth anniversary of Natalee's disappearance . Walking down the aisle: Leidy pictured outside the prison on the day the trainee accountant married the killer in July. She was six months' pregnant at the time . 'Did you expect that he would tell you something?' asked Oprah. 'No,' answered Beth. 'Maybe somewhere deep down...' In September Van der Sloot's wife told MailOnline that her husband was 'gentle, sensitive, kind' and 'no monster', despite being a convicted murderer. 'My Joran is no monster,' declared Figueroa, who insisted her husband has changed since they started an unlikely prison romance four years ago. She said the 6ft 5in killer was a 'different man' after finding God and said he 'seeks forgiveness' for the evil he has committed. And in a series of astonishing prison love letters seen by MailOnline, Van der Sloot's passionate feelings for his 5ft 3in wife were laid bare. Van der Sloot was the last person seen with Natalee Holloway, left, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005 . Ms Figueroa also said that her husband is close to breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions which he described as 'worse than Guantanamo Bay'. The prison's conditions are in stark contrast to those under which Van der Sloot fell in love with Leidy in an unlikely prison romance four years ago. Lax prison rules meant he was able to play online poker, use a cellphone, take drugs and have other women come and go as he pleased. And he enjoyed teaching English to other inmates and doing arts and crafts, making ceramic sculptures for his wife. Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca in August after he threatened to kill the warden of the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Lima. He was found with an illegal cellphone which was confiscated, officials of the Inpe prisons administration said. Van der Sloot even recorded a video in which he showed the conditions in his cell, later saying that it was warden Sergio Haro who provided him with the cellphone. Joran van der Sloot's wife Leidy Figueroa poses for a portrait with some of the ceramic sculptures Joran made for her inside prison - she gave birth to the couple's daughter, Dushy, in October . 'The warden himself gave it to me. I don't know why, but I suspect that it was to set a trap for me,' said Van der Sloot in a portion of the video. According to Leidy, Warden Haro was furious and told her husband he had never liked him. Van der Sloot was immediately thrown in the 'Hole' – solitary confinement – for six days. Leidy said: 'When he came out of the Hole the warden told Joran that he won't see his baby daughter when she's born. Joran didn't believe him but the warden is true to his word.' However she is confident that one day she and Van der Sloot will be together properly. 'Somehow one day he's going to leave prison and we can be a family,' she said. Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Natalee Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for $250,000 payment. The murderer was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved.","Murderer Joran Van der Sloot, is facing extradited to the U.S. in 2038 in connection with the 2005 disappearance of Natalee Holloway .

"The Scottish Football Association has turned down a request from Rangers to allow Mike Ashley to increase his shareholding at Ibrox. Newcastle owner Ashley is understood to have signed up to an agreement with the SFA that limits his stake to 10 per cent but wanted a new deal that would allow him three times that amount. However the SFA said its board had 'unanimously' rejected the application. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley has had his request to increase his sharehold in Rangers rejected . Ashley had hoped to treble his 10 per cent share in the Ibrox club but was rejected by the SFA . The talks came despite Ashley and Rangers facing a total of five disciplinary charges from the SFA over his recent moves to strengthen his influence at the club. An SFA statement read: 'The Scottish FA board convened on Tuesday, 23rd December to hear a submission from the board of Rangers Football Club. 'This meeting was arranged in respect of a request set out in an application to consent to an increase in MASH Holdings Limited's shareholding in Rangers International Football Club to a maximum of 29.9 per cent of the issued share capital. 'The board has now carefully considered the application and has decided, unanimously, that the application should not be granted. 'The board, under article 13 of the Scottish FA articles of association, is required to have due regard to the need to promote and safeguard the interests and public profile of association football, its players, spectators and others involved with the game.' Ibrox chairman David Somers has said 'a great deal of anti-Rangers feeling' exists within Scottish football . The talks were held a day after Rangers chairman David Somers claimed that a 'great deal of anti-Rangers feeling' exists within Scottish football, 'perhaps (although I hope not) even in the football establishment'. Ashley and the club now face a hearing on January 27 which will determined whether the Sports Direct founder's dual interests breached SFA rules and their agreement. Although his current stake in the club stands at 8.92 per cent, the club's retail division is run by Sports Direct and the Newcastle owner has recently handed the club a £3million loan. Derek Llambias - the former Newcastle managing director and close associate of Ashley - was recently named Rangers chief executive after earlier joining as a consultant and then being made director. Sports Direct executive Barry Leach also joined as a consultant and was on the stage at the club's annual general meeting on Monday. Rangers swiftly responded with a statement of their own which read: 'The Board of Rangers Football Club are very disappointed with the SFA's decision and we will now consider all our options.'

"It seems that Sony will be releasing their film The Interview after all. After announcing they would not distribute the film following the reluctance of many theaters to run the picture in the aftermath of a terrorist threat from hacking organization Guardians of Peace, Sony has now decided to allow the film to play in selected theaters and on video on demand on Christmas. The studio released a statement on Tuesday confirming the news, and James Franco shared his joy on Instagram, thanking President Obama before taking some time to mock him after flubbing his name during a news conference last week. Scroll down for videos . In theaters: Sony has announced they will release their film The Interview on Christmas day . Not happy: It is believed that North Korea was attempting to stop the release of the film as it depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un . Excitement: Seth Rogen shared how happy he was on Twitter Tuesday afternoon . Celebration: James Franco got in on the fun too, sharing a picture of him and Seth . '""The Interview"" starring Seth Rogen and James Flacco saved by President Obacco! I MEAN PRESIDENT OBAMA!!!!! Sorry!!!' wrote Franco on his Instagram. This after President Obama called the actor James Flacco last week while calling Sony's decision to not release the film a 'mistake.' It would seem that he had confused the Hollywood heartthrob with Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco. Flacco found the entire incident hysterical, writing soon after on Twitter; 'Welcome to the family, brother. @JamesFrancoTV.' ‘The president applauds Sony's decision to authorize screenings of the film,’ the White House said in a statement to the Huffington Post. ‘As the President made clear, we are a country that believes in free speech, and the right of artistic expression. The decision made by Sony and participating theaters allows people to make their own choices about the film, and we welcome that outcome.’ 'We're excited our movie will be in a number of theaters on Christmas Day,' said Sony CEO Michael Lynton. 'I want to thank our talent on The Interview and our employees, who have worked tirelessly through the many challenges we have all faced over the last month.' He then added, 'While we hope this is only the first step of the film’s release, we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech. Seth Rogen also shared his excitement on Twitter, writing; 'The people have spoken! Freedom has prevailed! Sony didn't give up! The Interview will be shown at theaters willing to play it on Xmas day!' 'VICTORY!!!!!!! The PEOPLE and THE PRESIDENT have spoken!!! SONY to release THE INTERVIEW in theaters on XMAS DAY!' said James Franco on Instagram. 'Breaking news: Sony has authorized screenings of THE INTERVIEW on Christmas Day. We are making shows available within the hour. #Victory,' tweeted Alamo Drafthouse founder Tim League, on Tuesday. The Alamo has theaters in California, Colorado, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Texas, and Virginia. The Plaza Atlanta also tweeted, writing; 'Breaking Plaza News:The Interview will open Exclusive on 12/25 . The Plaza will be one of the few theaters in the nation to open the film.' Sony had been widely criticized following their decision last week to shelf the movie, despite the fact that the film cost $42million to make and tens of millions to market. Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward. George Clooney also weighed in, saying; 'We cannot be told we can't see something by Kim Jong-un, of all f***ing people.' Supreme leader: Kim Jong-un (above) has denied that North Korea has anything to do with the hacking or threats of terrorism . Get your tickets: the Plaza Atlanta (above) is one of the theaters that will be playing The Interview . Coming soon: Posters advertising The Interview outside Alamo Drafthouse in Texas (above) Regal, AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex and Carmike, who between them operate more than half of the country's 40,000 cinemas, had announced last Wednesday that they wouldn't be showing the movie. In a statement, Regal said it was delaying any showings of The Interview because of 'the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats.' The statement from Regal's vice president of marketing and communications also pointed the finger of blame at Sony and its 'wavering support' for the movie. Sony had previously told exhibitors  that the company understood if they pulled the film in light of the threats. -The Plaza Atlanta (Atlanta, Georgia) -Alamo Drafthouse (Texas, Colorado, Virginia and New York) -State Theater (Ann Arbor, Michigan) -Southside Works Cinema (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) -Hollywood Boulevard Cinemas of Woodridge (Chicago, Illinois) 'Due to the wavering support of the film The Interview by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats, Regal Entertainment Group has decided to delay the opening of the film in our theaters,' said Regal's Russ Nunley. Cineplex, which also has more than a 75 percent market share in Canada with 161 theaters and 1,639 screens, also released a statement on Wednesday. As for international distribution, Sony had no comment on the planned February 6 release of the film in the UK. The film will also open in Lebanon and Iraq on Christmas. Deadline reports that the studio had decided against releasing the film in Asia months ago. Celebrate: James Franco shared his joy on Instagram (above) Overseas: A rep for Sony had no comment on the film's panned February 6 release in the UK . Global markets: The Interview is also set to open in Lebanon and Iraq on Christmas . Government officials have now revealed that North Korea was behind the hack on the movie studio, upset that they were set to release the film, which depicts the assassination of the leader. North Korea has denied any involvement. It is not yet known what other theaters may play the picture. The fallout from the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack that began five weeks ago exploded last week after the Guardians of Peace escalated their attack beyond corporate espionage and threatened moviegoers with violence reminiscent of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The seriousness of the threat made last Tuesday is still unclear. The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday there was 'no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters,' but noted it was still analyzing messages from the group.","Sony will release their film The Interview in selected theaters on Christmas day and on video on demand .

"Russian business owners are using American flags as doormats  as resentment over U.S. economic sanctions puts the squeeze on traders. Customers have been filmed wiping their feet on the fabled stars and stripes as they enter and exit stores across  Moscow, as struggling retailers take a hopeless swipe at their Cold War adversaries. Negotiations between the two nations are currently deadlocked over Russia's involvement in the Ukrainian crisis and the U.S. has initiated hard-hitting economic sanctions to try and force a compromise. Scroll down for video . A customer wipes his feet on the stars and stripes as he enters a Moscow supermarket . The doormats are being used by retailers in a novel attempt to show their anti-U.S. sentiments . In the video, the store owners' anti-U.S. sentiment is clear, as doormats emblazoned with the U.S. flag are positioned in doorways and corridors. Customers are then filmed walking on the flags as they enter and exit the stores. While recently announced U.S. sanctions have been dismissed by the Kremlin as useless, stabilizing the ruble, which is one of the world's worst-performing currencies this year following the sanctions imposed on Russia for its involvement in Ukraine, is a priority for Russia's monetary authorities. The country's statistics agency reported today that consumer prices rose 0.9 percent last week when the ruble was in freefall - there was clear evidence last week that retailers of imported products, such as electronics and cars, were raising prices in the wake of the ruble's fall. The weekly rise was the biggest since records began in 2008. Measures taken include last week's increase in the Central Bank's main interest rate to a whopping 17 percent in the hope that it makes holding rubles more attractive for traders. A woman walks across two U.S. flag doormats at a retail store in Moscow . The supermarket (pictured) owners used the doormats to take a small swipe at the U.S. And in a bid to boost hard currency offering at the markets, the government has encouraged major companies to sell more hard currency. Yesterday, it formally instructed five of the country's biggest state-controlled exporters to reduce their foreign currency assets to October levels and to not raise them again until March. However the ruble performs over the coming days and weeks, the Russian economy is predicted to fall into recession next year and inflation to spike - many forecasters expect the annual inflation rate to double from the current 10 percent. Some, like ex-Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin, are warning of a full-blown crisis.","Resentful Russian traders are using U.S. flags as doormats in their stores .

"A British holidaymaker has been awarded nearly £3,000 in compensation after she was diagnosed with salmonella following her all-inclusive stay at a Tunisian resort. Julie Roberts, from Walsall in West Midlands, fell ill on the final day of her two-week trip to the Dessole Riviera Resort in Port El Kantaoui in July and August of 2013. It was supposed to be a relaxing getaway with her mother and sister, but it turned into a ‘nightmare’ as she suffered stomach cramps, unusual bowel movements and severe diarrhoea. Julie Roberts (right) fell ill while staying at the resort with her mother, Christine Hartshorn (left), and sister . Mrs Roberts said she and her mother, Christine Hartshorn, and sister, Joanna Wright, only ate at the resort and did not visit any local restaurants or bars. At the hotel they were supplied with bottled water and did not have any cause for concern, she said. The 32-year-old said she generally consumed ‘egg, tomato and cheese on toast for breakfast, chicken with salad or pasta at lunch time and meat, vegetables and potato for dinner’. After falling ill shortly before she was scheduled to travel home, she chose not to report her illness to anyone at the resort. Mrs Roberts said she only ate at the resort and did not visit any local restaurants or bars . She added: ‘I was worried they wouldn’t let me travel. There was no rep available and I was desperate to get home, feeling so unwell.’ When she returned to the UK she sought medical attention from her GP, who confirmed she contracted salmonella, a foodborne illness that occurs when a person consumes contaminated products such as raw or lightly-cooked eggs or undercooked poultry. Mrs Roberts, who booked with Airtours, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook, hired solicitors from Your Holiday Claims, a division of Farnworth Rose solicitors, to investigate the source of her illness and pursue a claim against the tour operator, which resulted in her being awarded £2,685 in compensation. Julie Roberts, 32, booked her trip to Port El Kantaoui (pictured) with Airtours, a subsidiary of Thomas Cook . Anne Thomson, head of travel law at Your Holiday Claims, said: ‘We were saddened to hear that what was planned as a relaxing time to grieve for a loved one was spoilt by Mrs Robert’s illness. ‘Salmonella infections can be very serious and in some cases complications can arise. Hospital treatment may be required due to dehydration. ‘We hope that Thomas Cook and the hotel management carried out investigations into food handling and hygiene practices in order to ensure that that there no further cases of illness arise.’ Mrs Roberts’ mother and sister did not experience any symptoms, but other holidaymakers were reportedly ill at the resort, according to the law firm. In a statement, a Thomas Cook spokesman said: 'Thomas Cook is sorry that Mrs Roberts fell ill while on holiday at the Riviera Resort in Tunisia in summer 2013. We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with her legal representatives and that this matter is now resolved. 'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook closely audits all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained. 'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible while in resort or the UK so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.'","Julie Roberts fell ill at the Dessole Riviera Resort in Port El Kantaoui .

"They are pictures that seem almost impossible to take - the Milky Way glowing over the haunting beauty of America's National Parks. But one photographer has managed to capture the immense majesty of the star-studded night sky, with all the detail of the Milky Way as it stretches above some of America's most iconic landscapes. Astrophotographer Dave Lane, 58, has been capturing images of disk shaped galaxy - which cannot be distinguished properly with the naked eye - since early 2011 and has been obsessed with snapping the phenomenon ever since. The towering rock formations in Arches National Park, Utah, stand tall below the disk-shaped galaxy that appears like a rainbow of the night . The iridescent beauty of the Milky Way is reflected in Jenney Lake in a spectacular photo taken at Yellowstone National Park . In what looks like rainbow of iridescent stars arched across the night sky, one photograph shows the glowing band looming over a piping hot spring in Yellowstone. And another depicts an unwitting bison grazing below an explosion of luminous colours. According to Dave, capturing these images can be a notoriously tricky process, having spent weeks under the stars taking hundreds of shots in some cases.

"Manchester City can equal a club record of nine consecutive victories with success at West Brom on Boxing Day. City have hit form in the past month, with their sequence of eight straight wins carrying them into the Champions League's last 16 and cutting into Chelsea's lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League. They trail Chelsea by just three points heading into the Christmas league fixtures having - briefly - been as many as nine behind at one stage last month. Manchester City trained on Christmas Eve ahead of their Premier League Boxing Day trip to West Brom . Chelsea have responded to the champions' reinvigorated challenge by winning their last two but, after enduring an indifferent spell in October and November, City clearly have momentum. Manager Manuel Pellegrini said: 'We are playing now with the intensity and in style of play we always do. Again we have players in high level of performance and good moments. 'We are trusting in what we do so, in the same way maybe we played in a poor way two months ago, we are doing very well.' Victory at The Hawthorns will see City match a feat of winning nine in succession that they have only achieved twice before. The first time was in the old Division Two between December 1909 and February 1910, with the second their much more recent hot streak of autumn 2011. David Silva (centre) will be looking to add to his two-goal exploits against Crystal Palace on Saturday . The latter sequence, when City truly asserted themselves in what was to prove their first Premier League title-winning season, most memorably included their 6-1 destruction of Manchester United at Old Trafford. Last season they did win 18 out of 20 games across December and January but the most they won in succession was seven. Their latest strong run was partly sparked by the brilliance of Sergio Aguero - most obviously by his brilliant hat-trick against Bayern Munich last month - but City have been without their star striker for the last three games. The Argentinian is likely to be out another month with his knee injury and Pellegrini, although confident his team can maintain their momentum, acknowledges they need him back soon. Stevan Jovetic (right) is back in training after overcoming a hamstring injury . He said: 'It is enough for me for us just to continue (playing) in the same way - I don't know if better things will come. 'In this moment we are playing in a high level but we always need to return, as soon as we can, Aguero and all the other players that are injured.' City are also without their other senior strikers, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. Midfielder James Milner operated as a makeshift centre-forward for last week's victory over Crystal Palace with David Silva, who scored twice, behind him. That arrangement could be repeated at West Brom but Jovetic is back in training could soon return after a hamstring injury. City's defence has also shown marked improvement during their recent run of form, with just one goal conceded in six games. They have recorded four clean sheets in succession and, encouragingly, three of those have been secured without influential captain Vincent Kompany. Midfielder Fernandinho (centre) attempts to win the ball from Eliaquim Mangala (right) during a training drill . Eliaquim Mangala, who initially struggled after his £32million arrival from Porto, now seems to be finding his feet and Martin Demichelis, the subject of much derision last season, is proving a solid performer. Pellegrini said: 'You can play with more trust if you don't concede a goal. If not, and you are one goal behind, you start playing faster than you need to. It is very important to keep our clean sheet.' With the defensive mistakes now fewer, the decision to release Joleon Lescott - whom City will face at The Hawthorns - at the end of last season seems justified. Lescott, 32, was a key performer in the 2011-12 title success but struggled to command a regular place in the final two years of his contract. Pellegrini said: 'Every squad needs change every year. He is 33, 34 (sic) years old. We thought it was better for him to continue for another club. 'I was always very happy with his performance for us last year because he is a very good player and an intelligent player.'

"West Ham boss Sam Allardyce says he is licking his lips at their festive fixture list despite the club having the 'hardest games' of their Premier League rivals. The Hammers face consecutive London derbies in the space of two days as they host league leaders Chelsea before travelling to Arsenal.

'We're a completely different unit and we're enjoying our Christmas more this year. We do have the hardest games over 48 hours though,' said Allardyce at the club's pre-match press conference on Christmas Eve. 'I'm looking forward to the games on the basis of where we are in the league and what the team has done so far.' Boxing Day's clash against Chelsea will see Allardyce pit his wits up against Blues' counterpart Jose Mourinho. The duo traded a war of words after a 0-0 stalemate at Stamford Bridge last season, but Allardyce is looking for another good performance from his side with a result.

"While the rest of us are tucking into turkey on Christmas Day, spare a though for one mother, who has had to take to 35,000ft to spend the holidays with her family. Siblings Sarah-Jane, Christopher and Michael Gates will all be working on a British Airways flight from Sydney to Singapore on December 25, instead of celebrating at home in Bedfordshire. Sarah-Jane and her twin brothers will be serving Christmas dinner to 300 passengers on board the flight - one of whom will be their mother Kareen, who they have brought along for the ride. Siblings (L-R) Christopher Gates (cabin crew), Sarah-Jane Gates (customer service director) and Michael Gates (cabin crew) will all be flying together for British Airways over Christmas . In their bid to keep the family together, the siblings used the complimentary tickets they have for friends and family to whisk their mother away with them for the journey to Australia and back. The group left on the first leg of their trip on December 20 and will wake up to a barbecued breakfast in Sydney on Christmas Day. Then they will board a flight to Singapore where the children will work while Kareen enjoys a slap-up meal, before landing in Singapore for dinner. The family will eventually land back in the UK on December 29, just in time to recover for New Year's Eve. Customer service manager Sarah-Jane, who has worked for British Airways for four years, said: 'I am so excited for this Christmas, as it will be the first time in four years that we have all spent the festive season together. The family will spend the morning in Sydney celebrating Christmas Day with a barbecue . They Gates family will then jet to Singapore in time for Christmas Day evening . 'What better way to spend it than having a barbeque on the beach in the morning and dinner in Singapore the same evening?! 'Flying is a huge part of our lives so to spend Christmas somewhere exotic and together is fantastic. Not many people get to experience two completely different cultures in one day, and it’s great because our Christmas Day will last 27 hours instead of 24!'

Kareen, who has travelled around the globe, as she tries to join one of her children on a trip once a month, said: 'I'm so excited for Christmas this year. Being fortunate enough to travel around the world with my children is an opportunity not many people experience. 'To spend Christmas with my children is fabulous but to spend it in two cities in one day is a bonus. I am very proud of all my children working for British Airways. I’m also relieved that I won’t have to cook Christmas dinner for once!'

"Did Arsene Wenger miss a trick not signing Cesc Fabregas? Even if only to thwart his rivals, Chelsea. The former Arsenal midfielder is playing his best-ever football under Jose Mourinho. With that in mind, Sportsmail have Arsenal fan Jack Bishop of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation. Is Alexis Sanchez a suitable replacement? Let's see what he had to say. Seeing somebody you love in the arms of someone else is very tough. Especially when they've already promised that you will always be the only one for them. Unfortunately, when Chelsea signed Cesc Fabregas from Barcelona last summer, Arsenal fans felt that horrible feeling at the pit of their stomach. Our former captain broke his promise and shacked up with that rich, more successful fella who lives down the road. Gunners fans were left searching for the hows and whys of Fabregas' decision to move to Stamford Bridge. When it was revealed that Arsene Wenger actually turned the Spaniard down before completion of his Chelsea move, his transfer tactics were once again called into question. Alexis Sanchez pictured for Arsenal since signing from Barcelona as their newest forward . Cesc Fabregas joined Chelsea after Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger opted against bringing him to the Emirates . Wenger's preference to stay true to the super-expensive and at times invisible Mesut Ozil was the justification and it didn't sit well with many, me included. One month on, in July, Wenger raided Barcelona himself to sign his joker in the pack. Alexis Sanchez arrived for a bumper £30million and in his first half season of Barclays Premier League football has already become the new darling of the Emirates. Having hit 14 goals in all competitions before Christmas - including nine in the Premier League - Sanchez looks the perfect fit for English football. His strong work-ethic, appetite for attack and goal return already mean that Sanchez is indispensable to Arsene Wenger's plans. If there is a man who can lead the side beyond the realms of fourth-placed normality, it's the 26-year-old. Both players commanded a similar fee, both arrived from Barcelona and both are already proven at the highest level. Whichever player Wenger had decided to sign, it would have been a major coup. Fabregas celebrates putting Chelsea 2-0 up against Stoke City at the Britannia on Monday night . Fabregas had proved a shrewd move by Jose Mourinho as he has 12 assists this season for Chelsea . Wenger opted to stay true to the super-expensive Mesut Ozil over Fabregas during the summer . While Fabregas is having perhaps his best ever season in English football, we should stay faithful with Wenger's choice. The Spaniard has notched 12 assists in Chelsea blue already this season – one more than Jack Wilshere has made in his entire Premier League career - and it's a remarkable statistic. Fabregas' record is even better than the combined total of EIGHT Arsenal midfielders, including the likes of Ozil, Wilshere, Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey. But had he been taken ahead of Sanchez, he would have been just one more player to fit into a lineup of midfield clones. Each of the aforementioned midfielders bear similarity to each other's style and should Wenger finally decide to address the actual weaknesses in our squad over the next couple of transfer windows, Arsenal will rightfully stand at the next level. Sanchez (right) acknowledges Olivier Giroud as the Arsenal forward proves he has fit in well in London . A defensive midfielder and at least two defenders are a necessity and those signings coupled with the flexible Sanchez will give us more options. We won’t be title contenders until those problems further down the pitch are solved, but Wenger's decision to sign Sanchez over Fabregas is a sign that he is building for now and the future. Sanchez is the younger of the two and has the X factor that we have been lacking since Thierry Henry departed in 2007. While a former favourite son of north London is flourishing at his new club, Sanchez is on his way to becoming an Arsenal great - and Wenger actually deserves some credit for it for once. Wenger deserves credit for bringing in Sanchez, even if he did miss out on Fabregas, who joined Chelsea .

"Children run across a thick blanket of snow. Christmas trees, snowmen and snowball fights. But this is no winter wonderland. This is Dubai. And December temperatures are regularly in the mid 20s. So at this Christmas festival the snow is made by a machine. Children from all religions came together to celebrate the Dubai Christmas Festival . Festive celebrations abound in the United Arab Emirates, home to more than a hundred different nationalities. And people of all religions are getting involved. Nikul Patel is a Indian Hindu who grew up in the USA and his wife Zainab is a Muslim who grew up in the UAE. 'You know Christmas was just sitting around all day and eating and watching movies and now we have a kid and it's about him and sharing that experience and making sure he understands it. Christmas is not for us about a religion but it's a time to just celebrate,' he said. Bands play Christmas music for the crowds. People from all over the world are joining in the fun at the Dubai Christmas Fest. Event organisers put the ongoing successes of the Christmas festival down to the people of Dubai 'loving a good celebration' A machine produced enough synthetic snow so the children (and probably adults) could build snowmen . 'Very good, I think it's very good to get together all the people from all religions. I mean it's a nice thing,' says Yuksel Karakoc, who's originally from Turkey. Retailers sell tinsel and other decorations. And children visit Santa and his elves. Chris Fountain, managing director of Turret Media, which organises the Dubai Christmas Fest, explains why the event is so popular. 'It's an amazing family festival. It's grown year on year. I think everyone from all nationalities, all walks of life in Dubai enjoys a good celebration,' he said. Christmas is big business for Dubai's shopping malls too. At the Mall of the Emirates dancers perform a scene from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker, a favourite ballet during the festive season. And shoppers come to see the lavish decorations and massive Christmas tree. Dubai is a Muslim country, but research suggests Muslims enjoy the annual festival . According to Euromonitor International, UAE retail spending during December rises to US$3 billion (£1.3billion), an increase of half a billion dollars on the average monthly spending rate. Outgoings on food also increase during December - up by more than US$1 billion (£64million) from the average month. Hussein Doughan, country manager for Euromonitor International, says the popularity of Christmas is a relatively new phenomenon. 'Dubai is a Muslim country but Muslims and non-Muslims are enjoying the festival. There are decorations in the malls and Christmas trees across the city. Compared to ten years ago it is a big change,' he said. It might provide good business opportunities, but for many it's just a chance to have some fun.","Children and adults of all nationalities and religions enjoy the festival .

"The announcement by Sony last week that they would not be releasing the upcoming Kim Jong-un assassination film The Interview shocked many, especially when government officials confirmed that it was in fact North Korea who was behind the massive hacking of the movie studio. Their success was short lived however, as just days later, Sony reversed their decision, deciding to put the film in selected theaters across the country while also releasing it on video on demand on Christmas day. And now, North Korea and their Supreme Leader are getting mocked again thanks to a new photo sweeping social media that shows the stoic and stern Kim Jong-un with a full face of make-up and the hashtag ‪'#‎YouCantSilenceOurFreedomOfSpeech‬.' Scroll down for video . Kim Jong un-recognizable: A photo of Kim Jong-un in a full face of makeup is sweeping Facebook . Hacked: Government officials confirmed last week that North Korea and Kim Jong-un (above) were in fact behind the recent Sony hack . Shut it down: The hack was an attempt to get Sony to cancel the release of their film The Interview, which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un (above) The photo, which has been splashed across Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, urges individuals to share, retweet or regram, 'for no other reason than to piss off North Korea.' This as Kim Jong-un continues to deny that he or his country had anything to do with the massive hack, which saw the release of thousands of private emails between executives at the company, and ultimately culminated with a threat of terrorism aimed at any movie theater set to play the film. President Obama referred to the hack as an act of 'cybervandalism' by North Korea, while North Korea has stated that they believe the hack was the work of the United States government. Sony had been widely criticized following their decision last week to shelf the movie, despite the fact that the film cost $42million to make and tens of millions to market. Almost immediately, many in Hollywood voiced their concern, with writer Aaron Sorkin saying how upset he was that 'the U.S. succumbed to an unprecedented attack on our most cherished, bedrock principle of free speech by a group of North Korean terrorists,' and director Judd Apatow explaining the many problems this means for films moving forward. George Clooney also weighed in, saying; 'We cannot be told we can't see something by Kim Jong-un, of all f***ing people.' Party guy: The film also depicts Kim Jong-un as a party animal and ladies man . Regal, AMC, Cinemark, Cineplex and Carmike, who between them operate more than half of the country's 40,000 cinemas, had announced last Wednesday that they wouldn't be showing the movie. Sony had previously told exhibitors that the company understood if they pulled the film in light of the threats. The film will be carried in selected independent theaters around the country for one week starting on Thursday.","A mocking photo of Kim Jong-un in a full face of make-up is sweeping social media in the wake of the recent Sony hack .

"The world is facing a sixth 'great extinction' with 41 per cent of amphibians set to be wiped off the face of Earth, according to a new study. The research also claims just over a quarter of all mammal species and 13 per cent of birds could go the same way as the dodo as a result of human activities. And this could happen by 2200 if species continue to disappear at their current rate, researchers claim. The world is facing a sixth 'great extinction' with 41 per cent of amphibians set to be wiped off the face of Earth, according to a new study. The research also claims just over a quarter of all mammal species and 13 per cent of birds could go the same way as the dodo as a result of human activities . Many creatures are currently critically endangered including the Magellanic penguin, the Sumatran elephant and the Amur leopard – but more familiar animals could soon be added to that list. This is according to an analysis carried out by scientific journal, Nature, which blames the loss of habitat from man-made activities as a key reason behind the change. 'In general, the state of biodiversity is worsening, in many cases significantly,' said Derek Tittensor, a marine ecologist with the United Nations Environment Programme's World Conservation Monitoring Centre in Cambridge. He added that habitat destruction, pollution and over-fishing either kills off wild creatures and plants or leaves them badly weakened. The additional threat of worsening climate change will become more and more pronounced and could then kill off these survivors, he said. Many creatures are currently critically endangered including the Magellanic penguin (pictured), the Sumatran elephant and the Amur leopard – but more familiar animals could soon be added to that list . . Pictured is a Sumatran orangutan twenty-four year old female, named Ratna, playing with her female baby, named Global. The Sumatran oranguatan are critically endangered . Gaps in scientists' understanding about the Earth's biodiversity, according to Nature, is increasing the problem. For instance, the study found that at least 993 insects are threatened with extinction, but only 0.5 per cent of roughly 1 million known species have so far been studied. It claims that most of the unknown groups of endangered species inhabit small regions of the world, often in habitats that are rapidly being destroyed. Conservation policies could slow extinctions, but current trends suggest the extinction rate is still between 0.01 per cent to 0.7 per cent of all existing species each year. And the effects of climate change may make matters worse, accelerating extinctions in unknown ways, the editorial warns. In July, a separate analysis published in Science, also found that a 'sixth mass extinction' is underway. It said that while previous extinctions have been driven by natural planetary transformations or catastrophic asteroid strikes, the current die-off can be associated to human activity. Meteor impacts contributed to wiping out species during mass extinction events on Earth . Ordovician-Silurian mass extinction - 443.4 million years ago . This was the third largest extinction in Earth's history, and had two peaks of dying separated by hundreds of thousands of years. Around 26 per cent of all marine families were wiped out and 60 per cent of all genera - an estimated 82-88 per cent of all species. Late Devonian mass extinction - 375-359 million years ago . Three quarters of all species on Earth died out in the Late Devonian mass extinction, though it may have been a series of extinctions over several million years. Around 22 per cent of all marine families, and 57 per cent of all genera were wiped out - an estimated 79-87 per cent of all species. Permian mass extinction - 252 million years ago . The Permian mass extinction has been nicknamed The Great Dying, since an incredible 96 per cent of species died out. All life on Earth today is descended from the 4 per cent of species that survived. Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction - 201 million years ago . There were two or three phases of extinction that made up the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. 22 per cent of all marine families and 53 per cent of all genera - an estimated 76-84 per cent of all species. Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction - 66 million years ago . The Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction was the event that wiped out the dinosaurs. However, many other organisms perished including 16 per cent of all marine families and 47 per cent of all genera - an estimated 71-81 per cent of all species. Since 1500, more than 320 terrestrial vertebrates have become extinct. Populations of the remaining species show a 25 per cent average decline in abundance, and the situation is similarly dire for invertebrate animal life. Human population has doubled in the past 35 years; in the same period, the number of invertebrate animals – such as beetles, butterflies, spiders and worms – has decreased by 45 per cent. As with larger animals, the loss is driven primarily by loss of habitat and global climate disruption, and could have trickle-up effects in our everyday lives. For instance, insects pollinate roughly 75 per cent of the world's food crops, an estimated 10 per cent of the economic value of the world's food supply. A recent study by Brown University has also found that humans are causing species to die off as much as 1,000 times faster than they did 60 million years ago, according to a new US study.

Scroll down for video . Stepping down: Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, pictured, is stepping down after six years in office . Conflict: Brewer has spent the last few years locked in legal battles with the Obama administration mainly over provisions in her state's strict immigration bill, SB1070 . Finger pointing: Brewer was famously caught on camera wagging her finger in the president's face on an airport tarmac . The Arizona governor has spent the last few years locked in legal battles with the Obama administration mainly over provisions in her state's strict immigration bill, SB1070. But the federal courts have rejected many provisions in the bill as unconstitutional. This week, a federal court went against Brewer's efforts to deny driver's licenses to young undocumented immigrants known as 'dreamers,' according to Fox News. During her time in office, Brewer worked tirelessly to shore up the Arizona-Mexico border, but called it one of her biggest disappointments that she hadn't been able to do more.

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has conceded that misfiring forward Mario Balotelli doesn't fit into the style of the Reds' current tactical system. The 24-year-old has scored just two goals in all competitions since joining from AC Milan for £16million in August, and Rodgers' latest admission throws the Italian's future into further doubt. His Liverpool career hasn't been short of controversy so far, having already served a one-match ban imposed by the Football Association for a social media post which was deemed offensive. Mario Balotelli has failed to impress for Liverpool since joining from AC Milan in the summer . The 24-year-old took part in a training session on Wednesday ahead of his side's Boxing Day game at Burnley . Ahead of his side's Boxing Day game at Burnley, Rodgers said: 'I think we've seen that it's not really his game (the 3-4-3 system). 'Having worked with Mario during the time he's been here, we've seen that he's a player who is better in and around the box, so that level of intensity and pressing isn't a part of his game. 'But you try to get the best out of the players that you have, and the qualities that they have, so that's something that we'll focus on.

"Brendan Rodgers has revealed Liverpool will look to lay a new pitch at Anfield in the summer. The Liverpool boss, who has been disappointed with the playing surface at Anfield since taking over the reins at the Merseyside outfit, believes the pitch is hampering his side's style of play.

'It is nothing to do with the ground staff at the club or at Melwood, who are outstanding, it is just because the pitch is old. We will do the best on it until the end of the season.' Away from Anfield's playing surface, Rodgers insists he had not lost faith in Simon Mignolet as he backed the Belgian to return a better goalkeeper from his spell out of the side. Liverpool's manager took the decision to remove Mignolet from his starting line-up for an 'indefinite' period ahead of the trip to Manchester United earlier this month after his performance levels dipped. Brad Jones has taken over between the posts and Liverpool would certainly be in the market to add a goalkeeper in January if the right option became available. They have been linked with Petr Cech once more but Rodgers would not comment on his plans for the impending transfer window. What Rodgers was eager to stress, though, was the fact Mignolet has not been frozen out and he expects the spell on the sidelines to enable the 26-year-old to regather his focus and be sharp once he decides the time is right to bring him back in.

His training has been really good. That time coming out of the team can do you good. We have been looking at the areas that he can improve. 'Sometimes that little period out can help. Brad is in the team at the moment. The one thing that impresses me is he is consistent all the way through. You need your No 2 to be loyal. He comes in and does his work religiously. 'He is a wonderful professional so when he comes in he does his work really well. Simon has been very impressive in how he has responded. I haven't lost any belief in him.

When asked how he will look back on 2014, Rodgers said: 'We had a wonderful end to the season, we got better and better and exceeded expectations as we nearly won the league. The summer was busy and we lost a top player. 'The opening to this season has been less than impressive but there have been reasons. Our performance level is starting to return. We now want to finish the year with a number of wins so we can go on and attack the second half of the season. 'We are at our best when our game is aggressive.

"Alan Gross, the contractor freed . last week after five years in a Cuban jail, will receive $3.2million from the US government as part of a compensation package, it was announced yesterday. Gross was arrested in Cuba in 2009 and sentenced to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology and trying to establish clandestine Internet service for Cuban Jews. Yesterday the US Agency for International Development (USAID) claimed it had reached the settlement with his former employer DAI - which said it was 'delighted to have Alan home and pleased to have this legal matter settled'. Scroll down for video . Payout: Alan Gross, the contractor freed last week after five years in a Cuban jail, will receive $3.2million from the US government as part of a compensation package . Gross (left, shown with wife Judy) was physically robust and 100 pounds heavier before he was sent to a Cuban prison in 2009 . 'Our understanding is that the money will go to Alan Gross as part of an agreement between the two parties,' the USAID spokesman said. The money would be paid in the next few days, he added. Gross, 65, a foreign aid subcontractor, was delivering electronics to Jewish groups when he was arrested in Havana in December 2009. The United States says Gross was merely helping Cubans get connected as part of a democracy-building project. Initially accused of espionage, he was put on trial by Havana in 2011 and convicted of committing 'acts against the independence and territorial integrity' of Cuba. Gross met with Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin on the tarmac after he arrived in the United States . He was released in a series of surprise moves last week that saw the United States announce that it would end 50 years of estrangement and normalize relations with Cuba. Gross arrived in Washington on a US military aircraft last Wednesday, accompanied by several US politicians. The $3.2million payout came as a settlement of a larger contractual claim for $7 million filed by DAI against USAID for expenses related to the arrest and incarceration of Gross.

Cuban strongman Raul Castro, seen July 26 in a military memorial ceremony, negotiated a three-for-one package with Barack Obama that saw his country's most celebrated American captives set free . The settlement was finalized on Monday. 'The settlement avoids the cost, delay and risks of further proceedings, and does not constitute an admission of liability by either party,' USAID said in a statement. At the time of his arrest, Gross was allegedly in possession of an electronic chip that prevents the location of satellite telephone calls to be traced. A specialist in satellite communications, he visited Cuba several times, delivering computer and satellite gear to the island nation's small Jewish community. FREED: (left to right) Gerardo Hernandez, Antonio Guerrero and Ramon Labañino are three Cuban spies set to be released by President Barack Obama in exchange for the return of prisoner Alan Gross. Hernandez was given two life sentences for conspiring to shoot down airplanes flown  by American civilians . Gross and his wife Judy filed a $60 million lawsuit in . November 2012 for gross negligence against DAI and the U.S. government. He settled with DAI for undisclosed terms in May . 2013, and a US district court rejected his claim against the . government, which was upheld last month on appeal. A lawyer for Gross declined to discuss the settlement but . added that it was planning to seek a review by the Supreme Court . of its case against the U.S. government. Gross was employed by Bethesda, Maryland-based DAI as part of a USAID financed project. Gross speaks during a news conference at his lawyer's office in DC where he said he has learned the lesson during five years in Cuban captivity that freedom is not free . Cars drive past an 'End to Injustice!' banner featuring five Cuban prisoners held in US custody, two of whom were previously released, in Havana December 17 . Gross was a longtime supporter of Jewish causes and a career development consultant who traveled the world on private contracts before taking his Cuba assignment. He had only once previously visited Cuba and spoke very limited Spanish. Gross worked for Maryland-based Development Alternatives Inc (DAI), which had a $6 million deal with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to promote democracy and support political dissidents. Gross signed two contracts with DAI paying him a total of $590,000 to deliver telecommunications equipment over 20 months. During five trips to Cuba in 2009, Gross imported banned satellite communications devices and other high-tech gear in his luggage and helped install it at Jewish centers in Havana, Santiago and Camaguey. Cuban officials arrested him in his hotel room on Dec. 3, 2009, just before he had planned to return home. Gross sued DAI and the U.S. government for $60 million, saying he was inadequately informed of the dangers and illegality of his mission. He settled with DAI for an undisclosed sum and a judge threw out his suit against the United States, a decision upheld on appeal. While incarcerated, Gross morphed from a gadget geek to an embittered critic of the U.S. and Cuban governments. He lost 100 pounds from his original 254 pounds. His spirits dimmed after his mother died of cancer in June, and he stopped seeing doctors, his wife, or officials of the U.S. interests section shortly thereafter. The day before his release, Barack Obama and Cuban strongman Raul Castro spoke on the phone for 45 minutes to cement what became a prisoner swap. It was the first such contact between the countries' heads of state since the middle of the 20th century. 'I was very insistent with him that we would continue to promote democracy and human rights and speak out forcefully on behalf of the freedom of the people of Cuba,' Obama told ABC News in a post-announcement interview that aired Wednesday night. During a 15-minute television address hours earlier, he pledged to 'end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests, and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,' 'Todos somos Americanos,' Obama said – 'We are all Americans' – emphasizing his wish that Cuba should be mainstreamed among its North and South American neighbors. The historic breakthrough in U.S.-Cuban relations began in spring 2013, when President Barack Obama authorized secret talks with Havana, the same tactic he used to open nuclear negotiations with Iran. Months of talks in Canada and at the Vatican, involving one of Obama's closest aides, culminated on Tuesday when Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro spoke by phone for nearly an hour and gave final assent to steps that could end a half-century of enmity and reshape Western Hemisphere relations. Talks in Canada and at the Vatican culminated on Tuesday when Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro spoke by phone for nearly an hour and gave final assent to steps that could end a half-century of enmity . Obama believed that 'if there is any U.S. foreign policy that has passed its expiration date, it is the U.S.-Cuba policy,' said a senior Obama administration official, briefing reporters on condition of anonymity. The Vatican played a key role in the rapprochement, including facilitating talks on the release of Alan Gross, a former subcontractor for the U.S. Agency for International Development who returned from Cuba on Wednesday after five years' imprisonment, U.S. officials said. In early summer 2014, Pope Francis - who is from Argentina - sent separate personal letters to Obama and Castro, urging them to exchange captives and improve relations. When the pope received the U.S. president in Vatican City in late March, the secret Cubatalks were a central topic of discussion. Cuba 'got as much attention as anything else,' the official said. The first face-to-face talks that eventually led to this week's deal took place in June 2013 in Canada, which has long maintained relations with Cuba. Leading the U.S. delegation were Ben Rhodes, a close Obama aide who is a deputy national security adviser, and Ricardo Zuniga, the top Latin American specialist on the White House's National Security Council. The names of the Cuban participants in the talks could not immediately be learned. U.S. and Cuban prisoners were a major point of debate, the officials said. For the Obama administration, Gross' continued imprisonment was both a practical and political barrier to improved ties. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone four times this summer with Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez about Gross, a second senior U.S. official said. Kerry told the Cubans that if anything happened to Gross, there would never be better relations between Washington and Havana, this official said.","Contractor was freed last week after spending five years in a Cuban prison .

"The oldest ever traces of olive oil have been unearthed of shards of ancient pottery in Israel. Archaeologists unearthed the 8,000-year-old fragments at Ein Zippori, an Early Bronze Age town in the Lower Galilee. Analysis of the pots revealed traces of the plant oil remarkably similar to modern versions, researchers said. Ianir Milevski and Nimrod Getzov of the Israel Antiquities Authority sampled the vessels to reveal what was stored in them and how they were used by the site’s ancient inhabitants. Ancient vessel: Archaeologists unearthed the 8,000-year-old fragments (pictured) at Ein Zippori in the  Galilee . ‘Although it is impossible to say for sure, this might be an olive species that was domesticated and joined grain and legumes – the other kinds of field crops that we know were grown then. ‘Those crops are known from at least 2,000 years prior to the settlement at Ein Zippori. With the adoption of olive oil the basic Mediterranean diet was complete. ‘From ancient times to the present, the Mediterranean economy has been based on high quality olive oil, grain and must, the three crops frequently mentioned in the Bible,' they said in a statement. The society using the oil was pre-Jewish and practiced a pagan religion revolving around the worship of fertility. The shards were found on the site Ein Zippori, an Early Bronze Age settlement in the Lower Galilee . Window into the past: The society using the oil was pre-Jewish and practiced a religion revolving around the worship of fertility, experts said . Olive oil has a very long history of religious symbolism. An enormous number of references to olive oil can be found in the religious writings of Judaism, Christianity and Islam as well as in the sacred texts of Ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome. The olive tree has long been understood as a symbol of  life, renewal, resilience, and peace. The oil symbolises purity, protection, health and light. ‘We have no writing during that period so we know little about them. We do not know what language they spoke but we assume it was an early Semitic language, from which Babylonian and Akkadian evolved and later also Hebrew and Arabic,’ Milevski said. On the same site archaeologists found stone palettes with engravings of female figures with animals around them, reported The Times of Israel. They also found bones from the limbs of large animals engraved with images of eyes, trees and triangles symbolizing the female sex. Of the 20 pottery vessels sampled, two were found to be particularly ancient, dating to approximately 5,800 BCE. Researchers said the findings (pictured) went hand in hand with recent finds at Kfar Samir, a 7,700-year-old site now underwater off the coast of Haifa, where the oldest evidence of olive oil production was discovered . The researchers said the findings went hand in hand with recent finds at Kfar Samir, a 7,700-year-old site now underwater off the coast of Haifa, where the oldest evidence of olive oil production was discovered. ‘Now at Zippori, evidence has been found for the first time of the use of olive oil. Together with the Kfar Samir discovery, this is the earliest evidence of olive oil production in the country, and possibly the entire Levant (the Mediterranean basin),’ researchers added. It is not known whether the oil was used as a food or as lighting or both. The findings were published in the Israel Journal of Plant Sciences.","Archaeologists unearthed the fragments at Ein Zippori in the Lower Galilee .

"Move over Mario Balotelli. The Premier League has a new bad boy. Eljero Elia completed a loan move to Southampton from Werder Bremen on Tuesday, but in Germany they are simply glad to see the back of him. Despite his obvious talent, the Dutch winger has disappointed in his two spells as a Bundesliga player. Like Liverpool's controversial frontman Balotelli, Elia is more accustomed to grabbing headlines for his misdemeanours off the pitch, rather than his achievements on it. The winger first came to the Bundesliga when he joined Hamburg in 2009. After two years of failing to live up to expectations, the Dutchman left the club in 2011 under a cloud of controversy. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Eljero Elia amazing skills and fantastic goals Werder Breman . Southampton have confirmed the loan signing of Werder Bremen winger Eljero Elia . The former Hamburg midfielder has made 28 appearances for Holland . 2011 - Before his move to Juventus, Elia was fined by Hamburg for complaining that the club hadn't looked after him following an ankle operation. 2013 - Caught speeding at 3am alongside now Stoke midfielder Marko Arnautovic. It was alleged that the pair had insulted and acted agressivley towards the police officer. 2014 - Tweets 'Ready for War' ahead of Werder Bremen vs Hamburg clash before insulting a fan of his own team via Facebook. He complained that the team's style didn't suit him, and that the club had not looked after him during an ankle operation. Hamburg fined him for his complaints, and Elia stormed off to Juventus. One disappointing year later, he was back in the north of Germany, signing for Hamburg's arch rivals Werder Bremen. The club shelled out £4.5m for the player and put him on a £2m salary. Elia was billed as “the man who will shoot Bremen back into Europe”. Instead, the club have spent two and a half seasons loitering around the relegation zone, and Elia has shown the worst side of his character in a host of off the field scandals. In April 2013, the Dutchman was caught speeding at 3am alongside then team-mate Marko Arnautovic. It was later alleged that the two players had acted aggressively when stopped, and had insulted a police officer. Elia (left) will join the club on January 3 with a view to a permanent transfer next summer . Mario Balotelli has scored just one Premier League goal since joining Liverpool . As punishment, the two players were made to train in isolation for the rest of the season. It was the final straw at Bremen for Arnautovic, who left for Stoke City that summer. Elia stayed, however, though there was little change in his behaviour. This month alone, the 27-year-old has been at the centre of two social media scandals. Before the derby game against Hamburg, Elia tweeted the words “Ready for War”, a phrase which doesn't go down too well in Germany. He later insulted a Bremen fan on Facebook, telling them to “go f*** yourself”. On the pitch, too, Elia has repeatedly failed to live up to expectations, with only four goals in 66 appearances for Bremen. The Italian midfielder has become known for being a difficult character to handle off the pitch . New coach Viktor Skripnik accused the player of arrogance, saying that 'It would be nice to see a bit more effort from him. He needs to realise that his job is about more than just annoying his team mates.' A flop on the pitch, a perpetual irritation off it, Bremen were desperate to get rid of Elia. 'He is a good player, but he hasn't really performed for us. When a player with this kind of contract isn't even in the squad, you have to think about moving him on', said Director of Sport Rouven Schroder. Perhaps wary of his reputation, Southampton declined to buy Elia straight away, but the Saints do will have that option in the summer. Whether they act on it will depend on Ronald Koeman. If the Dutch manager can realise his compatriot's potential, credit to him. If not, St. Mary's may spend the next six months plagued by the poor man's Balotelli. Southampton boss Ronald Koeman could have his work cut out when Elia arrives at the club .","Eljero Elia will join Southampton from Werder Bremen in January .

"A Honduran-born woman is sheltering in a church with her two US citizen children  in a bid to avoid deportation. Angela Navarro, who has been living in Philadelphia for the past ten years, gave up her house and moved into a church seeking sanctuary from federal authorities. Mrs Navarro arrived in the United States as a 17-year-old but failed to secure permission to remain in the country and was issued with a deportation order. Scroll down for video . Angela Navarro, pictured, arrived in the United States back in 2003 as a 17-year-old girl from Honduras . Mrs Navarro's parents were allowed to stay in the U.S. after their Honduran home was destroyed in a storm . Mrs Navarro has remained in the West Kensington Ministry church in Philadelphia, pictured, with her U.S. citizen husband and two children while campaigners plead with authorities to allow her remain . Her parents arrived in the country in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch in 2003 and were granted permission to stay. Mrs Navarro remained in the U.S. illegally, but got married to a U.S. citizen and had two children who were both born in the United States. Speaking on Christmas Eve, Mrs Navarro said: 'The hardest part has been leaving my life behind — leaving my house, my job, the inability to do normal family things, like going out for a walk or going shopping.' The 28-year-old mother of two hopes that immigration authorities will not enter a church to forcibly evict her from the country. On November 18, Mrs Navarro, her husband and two children moved into a multi purpose room at the church in West Kensington, Philadelphia. Mrs Navarro's U.S. born children Angela, left and Arturo, right, have to share a room in the church's annex . Ms Navarro's two children Arturo, left, and Angela, right, continue to go to school despite living in a church . Since moving into the church in November, Mrs Navarro has been unable to leave out of fear of deportation . It is believed there are approximately a dozen illegal immigrants currently staying in churches across the nation in the belief that they are safe from deportation. The West Kensington Ministry is led by Adan Mairena, who is a member of the Sanctuary 2014 coalition, who provide support for illegal immigrants in fear of federal authorities. He said: 'It's a way for us to act out our faith.' Since last summer, three immigrants in sanctuary have won government reprieves and two have left their churches because they felt safe, coalition spokesman Sidney Traynham said. Four besides Mrs Navarro remain in refuge in churches in Denver, Phoenix and Tucson, Arizona. Attorney Patricia Camuzzi Luber recently filed paperwork asking officials to suspend Navarro's deportation order and review her case in light of her marriage and Obama's executive actions, which could grant legal status to those who arrived in the U.S. as minors or who have American children. Officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement said their main priority, when it came to deportation, was sending home ether recently arrived immigrants or those who have felony convictions . A campaigner, left, has been working with Mrs Navarro to outline the the details of her appeal . Because Mrs Navarro's case remains unsettled, she stayed at the church last week while supporters rallied outside Philadelphia's office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 'Her mother made a tearful plea, and Mr Mariana presented officials with a stack of petitions supporting her mom's request to stay, including a letter from U.S. Representative Bob Brady, a Democrat who represents part of the city. ICE officials wouldn't meet with the group but released a statement saying their agency 'remains focused on smart and effective immigration enforcement that prioritises the removal of convicted criminals and recent border entrants.' Mrs Navarro doesn't fall under either category. Mrs Navarro's children continue to attend school, and her husband still works as a truck driver, but she won't leave the West Kensington property while continuing her campaign  with the help of the local New Sanctuary Movement. Posters outlining her to-do list cover the doors to her makeshift bedroom, which looks more like a glorified closet. A portable wall in the main area separates the kids' sleeping area from the crowded living room. Meals are prepared in the church's kitchen, where food and appliances are tagged with notes labeled 'Angela's stuff.' Volunteers built a full bathroom before the family moved in.","Angela Navarro left Honduras aged just 17 to move to the United States .

"While they have helped thousands find both long-term love and short term flings, dating apps have created almost as many problems as they have solved. From a constant barrage of seedy messages (and pictures) from shady characters, to meeting up with people who clearly took their picture when New Kids On The Block were still in the charts, navigating your way through the world of dating apps can leave you feeling rather sour. But a new app, created by two women, promises to put an end to these dating woes by putting women in control of the dating scene. Two Cambridge graduates have invented a dating app called Antidate that makes women invisible until THEY decide to make a move. They can also use the app to locate a hot man geographically . Antidate allows women to remain anonymous, entirely unseen by the men in their vicinity until they choose to contact them. Women can look at the profiles of men near their location and decide who is their type while staying completely invisible. This means they can avoid both creeps and wasting time talking to people who you will never 'click' with. The woman can then initiate contact by either 'tapping' a man, or start messaging him, at which point he can see her profile and location. As well as being linked to a person's Instagram account, members on Antidate must also submit a time-stamped verified profile picture to ensure that people actually look similar to how they present themselves. Avoiding time-wasting is also a big selling point of Antidate, as messages are deleted after just 24 hours. As well as being linked to a person's Instagram account, members on Antidate must also submit a time-stamped verified profile picture to ensure that people actually look similar to how they present themselves . Avoiding time-wasting is also a big selling point of Antidate, as messages are deleted after just 24 hours. The app is the brainchild of Cambridge graduates Hatty Kingsley-Miller, 33, and Mo Saha,34, who first met at senior school in south London. Speaking to FEMAIL, Hatty said: 'We were single when we started work on the app - it was before Tinder and so online dating was really big on places like match.com. 'We really thought at the time that online dating could be a more fun experience for people than it was, we wanted to do something that was less of a pain. 'I think anyone who has dabbled in online dating has experienced the dates where you meet them and they look at least four years older than their photo.' The app is the brainchild of Cambridge graduates Hatty Kingsley-Miller, 33, and Mo Saha,34, who first met at senior school in south London . She continued: 'You know from the split second that you meet them at the tube station if they are a no or a yes, so with with this app we were trying to replicate meeting in a bar instead - with the minimum invested time beforehand that now always comes with messaging for weeks.' Mo added that the anonymity feature is also a huge plus for both women and men. She said: 'We imported one of the key features from Grindr that shows where people on the app are in London. Except only the women can see the men. 'So, if a girl can see there are loads of hot guys in Soho, then they can go and meet them there. 'It's bringing it back to the basics again.'","Hatty Kingsley-Miller, 33, and Mo Saha, 34, invented a dating app .

Oyston's words drew condemnation from a number of organisations and many Blackpool fans, who have set up a petition demanding the chairman step down and leave the club along with his father Owen, who owns the club. The petition, launched on change.org, was set up on Christmas Eve morning at around 10am. Within four hours, 1,000 people had signed the petition, which called on Oyston to 'step down from any position of influence in Blackpool FC immediately'. The text in the petition says Oyston's comments make him 'unsuitable to hold a position of influence within our famous community football club.'' Blackpool president Valeri Belokon is unhappy with the running of the club and called for Oyston to resign . Oyston's father Owen bought the club in 1987. His son has been chairman since 2000. Club president Valeri Belokon owns a 20 per cent stake in the club. On Tuesday the Latvian called on the Oystons to relinquish their ownership of the club in light of the latest controversy surrounding the family's reign at Bloomfield Road. Belokon told BBC Radio 5 Live he was 'in shock' at the nature of the messages, which he said were 'unacceptable'. He said he would be interested in taking over the club, but only if the Oystons were removed. Smith has given his backing to Belokon. 'I 100 per cent support Valeri,' Smith said . 'I met Valeri in March to talk about the future of the club as I thought it was going in the wrong direction. 'He was a real gent. He talked about how he thought the football club should be run - as a community asset, there for the people, fully transparent... he said there would be no closed doors, and that's why I support him.' Blackpool remain rooted to the bottom of the Championship and lost 6-1 to Bournemouth last Saturday . Even though Blackpool were promoted to the Barclays Premier League in 2010, Oyston has endured a rocky relationship with many of the club's supporters. They now sit bottom of the Sky Bet Championship and last weekend they lost 6-1 to Bournemouth. 'I think the Blackpool fans will be more elated if Oyston goes than they were when Blackpool got promoted to the Premier League,' Smith added. 'That's the depth of bad feeling towards him in the town.' In October, fans staged a walkout in protest against Oyston's ownership and fans are likely to voice their dissent during the club's next home game against Rotherham on December 28. 'A few more people might turn up for the next home game,' Smith said. 'It will put more money in his pocket but given what has happened, the feeling is fans actually want to go to the game to express their anger and I think that's what's going to happen.' Oyston said in his text row with Smith that he would ban the Blackpool supporter, but he intends to go to the game. 'I haven't had any confirmation off him whether I am banned or not so I think I might try my luck and see what happens,' he said. Blackpool failed to respond to requests for a comment on Wednesday.","Blackpool fans have called for chairman Karl Oyston to resign .

"The vast majority of the 6.4 million Americans enrolled in Obamacare coverage for 2015 through Healthcare.gov never clicked a mouse or made a phone call this year: They were re-enrolled on autopilot. Only 1.9 million signed up on their own, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said Tuesday. Yet even with this help in capturing customers – including reluctant ones – the Obama administration is far behind what Congress' independent bean-counters estimated it would need in order to keep the Affordable Care Act financially afloat. HHSSecretary Sylvia Burwell spoke at Florida International University College of Law in Miami, shown in a file photo. Obamacare signup numbers she revealed Tuesday are below Congressional Budget Office projections . Shorter Obamacare lines this year: Fewer Americans are signing up for the first time – an expected development – and most of the renewals are being processed without Americans' explicit say-son . The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected the overall number, including people who sign up through state-level marketplaces, at 13 million by the end of the open enrollment period ending February 15. Big states like California and New York could boost the total, but a DailyMail.com analysis based on population figures indicates that the nationwide total at year's end will be less than 8.3 million. New York, for instance, had enrolled fewer than 84,000 new customers as of Dec. 20. The administration will release a full 50-state report next week, Burwell said. 'We still have a lot of work to do,' she told reporters. 'But this is an encouraging start.' Another HHS official in November told The Hill, an inside-the-beltway newspaper, that the agency's numbers will catch up eventually, but at a slower pace than Congress expected. 'We think the evidence points to a longer ramp-up rate than the CBO projections had, and that is based on what we've learned over the last year from looking at our own data,' the source said then. But the longer-term outlook could get worse before it gets better: CBO's numbers call for 25 million enrollees by 2018, a number that HHS hasn't said how it can hit. Worse, CBO says that by then 12 million Americans will have lost their pre-Obamacare medical insurance plans because of the law's strict minimum standards that have made countless policies illegal. The administration also faces trouble as costs increase for consumers. An HHS official told DailyMail.com that the agency is bracing for a wave of cancellations in January when many of those who are auto-enrolled see the price tags on their 2015 insurance policies. The federal government has anticipated this for months but is powerless to change the situation until at least 2016. That's when, HHS hopes, a new rule will go into effect allowing states with their own insurance exchanges to unilaterally change people's coverage levels in order to prevent a mass 'rate shock' that could send Americans streaming toward Obamacare's exits in favor of paying comparatively modest fines. The Obama administration's Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) wants to have that level of control for itself a year later. 'We are considering alternative options for re-enrollment, under which consumers who take no action might be defaulted into a lower cost plan rather than their current plan,' a November CMS fact sheet on the rule changes reads. 'We are considering allowing states to pursue these sorts of re-enrollment alternatives for coverage in 2016. The [federal government's marketplace] is exploring such an approach for coverage in 2017.' SILVER LINING: Few websitge snafus have marred this year's Affordable Care Act implementation, but with a user base far smaller than the 2013 audience, HHS's web servers have fewer numbers to crunch . Another problem, warns Elizabeth Carpenter, director of the consulting firm Avalere Health, is that the government isn't equipped to re-estimate insurance subsidy levels as quickly as rates go up. 'Those receiving federal premium subsidies may need to switch plans in 2015 to avoid paying more than the limits established by the [Affordable Care Act],' she said in June, 'and the impact will be more profound for lower-income consumers.' Meanwhile, HHS has revised its enrollment estimates downward. The agency's expectations, lowered in November, now call for only between 9 million and 9.9 million signups for coverage through the end of 2015. At current rates the total will likely crest 9.2 million by the mid-February deadline, but is unlikely to approach CBO's magic number of 13 million. That target is important because when the office 'scored' the Affordable Care Act in 2009 it laid out targets that were calculated to keep enough money in the system to prevent financial shortfalls that would likely be offset by new tax increases or syrocketing premiums that Americans can't afford. Avalere projects that the administration will fall short, with no more than 10.5 million customers next year, according toThe Daily Caller.","Just 1.9 million have signed up this year so far .
Most renewals are on autopilot, creating the risk of 'rate shock' when re-upped Americans get their bills in January .
HHS's solution is a plan that  would allow the agency to change consumers' coverage levels without their permission .
DailyMail.com projects that fewer than 8.3 million Americans will be signed up by the mid-February deadline .
That would miss HHS's own 9 million to 9.9 million estimate and fall well short of the Congressional Budget Office's 13 million number ."
"Click here to read Martin Samuel's match report from the Etihad Stadium . Louis van Gaal defended Marouane Fellaini after the United midfielder appeared to spit at Sergio Aguero during the Manchester derby. In a typically heated clash between two of English football's most bitter rivals, Fellaini became irate with Manchester City striker Aguero in an incident towards the end of the first half. The Argentine tumbled to the floor after the Belgian kicked his standing leg and the hosts appealed for a penalty, which was not given.

Click here for all the stats, heat maps and Sergio Aguero's goal graphic from the Etihad Stadium in our Match Zone. Fellaini clearly did not feel it was a foul and he bent down to shout at his rival as he lay face down on the floor. Some spit appeared to exit the Belgian's mouth as he unleashed his tirade at Aguero, but Van Gaal insists it was not intentional and seemed to suggest Fellaini was not that type of player. 'The TV has shown that he is shouting and sometimes when you shout there's a little bit of saliva (that comes out) with it,' the United boss said. Fellaini appears to spit at City defender Pablo Zabaleta during the derby at Old Trafford in March . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini said he was not aware of the alleged spitting incident after the game . Marouane Fellaini was also accused of spitting at Manchester City defender Pablo Zabaleta during the derby at Old Trafford in March. The Belgian elbowed his opponent and appeared to spit at the grounded Argentine following the clash, for which he was cautioned by Michael Oliver - who was also the referee on Sunday. Fellaini protested his innocence and the FA eventually decided to take no action. 'I don't think that he's a spitting figure.' Van Gaal's opposite number Manuel Pellegrini said he was not aware of the incident. Fellaini was involved in a similar incident in March's Manchester derby when he appeared to spit at the grounded Pablo Zabaleta after elbowing the City defender. The referee on that occasion was Oliver. Fellaini played poorly at the Etihad Stadium, missing a good chance to snatch a point for United in the second half when he shouldered the ball wide when attempting a header. Aguero, on the other hand, impressed throughout and scored the winning goal in the 63rd minute when he converted Gael Clichy's cross. The FA will wait to see if Oliver mentions the incident in his report before deciding whether to take any action against Fellaini. If the alleged spit was not seen by the referee or any of his assistants, the FA video review panel could take disciplinary action against the Belgian if they think it was a deliberate act. In March, they eventually chose to take no action. United defender Chris Smalling (right) blocks the kick of Joe Hart to pick up his first of his two bookings in the game .

Referee: Michael Oliver 4 . *Match ratings by Laurie Whitwell at the Etihad . Van Gaal, however, was less than impressed with Chris Smalling, who he branded 'stupid' for his sending off in the Manchester derby and said the defender had apologised to team-mates. Smalling lunged in on James Milner to pick up a second yellow card from referee Michael Oliver two minutes before half time, having been cautioned earlier for blocking Joe Hart's kick. It greatly undermined his team's task at the Etihad Stadium with the score 0-0 and City eventually scored through Aguero to condemn United to a third defeat of the season. 'In a derby you have to be careful - the second yellow card is a stupid yellow card,' said Van Gaal. 'The first I didn't see but as player with a yellow card you have to deal with that. 'You cannot do what he has done with the second yellow card. That's not very smart. He said (sorry) and is very humble. You can only accept it. Nevertheless it is, in my opinion, not so smart.' 'As a player you have to control your aggression. I said that to the players.' Pellegrini, on the other hand, was happy to see his team end their three-match winless run. 'I am very pleased with the performance. It is always important to win a derby, especially against this Manchester United team which is a great team with great players,' Pellegrini said. 'We played really well all the match except the last 10 minutes with less intensity but I am really happy about the result.' Pellegrini's only gripe was with referee Oliver, who waved away several penalty shouts. The most plausible appeal came in first half injury time when Rojo kicked Toure as he was about to shoot from 10 yards following a masterful chip by Aguero. 'It is unbelievable we didn't get a penalty (for the foul) against Yaya Toure,' Pellegrini added. 'It was not only a penalty but also a sending off because was the last man. 'There were two others against Sergio but we are not talking about that.' The result will strengthen the argument of those who say City are now the best team in Manchester. This was their fourth successive win against United. The last time that happened was 44 years ago. Pellegrini's men now trail leaders Chelsea by six points.

"Last week, it was easy picking for Sky Sports showing Manchester United live. Seven days ago, all they really needed was to point a camera at Jose Mourinho and let the Chelsea manager deliver the telly gold. This week, however, it was more about the bigger picture. They had an entire city to cover. This they did by laying it on thick and heavy with the match they dubbed ‘The Derby’. Now there will be plenty of you thinking, well hold on, what’s all that about with the ‘The’? A derby, yes. A good derby, again yes. Almost certainly one of the great ones, even? But ‘The’? VIDEO Scroll down to watch Noel Gallagher vs Gary Neville . Gary Neville sits down for a chat with Oasis legend and Manchester City fan Noel Gallagher (left) Regardless of where it is in the derby pecking order, the big point really was with this game, is that it was the two Manchester teams carrying a bit of baggage with them at the moment. So local rivalries aside, it was a big Premier League game for the pair of them. Nevertheless, there were plenty enough of these games in the past that did ignite and remind us what a derby match is all about. Or as Andy Cole put it when discussing the belter he was involved in 1996, it was all about ‘three points, and bragging rights’. From here, you may have thought a few old stagers once again locking horns might have been the ideal set up for a traditional tie like this one. But Sky Sports decided not to travel too far down memory lane. They couldn’t have got more contemporary, for example, than they were with one of the ‘mini derbies’ they arranged prior to kick off. New United hero Angel di Maria was sat down alongside his fellow Argentine and City favourite Pablo Zabaleta to set the match up. And via subtitles, the midfielder was nicely on point when he told us ‘all derbies are clasicos’. Gallagher was happy to remind Neville of City's famous 6-1 win against United at Old Trafford in 2011 . Angel di Maria (right) was sat down alongside his fellow Argentine Pablo Zabaleta (left)  to set the match up . While in excellent English, the right back from the blue half was somewhat more mischievous when he said the two were ‘not going to be friends on the pitch’, before nodding at his mate and adding, ‘he’s not understanding what I’m saying. Don’t say nothing to him’. But the highlight of Sky Sports production for this game was the other head-to-head they had arranged. This one, between their pundit, and former United right back, and the man behind one of Manchester’s most successful exports, Oasis. Noel Gallagher and Gary Neville locking horns and swapping snipes was a real treat. Sat together at a much too empty counter in a rather too fancy bar for my personal tastes, they popped away at each other like the couple of hardcore fans they clearly are. Gallagher was the man with the most to say. Happy to remind Neville of ‘the sheer comedy of Dzeko not knowing the score’ when City put six past United. That Rooney’s overhead was good but ‘he did shin it’. And that he hates the ‘hypocrisy’ of United, especially most recently after they sacked David Moyes and suddenly it’s ‘raining tenners’. 'All about one love,' claims Gallagher as Neville brandishes the musician's latest album cover . But Sky’s man was not to be outdone. Turned out he was just biding his time to get his digs in. When Noel told him Oasis had once had a meeting about the band investing in City, Gary chuckled ‘that would have brought some stability to football!’. He then brandished the sleeve of a new Gallagher CD ‘In the heat of the Moment’ - half red, half blue - and asked incredulously ‘you signed that off?’. ‘All about one love’ was the musician’s awkward reply. But it was all in good humour, and most entertaining in the process, too. What’s more, you were not left wondering if Gallagher might actually be one of those modern day ‘prawn sandwich’ supporters. ‘I learned how to sing on the Kippax’ he remembered fondly. Although there may have been a whiff of the posh nosh when he also happily proclaimed ‘I haven’t paid to get in for years’. Well we all would if we could, wouldn’t we? So Sky Sports certainly delivered their all-star moment to get their match coverage going. Although I do wish there had perhaps been a red button alternative to it. I’d love to have seen the ‘other brothers’ in action, too. Liam and Phil, down the local, with Phil trying to ask serious questions, while Liam threw cheese and onion crisps at his head. Andrew Flintoff saved a James Corden penalty during a half-time shootout at the Etihad . A little idea for the return derby at Old Trafford in April, perhaps? You can have that one on me, telly people. But hold on, you might be saying? What about the action on the pitch? Quite right, too. How could I forget that penalty save! What a blinder that was from Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff at half time. All those years in the slips clearly paid off. Although his opposite number from A League of their Own, Jamie Redknapp, was far from impressed. ‘He keeps telling me he’s a Preston fan’, said Jamie. ‘Now he’s kissing the City badge’. Very Gallagher brother, I’m sure! Jamie Redknapp was surprised to see alleged Preston fan Flintoff grab the Manchester City badge .","Sky Sports ramp up Manchester derby with big name interviews .

"Wayne Rooney has claimed that Manchester United are 'heading in the right direction' despite Sunday's derby defeat ensuring Louis van Gaal has presided over the club's worst start to a season since 1986. United have just 13 points after 10 Barclays Premier League games under the Dutchman, despite spending more than £150million on stars including Angel di Maria, Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo, who all played in the 1-0 derby defeat against Manchester City on Sunday. But captain Rooney remains positive about his side's progress under their new boss and insisted the poor form is a result of adjusting to the Dutchman’s managerial methods. England's skipper also said it is only a matter of time before the new-look United shifts into top gear. Sergio Aguero (left) celebrates the winning goal in the Manchester derby while Angel di Maria (right) looks on . ‘We're working on different things, which a lot of us haven't been used to,’ Rooney told MUTV. ‘We're certainly heading in the right direction. ‘We're progressing each week and playing some nice football. We need to turn that into results and I'm sure we can do that if we keep working, keep learning and keep doing what the manager wants from us.’ Rooney also joined Van Gaal in criticising Chris Smalling for his red card in the derby, admitting the defender’s sending-off cost his side the game.

"Championship side Brighton have sacked their head of football operations David Burke just days after manager Sami Hyypia quit. Hyypia's resignation was accepted by the struggling Championship club on Monday, sparking a search for a new boss ahead of Christmas. Chairman Tony Bloom has flown back into the country from Australia with a view to holding a interviews after Christmas and appointing a new boss as quickly as possible. Brighton have sacked head of football operations David Burke following three years at the club . Tim Sherwood, Uwe Rosler and MK Dons manager Karl Robinson are among those in the frame to take over. Bloom is understood to want a new manager in place before the FA Cup third round tie against Brentford on January 3. Burke's dismissal suggests that the board see this season's problems to be about recruitment rather than coaching. Speaking to www.seagulls.co.uk, Bloom underlined the reasons for Burke's departure saying: 'David's been with us for three years, and I would like to thank him for all his hard work and endeavour on behalf of the club during that time. Sami Hyypia resigned as manager of Brighton & Hove Albion on Monday following a poor start to the season . Games: 25 (including League Cup) Wins: 6 . Draws: 9 . Losses: 10 . Win %: 24 . 'There is no question he has done an exceptional job in helping with the design of the American Express Elite Football Performance Centre and in putting in place a first-class infrastructure in the football, academy and sports science areas of the club. 'David's work in helping to establish the club's first-ever academy and to quickly gain category one status in the new world of the EPPP guidelines is highly appreciated by myself and by everyone at the club.

"He is the self-proclaimed 'pick-up coach' who has been banned from the UK, Australia and Singapore after being accused of promoting sexual assault - admitting he is the 'most hated man in the world'. Julien Blanc's techniques include telling women to save him the effort and spike their own drinks, prompting the Australian Government to kick him out and the British to tell him he was unwelcome. Part of the 26-year-old’s technique has been to create an air of mystery, with extremely little known about his background. But a MailOnline investigation can disclose that Blanc is in fact from a small, suburban Swiss town called Lully, where his parents still live and remain proud of him. At the family home in the Swiss canton of Vaud - best known for its wine production - Julien's mother Lauren, who is American and originally hails from Seattle, broke her silence and said: 'I want to say that we are very supportive of him. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Julien Blanc has been kicked out of Australia and banned from the UK. He's a Swiss native, living in the U.S. where he has dual nationality as his mother is originally from Seattle, Washington State . Supportive: Lauren Blanc (left) says she and her husband Theirry (right) are behind their son after he was caught up the headlines . Artist: This is believed to be Marielle Blanc, Julien Blanc's younger sister, an emerging artist . 'We are supportive of Julien and I feel that the journalists around the world have not done their job, up until now they have never bothered to look into what his work really is. 'But that's a mother's personal opinion.' Last month, Blanc, 26,was banned from the UK for allegedly encouraging violence against women. He was similarly banned from Australia and Singapore after footage emerged of him using racist language and grabbing women by the throat. Working as an 'executive coach' for a company called Real Social Dynamics as an 'international leader in dating advice', Julien claims to teach men to seduce women and make them 'beg' for sex. Critics say his methods, such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends, are abusive and controlling. Blanc has successfully been running $1,800-a-head seminars across the globe despite his own admission he is the 'most hated man in the world'. One post from his Twitter account, now made private, said: 'Dear girls, could you please save me the effort and roofie [spike] your own drink? #JustKidding.' In November, he was due to run a seminar in Britain, but more than 136,000 people signed a petition for him to be refused a visa and Home Office ministers were forced to intervene. At the time, Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone said: 'Julien Blanc's presence in the UK could have led to an increase in sexual violence and harassment. I am delighted that Mr Blanc won't be coming to our shores.' For a man who has caused such uproar, however, Blanc has had a very modest upbringing. He was born on October 24, 1988, in Morges, Switzerland, to parents Lauren and Thierry Blanc, who married in Washington state in August 1986. Two years later, in October 1990, the couple welcomed daughter Marielle. Geek: Julien Blanc makes no secret of his bad history with women - posting pictures of himself on his website as a teenager .

Scandal: Blanc extols chat up methods such as threatening to commit suicide and isolating women from friends . Lauren's American nationality explains how Blanc, who is believed to live in Los Angeles, has been able to live and work in the U.S. with such ease. Mrs Blanc, 56, works for her local town hall, while in July 2011, her husband was understood to have been given the prestigious job of Director General of Health in Geneva. The couple have a quiet life and are members of their local choir. Growing up, Blanc was a pupil at Beausobre College in Morges. A fellow student Léonore Porchet was stunned to see her former schoolmate hit the headlines, writing on Facebook that she was 'extremely shocked' by his antics, saying: 'The behavior of this bloke is unacceptable and constitutes a very serious attack on women's physical and moral integrity. Modest: A map of Lully, the small Swiss town where Julien Blanc grew up and his parents still live . She added: 'Former classmates, yes, it is indeed Julien Blanc, who we used to hang out with on the school benches. Yes, stalkers and dangerous men can be the 'guy next door.' And she added: 'Don't hesitate to warn people about the different sides of his character.' Despite his friends' shock and his parents more sedate life, he's not the only member of the family to court controversy. His sister Marielle is making a name for her slightly risque art. Pictures of blow up dolls feature in her work, and in January, Marielle posted a video of performance art in Lausanne, Switzerland, called Sois belle et tais-toi!” (Be beautiful and shut up). She wrote: 'This was an artistic performance in a public square in the centre of Lausanne, Switzerland. For two hours, I stood on a pedestal with my lips drawn stapled shut. My friends interviewed passers-by for their opinion of that quote.' Quiet life: The Blancs, Lauren and Thierry, both ringed, are members of their local choir in Lully . Modest: The Blancs' home in the town of Lully, in the Swiss Canton of Vaud . Sources now say Marielle is in Canada studying at University for her Masters. Since his ban from the UK last month, Blanc has not been seen in public. When asked if Julien would be spending Christmas with his family at their semi-detached home, his mother said: 'I do not know. I really do not know.' Mr Blanc, 56, declined to speak about his son. However, his wife said he is handling the fallout of his travel bans, saying: 'Julien is dealing with it on his own.' And she made it clear that her son has gone to ground saying: 'You'll find his email on the internet but he will not respond.' On Blanc's website, he admits: 'I wasn’t a popular kid' and posts pictures of himself as a somewhat geeky teen. Travelling: Julien Blanc left his parents' home in Lully to move to the U.S. and travel the globe teaching his dating tricks . Student: Julien Blanc was a pupil at Beausobre College in Morges, Switzerland. A fellow pupil who studied with him expressed shock after he hit the headlines. But he says his life turned around after he read The Game by Neil Strauss, the 'bible of pickup'. He went on to train with RSD co-founder and dating coach Tyler Durden - real name Owen Cook - for two years. Cook named himself after Brad Pitt's character in the movie Fight Club after adopting an outrageous and cavalier persona. Blanc now boasts: 'Since then, I’ve traveled the world teaching literally THOUSANDS of clients.' He says he teaches men 'how to pick up the hottest women, in the hardest venues, and the results have been nothing short of phenomenal for my students.' His website says men can 'shortcircuit' a woman's 'logical mind' to get her into bed. He also reposted a chart used by support groups to identify signs of domestic abuse with the words: 'May as well be a checklist. #HowToMakeHerStay.' On his website he says people taught by him can 'make girls BEG to sleep with you after short-circuiting their emotional and logical mind into a million reasons why they should'. In action: Julien Blanc during a seminar for his company, Real Social Dynamics . Posing: Julien Blanc with Brit comic Russell Brand . It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'. But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them. A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him urging men in the audience not to bother being 'polite' to Japanese women - but instead 'grab girls and shove their head' into their 'crotch.' In the wake of his UK ban, Blanc issued an apology, telling CNN's Chris Cuomo: 'I just want to apologise to anyone I’ve offended in any way. This was never my intention and I just want to put it out there. 'I’m extremely sorry. Like, I feel horrible. I’m not going to be happy to feel like I’m the most hated man in the world. I’m overwhelmed by the way people are responding.' His critics were largely unimpressed with the apology.' Peaceful: Julien Blanc originally comes from Lully in Switzerland . Workplace: Julien Blanc's mother, Lauren Blanc, works at the Lully town council . But Jennnifer Li, who led an online campaign against Blanc under the hashtag #takedownjulienblanc, told BuzzFeed that Blanc’s apology was 'full of s**t'. 'He is sorry he got caught, not for what he has done,' Li said. When Cuomo challenged Blanc, noting his materials and seminars have explicitly taught men to use potentially abusive or racist tactics to attract women, Blanc added: 'My intentions were never bad,” Blanc said. He said his materials have been taken 'out of context' and that a photo of him with his hand around a woman’s throat was a 'horrible attempt at humor'. Asked about Blanc’s antics, his U.S. relatives firmly declined to comment. And whether he decides to come out of hiding for a family Christmas in Switzerland remains to be seen.","Blanc, 26, hails from the quiet town of Lully in Switzerland where his parents Lauren and Thierry still live .

"They were mocked as 'jackasses' for revealing how they had been 'exiled' from the United States - to Italy's most exclusive resort. Now the Chilean-born New York socialites refused re-entry to the US, after being accused of 'enslaving' their Chilean nanny, have broken their silence to Dailymail.com - to say that it is 'heart-breaking' spending Christmas in Portofino. Malu Custer Edwards and her husband Micky Hurley were formally cleared of trafficking their child-minder to the US and forcing her to work in slave-like conditions. But during a family sailing holiday around the Mediterranean, their visas were rescinded- and the family have been stuck in Portofino on the Italian Riviera ever since. Now as they face Christmas away from their Upper East Side home and an ongoing legal tussle, mother-of-four Malu has told Mail Online of her despair after being denied entry to the country where she grew up. Stranded: Socialites Malu Custer Edwards, 29, left, and Micky Hurley, 35, right,  are not allowed to return to New York from Italy despite being cleared of abusing their nanny . 'Distress': The couple and their four children are stuck in Portofino, north Italy . The 30-year-old said it was 'heart-breaking' for the couple to tell the children they weren't going to get home for the holidays. She said: 'My eldest son asked for no presents for Christmas. Instead he made a card saying all he wanted for Christmas was to go back to New York, as a family.' The couple's elder children Rex, Malu and Olympia, have now missed the first semester of the school year and the Hurleys have been forced to enroll them in an Italian school 'to distract them' and 'give them some normality in their lives'. Malu, who was born in Chile into a prominent family, grew up in New York until, at the age of 19, she fell pregnant with Rex and moved with Micky to her native country. But after she gained a place at the prestigious Parsons School of Design in 2011 the family relocated to the Manhattan's Upper East Side. Micky and the three elder children had permission to live there because of Malu's student visa while their youngest was born in the States and is a US citizen. The family were accompanied by a nanny, Felicitas del Carmen Villanueva Garcia, whom they had hired through an agency in Chile. But with three months she had left. Two years later she accused the couple of taking her passport, locking her in their apartment, not giving her enough food while they dined out at Manhattan's trendiest restaurants and allowing their children to beat her. The Hurleys denied the charges but were ordered to pay around $6,000 in backpay. In the surrounding publicity a series of unpleasant emails between Micky and a photographer who had worked with him emerged, creating the impression of an over-privileged snob. In one email Micky allegedly tormented his former collaborator with the fact that he was the great-grandson of a seamstress. 'If you were reborn a million times your grandmother would never be a Baroness like mine.' Hurley claims his grandmother was born an aristocrat in Ireland, although his exact lineage is unclear. 'Abuse': Custer Edwards claims the pair have been receiving hate mail in the wake of the dismissed lawsuit . But Malu insists their home life in New York was 'very simple' and says she and her husband divided the chores and had no any help around the house after the nanny left. This summer as the case dragged on and with the stress of proving their innocence weighing on them the couple accepted an invitation to stay on a friend's boat sailing along the French and Italian coast. Since Malu hadn't left the US for two years, their visas had expired, but she believed renewing them was a formality and she claims she had all the paper work in order. The lawsuit was not yet resolved but as it was a civil suit it shouldn't have had any bearing on the decision, Malu says. But when she went to pick up the passports the first thing they did was stamp them with denials as she looked on in horror. On a peninsula in the Ligurian Sea, Portofino is Italy's most exclusive and glamorous resort. It is where Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton romanced in the 1961 as she took a break from filming Cleopatra, and its main hotel, the Splendido, offers stunning views, lavish fine dining and the chance to bump into A-list guests. The resort itself has hosted everyone from Winston Churchill to Rihanna, drawn by its scenery and climate. Christmas is low season but it compares favorably to New York for climate. Today it is mostly sunny and 50F - compared to a rainy Manhattan where the temperature is 39F . The officials would not explain the problem but gave her a code that corresponded to the stated reason for refusal. It was only afterwards that she discovered the visa was refused on grounds of the 'human trafficking' claims made against her by the nanny. She remembered: 'I was in a complete state of shock. I lived in the US from the age of one until I was 19. Never could I have imagined that this would happen. 'It was horrible. I felt like I had been judged without having been found guilty.' She said it 'broke her heart' to tell the family. 'One more way the lawsuit ruined our lives.' Things went from bad to worse. Within 24 hours of the decision her husband was hospitalized and operated on for a collapsed lung. Malu describes this time as 'the most difficult experience of our lives'. But after two weeks Micky was allowed to go 'home', which was by then, a friend's house, a former chapel near Portofino. And on December 9 they were officially cleared of all charges brought by the nanny. 'We cried tears of joy and relief' she said. However it will be impossible to forget the 'suffering we went through because of all the lies,' she said. But the ramifications of the lawsuit that 'ruined our lives' are still with them as they have not so far been granted permission for a reconsideration of their immigration ban. 'All those false allegations were deemed baseless and thrown out of court...it was all a lie, but the repercussions of this lawsuit seem endless,' she said. With Christmas here it is particularly tough. 'The children miss their friends, their toys, belongings.' The Hurleys will be having a 'simple' family Christmas she said. 'We will give the children their gifts, we will go to mass in family. We will continue to pray that this wrong be righted. Friends and family cannot believe the injustice, she said. 'It makes no sense to anyone looking from the outside in. Well, it doesn't make sense to us either and we are living it.' 'We want to leave all this nightmare behind us, and get back to NY, where we have a right to be, adding, 'Our bags are packed. We are ready to go.'","Micky Hurley, 37, and Malu Custer Edwards, 30, were accused of abusing Chilean nanny and locking her in their Upper East Side apartment .

"Brendan Rodgers insists sentiment has no bearing on his determination to see Steven Gerrard be given a contract extension. Liverpool’s captain, who is out of contract next June, raised the prospect that he could play somewhere else next season, after he revealed in an interview with Sportsmail last week that he had yet to be offered a new deal and has no plans to retire. That statement pricked the ears of several managers, notably Manchester City’s Manuel Pellegrini, who admitted he would certainly consider a move for the 34-year-old, as he believes Gerrard has the quality to ‘continue at a high level for a couple more years’. Steven Gerrard's Liverpool contract expires at the end of the season and he insists he will not retire . The Reds captain was in action on Saturday as Liverpool went down 1-0 to Newcastle United at St James' Park . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (right), standing on the touchline looking on with Newcastle United boss Alan Pardew, insists a new contract for Gerrard would have 'nothing to do with sentiment' and he would deserve it . Mario Balotelli (right) used to play for Manchester City, a side who Steven Gerrard has been linked to . Newcastle (4-2-3-1): Krul 7; Janmaat 7.5, Taylor 7, Coloccini 7, Dummett 7; Abeid 7.5, Colback 7; Obertan 6 (Aarons 26mins, 7), Sissoko 8, Ameobi 6 (Cabella 66, 7); Cisse 6 (Perez 46, 7). Subs not used: Elliott, Gouffran, Haidara, Taylor. Booked: Janmaat, Taylor, Colback, Sissoko. Scorer: Perez 73.

Subs not used: Jones, Toure, Lambert, Manquillo, Lallana, Can, Borini. Booked: Skrtel, Lovren, Henderson. Man of the match: Moussa Sissoko. Referee: Andre Marriner 7. Crucially, though, so does Rodgers and he explained that his motives for wanting to keep Gerrard as the heart of his team have got nothing to do with the fact he has been at the club all his life or because he has a strong relationship with him. Rodgers has held initial discussions with Gerrard’s representatives and has recommended to Fenway Sports Group, the club’s American owners, that his terms be renewed. Liverpool hope to have the matter concluded swiftly once formal talks begin. ‘It is certainly not sentimental,’ said Rodgers. ‘As the manager of this club, you can’t afford to do that. I look at his contribution since I’ve been here. I came here two-and-a-half years ago when Steven was 32, had struggled with injury and hadn’t played consistently over a number of years. 'I came in, sold him the idea and the philosophy of how we wanted to work and his importance to it. In that period, he has been outstanding. Maybe the team hasn’t played so well this year - and maybe there is a focus on Steven - but he’s been brilliant for me. ‘Both on and off the field, as a leader and a captain, and I want to ensure that on this second curve we’re on, in terms of the development of this group, he is very much a part of that. So there is certainly no sentiment involved in it. Pellegrini believes that the Liverpool captain can play on at the top for at least two more years . Ayoze Perez shows a poacher's instinct to prod past Simon Mignolet to punish Alberto Moreno's (right) mistake . Mario Balotelli (xentre) was once again a peripheral figure, with £16m man flattering to deceive on Tyneside . Ayoze Perez’s strike for Newcastle United in the 1-0 win over Liverpool ensured this game’s ability to keep producing goals continues. These clubs have not shared a 0-0 draw since February 1974. ‘When you see some of his passes and his influence in the changing room, he is still an outstanding player. He is the perfect example for a lot of our players to learn from.’ Gerrard was the only Liverpool player who looked capable of making anything happen at St James’ Park on Saturday.] . Too many of his colleagues failed to impose themselves on a drab contest from which Newcastle managed to chisel a 1-0 win thanks to Ayoze Perez’s goal. Newcastle celebrate after Ayoze's goal inflicted Liverpool's fourth Premier League defeat  in ten games . Champions League holders Real Madrid eased to a 4-0 victory at Granada on Saturday, with Cristiano Ronaldo incredibly scoring his 22nd goal of the season. It was the Galacticos’ 11th straight win ahead of Tuesday’s clash against Liverpool. Liverpool’s form has been wretched and since the start of September, they have floundered in the Premier League, winning just two of their seven assignments. On Tuesday they face a huge task in Madrid against Champions League holders Real. A showdown with Chelsea at Anfield then awaits next Saturday and with no momentum behind them, few will give Liverpool a chance of taking anything from either assignment. Rodgers, though, is refusing to grumble. ‘It is why we worked so hard,’ said Rodgers. ‘We wanted to be involved in this type of game, (against Real Madrid), because it means we’ve been successful. ‘This result wasn’t what we wanted and we have to work to rectify it.’ Remy Cabella hops on Ayoze's back in front of the adoring fans as Newcastle take the lead on Saturday .

Big rollout: The Interview (above) will now be released on YouTube starting Wednesday afternoon . Early release: The film will be online a full day before it is set to be released on video on demand and play in selected theaters such as the Plaza Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia (above) CNN reports that previous negotiations with Apple's iTunes store fell apart. It will also be released on Microsoft X Box, www.seetheinterview.com and HD on Google Play, costing $5.99 to rent and $14.99 to purchase. In a statement, Google revealed that Sony first contacted them about a possible online release last Wednesday, the same day they announced they would not be distributing the film. This following a threat of terrorism that forced major movie chains across the country to announce that they would not be showing the film as scheduled for fear of legal repercussions should the group behind the threats follow through on their claims. The refusal of these theaters to show The Interview is no doubt what opened the door to the possibility of an online release, as the studio did not have to worry about the push by many theater owners to stop the practice of same-day-and-date release. The studio's CEO Michael Lynton seemed determined for the film to get an online release earlier in the week, and across as many platforms as possible. While announcing on Tuesday that the film would be getting a limited theatrical run and be available on video on demand, Lynton also said; 'We are continuing our efforts to secure more platforms and more theaters so that this movie reaches the largest possible audience.' The film's release across a variety of viewing platforms will no doubt be followed closely by many in Hollywood, as the industry has never had a film of this magnitude open online, on demand and in theaters simultaneously. That being said, Sony revealed on Wednesday that they would not be releasing any of the film's online viewership or sales numbers to the public.","The Interview is now set to be released on YouTube beginning Wednesday .

"Juan Mata says Manchester United need to be more disciplined if they are to challenge in the Premier League this season. Louis van Gaal's side fell to their third league defeat of the season at Manchester City on Sunday after defender Chris Smalling was sent off. The manager branded Smalling 'stupid' after he collected a soft booking for needlessly blocking a clearance by City goalkeeper Joe Hart after 31 minutes of the derby and the defender was shown a second yellow by Michael Oliver eight minutes later for a lunge at James Milner. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Louis van Gaal slam 'stupid' Chris Smalling after red card . Juan Mata has called on Manchester United to show more discipline following their derby defeat to City . Chris Smalling is shown a red card by referee Michael Oliver in the 39th minute at the Etihad Stadium . Smalling received a second yellow card for this lunge on City's James Milner . Smalling is the third United player to see red this season after Tyler Blackett was dismissed at Leicester and Wayne Rooney went in the home match with West Ham. Mata, who was an unused substitute in the match, wrote on his blog: 'Playing away against City is always challenging because they have a big offensive potential, as it was shown, but having one player sent off in the first half just makes things more complicated. 'This is the fifth [it is actually third] time this season that one of us gets a red card, so unfortunately we already know what it means to have one player less. 'But even if Aguero scored and we were just 10, our team showed pride and almost tied the game, although this time it was not possible. 'To be honest, right now, rather than looking at the table we have to focus on our path in order to improve and to win games.' The defender had been booked minutes earlier for charging down a Joe Hart goal kick . Sergio Aguero won the contest for City on 63 minutes with his 12th goal of the season . United manager Louis van Gaal described Smalling's dismissal as 'stupid' Mata added that the defeat was 'hard to accept' and that the 'whole team is very upset.' The defeat, United's fourth in succession against their rivals, leaves them 10th in the table with their lowest points return since 1986, the year Alex Ferguson took over. Mata added: 'Obviously this situation is not what we wanted, but in this moment the team must stick together and keep on going. I'm sure we will do it.' In addition to the three reds, United have also racked up 19 yellow cards in their Premier League games so far. They face Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday in their next match.

"Olivia Dein, nine, has one wish this Christmas - she just wants to get better . With Christmas Day fast approaching, children across the world are eagerly waiting to see if Santa Claus received their wish lists. From their favourite Frozen character, to a scooter or a bike, bright parcels adorn the bottom of Christmas trees waiting to be ripped open on the big morning. But for one nine-year-old from north London, her Christmas wish is  simple. Olivia Dein has written asking Father Christmas to make her better. She was diagnosed with the life-limiting condition cystic fibrosis when she was just five weeks old. Now she and her family face the agonising reality that half of sufferers don't live past their young years. Her mother Sara Dein, 36, told MailOnline: 'Within 24 hours of Olivia being born we knew something was wrong. 'She failed to pass meconium as all newborns should, so she was immediately referred for tests. 'She was eventually diagnosed with cystic fibrosis at five weeks old. ‘As a family, we knew nothing about Cystic Fibrosis. After her diagnosis, we discovered that both Olivia's dad and I are carriers of the gene. 'Thankfully, our younger children Jessica, five, Dylan, three, don't have the condition.' Now Olivia has written a letter to Santa Claus, outlining her wish for Christmas this year - to be well, like her brother and sister... Dear Santa, . 'My name is Olivia and I’m nine years old. I live in London with my mum and dad and my younger brother and sister. 'I do lots of sports and I really love netball. I’ve got a new netball post in my garden, and I enjoy playing with it. 'Lots of children ask you for toys. But, this Christmas, I wanted to write to you about something else. 'I’m different from other children. That’s because I have cystic fibrosis (CF). 'I’m so lucky to have so many toys and lovely things, but being healthier, coughing less and not having to take so many medicines would mean so much more to me this Christmas. The nine-year-old, from north London, was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was five weeks old . Instead of asking for toys this Christmas, Olivia has written to Santa Claus asking that he make her well . Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting genetic condition. Only half of those diagnosed with the illness live to celebrate their 40th birthday. It causes the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, to become clogged with thick sticky mucus, resulting in chronic infections and inflammation of the lungs. Cystic fibrosis directly affects around 10,000 people in the UK. The faulty gene is carried by over two million people in the UK, most of whom have no idea. If two carriers have children, there’s a one in four chance their child will have the condition, which slowly destroys the lungs and digestive system. People with cystic fibrosis often look perfectly healthy. But it poses a lifelong challenge involving daily intake of drugs, time-consuming physiotherapy and isolation from others with the condition. It places a huge burden on those around them and the condition can critically escalate at any moment. Olivia and her family have been supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, which is in its 50th year. The charity aims to fundraise for better treatments and investment into cutting edge research so that people with cystic fibrosis can also look forward to their fiftieth birthdays. To donate to the charity or to find out more about the condition, visit their website here. ‘Recently, I found out that I can die from having CF. 'It made me feel so scared. If I could have anything this Christmas? I’d like to be well. 'Life for me is a bit like a rollercoaster – my health is up and down. 'There are so many simple things that I’d like to do that I can’t. ‘I’m not allowed to go into public indoor swimming pools. 'When I was five years old and my school friends started swimming lessons, I wasn’t allowed to join in. I was so upset. 'I’ve never swum with my friends in a public swimming pool or played in the water at school because of the infections that I could catch, and that makes me sad. 'I have to be careful around people who have coughs. If I get a cold it can damage my lungs. So if my friends or family are ill they can’t come to my house. It can be lonely sometimes. 'At the end of last term, when I was eight, I was getting more and more worried about not being able to do things. 'I was worried that I’d never be able to go to sleepovers and parties at my friends’ houses because I’d have to do physiotherapy instead. 'I was scared what people would think about me having to take lots of pills and not being able to join in all the activities. I felt like I was different. I felt embarrassed. 'My feelings were all mixed up. I felt angry and sad. 'Mum and dad even bought me a punch bag to take my frustrations out on. 'I also started going to a talking doctor who helped me understand my feelings and my anger. Then, before the summer holidays, I decided that I wanted to tell more people at school about CF. She said: 'Recently, I found out that many CF sufferers don’t make it past their 40th birthdays. It made me feel so scared. If I could have anything this Christmas? I’d like to be well' Cystic fibrosis affects every part of Olivia's life, she tells Santa Claus she can't go swimming with her friends and has to be careful to avoid anyone with a cough. She just wants to be like her little brother Dylan, three, and sister Jessica, five, pictured left . Olivia's mother, Sara Dein said her daughter faces strict treatment regimes that often result in her being admitted to hospital . 'I wanted to do this because it was stressing me out that they didn’t know anything about my condition. 'My mum and dad had spoken to my teachers, but my class and other pupils didn’t really know about CF. 'So one day, my class were all sitting together and I told them what CF is and how it makes me feel. 'I told them that I got CF because my dad has a CF gene and my mum also has a CF gene, but they didn’t both know this before I was born; when their genes made me, it gave me CF. 'I told them that you can’t catch CF; it’s something that I was born with. 'Afterwards one of my friends kept trying to help me walk, and I know she was just being nice, but I told her to stop. 'I told people not to treat me like I’m disabled otherwise I’d get upset. I want to try to be like everyone else. 'Now that my friends know it’s a big relief. It really helps. 'They treat me like I’m one of them, and I don’t need to use the punch bag as much. I still get upset sometimes but I’m coping better. What I’d really like this Christmas is to be able to meet someone else who has CF – someone older who could tell me that everything was going to be ok. 'But I’m not allowed to meet others face-to-face because we could infect each other. 'Recently, my parents arranged for me to speak to a family friend who has CF on Skype. We tried to talk, but I felt awkward and upset and scared. I hid my face. Though Olivia's parents both carry the CF gene they only passed it to their eldest child . 'All I wanted to do was meet her in person but I can never do that. It’s horrible that we can’t meet. ‘I do physiotherapy twice a day, have lots of nebulisers and inhaled medicine and swallow at least 50 pills every day. 'I have to go to the doctors a lot. When I get really poorly with a bad chest, I have tubes in my arms - intravenous antibiotics. 'I get nightmares near my birthday because that’s when I have my yearly check up – blood tests which scare me because I hate needles. 'I’m scared about what lies ahead for me but when I grow up I want to be a vet or an actress. Since I’ve told my friends about my CF I want more people to know more too so that they can understand too. 'And, despite everything, I still manage to have fun. Merry Christmas . Love, Olivia . Xx . As Olivia's letter reveals, her condition affects every part of her life. 'She has strict treatment regimens and medical routines that are lengthy and tiring,' saidher mother. 'When very poorly, she is put on intravenous medication for two weeks and potentially needs a bronchoscopy, which is an exploratory lung procedure.’ As Olivia has grown older and has become aware of her condition, her parents have had to address some difficult issues. Many sufferers require life-saving heart and lung transplants if their condition deteriorates. 'We’ve used diagrams to explain the genetics to Olivia and she now understands the medical background to her condition,' said Mrs Dein. 'We talk to her about the progress that is being made with medical trials, and the hopes for medical and scientific advancements. 'But she worries about the future and about the daily management of her condition, along with the embarrassment of explaining it to people.' Olivia added: 'I’m scared about what lies ahead for me but when I grow up I want to be a vet or an actress.

"A Chinese property developer is under investigation after local residents claimed the firm bullied them out of their homes by telling them that they would be infected with AIDS if they did not leave. Authorities in the city of Nanyang in central Henan Province are carrying out the investigation to find out whether the firm hired builders with AIDS for the purpose of intimidation. According to local media reports, the 'AIDS demolition team'  threatened local residents with infection. AIDS? According to local media there was an 'AIDS demolition team' of builders carrying out the work and intimidating residents with threats of infection . The reports, distributed through Weibo microblogging service allegedly showed pictures of threatening red graffiti on a building wall saying 'AIDS demolition team.' The crew claimed to have AIDS patients in their ranks and threatened people living in areas slated for demolition and development with the disease, according to agency Xinhua. Local residents said the bullying begun in the neighborhood in 2012, with houses being illegally cut from utilities. Ignorance: Discrimination against AIDS sufferers remains rife across China despite numerous awareness campaigns in Shanghai and other large cities . HIV/AIDS is transmitted primarily through unprotected sexual intercourse including anal and oral sex, contaminated blood transfusions, from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or hypodermic needles. HIV infection can be prevented through safe sex and needle-exchange programs. However, there is no cure or vaccine for the disease, but antiretroviral treatment can slow the disease down. The ‘AIDS demolition team’ allegedly had six members, who had papers confirming their diagnosis. But authorities  have not yet established whether the papers were authentic, as the company involved has been shut down during the investigation. In the 1990s, the Henan province faced a massive AIDS epidemic and the disease spread among local villagers, who had sold their blood for medical purposes. The blood was often collected by  clinics with unsanitary conditions which spread the disease further. There is still a great deal of ignorance about how the HIV/AIDS virus is passed on in the country.","Authorities are carrying out an investigation into the firm based in China .

"Locked up: Apollo Hernandez, 29, had his bail revoked at the request of his father on Monday . A fearful father has asked police to revoke his son's bail for an incest rape charge after the man's mother was found murdered inside her apartment. Apollo Hernandez, 29, was charged earlier this year with sexually assaulting a teenage relative in 2008 but he was released after his father posted $3,500 bail. On Saturday morning, Hernandez's mother, 48-year-old Ruth Maceira, who was a witness in his case, was found with her neck slashed in her Bushwick apartment. On Monday, Hernandez's father, Alfred Hernandez, went to Brooklyn Criminal Court and asked for his son's bail money back and for authorities to lock up his son, the New York Daily News reported. Although sources told the Daily News that Hernandez had been named as a suspect in his mother's murder, he had not yet been charged because investigators were waiting for crime scene evidence. But his father told authorities that he was fearful that his son 'can be a danger to himself or others', prosecutors said. Authorities reacted to the father's plea by using an open warrant they had for Hernandez for littering to take him back to court and hand back the bail money to his father. A source said his father saw no other option because he wanted to get help for his son. Hernandez's mother was found face-down on the floor and unresponsive in her fourth-floor apartment on Grove Street with a deep cut to her neck, authorities previously said. Crime scene: The body of his mother was found at her Brooklyn apartment, pictured center, on Saturday and he was named as a suspect but released by police, pending further evidence .

Afterwards, Hernandez was taken into police custody but refused to answer any questions, a source told the Daily News. The newspaper added that Maceira was a witness in her son's case after his alleged victim told her about the rape earlier this year.

"Former Oklahoma Sooners running back Brennan Clay has apologized for accusing his wife of having a tryst with a Dallas Cowboys player. Clay celebrated his reconciliation with his better half, Gina D'Agostini, by posting on social media a risque photo of the married couple in bed Tuesday. The saucy snapshot showing Clay lying on top of his topless wife was accompanied by the caption: 'Jumped to a conclusion that wasn't true ..can't judge a situation without knowing all the facts ..I apologize ..' Scroll down for video . Reconciled: Former Oklahoma Sooners running back Brennan Clay posted this racy photo depicting him on top of his wife, to whom he apologized for accusing her of cheating on his with a Dallas Cowboys star . Change of heart: Clay tweeted Tuesday that his accusations of infidelity against his wife and his former teammate were baseless . Earlier this month, Clay publicly accused D'Agostini of cheating on him with college teammate and Dallas Cowboys star DeMarco Murray, posting what he claims are intimate text messages between the two to Twitter. Clay's about-face regarding his wife's alleged affair came just days after the newlywed husband wrote a cryptic message on Twitter saying how everyone deserves a second chance, himself included. The former Sooners player kept mum Wednesday on what has made him change his mind about the infidelity allegations, which reportedly had been based on his wife's intimate correspondence with a man Clay publicly identified as Marco. Daily Mail has reached out to both men for comment on social media Wednesday. Clay, 22, played alongside Murray, 26, for the University of Oklahoma Sooners in the 2010 season, but announced to the world this week that his wife of just five months, Gina D'Agostini, is having an affair with Murray. Taking it a step further earlier this month, Clay revealed explicit texts he allegedly found in his wife's phone, including one about the two having sex in his own bed, according toGawker. Love triangle: Dallas Cowboys running back DeMarco Murray (right) has been accused of having an affair with Dallas fitness instructor Gina D'Agostini -- who also happens to be the wife of his former college teammate, Brennan Clay. Clay posted to Twitter explicit texts apparently exchanged between the pair . Left in the cold? Ex Oklahoma Sooners running back Brennan Clay (pictured in 2013) has publicly claimed his wife of just five months is cheating on him with Cowboys star player DeMarco Murray . Clay said the text conversation happened on October 5, once he left to go to training for the San Diego Chargers. After saying goodbye to Clay at the airport, D'Agostini appears to text Murray, saying that her 'roomate(sic)' has gone. Clay claims his wife disguised Murray's number in her phone by saving it under 'Spray Tan'. 'So I can f--- u in your bed now?' Murray allegedly wrote back. 'Is that where you want to f--- me? And yes,' D'Agonstini allegedly replied. To further prove his point, Clay also posted another screen shot of his wife's phone, showing the 'Spray Tan' number to have an area code of Las Vegas, where Murray is from. His online rant first started on Sunday, saying he found more than 50 'inappropriate' texts. 'So Demarco Murray was having an affair with my wife...I'm done...' Clay wrote  to his nearly 25,000 followers. Clay did not specify how long he believes his wife and the NFL player were together, nor did he say whether the affair has ended. However, he did offer a couple of reasons their alleged affair is so wrong. '1 has a baby momma and she has 2 kids,' he wrote. Michigan native D'Agostini does not have children with Clay. Murray has a baby with former Passions actress Heidi Mueller. Clay failed to mention what might make such an affair so painful for him, besides the obvious feeling of betrayal: he and D'Agostini have been married just five months according to a Facebook profile that appears to belong to Clay. Clay did not fail to convey how he feels about the alleged breach of trust, however. 'I'm disgusted...' Clay wrote, before heading off for some spiritual consolation.

"The sick Twitter prankster who pretended to be best friends with shooting victim Antonio Martin and watch him die got his comeuppance today after the infamous 'hactivist' group Anonymous started publishing his personal information on their several Twitter accounts. Twitter user Jesus Christo (@DesJuanTheThug), who also goes by the name Desjuan Garrett, falsely claimed in an interview with the Huffington Post that he was there when 18-year-old Antonio Martin was killed a Mobil gas station a few miles from Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday. The group Anonymous, an international network of activists and hackers, weren't pleased with Christos' blatant lies and so they published his phone number along with other personal information to their internationally recognized Twitter account boasting  over 77,000 followers, reports The Daily Dot.

'This dude @DesJuanTheThug is a joke. Using #AntonioMartin to gain followers. Here's his # btw,' they tweeted along with a phone number that appears to be his actual cell contact. Jesus Christo tweeted on his own page, 'Why yall calling me if you not going to talk when I answer?,' indicating the number does in fact belong to him.

Desjuan has openly admitted to lying to the Huffington Post and is a self-proclaimed ‘troll.’ ‘Now what did we learn? @HuffingtonPost,’ Desjuan posted today but it appears as though most readers aren't amused with his lies. Other furious Twitter users have rallied against a prankster who pretended he was best friends with latest police shooting victim Antonio Martin. Jesus Christo claimed in the interview that he was there when the 18-year-old was killed and fabricated an account of how a police officer opened fire on Martin when he refused to lie on the . Desjuan originally tweeted, 'I can't believe my best friend just died in front of me' - and the comment was retweeted more than 3,000 times. He then posted a series of tweets telling people to listen to his mixtape and add him on SoundCloud - an audio platform that allows people to promote their own music. He had earlier told The Huffington Post how he and Martin were stopped by an officer at a Mobil gas station on North Hanley Road because they matched the description of robbery suspects. He claimed the officer then searched Martin and was quoted as saying: 'The officer then stepped back and pulled his weapon and pointed at Antonio and told us to lay on the ground. 'I laid down but Antonio refused. The officer then stepped back at us with his gun still aimed at us. He told Antonio to lay down again and when Antonio didn't lay down the officer opened fire. 'And when I tried to help my friend he screamed at me to stay down with his weapon still drawn.' Latest shooting: Antonio Martin, 18, was shot at a Mobil gas station in Missouri last night - prompting violent clashes between crowds and police . Lie: His vile lie was retweeted more than 2,000 times and he even fabricated an account of last night's shooting in an interview with the Huffington Post . The Huffington Post has since released a statement confirming the account was false which read: 'A previous version of this story included an interview with a man claiming to have been at the scene of the shooting and friends with the deceased. 'As police have released statements saying the second person involved in the incident has fled the scene, the source is now suggesting he was never there.' Christo's fake account of what happened has provoked fury on social media. Scene of the shooting: Angry crowds gathered at a Mobil gas station on North Hanley Road Berkeley, near Ferguson, Missouri last night and clashed violently with police .

Christo is clearly unapologetic and has since posted: 'Tell the Huffington Post to do a better job of finding credible sources.' In another vile tweet, he boasted 'I pi**ed the whole country off' and 'I need two bad bi***es to help me grieve'.

"The tourist spacecraft that could blast passengers into space for just $95,000 and let them sit in the cockpit is nearing completion, the firm behind it has revealed. Passengers in the XCOR Lynx will be able to  view the earth from over 330,000ft above the Earth in the two seater craft. These pictures reveal the Spacecraft is entering the final stages of production - and is expected to blast off in 2016, despite fears that the tragic accident that hit rival Virgin Galactic could delay the industry as a whole. Scroll down for video . The spaceship taking shape: XCOR says it is making 'rapid progress' with its craft, which it hopes will fly in 2016 . XCOR Aerospace is based at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California. Its Lynx spacecraft, illustration pictured, seats two people - the passenger and a pilot - and tickets cost $95,000 (£57,000). This is almost two thirds the price of Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo . There are just 15 seconds between lighting the engines and take off. Then, 50 seconds after lighting the engines you go supersonic and very close to vertical and are pushed back in your seat. Three minutes after lighting the engines you are at 180,000ft. The craft travels at Mach 3 before the engines cut off and coasts to peak altitude of 350,000ft . More than 200 tickets for a trip already been sold for the spacecraft that takes off and lands vertically using its reusable rocket propulsion system. 'The XCOR Lynx suborbital spacecraft continues to make rapid progress towards final assembly,' the firm said. 'Immediately after bonding the cockpit to the fuselage the shop crews set up for the delicate and precise operation of bonding the carry-through spar on to the rear end of the Lynx fuselage. To correctly locate the spar, the Lynx rocket truss was temporarily removed from its own test stand and placed on the vehicle itself for the first time . Technicians spent several days carefully aligning the spar to ensure perfect symmetry, then began to bond it in place. 'This was our Thanksgiving present,' says XCOR composites shop manager Jeff Smith. 'We applied the final glue layers on Wednesday just before the holiday, and removed the support equipment over the weekend. We're looking forward to the next big step, integration of the wing strakes onto the Lynx.' After the spar was installed the entire structure, from front to back was load tested to the equivalent of 6G re-entry, while in the test area the cabin was pressurized to 11 PSI, the first pressure test after being bonded to the fuselage. 'The carry-through spar is the heart of the loading structure on any winged craft – it supports the primary load of the wings and carries that load through the fuselage,' says XCOR CEO Jeff Greason. 'Attaching the spar on a composite vehicle is a one-way operation, so it has to be done right the first time.' 'We're really excited to have achieved this step. It paves the way for the strakes to be attached as the next step. 'Thanks to the hard work of the composites crew, we're proceeding at a very rapid pace toward first flight.' The spacecraft is quickly taking shape at the firm's Mojave headquarters . This graphic explains what happens during the 30-minute flight. Around 50 seconds after the engines are lit, the craft goes supersonic. Around three minutes after lighting the engine, passengers reach 180,000ft. Craft travels at Mach 3 before the engines cut off and coasts to peak altitude of 350,000ft . Greason is convinced making space travel financially viable is the key to exploring the skies. He said: 'We have to go a couple of levels deeper than passion. When you look at the question of why it is so many years after we first went to space yet so little of it is being used, it's because it just costs too much. 'We have to do something to fundamentally reduce the cost before space becomes an economic good. We looked at that problem and not having a billionaire writing your cheques, it had to be a money making proposition.' Passengers will put on white space suits two hours before boarding the spacecraft and embarking on the 30- to 50-minute flight. Randy Baker, a vice president at XCOR, said things move very quickly: 'There is just 15 seconds between lighting the engines and take off. Then 50 seconds after lighting the engines you go supersonic and very close to vertical and are pushed back in your seat. Then three minutes after lighting the engines you are at 180,000ft.' Greason continued: 'You are going more or less straight up at about Mach 3. 'Then the engines cut off and you have about a minute and a half of zero gravity as you coast up to our peak altitude of 350,000ft - then another minute and a half of coasting back down until there is enough atmosphere for the vehicle to feel it.' The Lynx aircraft has four engines, pictured, as well as rocket pumps and a propulsion bay. Passengers sit in the pressure cabin. The first model will take travellers 200,000ft up but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft and it will not be too long before they are ready to reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft . He said re-entry then takes about a minute and the craft glides to land in approximately 20 minutes. The spacecraft, which will be able to fly four times a day, seats just the pilot and the passenger will be expected to get involved during the adventure. They will be asked to perform tasks, such as reading instruments and making sure dials are holding steady. 'It's your flight so if there is some particular part of the earth that you want to look at we can steer the ship to look at the Grand Canyon or the area you find of most interest,' Baker added. 'Then you have time to look around and soak up being where so few have been before.' The first model will take travellers . 200,000ft above the Earth, but the company hopes the second model will reach 300,000ft . and it will not be too long before they are ready to take to the skies . and reach maximum altitude of 350,000ft. 'We expect to be in flight tests by the end of the year, after the first tests we won't know how long until we are ready to take the first passengers but my guess is six to 18 months. The Lynx aircraft and its jet propulsion system, pictured, is still undergoing tests. XCOR claims the first public flights should launch in between six and 18 months . 'I think we will be flying participants by the end of next year but we don't like to put a date on things,' Baker said. There are also very few physical limitations, so even those in poor health may be able to travel. 'Some people cannot handle the excitement, some people are claustrophobic, so we take them in a high performance aeroplane to test if they have a psychological problem but in the broad sense, if you can on a rollercoaster, you can do this because the time you are doing it is short. 'It means people in ill health who want to do this while they still can are able to,' added Baker. XCOR Aerospace is housed in a small former Second World War Marine Corps base at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California.","XCOR Aerospace is based at the Mojave Air and Space Port in California, alongside Virgin Galactic's HQ .

"President Barack Obama will make the economic recovery a focal point of his State of the Union, touting his administration's successes, while pressuring Congress to enact the types of reforms he believes will further buoy the middle class. The Jan. 20 speech is expected to be less depressed in tone than the one he gave during the last joint session of Congress, Obama advisers who spoke to Politico indicated, and will put on a pedestal the headway the country has made in the past six years in the face of unfavorable economic winds. 'You can’t convince people that their paycheck is going farther than it was -- and you shouldn’t try. That would be a big mistake. What you can do is try to affect people’s optimism for the long term,' a senior Obama adviser told the publication. President Barack Obama is expected in his annual State of the Union address to put on a pedestal the headway the country has made in the past six years in the face of unfavorable economic winds. He is pictured here during his 2014 speech to a joint session of Congress . 'If we can make people understand that there are reasons for a bright future and the president has a plan to address what ails them, then that will be real progress,' the aide added. Early drafts of the annual speech, traditionally given at the request of Congress in late January, draw inspiration from remarks the president made a month before the midterm elections at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, speechwriters signaled. Mostly lost to memory in the wake of a distracting line about Obama policies being on the ballot in November - a statement that haunted Democrats throughout the rest of the general election - the remarks cast a rose-colored light on America's recent prosperity and the administration that oversaw the fruition of this 'new foundation.' 'Sometimes the noise clutters and I think confuses the nature of the reality out there,' Obama said. 'Here are the facts: When I took office, businesses were laying off 800,000 Americans a month. Today, our businesses are hiring 200,000 Americans a month,' he said, reminding the audience that the unemployment rate has decreased by nearly four percent since 2009. Continuing, Obama stated that 'over the past four and a half years, our businesses have created 10 million new jobs; this is the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history. 'Right now, there are more job openings than at any time since 2001. All told, the United States has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and every other advanced economy combined. 'This progress has been hard, but it has been steady and it has been real. And it’s the direct result of the American people’s drive and their determination and their resilience, and it’s also the result of sound decisions made by my administration,' he contended. Perceptions to the contrary are not based on the facts, Obama argued. 'It is indisputable that our economy is stronger today than when I took office. By every economic measure, we are better off now than we were when I took office. 'At the same time, it’s also indisputable that millions of Americans don’t yet feel enough of the benefits of a growing economy where it matters most -- and that's in their own lives,' he stated. The president acknowledged that 'it’s still harder than it should be to pay the bills and to put away some money' for many Americans. 'Even when you’re working your tail off, it’s harder than it should be to get ahead,' he said. Average American families haven't increased their take home pay in nearly two decades, he said, which 'means it’s harder for middle-class Americans to climb the ladder of success. It means that it’s harder for poor Americans to grab hold of the ladder into the middle class.' 'That’s not what America is supposed to be about. It offends the very essence of who we are,' Obama said. 'Because if being an American means anything, it means we believe that even if we’re born with nothing -- regardless of our circumstances, a last name, whether we were wealthy, whether our parents were advantaged -- no matter what our circumstances, with hard work we can change our lives, and then our kids can too.' This year's speech, scheduled for January 20, is expected to be less depressed in tone than the one he gave last year. The president will 'try to affect people’s optimism for the long term,' a senior Obama adviser said . Back in his hometown for the remarks, Obama too returned back to the message that propelled Democrats to success in the 2012 presidential election and concurring congressional elections- economic 'fairness.' 'Our economy cannot truly succeed if we’re stuck in a winner-take-all system where a shrinking few do very well while a growing many are struggling to get by,' he told the audience. 'Historically, our economic greatness rests on a simple principle: When the middle class thrives, and when people can work hard to get into the middle class, then America thrives. And when it doesn’t, America doesn't.' The president also used the economic thread to make the case for another one of his signature achievements: health care reform. 'Health care has long been the single biggest driver of America’s future deficits. It’s been the single biggest driver of our debt. Health care is now the single biggest factor driving down those deficits,' he claimed. The Affordable Care Act, Obama said, is a 'game-changer for the fourth cornerstone of this new foundation' his administration is building for America. 'America is better poised to lead and succeed in the 21st century than any other nation on Earth. We’ve got the best cards,' the president said. 'And I will not allow anyone to dismantle this foundation. Because for the first time, we can see real, tangible evidence of what the contours of the new economy will look like.' Obama is expected to bring back to the forefront of the political debate several policies his administration has long said would set America's economy on solid long-term footing, including new investments in infrastructure, research, early childhood education and clean energy technology. The president will also press Congress to take up tax reforms that prevent corporate inversions, legislation to make it easier for  first-time home buyers to obtain a loan, equal pay for equal work, paid family leave and a minimum wage increase. If the U.S. makes 'high-quality preschool available to every child, not only will we give our kids a safe place to learn and grow while their parents go to work, we’ll give them the start that they need to succeed in school, and earn higher wages, and form more stable families of their own,' Obama has said. In the State of the Union he will likely recommit to a plan to enroll 6 million children early education programs by the end of the decade. He's also anticipated to touch on higher education and the need for reforms that make it easier for graduates to pay off their student loans. Changes to the loan process will 'help a whole lot of young people breathe easier and feel freer to take the jobs they really want,' Obama told attendees of his Northwestern speech. President Obama's State of the Union address will draw its inspiration from an overlooked speech he gave at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, a month before the midterm elections . Another issue that is certain to come up in his address is immigration reform. Although the president used executive action to protect as many as 5 million illegal immigrants last month, he has continued to advocate for permanent, legislative changes to the immigration system that would provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal residents. Framing it as an economic boon, Obama has said comprehensive immigration reform will 'grow our economy, shrink our deficits, secure our borders.' Obama could also use the address to lecture Wall Street in a symbolic gesture aimed at his base. The $1.1 trillion spending bill passed by Congress and signed by the president last week that funds the federal government, with the exception of Homeland Security, through the end of fiscal year 2015 contained a provision that would weaken restrictions on Wall Street enacted in 2010 as part of Dodd-Frank. The progressive wing of the party, led by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, attempted to derail the bill over the provision, pitting the Democratic lawmakers against the White House, which came out in support of the massive appropriations legislation. In order to make nice with the caucus, Obama may take a strong stance in favor of financial reforms that aim to rein in big banks and prevent future taxpayer-funded bailouts. Republicans have resisted the Obama administrations efforts to slap new rules on businesses that they believe would hurt the job growth rather than help it such as a federal minimum wage increase and paid family leave. But the president could find a partner in the GOP, which will become the majority party in both legislative chambers next month, on less divisive issues like tax reform and other measures to rehabilitate the economy. 'If [Obama's] willing to explain that, which he says he’s for, that would be great. Because there will be plenty of Democrats saying the opposite,' Ohio Sen. Rob Portman told Politico. 'Without his help, particularly with Democrats, it will be difficult to move that agenda that he says he’s for.' In the last legislative session House Republicans say they passed more than 40 bills aimed at creating jobs and boosting the economy- almost all of which died in the Democratically controlled Senate. They plan to introduce similar legislation in the first six weeks of the year as part of their 'New American Congress' initiative. Portman said that Obama will have to walk the walk rather than just talk the talk if he wants Demoracts - and Republicans - in Congress to adopt his priority list. 'He has every right to go out and talk about his message. But he ought to spend more time up here, working with Democrats and Republicans alike on passing items that will actually help improve the wages of middle class Americans and provide more opportunity for growth in the economy,' Portman said.","The president will 'try to affect people’s optimism for the long term,' a senior Obama adviser said .

"Funnyman Adam Sandler has certainly got reason to be laughing all the way to the bank. The 48-year-old, who commands north of $15million per film, has topped a list of Hollywood’s most overpaid stars. Following a string of box-office flops, Forbes says the actor provides the least value for his huge fees. Film flop: Adam Sandler has topped a list of Hollywood’s most overpaid stars . The magazine looked at his last three movies up until June 1 2014 and compared what he was paid against what the movies made to provide a 'return on investment number'. Animated and limited release films and cameo roles were not included in the calculations. Although Sandler's latest film Grown Ups 2 was a hit, pulling in $246 million at the box office, it didn't go far enough to make up for his previous flops, Jack and Jill and That's My Boy. Overall the star’s last three films cost an estimated $229million to make, including his salary costs, but brought in just over $149million. In contrast, the world’s highest-grossing film over the past year has been Transformers: Age of Extinction Paramount Pictures, which cost $210 million to make and made more than a billion at the box office. It starred Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci. The magazine said Sandler had the lowest return on investment of any actor analyzed. Here is the list of the most overpaid actors in Hollywood according to Forbes magazine and the returns they make on every $1 paid. For every $1 he was paid, it was estimated he returned . an average of $3.20 in 2014. It is the second year Sandler has snagged the dubious honor. Johnny Depp, the star of the hugely successful Pirates of the . Caribbean films, came in second on Forbes' list, returning an average of $4.10 . for each dollar paid. This was put down to recent misses like The Lone . Ranger and Dark Shadows. Comedian Ben Stiller, whose film Night at the Museum: . Secrets of the Tomb opened in U.S. theaters earlier this month, . was number three with a $4.80 return. This was due to the 2011 action-comedy Tower Heist and 2012 sci-fi comedy The . Watch, under-performing at the box office. Green Lantern star Ryan Reynolds, whose action comedy . film R.I.P.D. was one of the biggest misses of 2013, was . fourth with $4.90 for each dollar paid, followed by dual Oscar . winner Tom Hanks, who pulled in a $5.20 return, rounding out the . top five. 'Cloud Atlas was a very expensive flop and Hanks played . six different roles in the movie,' according to Forbes.

Researchers created the incredible maps from data created by the US Geological Survey. Scroll down for an interactive version of the map . Brooklyn designer Andrew Hill created the amazing map using data created by the US Geological Survey of all 250,000 rivers running through America. The longest river on the map is the Missouri at 4088 kilometres. But the biggest in terms of water volume is the Mississippi, which is deeper. At 1114 kilometres, the Yellowstone is the longest un-dammed river in the US. It was created by Brooklyn designer Andrew Hill of data-visualisation firm Vizzuality. He used theCartoDB platform and the National Hydrography Dataset, which is made available online by the US Geological Survey, to create the map.

"More than 1,000 migrants have been saved after they attempted to cross the Mediterranean in the last 24 hours before Christmas. Five of the desperate refugees died as they attempted the deadly crossing from Africa to Europe. Italian authorities said they had rescued a total of 1,026 survivors during several missions by the country's navy in the Strait of Sicily in the last 24 hours. Scroll down for video . An Italian Navy vessel is seen packed with refugees after more than 1,000 migrants were saved from the Mediterranean in the last 24 hours. Five migrants died trying to make the dangerous journey . The narrow yet treacherous route between Libya and the Italian island of Sicily has claimed thousands of lives. One of the dead was brought onto the navy's Etna vessel by a merchant ship from Malta, while the other four were taken onto the Orione patrol boat from a Cypriot vessel. The Italian navy said Etna had rescued 363 survivors from the waters, the Orione 440 and another vessel, the Driade, saved 223 people. Italian authorities said they had rescued a total of 1,026 survivors during several missions by the country's navy in the Strait of Sicily in the last 24 hours . Five of the desperate refugees died as they attempted the deadly crossing from Africa to Europe . Earlier this month the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimated that 3,419 migrants had died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe since January 1, making it the deadliest sea route for migrants. Most of the 207,000 who attempted to seek asylum or emigrate through making the perilous crossing were from Syria or Eritrea. Many of them had left Libya bound for Italy and Malta, and were either looking for work or seeking asylum in Europe. Italy's Mare Nostrum search-and-rescue operation ended this autumn after other EU members refused to help fund it. Earlier this month the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, estimated that 3,419 migrants had died while attempting to cross the Mediterranean to reach Europe since January 1 . One of the dead was brought onto the navy's Etna vessel by a merchant ship from Malta, while the other four were taken onto the Orione patrol boat from a Cypriot vessel . The scheme was responsible for bringing some 150,000 migrants to shore in its year of operation, but critics said it encouraged migrants to risk everything to get to Europe and made the job of people smugglers easier. There were reports of traffickers steering ships into the middle of the ocean before abandoning them, leaving the passengers with just mobile or satellite phones and the contact number of the Italian coastguard, but it is not known how widespread this practice was. Italy says Mare Nostrum, which was launched after two sinkings off the island of Lampedusa in October last year, leaving more than 400 dead, was costing  nine million euros  a month. It has been replaced by an EU-run operation known as Triton whose mandate is limited to patrolling waters within 30 nautical miles of the  coastline. But organisations including Amnesty International and  UNHCR have warned this will lead to more deaths. They dispute the argument that rescue operations increase the 'pull factor' drawing migrants to Europe, and argue that the growing numbers and rising proportions of children, women and disabled people, reflect a surge in refugee numbers due to conflicts like Syria/Iraq.","Italian authorities say 1,026 people were rescued during several missions .

"Tourism in African countries not affected by Ebola is being brought to its knees because of ignorance about the geography of the continent, it has been claimed. Holiday-makers terrified by the outbreak of the deadly virus are turning their backs on the Gambia in West Africa - even though it does not border countries where thousands have died from the disease. Dr Marina Novelli, reader in the School of Sport and Service Management at the University of Brighton, said panic caused by misinformation has had a huge impact on tourism in Ebola-free countries. Tourism in African countries not affected by Ebola is being brought to its knees because of ignorance about the geography of the continent, it has been claimed . She said: 'I want to appeal to everyone to spread the word. 'This country is open for business and is not affected by the Ebola outbreak - otherwise I would not have travelled there.' Ms Novelli, who was in the country working on tourism and sport capacity building projects, said: 'It broke our hearts seeing the industry on its knees; hotels closing and staff being laid off as a result of tourists' cancellations and tour operators reducing scheduled flights. 'This is all due to ignorance about the geography of Africa and panic caused by misinformation. 'The Gambia is shielded within Senegal and both countries are Ebola-free. 'Air links with countries affected by Ebola have been suspended as they have in many other parts of the world. 'The UK Government itself has declared the Gambia to be Ebola-free, but spreading this message is proving incredibly difficult, and businesses and people here are suffering as a result.' Holiday-makers terrified by the outbreak of the deadly virus are turning their backs on the Gambia (pictured) in West Africa . Ms Novelli said tourism was about 65 per cent down since last year and charter flight arrivals as of November this year, the start of the high season, were about half what they were last year. She said: 'Some hotels have closed and those which have remained open are doing their very best to keep staff on rota, but there is uncertainty about what is going to happen in the next few months. 'Anecdotal evidence shows that every person employed in tourism usually supports between seven and 10 people, so the reality is that the impact on an economy, which relies so heavily on tourism is dramatic. The Sierra Leone government declared a five-day lockdown in the country's Northern Province today to step up efforts to contain the Ebola epidemic. 'Within this period, no shops will be opened. No market will operate. 'No unauthorised vehicles or motorcycle taxis will ply the route in or outside towns and villages except those officially assigned to Ebola-related assignments,' Alie Kamara, resident minister for the Northern Region, told AFP. 'Generally, people will rely on the support of their families but because so many people depend on tourism the intrinsic impact is difficult to measure. 'Families are already suffering hardship and businesses are at risk, and this is a tragedy that is worsening and unfolding before our eyes.' Ms Novelli said only Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia have been significantly affected by the current Ebola outbreak to date. She added: 'Ask yourself, if the Ebola virus had spread to Italy would people be frightened to travel to the nearby UK? Probably not. 'Africa is a huge continent and there is absolutely no reason not to travel to non-affected West African destinations. 'Whether you are travellers, tourists, educators or experts in aspects of development, I urge everyone to keep informed and to continue travelling to countries like The Gambia. 'The Gambian tourism industry and the Gambian people need us all.'","Travellers turning backs on the Gambia in West Africa over Ebola fears .

"Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush once knocked President Bill Clinton as being too 'preoccupied with other matters' to confront Cuba, an email from Bush's time in office that was released today reveals. In the January 1999 email, obtained and published by the Washington Post along with other correspondence from Bush's eight years in office, Florida's newly elected chief executive took a shot at embattled Clinton over his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky and suggested that the next president should be more bold with the communist country. 'Forceful diplomacy can make a difference and we have had none for the last seven years and the current President is preoccupied with other matters,' Bush said in an email to then-Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida. Jeb Bush, left, is sworn in as governor of Florida by Florida Chief Justice Major Harding, right, as Bush's wife Columba holds the Bible and their son George P., left, looks on in this Jan 5, 1999 photo, Newly released emails from Bush's first days in office show a hard-working executive who took time to answer constituent emails but was concerned that his communications might one day be released, just as they have been . All in the family: Jeb Bush is pictured here in October on his son George P. Bush's campaign bus during an interview in Abilene, Texas. At the time George was running for Commissioner of Texas's General Land Office, a position he was elected to, and Jeb was merely mulling the presidential run he is now actively exploring . At that time Jeb's older brother, George, was competing in the Republican primary for president but he had not yet beat out fellow contender and Arizona Sen. John McCain for the party's nomination. George W. Bush would go on to win the 2000 general election with the help of his brother's home state of Florida. And as predicted by Jeb, he did in fact take a harder line with Cuba than his predecessor Clinton. When it was Jeb's name on the ballot again, George came to Florida, which boasts the largest Cuban-American population in the country, and promised to veto any legislation proposing to lift the embargo on Cuba and then-President Fidel Castro's regime. Fast forward 15 years, and now it's Jeb who is in the hot seat over the United States' relationship with Cuba as he considers competing for the presidency himself next year. A day after Bush said he would 'actively explore' a bid for higher office, President Barack Obama announced a shift in U.S. policy toward Cuba and called for an end on the 53-year-embargo that restricts trade and travel with the country. Bush immediately reprimanded Obama, calling the decision to resume high-level diplomatic relations with the country a 'misstep' and 'another dramatic overreach of his executive authority.' 'It undermines America’s credibility and undermines the quest for a free and democratic Cuba,' he said in a statement posted to Facebook. 'Cuba is a dictatorship with a disastrous human rights record, and now President Obama has rewarded those dictators. We should instead be fostering efforts that will truly lead to the fair, legitimate democracy that will ultimately prevail in Cuba.' At an event hosted by the US Cuba Democracy PAC earlier in the month, before word broke of the Obama administration's secret talks with Cuban President Raul Castro, Bush argued that the embargo, which contains several loopholes, should be tightened, if anything. 'I would argue that instead of lifting the embargo we should consider strengthening it again to put pressure on the Cuban regime,' he said, providing a glimpse of his foreign policy style.

Jeb Bush after playing an early morning round at Cape Arundel Golf Club . in Maine in this July 7, 2001 photo. Jeb could be the third Bush to hold higher office in the last three decades if he wins the 2016 general election . The emails published today by the Washington Post show another side of Bush: a hard-working executive who personally responded to online correspondence directed to him but was wary of leaving behind a permanent trail of unflattering communications. In one message, dated December 1999, Bush reportedly warned aides that they may not want to have a conversation about vacation time over email it 'might make a newspaper one of these days. He went on to say, 'I suggest that you guys have a verbal conversation about it rather than create a public document. :)' In it's review of the emails spanning from 1999 to 2007 the Post says it found that Bush often responded to constituents who emailed him, including one woman who asked him for his wife's birthday. Another time Bush directed a staffer to look into a man's plea for help in a personal matter. 'What should have been a messy divorce, seems to have turned into a criminal matter; with me in the middle,' the man wrote, describing two friends' divorce. Bush couldn't resist responding facetiously to another man who emailed him to complain that 'politicians make me sick, you make me sick.' To him Bush said, 'I am truly sorry you feel that way. Have a nice day' with a smiley face at the end of the message. The set of emails, available to the public through Florida's open records act, were set to be released by Bush in the coming weeks as a show of transparency. The Post sped up the process on Wednesday and published excepts of the more meaty messages. While mostly mundane, the emails obtained and released by the Post did unearth one political liability for Bush: concerns that he isn't conservative enough. Early in his tenure Bush handled his own hate mail as his administration had not yet created a process to flag and respond to such messages. The recently elected governor passed on at least one angry email to his advisers that characterized his as 'NO CONSERVATIVE.' That was years before Bush would come out in favor of national educational standards known as Common Core and comprehensive immigration reform, two issues that conservatives have used as a cudgel against him. Since Bush affirmed his presidential aspirations, current and former aides have come to defense of his record as governor, pointing to his rejection of a high speed rail project of $2 billion in new spending during his tenure and $19 billion in tax cuts.","'Forceful diplomacy can make a difference and we have had none for the last seven years,' Bush said of then-President Bill Clinton .

"Christmas Eve is shaping up to be windy, wet and warm instead of white across much of the country, making for a travel nightmare for those heading to their holiday destinations. While parts of the South cleaned up from severe storms that killed at least four people, a system that forecasters had feared could bring several inches of snow to Illinois, including the air travel hub of Chicago, was expected to track farther east. Still, by early afternoon Wednesday, more than 280 flights had been canceled in the US, according to flight tracking service FlightAware. Chicago's O'Hare International Airport was hardest hit, accounting for 98 of the cancellations.

More than 4,300 departing and arriving flights - and counting - were facing delays Wednesday. Several inches of slushy snow was still possible in the afternoon, mainly in areas southeast of Chicago along the Indiana state line and in far western Illinois. That was similar to the forecast for Indiana, where the National Weather Service said 2-4 inches of snow could leave untreated roads and bridges slick. Holiday travelers in Ohio, Michigan and New York faced the prospect of gusty weather. A high wind warning was issued from Wednesday evening to Thursday morning for much of northern Ohio. Meteorologists warned that gusts of 65mph in western New York could blow away holiday decorations. In Michigan, utility companies braced for extremely strong gales a year after a storm put thousands of people in the dark at Christmas. The weather service said the strongest winds are expected at night and would last nearly until dawn on Christmas Day. Crews are on standby Wednesday in anticipation of gusts of 45mph or higher in the Detroit area, said DTE Energy spokeswoman Randi Berris. A light but steady rain fell Wednesday along much of the East Coast. Balmy: In the Florida panhandle, mercury climbed into the mid-80s on Christmas Eve . Springtime in December: Temperatures topped near-record 50 degrees Wednesday morning in some areas of western New York. Temperatures topped near-record 50 degrees Wednesday morning in some areas of western New York. In northern New Jersey, forecasters warned thunderstorms could boom as temperatures head toward 60. A coastal flood advisory was in effect, and fog was predicted in the northern part of the state. Still, some parts of the country were welcoming bona fide snow in time for Santa’s arrival. Five to 10 inches was forecast in mountain passes and up to 3 inches on valley floors in Nevada's Sierras. And mountainous areas of Washington expected 3 to 5 inches to fall Wednesday. Power companies struggled to restore electricity to thousands of people in Mississippi after severe weather killed at least four people, injured about 50, and damaged or destroyed an unknown number of homes and businesses, including a day care center.

But not all winter weather lovers were so lucky. Snow isn't expected in other parts of South Dakota until Friday. Sioux Falls resident Alana Amdahl said she's disappointed about the lack of snow projected for Christmas. ‘We live in South Dakota for a reason,’ said Amdahl, 27. ‘We don't have palm trees to put Christmas lights on, we have evergreens. Of course, we need snow. It can melt after the new year.’ Aftermath: Jeff and Melissa McKenzie embraced in the ruins of their flower shop in Columbia, Mississippi, as four were killed and others wounded by tornadoes that ripped through the state .

Backed up: Debris littered US 98 near Columbia as traffic was backed up due to inclement weather conditions, including tornadoes, in the state . A building is severely damaged on US 98 East near Columbia, Miss., after a tornado touched down . The hospital in Marion County, Mississippi, had every room full when it lost electricity, forcing the staff to work off a generator, WDAM reported. An additional 6,000 households throughout the state lost power, with damage to the electrical grid due to the severe weather. Mississippi Power told The Associated Press about 300 customers were still without electricity by midday Wednesday, but most would have power by the end of the day. NBC reported that in addition to wind and rain, hail struck the state, with golf-ball sized hail falling in Enterprise, Mississippi, and pea-sized debris hitting . A Walmart in Columbia was structurally damaged, with skylights blowing out and flooding reported. Vehicles parked outside were also damaged. Governor Phil Bryant, who toured the twister-stricken area by helicopter and by vehicle before the news conference, said state emergency officials believe the destruction was caused by a tornado. Some 40 businesses and 30 homes were damaged in Columbia, Bryant said. About 10 to 15 buildings were damaged in the more rural Jones County. Columbia Mayor Robert Bourne said the tornado straddled US 98, so damage was on both sides of the four-lane highway. Bryant had said earlier that the tornado cut a swath of about 3 to 3.5 miles long through Columbia and about a quarter of a mile wide. Police in Columbia were stationed at all major intersections after traffic lights were either swept away or destroyed amid Tuesday's powerful storms. At least 20 people were injured, according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency officials. Ravaged: A resident walks past a Ten Commandments display in Columbia, Mississippi, Wednesday.

The roof was ripped off the building of the Jack Morris Gas Co., a natural gas supplier. Wanda Morris, a family member who works in the company office, said she was watching TV when a weather warning was issued and the sirens went off in town. She said she gathered employees and customers, about 15 people in all, into a vault in the building, and they rode out the storm there. ‘When we heard the sirens the second time, I started yelling, 'Get into the vault! Get into the vault! And I ran outside and started yelling,’ she said. Only one employee failed to make it into the vault in time and hid under a metal table. He sustained minor injuries. Although the business itself was heavily damaged, a sign outside bearing the Ten Commandments was left completely intact. In Alabama, authorities said thunderstorms left trees and power lines down across the state and flooded several roads. In the Great Lakes region, rain is expected to turn to snow later today, dropping several inches of slushy snow on parts of Illinois. 'I'd be nervous about the possibility of not being able to get out,' said meteorologist Charles Mott as Chicago airports geared up for more cancellations. 'I would definitely make plans about possibly staying put or doing something else.' Stuck: David Welborn and his family wait in the lost luggage line of Raleigh/Durham International Airport after flying in from Washington State . Tired: Travelers waited in lines at Dulles International Airport as the holiday season added long waits at airports that were worsened by bad weather . Destruction: Severe weather throughout parts of the United States led to the death of at least four on Tuesday in Mississippi, as well as property damage in Georgia and Louisiana, where this picture was taken . Any delays would hit the nearly 4.2 million passengers estimated to come through O'Hare and Midway over 18 days that make up the holiday travel season, said a Chicago Aviation Department spokesperson. The worst travel backups Wednesday afternoon happened in Chicago, where 44 departures and 56 arrivals had been canceled. Cracked: The left rear winglet was damaged, forcing passengers to deplane and be booked to other flights, though no one was injured . Fog, rain and drizzle contributed to flight delays and cancellations at the three New York City-area airports. At New York's LaGuardia Airport, a Southwest airliner collided with an American Airlines plane, knocking off a piece of the Southwest plane's vertical fin just as it was taxiing for takeoff. The American Airlines plane was taxiing with the help of two ground personnel, spokesperson Joshua Freed said in an email according to Fox News. No one was injured and the Southwest passengers were booked to other flights. Washington, DC, Baltimore and Boston experienced delays though cancellations were low. Thunderstorms disrupted flights in Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston and Charlotte had 10 cancellations Wednesday in addition to numerous delays. Snow in Wisconsin caused a three-vehicle crash that included a school bus, though no one was reported injured. Strong winds and snow shut down Interstate 70 from eastern Colorado into Kansas for eight hours, and caused another Colorado highway to close temporarily.","Tornadoes in Mississippi killed four as severe weather damaged property in Louisiana and Georgia .

"A smart home full of devices connected to each other, as well as domestic robots are closer than we think, according to one futurologist. This year has seen a rush in the popularity of smart gadgets, with items like 3D printers and smart thermostats making it onto Christmas lists for the first time. The trend is a sign of the way technology will accelerate in 2015, according to London-based futurologist Dr James Bellini. Scroll down for video . Tipping pint: According to a recent survey, 26 per cent if people are most looking forward to getting a robot helper in the home.  Technology giant Honda already has a domestic robot, Asimo (left). Futurologist Dr James Bellini (right) claims the technology could be closer than we think . 'The centrepiece of our future is the British home, which is rapidly becoming the digital hub for our increasingly connected lives,' he said. 'Our homes are set to be enriched further by energy; from high-tech gadgets and appliances to smart devices.' Dr Bellini was commenting on the release of a report by energy company SSE, which showed that the average home was transforming, as consumer buying habits changed. The Home of the Future report found that in 2015, the most wanted products will be 3D printers, followed by smart devices that connect to our phones - primarily thermostats and security systems, as well as solar-powered chargers. Future of food? 3D printers such as Foodini (pictured) could change the way we prepare our meals. They are set to become more mainstream, according to a recent study . 3D printing is a technology moving further into the mainstream, with the first artificial limbs created from 3D printers being used on patients this year. Not only are the devices now on sale in retailers, but there are multiple mobile apps that enable users to create and buy figures and toys that are printed in 3D. '3D has been described as the biggest economic revolution since Henry Ford introduced production line manufacturing in the 1900s,' Dr Bellini said. 'Nasa already use it to turn out rocket parts; they are also developing ways to deploy 3D technology to produce on-board meals for the manned Mars missions planned for 2030 and beyond. Bright idea: The Home of the Future report found that in 2015, the most wanted products will be 3D printers, followed by smart devices that connect to our phones. Pictured is the LiFx light system . 'At the domestic level, 3D printing will mimic the take-up of fax machines and microwaves in the 1980s. 'The cost of a printer is falling rapidly - a starter version sells for less than £500 ($777) - and they are incredibly versatile. 'Printing a new smartphone case takes about 30 minutes - then there are toys, handles, chess pieces, replacements parts for every domestic gadget. 'Then there's food. 'Nutritionists are looking at ways of printing food items for the elderly to match individual nutritional/dietary needs. 'And although it's early days for 3D printed pizzas and chocolate, it won't be long before every home has gone 3D.' SSE's report also found that one of the products people were most looking forward to having in their home were domestic robots, with 26 per cent of those surveyed highlighting humanoids as a desirable product in years to come. Technology giant Honda already has a domestic robot, Asimo, who can remember faces and serve drinks, and made its first appearance in Europe this year. As the number of smartphones and tablets around the home grows, Dr Bellini said we were beginning to see the phasing out of 'traditional' technologies, such as the TV set, as well as landline phones and older portable devices. '2014 was the tipping point, with the total number of old-style TV sets in the UK declining for the first time ever,' he said. Earlier this year, Tokyo firm Softbank unveiled a robot called Pepper, which can read emotions . In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots. Earlier this year, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions. Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900). The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. Pepper uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to study gestures, expressions and human speech tones. The 48-inch (121 cm) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest. It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots. 'We're seeing more people increasingly watch TV shows and movies, as well as playing games on tablets and other devices.' He added, 'Nostalgia is being overtaken by digital practicalities. 'In the mobile age, fixed-line phones are about as relevant as sand-filled egg-timers. 'According to a recent Ofcom study, it is a highly generational thing. 'A third of 16 to 24-year-olds and 26 per cent of 25 to 34-year-olds live in mobile-only homes. 'For the over-75s, the figure is just one per cent.' Major technology brands have also spoken of the growing influence of the 'Internet of Things'; the idea that eventually all the devices and appliances in the home will be connected together via the web, and controlled from a single device. Samsung UK president Andy Griffiths said earlier this year: 'There has been a huge change in the way the connected world is established, and so to take that forward 10 years it's interesting to note that the main trend we believe by then will be the connected home.' Cutting costs: 3D printing is a technology moving further into the mainstream The Micro 3D, pictured, costs $249 (£150), weighs just 2.2lbs (1.2kg) and prints objects up 4.6-inches (116mm) tall. Its designers launched the product on Kickstarter earlier this year .","Comments were made by London-based futurologist Dr James Bellini .

"It could give every internet user access to simple encryption - and make the internet a far more secure place. Scientists at Scentrics, working with University College London, say they have created an algorithm that can guarantee total privacy for everything from emails and text messages. Called 'the construct', they hope the system could be used to give everything from desktop machines to mobile phones simple to use encryption. Scientists at Scentrics, working with University College London, say they have created an algorithm that can guarantee total privacy for everything from emails and text messages. The Construct is the name given to the algorithm which thwarts the MiTM results in a fully automated, standards based cryptographic key management protocol for TCP/IP and the UMTS network. It means 'one click privacy' ­ in an instant, and handles all of the key exchange and encryption that is needed - without the user having to do anything. If you are not connected when you receive a message for example (in its messaging security application), then you will be invited to join the key management service. The company is headed by a computer scientist and mathematician, Paran Chandrasekaran, who used to be technology counsellor to the Prince of Wales' Business Advisory Board. 'This allows people to lock their digital front doors and alarm their online lives,' he told DailyMail.com. 'The challenge is to give crypto to the masses, make it a one click solution and comply with corporate security. 'What we have developed is an algorithm that places a security layers into the DNA of the internet - it will have crypto for the masses, and you won't even need a special app.' The company has found a way of defeating what cryptologists call 'the man-in-the-middle attack' or MITM – the ability of someone to hack and intercept an electronic message. This requires an attacker to have the ability to both monitor and alter or inject messages into a communication channel. One example of this used by hackers is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted Wi-Fi wireless access point, can insert himself as a man-in-the-middle. Until now, said Chandrasekaran said, there has been no foolproof way of blocking a third person from gaining access to the electronic conversation. The team recently received a patent for their solution, and is currently in talks with a major backer, with a deal expected to be announced within weeks. 'The buyer of this company must be commercial and responsible, well respected and not fight with other firms,' Chandrasekaran warned. 'Whoever aquires it can put this in place withih 30 days, and the deal going forward is that we will grow a small group to bring out more IP for this layer.' The firm says it could even have been able to thwart the Sony attack. The simple Application Programming Interface (API) allows for any service provider to plug in any application to take care of privacy and security settings for data and image and voice. This has never previously been possible. An example of two such reference implementations include: Messaging security – for cross platform on IPhone, Android and Blackberry where all SMS, MMS and emails (with attachments) are sent and received with just a simple one-click go button within the native applications – so the user has no need to visit other programs or applications to secure content. A second applications enables all Facebook users to store and retrieve their images, fully encrypted, within Facebook's own servers – whereby not even Facebook's own management can see such images. This, if repeated within ICloud renders no member of Apple's management have access to the images. 'Sony used to have a reputation for having biggest spend per head for security software,' said Chandrasekaran.' 'To be able to go inside there and get all the records is like walking through the front door, you need to nail these things to the floor. 'Encryption is hard to use because of key management, and we have solved this.' Earlier this year, another company which had been working closely with UCL, the artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind, was sold to Google for £400m. The service was developed with researchers at University College London. Professor Anthony Finkelstein, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering Sciences at UCL and a Fellow of the Royal College of Engineering, a member of Scentrics' Technical Advisory Board (TAB) said: 'What differentiates low and high value IP is algorithmic research or its absence. 'Scentrics, rather like many of the other companies founded on algorithmic research, such as Google and Facebook, has done incredible work to solve the problem of automated key distribution and was one of the many reasons why UCL became involved.' Where issues of national security are concerned, the ciphers used are all government-approved, which means messages can be accessed if they need to be by the security services, he said. 'No longer will there be the complaint that security is hard to use on the internet or phones,' the firm claims. 'The impact is truly revolutionary as it envisages a future in which there will be total user controlled privacy whilst also balancing the needs of national security by the architecture of the service which allows for Legitimised Key Escrow. 'In short, every individual and/or machine now has the ability to call, from the cloud, its own cryptographic key (pair). This process, for the first time in history, is fully automated.'","Hope to commercialise their algorithm within months .

"Researchers have used skin cells to make primitive artificial sperm and eggs in a move that could transform fertility treatment. Scientists in Cambridge made the sex cells by culturing human embryonic stem cells for five days under carefully-controlled conditions. They then showed that the same process can convert adults' skin tissue into early-stage sperm and eggs. Scientists have made primitive artificial sperm and eggs which could transform fertility treatment. Pictured: A single sperm being injected directly into an egg during IVF (file picture) The scientists believe that those cells could then grow into mature sperm and eggs. The next step in the project will be to inject the primitive cells into mouse ovaries  to see if they do fully develop. If it works, it could mean skin cells could be turned into genetically-identical sex cells to be used in adults who are undergoing IVF therapy. Azim Surani, who led the work at the Gurdon Institute in Cambridge, told the Guardian: 'It’s remarkably fast. 'We can now take any embryonic stem cell line and once we have them in the proper conditions, we can make these primordial cells in five to six days.' The move could be a landmark development in the medical world. Researchers have previously made sperm and eggs from rodent stem cells but have struggled to achieve the same with human cells. If the research does work, the current law for fertility treatment would need to be changed for the process to be used. Currently, British fertility clinics are prevented from using artificial sperm and eggs to treat infertile couples. The findings could mean skin cells could be used to make genetically-identical sex cells  which could be used in IVF therapies . In 2012, Japanese scientists used stem cells to create mouse eggs, which were used to make baby mice. Scientists at Newcastle University had also claimed to have made human sperm in the same way in 2009, but their paper was retracted amid allegations of plagiarism. For this research, the scientists developed a culture process which turned about half of the cells into into precursors of eggs and sperm. They then added natural chemicals called growth factors to development them further. Details of the work, a collaboration with the Weizmann Institute in Israel, are published in the journal, Cell.","Cambridge researchers turned stem cells into precursors of egg and sperm .

"Killed: Antonio Martin was shot dead by an officer on Tuesday - but the cop was not wearing a body cam . A police officer who shot dead a black teenager at a Missouri gas station on Tuesday night was not wearing his body camera at the time - even though he had been issued one of the department's three cameras earlier that evening. The officer, a six-year veteran of the Berkeley Police Department, is on administrative leave for killing 18-year-old Antonio Martin after the teen pointed a weapon at him, police said. The officer, 34, had been assigned a camera at roll call at the start of his shift but didn't put it on, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar said at an early-morning press conference on Wednesday. The police chief suggested that the officer, who has not been named, had been handed the body camera when he was distracted by something else, such as a call. 'He said he clipped it somewhere in the car, didn't put it on, and next thing you know you're here,' Belmar said. Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said that the police department has just three body cameras. There are 31 officers in the department in Berkeley, a town of around 9,000 residents on the outskirts of St Louis. Belmar and Hoskins downplayed the officer's oversight, saying it is unsurprising that he forgot to attach the camera because they have only just started using the devices. Hoskins, speaking at a separate news conference on Wednesday, said he was 'not concerned'. 'At this point it's relatively new,' he said of the technology. 'We only have three, so if it had been six months from today and we had gone through all the training I would have some concerns.' On camera: The teenager can be seen raising his arm on this surveillance footage, which was taken from the gas station's cameras. Police said it shows him raising a gun and pointing it at the police officer . He said that thankfully they had surveillance footage from the gas station to help them figure out what had happened. 'It would've been helpful' to have the body cam footage, he said, 'and in the future and when we get well trained, there will be a severe penalty for an officer who does not turn it on.' The officer also did not have his dashboard camera on inside his patrol vehicle, but Belmar said the camera is activated when the car's red flashing lights are on, which they were not. Instead, the late-night incident was captured by surveillance cameras outside the Mobil gas station in Berkeley, and police shared the footage at the news conference on Wednesday. The officer, who was responding to a call about a theft in the area, drove up to the gas station and called over two men, including Antonio Martin. As the officer was speaking to the other male, Martin pulled out a weapon and pointed it at the officer, police said. 'Fearing for his life', the officer pulled out his weapon, stumbled backwards and fired three times, hitting Martin once, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. No concerns: At a press conference on Wednesday, St Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar explained that the officer did not put on his assigned body camera and clipped it inside his car instead . Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said he was not concerned that the officer was not wearing the camera. He added that after officers receive more training, there will be harsher penalties for forgetting them . Also at the scene, investigators found a loaded 9mm gun with its serial number filed off, which they say belonged to the slain teenager. The second man fled the scene and police are still looking for him. After the death, as many as 300 people descended on the gas station, with some starting explosions or throwing bricks at police officers. Patrol cars were damaged and two officers went to hospital with minor injuries, Belmar said. Four arrests for assaulting police officers were also made. The officer's attorney, Brian Milliken, would not comment on why the cop was not wearing his body camera at the time of the shooting, telling the St Louis Post-Dispatch: 'There could be some internal issues.' Body cameras have been a subject of debate in recent months following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson in August. Device: A police body camera can be seen here on Los Angeles Police Sergeant Dan Gomez earlier this month as he announced plans to equip thousands of police officers with the cameras by next summer . All still: Pictured Wednesday, a police cruiser sits at the gas station where Martin was killed on Tuesday . Both police officers and protesters have argued that if all police wore body cameras, it would help prove innocence or guilt, and could alter the way people act and ultimately save lives. At the end of August, police officers in Ferguson began wearing cameras attached to their uniforms. About 50 cameras were donated by two private companies, Safety Visions and Digital Ally, after the shooting of Brown, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson told the Post-Dispatch at the time. The newspaper reported that other police departments in the St. Louis area were planning to start using wearable cameras, the Post-Dispatch says. At the start of the month, Obama appealed to Congress for $263 million to help buy 50,000 body-worn cameras that could help provide information about incidents involving police interactions.","A white police officer, 34, killed 18-year-old Antonio Martin after the teenager apparently pointed a gun at him in a gas station on Tuesday .

"Texas police have issued a warrant for the missing driver of an armored truck that was found emptied and abandoned Monday, and they have arrested the man's father. Police are continuing their search for Trent Michael Cook, 24, of Amarillo, who police have charged with first-degree felony theft of more than $200,000, ABC News reports. Cook's father, Brian  Hodge, 43, has been arrested in connection with the crime. Cook has not been seen since Monday, the same day police found a Rochester Armored Car Co. vehicle  abandoned, its contents stolen, and its engine running, nearly 30 minutes after the vehicle went missing. Father & Son: Missing armored truck driver Trent Cook, 24, (left) has been charged with first-degree felony theft and his father, Brian Hodge,43, (right) has been arrested for allegedly being involved in the heist . Emptied: On Monday, authorities found this Rochester Armored Car Co. abandoned with its contents stolen; Cook, the driver, was nowhere to be found . Authorities have not revealed the contents of the vehicle. When authorities found the abandoned vehicle  around 7.50am in a vacant lot, the Amarillo Police Department listed Cook as a 'missing/endangered person,' but now, investigators say they have reason to believe Cook was involved in the heist. 'Investigators have developed credible evidence Cook has access to a rifle and handguns, and could be considered dangerous due to this information,' the department said in a statement. On Tuesday, police issued the warrant for Cook and arrested Hodge who, they say, tampered with or fabricated evidence involving the case. Family: Cook's mother (left) and stepfather, Bill Wills (right) hold that if Cook was involved in any crime involving the vehicle, he was forced to participate against his will . Abandoned: On Monday, police found the armored company vehicle abandoned with its contents emptied nearly 30 minutes after the truck went missing . Cook's family holds that Cook was not voluntarily involved in the heist and that if he did have anything to do with it, it was against his will. But, investigators have uncovered that Cook discussed with others how a heist like this could be pulled off, according to Fox News. On Tuesday evening, authorities even found a white 1995 Ford van in a parking lot which they believe was Cook's getaway vehicle. 'This recovery indicates that the suspect changed cars in the area early in the day, possibly shortly after the theft,' the department said in a statement, according to Fox. 'It is unknown if he was picked up by another person or if the suspect had pre-positioned a second vehicle at that scene.' Getaway Vehicle: Authorities found a white 1995 Ford van abandoned in a parking lot which they say they believe was Cook's (photographed) getaway vehicle .

"They are among our most commonly seen birds, doing nothing more extraordinary than looking for food in an unremarkable back garden. Frozen in flight by the camera, however, they become creatures of spectacular grace and beauty. In a fraction of a second, these incredible photographs capture the everyday activity of robins, tits, finches and other native species in a way the human eye never could. They transform the simplest manoeuvre into an aerial ballet; show tiny wings in majestic, intricate detail. They also give a rare glimpse of the fierce competition for food and territorial supremacy in the avian kingdom. Scroll down for video . These two goldfinches were captured during an amazingly complex flight display as they almost danced most serenely in the air while they were out feeding . These robins seem to have a difference of opinion as they perch on a rusting metal pole in a back garden. The moment was captured by photographer John Crabb . John Crabb wanted to be able to capture the images of birds in free-frame while they are in mid-air without scaring the birds, which was a major task . But just how does a photographer get close enough to freeze-frame the mid-air action in perfect focus, without scaring the birds? Simple, if you happen to be retired physicist and lifelong gadget enthusiast Dr John Crabb. He might have bought his first camera only four years ago, but his enthusiasm for Heath Robinson-style solutions to challenging problems has rapidly allowed his new-found hobby to take flight. Hence, it was a succession of wacky looking, home-made devices that allowed him get the perfect shot. The first was nothing more complex than a twig attached to a post, wired up to trigger the camera shutter when a bird launched itself from the perch. The Mk II version was a spring-loaded feeding platform (it looks a little like a medieval siege-engine catapult) — rigged up with a switch that operates an electrical circuit connected to the camera. Dr Crabb had to go back to the drawing board after a cheeky robin bounced up and down so excitedly on the platform, it produced hundreds of frames of an empty patch of air. The camera was focused on the spot where the robin should have flown; instead, the bouncing bird kept triggering the shutter without actually taking off. The retired physicist designed an ingenious method of capturing the perfect image of the bird every time without scaring the subject . Dr Crabb used his scientific know-how to attach a trigger to a twig with a pressure switch, when the bird launched itself from branch it set off the camera . So in the weeks and months that followed, the devices were refined with infra-red or laser beams that fired the camera when the beam was broken by a bird or its shadow. Result: a portfolio of stunningly clear photographs revealing the hidden beauty of birds in the early stages of flight, fighting each other, and feeding their young. Yesterday Dr Crabb explained: ‘The main point of all the geekery was, of course the photos, and some of them turned out astonishingly well. They show aspects of flight that would otherwise be unobservable — people tell me they have never seen birds flying like that before. All of them are just ordinary garden birds, so much overlooked. But to catch them in dramatic flight really pleases me. Even the smallest ones look more magnificent than I could have expected. With their fully spread wings, they look every bit as impressive as eagles. You can see these birds every day, but the images give a new insight into what they actually look like.’ The photographs were all taken in natural light in Dr Crabb’s back garden in Somerset, then posted on a wildlife website he created to showcase them. Needless to say, he’s also on Twitter. Dr Crabb said he was concentrating on ordinary garden birds that he had seen out of the back of his Somerset home but was able to capture the most amazing images . Dr Crabb captured images which are normally missed of birds landing and taking off or fighting with each other .","Scientist John Crabb wanted to take photographs of ordinary garden birds in the most extraordinary situations .

"Queensland's premier says Russian President Vladimir Putin isn't welcome at this year's G20 conference in Brisbane unless he co-operates with a probe into the MH17 disaster. Flags across the state will fly at half mast on Saturday in tribute to the seven Queenslanders who were among 298 killed when a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down in eastern Ukraine. Suspicion has fallen on Russian-backed rebels armed with Russian artillery but Mr Putin has said Ukraine bears responsibility for the crash which left 298 people dead, including 28 Australians. Scroll down for video . Queensland Premier Campbell Newman (left) says Russian President Vladimir Putin (right) is not welcome to Brisbane for the G20 Summit in November . He has blamed that country's crackdown on separatist rebels for stoking tensions. On Saturday, Queensland Premier Campbell Newman called on Mr Putin and the Russian government to fully co-operate with an independent international investigation. 'If Mr Putin's not prepared to do that, well frankly I believe that Queenslanders don't want him here at the G20,' Mr Newman said. 'He has the opportunity to demonstrate some good faith and that can be done by properly getting behind international efforts to get to the bottom of what is clearly, in my view, a crime, a terrible crime.' Mr Newman said the Russian president's presence at the summit was ultimately Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision, but he felt he was speaking for Queenslanders. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten echoed these views and says Mr Abbott should consider uninviting the Russian President from the Brisbane meeting over his government's 'reckless and stupid' actions leading up to the MH17 disaster. Mr Abbott wouldn't comment on his stance regarding Mr Putin's attendance to the international gathering.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten also says Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott should consider uninviting Mr Putin . 'For an outside nation to have supplied these Ukrainian rebels with this weaponry of war and murder is a very, very reckless and stupid act,' Mr Shorten said on Saturday. 'It is in the interests of resolving what has happened that all of the great powers, including the Russian Federation, support what was said at the United Nations Security Council last night.' The council called for a thorough investigation of the crash. Mr Shorten said the Australian government should consider barring Mr Putin from the upcoming G20 meeting in Brisbane if the country did not support the investigation. 'If the Russian Federation will not co-operate to help resolve and get to the heart of what has happened here, I don't think Australians would welcome them coming to the G20,' he said.

"Up to a dozen workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta campus may have been exposed to a misplaced sample of the Ebola virus. CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said on Wednesday that a technician working in the secure laboratory may have come into contact with a small amount of a live virus that was part of an Ebola experiment. Reynolds says the potential exposure is under internal investigation and has been reported to Secretary of Health and Human Services Sylvia Burwell. Up to a dozen workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Atlanta campus may have been exposed to a misplaced sample of the Ebola virus . The Washington Post reports that up to a dozen people in the area are being assessed for exposure risks. The technician at greatest risk had not yet developed symptoms, but will be monitored for 21 days. The exposure occurred on Monday afternoon and once discovered was rapidly escalated to supervisors by Tuesday. Scientists conducting research on the virus at the high-security lab mistakenly put a sample containing the potentially infectious virus in a place where it was transferred for processing to another CDC lab, also in Atlanta on the CDC campus. Reynolds says additional employees have been notified, but none has required monitoring. There was no possible exposure outside the secure laboratory at CDC and no exposure or risk to the public, said officials. CDC Director Tom Frieden said he is troubled by the employee's potential exposure. In June, at least 52 workers at the CDC took antibiotics as a precaution because a lab safety problem was thought to have exposed them to anthrax. CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said on Wednesday that a technician working in the secure laboratory may have come into contact with a small amount of a live virus that was part of an Ebola experiment . The global death toll from Ebola has risen to 7,588 out of 19,497 confirmed cases recorded in the year-old epidemic raging in West Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. The virus is still spreading intensely in Sierra Leone, especially in the north and west, with 315 new confirmed cases reported in the former British colony in the week to December 21, it said. These included 115 cases in the capital Freetown. 'The neighbouring district of Port Loko experienced a surge in new cases, reporting 92 confirmed cases compared with 56 the previous week,' the WHO said. In Sierra Leone, information about how to prevent and treat Ebola was provided to more than 5,000 households between 10 and 17 December as part of a major awareness campaign, it said. In Guinea, 156 confirmed cases were recorded during the same period, 'the highest weekly case incidence reported by the country in this outbreak', the WHO said. The global death toll from Ebola has risen to 7,588 out of 19,497 confirmed cases recorded in the year-old epidemic raging in West Africa, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday . 'This largely due to a surge in cases in the south-eastern district of Kissidougou, which reported 58 confirmed cases - one-third of cases reported in the country in the past week.' Noting the district had previously reported no more than five cases per week, it said the surge showed the need for continuing vigilance even where the virus was not widespread. In Liberia, where case incidence has been declining for the past month, 21 cases were reported in the week to December 21. Montserrado county, including the capital Monrovia, still has the highest rates of the disease nationwide, while along the Côte d'Ivoire border to the east, Nimba county reported 3 confirmed cases, its first in 9 weeks, the WHO said. Five additional countries - Nigeria, Senegal, Mali, Spain and the United States - have had imported cases and are included in the global toll. The Ebola crisis, which claimed its first victim in Guinea exactly a year ago, is likely to last until the end of 2015, according to Peter Piot, a scientist who helped to discover the virus in 1976. Medical detective work will be the next phase in the fight against Ebola. The United Nations will deploy hundreds of health workers to identify chains of infection as the virus passes from person to person, WHO director-general Margaret Chan said in Accra, Ghana earlier on Wednesday.","Technician working in the secure laboratory mistakenly put an Ebola sample  in a place where it was transferred  to another lab .

"Arsene Wenger has urged his Arsenal team to use their Christmas fixtures to prove they are in a false position in the Barclays Premier League. The sixth-placed Gunners face QPR on Boxing Day and then travel to West Ham and Southampton, clubs who sit directly above them in the table and rivals for Champions League qualification. 'We have to make sure that over Christmas we take advantage of the schedule we have and put the performances in,' Wenger said. Arsenal conceded late against 10-man Liverpool last weekend to leave them sitting sixth in the table . Under-pressure manager Arsene Wenger hopes his side can show their true potential in the next three games . 'We have a good opportunity over Christmas to show that we are much better than people think we are. 'Every team has difficult games, so it is the consistency in that period that will matter.' QPR have yet to register an away point this season, but Wenger refuses to take victory at the Emirates Stadium on Friday for granted. 'We expect a QPR with nothing to lose. They will come and have a go at us,' Wenger said. The return of Olivier Giroud in recent games has aided Wenger's striking options alongside Alexis Sanchez . Charlie Austin, who scored a hat-trick at the weekend, will be QPR's main threat on Boxing Day . 'You focus on your own performance and don't expect any weakness from your opponent. In the Premier League every game is difficult and you just want to turn up. 'We played QPR two years ago and they were very difficult games. West Ham at the moment are in very good shape. 'We go away to Southampton, which is a very difficult as well. Again, it's down to our performances.'","Arsenal face QPR, West Ham and Southampton over festive period .

"A new exhibition explores how fashion and ballet have been sources of inspiration for one another over the past two centuries. Dance & Fashion, which has just opened at the Museum at FIT in New York City, features iconic stage costumes as well as photos and videos of various performances. In recent times, it has not been uncommon for top fashion designers to create costumes for the ballet; among those represented in the exhibition are Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Lacroix, Jean Paul Gaultier and Prabal Gurung. All dressed up: Dance & Fashion, a new exhibit at the Museum at FIT in New York City, features iconic ballet and dance costumes from the 1800s to today. (Left: A Prabal Gurung design. Right: A costume by Rodarte) Tip toes: A pair of Comme des Garcons shoes from the spring 2005 collection demonstrate how dance influences fashion and vice versa . The show is created by the museum's director and lead historian, who told Elle: 'Dance and fashion are the two embodied arts forms all about the body. You couldn't have [either] without the body.' One of the costumes on show is a flouncy red dress accented with a black leather strap. The look was created by Prabal Gurung for Capricious Maneuvers, a show that debuted in New York City in fall 2013. A rather striking costume in the exhibition is a man's 'tattoo costume' designed by Stella McCartney, a nude body suit adorned with black designs giving the illusion of tattooed skin.

"The bittersweet moment of saying goodbye to loved ones has been documented by a Cleveland photographer in a new photo series which movingly captures his father’s life and death. In 2013 Angelo Merendino started taking photographs of his parents waving goodbye on their Akron doorstep after every visit. He didn't realize how poignant the series would become until his father died in May 2014 and his parents joint appearances on the porch slipped away to his mother’s solitary wave farewell. His photos capture the emotional moment that most of us will experience during the holidays - the combination of happiness at our time spent with loved ones but also our reluctance to see them walk out the door. Goodbye: Angelo Merendino was touched by how his parents would always come to the door to see him out of their Ohio home . Loving: The couple are always seen grinning and affectionately hugging each other as they wave goodbye . Home for the holidays? The series reflects what many will experience as they travel home for the holidays and eventually have to make those bittersweet goodbyes . ‘As long as I can remember my parents have stood by the door and waived goodbye when I would leave. There was never an, ""I'll just let myself out,"" it was always, ""We'll walk you to the door,’ Merendino writes on his website. ‘I don't remember when I realized that this goodbye wasn't a given. One day it would be different. Since my dad's passing a mom still comes to the door.’ In a recent interview with Today, the artist spoke out about his grief over the death of his father who died aged 85. He said he feels the photos document how much his parents cared about him and all those who visited the family home. 'I felt like that really told the story of how much they cared,"" Merendino said. ""It wasn't just for me or my brothers and sisters, anyone who's ever come to visit my parents' home were walked out the door. They really cared about people and taught me to care about people.' Merendino’s personal work is a continuation from his emotional series documenting his late wife’s battle with cancer. Manners: Merendino recalls how his parents will refuse to let anyone see themselves out - insisting on the proper goodbye . Lessons: Merendino says his parents taught him how important it was to care for others seen in the simple but moving way in which they welcomed people to and from their home . Not a given: Merendino only decided to share the images when his father died at 85. Looking back it made him realise how moving they are . Supportive: His parents supported him throughout the loss of his wife to cancer and he would in turn support his mother through the loss of his dad . All year round: The pictures show the couple on the doorstep come rain or shine . Shift: The photographs become all the more poignant when they change so Merendino's mother is the only one on the porch not his father . In a series entitled The Battle We Didn’t Choose, Merendino photographs his wife Jennifer in her brave battle with the disease after being diagnosed just five months after their Central Park wedding. Following her death in December 2011, Merendino moved home to Cleveland from New York to live near his elderly parents. Their relationship - particularly with his father - drew even closer after the move and in response to Merendino’s heartbreaking experience of losing his wife aged just 40. The artist told Today he wants his work to remind people to seize the day and remember what matters is their loved ones and to hold them near. ‘I want people to see that life is precious,’ he said. ‘Stop for a minute and say 'I love you' to the people in their life. It's the greatest feeling, to be loved.’ Quoting his wife on his website he writes ‘Love every morsel of the people in your life’. Angelo Merendino now runs a non-profit organisation The Love You Share to provide financial assistance to women who are being treated for breast cancer. Thumbs up: The photographer's father is seen smiling happily in all the photos as he bids his son farewell . Loss: Merendino's father died at the age of 85 . Still saying goodbye: Merendino says his mother now keeps up the tradition alone .","Angelo Merendino of Akron, Ohio, decided to document his parents' goodbyes after moving home following his wife's death .

"New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker joined in on Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's annual 'airing of the grievances' on Twitter this year, playfully suggesting that the Republican lawmaker shed his curly locks ahead of his probable presidential campaign. Paul, a likely but unconfirmed White House contender, was sending the tweets as part of the fictional 'Festivus' holiday, made popular in the 1990s 'Seinfeld' sitcom when he teased Democrat Booker for not retweeting him more often. Booker responded in kind and said he had only one grievance for his colleague in the Senate. 'SHAVE YOUR HEAD. Those curls are offensive. Plus If running for a higher office u'll be far more aerodynamic,' he joked. Earlier in the day Paul had mocked the media for obsessing over his hair and questioning the authenticity of his curls. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, center, and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, right, are pictured here during a Politico Playbook event hosted by the Politico writer Mike Allen, left. The two senators of opposing political parties have bonded over their support for criminal justice reform . Paul is an unconfirmed presidential contender but is expected to join a broad GOP field in the coming months, but he could just be referring to his Senate re-election bid . After Paul teased Booker for not retweeting him more, the New Jersey Senator - who is bald - mocked Paul's curly hair . 'The hair is real & mine. Don't know why ur fascinated with it or compare it to alien life forms,' he tweeted along with a photo of himself with his hair circled in red. Booker and Paul are on opposite sides of the political divide but they have bonded in the Senate over their support for criminal justice reform. After his initial tweet sharing his artificial grievance with Booker, Paul noted that in the past year the two had 'discussed hemp, med marijuana, crim justice reform. Some of that has now passed, all of it we've worked on together this year.' Paul added,'My grievance there though remains the same. Not enough looking for agreement in Washington. @CoryBooker and I will keep trying.' Booker also followed up his lighthearted message with one that was serious in tone. 'Rand, in honor of #Festivus, here's to u & I with our colleagues showing a true feat of strength & passing crim justice reform,' he said. 'Festivus' is a made-up secular holiday that the cantankerous 'Seinfeld' character Frank Costanza forced on his family each year two days before Christmas as an alternative to Christmas and Hanukkah. Its celebration, he explained on the show, included a Festivus dinner during which people told their family members 'all the ways they've disappointed you' during the year. Instead of a tree or menorah, the Costanza family erected an unadorned silver 'Festivus pole.' The day-long event also included 'feats of strength' and 'Festivus miracles' – which were ordinary events with simple explanations. Earlier in the day Paul had pondered the media's obsession with his hair and confirmed its authenticity . Paul's grievances included ribs at his political opponents, including Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, outgoing Senate Majority Leader and Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. In a tweet directed at Grimes, who unsuccessfully challenged incoming Majority Leader Mitch McConnell in the last election and will likely challenge Paul in the next one, Paul made of the Democrat for refusing to acknowledge her support for Obama during her last campaign. 'I am still wondering who @Alison4KY voted for,' he said, facetiously. Paul also rubbed salt in Reid's election-inflicted wound, tweeting, 'To my friend @SenatorReid , wishing you a long and fruitful tenure as minority leader #sorrynotsorry' As a result of Republican gains in November Reid was demoted and Republican McConnell ascended to the Senate's top leadership post. Paul mostly left his Republican colleagues alone, save Rubio, who he has been feuding with for the past week over the Cuba policy. 'Tempting to air a grievance @MarcoRubio again, but we've done that enough for this week. Instead I will say an early Merry Christmas,' Paul said, laying down his sword in the holiday spirit. Taking a jovial tone, Paul joking griped that 'no matter how many times I ask [McConnell] he won't let me borrow this awesome sweater vest.' 'We all know having a fashion forward campaign is important to success, as [former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum] showed us in 2012 #festivus,' he said in a tweet accompanied by a photo of Santorum on the campaign trail. Paul's 'airing of grievances started with a jab at incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's fashion sense before he posted his own Photoshopped shirt . Did a US senator just announce he's running for president on Twitter, or is he toying with us? Kentucky Republican Rand Paul tweeted this photo on Tuesday . But what started as jabs about sweater vests worn quickly switched on Washington's buzz machine when Paul added a Photoshopped pic of a turtleneck sporting a 'Rand Paul 2016' slogan. 'Of course, everyone has to be themselves, and I have my own style,' he tweeted. 'I think this will be a popular item this year.' Many who follow the senator on Twitter took him seriously. 'Strangest way to announce you're running for President, achieved,' tweeted one user. 'If Rand Paul just announced his presidential campaign vis a vis a Festivus rant, I have to vote for him. No choicem,' wrote another. But others noted that Paul is also up for re-election to the Senate in two years. Asked whether the senator was really making a campaign announcement about the presidency, a Paul spokesman wrote back – complete with a smiley-face emoticon: 'Senator Paul is running for the Senate in 2016 :-)' 'Ive got a lot of problems with you people!': Paul quoted Frank Costanza, a 'Seinfeld' character, who berated his family members around the dinner table two days before Christmas . On 'Seinfeld,' Frank Costanza, the crusty father of George Costanza, created Festivus as an alternative to Christmas and Hanukkah . He has signaled, however, that he could run for both the Senate and the White House simultaneously, a prospect that Grimes has said she will try to block. Grimes lost her own Senate bid to McConnell in November by a 15-point margin. 'The law is clear,' she told WHAS-TV a week ago. 'You can’t be on the ballot twice for two offices.' 'At the end of the day, we’re not going to be bullied,' she pledged. Grimes herself could be a Senate front-runner if Paul were forced to choose and picked a presidential bid over running for a second six-year term in Congress. Making a big political announcement on social media isn't unprecedented. Last week former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush used Facebook and Twitter to declare that he was launching a presidential exploratory committee.","'Festivus' is a fictional secular holiday introduced to Americans during a 1997 episode of 'Seinfeld'

"Rush Limbaugh has admitted to being 'racist' following comments he made about actor Idris Elba. The eternally outspoken host decided to address news out of the Sony hack that Elba was being eyed to play James Bond once Daniel Craig exited the franchise, declaring it unacceptable for a black actor to even be considered for the iconic role of 007. He then took it a step further by saying the idea of casting Elba as Bond, a fictional storybook spy created by author Ian Fleming, was as ridiculous as a white actor playing a black historical figure. Scroll down for video . Ranting and raving: Rush Limbaugh (above) declared that a black actor could not ever play the role of James Bond on his radio show Tuesday . Rumor: This after it was revealed that Sony executives were hoping to cast Idris Elba (above) as Bond when actor Daniel Craig leaves the franchise . 'James Bond is a total concept put together by Ian Fleming. He was white and Scottish. Period. That is who James Bond is, was,' said Limbaugh as he began his diatribe. 'But now [they are] suggesting that the next James Bond should be Idris Elba, a black Briton, rather than a white from Scotland.' Hear more on YouTube . The polarizing pundit then acknowledged that he was being racist, seemingly unfazed by the realization, adding; 'That’s not who James Bond is and I know it’s racist to probably point this out.' Limbaugh did not reveal however how he feels about Craig playing Bond, or make mention of actors David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan, who, while white, are not Scottish. In fact, of the seven men to have played the smooth-talking spy over the past 50 years, only one is actually Scottish - the very first Bond, Sean Connery. Despite these inarguable facts, Limbaugh still declared at one point during the show; 'Fifty years of white Bond because Bond is white. Always Scottish. Always drank vodka.' Things then got taken a step further when Limbaugh said that casting Elba, whose phonetical name proved challenging for Limbaugh to pronounce throughout the segment, as Bond would be like casting George Clooney as President Obama or Kelsey Grammer as Nelson Mandela. It didn't stop there either, with Limbaugh imagining Kate Hudson playing Michelle Obama and Scarlett Johansson as Condoleezza Rice as scenarios as ludicrous as a black man playing Bond, before capping it all off by suggesting British actor Hugh Grant playing the role of gay footballer Michael Sam is akin to Elba as Bond. Limbaugh then declared 'we’re just playing here,' before moving on to his next talking point. It is also worth noting that the self-described Bond fanatic Limbaugh's claim that 007 'always drank vodka' is also not accurate, as the spy drinks a variety of different beverages in Flemming's novels.","Rush Limbaugh declared that a black man could not portray James Bond during his radio show on Tuesday .

"Involuntary hero: Triple graduate Benjamin Serra Bosch has become the poster boy for Spain's 'Lost generation' after his post about 'cleaning s***' in London . A Spanish graduate who won three degrees has found the only job available to him is cleaning the bathrooms in a London cafe. Benjamin Serra Bosch, 25, received distinctions for his academic work in journalism and PR but has not be able to find qualified work in Spain or his new home country. In a frustrated online rant, he outlines the hopeless situation for thousands of young Spaniards like himself who are forced to go abroad to take on jobs for which they are overqualified. Mr Serra has gained thousands of followers and stirred online debate about unemployment and higher education in Spain after writing a post on Facebook and Twitter bemoaning his situation in London. He has two Bachelor degrees, one in Journalism and Advertising and another in Public Relations from the prestigious private CEU Cardenal Herrera University. He also has a Master's degree in Community Management from the IEBS Business School. Yet he was not able to find employment in Spain, and after a six-month internship in London, he took a job at a ‘well-known coffee chain’ as a waiter. ‘I received a distinction for both my degrees and now I clean s*** in a foreign country,’ he writes. ‘I've been working in a well known café chain in London since May. And after five months working there, today for the first time I saw it clearly. ‘I clean toilets. My thought was “I received distinction in my two degrees and I clean other peoples s*** in a country that isn't my own.” Well, I also make coffees, wipe tables and wash up cups.’ The reaction from other young Spaniards, did not take long. Since Friday, his post has been . shared over 1,500 times on Facebook alone, with thousands of comments . from others in his situation. Thousands have chimed in to complain of the hopeless situation for many young people in Spain, where unemployment for under-25s reached 56 per cent in August. The Valencia native insists in his post that he is not ashamed of working a job he is overqualified for, but rather that, like many others of his generation, he was forced to go abroad to get it as a result of the high unemployment in Spain. Online rant: Benjamin Serra Bosch's Facebook post on how, despite having three degrees he is forced to work in a cafe in London as he cannot find any employment in Spain . ‘I'm not ashamed of what I do. Cleaning is a very worthy job, What embarrasses me is having to do it because no one has given me an opportunity in Spain. There are many Spaniards like me especially in London. ‘We are a plague. And make no mistake, the youth [from Spain] are not here to learn the language, having an adventure and new experiences. We are IMMIGRANTS. ‘I thought I deserved better after so much effort in my academic life. Apparently I was wrong.’ Following his post, Mr Serra has involuntarily been dubbed 'the voice' of his generation. On his blog, Mr Serra clarifies: 'My intention has never been to go viral, and it became much less so as this madness is happening. 'Neither was it to get the reviews, but each one is free to think what they want. As I said, I'm not ashamed clean . It is a worthy work. Similarly it is that of the server or any other. I simply complained that I'm not working for what I want and what I've made ​​. 'I know this has transpired because many of us [young Spaniards] find ourselves in the same situation or are parents who have struggled to prepare their children and identify with my situation. Or simply because there are people who see that Spain has spent years living in an untenable position. 'I am an ordinary person, not a public figure. I never wanted to be the hero of the stories, I just want to tell them.'","Benjamin Serra Bosch from Valencia has two bachelors and a master .

"While the rest of Europe keeps its toes dry, elevated and toasty by the nearest fire place, the football season goes on in the Premier League with the traditional Boxing Day fixtures. It's the start of a typically and traditionally packed fixture list for teams up and down the land but it is also a time for Christmas crackers as Sportsmail looks at the finest top flight clashes from December 26 over the years. 10. Sheffield Wednesday 3-3 Manchester United, 1992 . It wasn’t just at Old Trafford where Sheffield Wednesday could implode while leading against Manchester United (see 1993) – they could do it at Hillsborough too. David Hirst, Mark Bright and John Sheridan had the Owls cruising just after the hour mark, before Brian McCLair scored twice in 13 minutes to set up a tense finale for the final 10. A combination of comical Wednesday defending and fine attacking instinct ensured United an equaliser with six minutes left, as former Wednesday trialist Eric Cantona bundled home from close range. Arguably the first of many amazing United comebacks in the Premier League era. 9. Aston Villa 2-2 Arsenal, 2008 . This Villa Park clash was crucial at the top of the table with Arsenal having eyes on the league title, while Aston Villa were well in the hunt for Champions League football. The Gunners took control with goals before and after half-time from Denilson and Abou Diaby but Martin O’Neill’s side were far from finished. Gareth Barry netted a 65th minute penalty following William Gallas’s foul on Gabriel Agbonlahor, before Zat Knight clinched a dramatic draw after turning home Stiliyan Petrov’s cross in stoppage time. Gareth Barry fires home a 65th minute penalty to send Aston Villa on their way to a 2-2 draw against Arsenal . Zat Knight clinched a dramatic draw after turning home Stiliyan Petrov’s cross in stoppage time . 8. Manchester City 5-1 Hull, 2008 . While Villa were rescuing draws against Arsenal, Hull boss Phil Brown was busy giving one of the more unorthodox team-talks seen in recent times. With the Tigers 4-0 down at City thanks to doubles from Felipe Caicedo and Robinho, Brown held a three-minute team-talk at the break in front of the Hull supporters as he publicly gave his team a verbal lashing at the Etihad Stadium. It brought his team a consolation strike in the second half through Craig Fagan, only for Stephen Ireland to restore City’s four-goal advantage just two minutes later in the 82nd minute. Phil Brown berates his Hull City team during at half-time after they went 4-0 down by half-time . 7. Bolton 4-3 Newcastle, 2002 . It was the year in which defensive coaches were given Christmas off at Bolton and Newcastle with this game seeing three goals inside the first 10 minutes, with an Alan Shearer equaliser sandwiched between Jay-Jay Okocha and Ricardo Gardner goals for Bolton. The real shock here though wasn’t that Bolton would go on to win just their second home game of the season, but that Michael Ricketts (post England debut) would find the back of the net twice in the victory. His final league goals for the Trotters were enough to seal the points despite 71st and 79th minute strikes from Shola Ameobi and Shearer to set up a close finish. Michael Ricketts found the net twice as Bolton enjoyed a 4-3 win against Newcastle in 2002 . 6. Everton 2-6 Manchester United, 1977 . Back in 1977, Everton were the team going for the title and they were huge favourites at home to a United side languishing in 14th place in the old First Division table. Martin Dobson and Bob Latchford scored for Gordon Lee’s side. But goals from Lou Macari (2), Steve Coppell, Jimmy Greenhoff, Gordon Hill and Sammy McIlroy gave United a stunning win in front of nearly 50,000 at Goodison Park. Everton would go on to finish a distant third behind title winners Nottingham Forest and Liverpool, while United wound up in tenth at the end of the season. 5. Coventry 3-2 Arsenal, 1999 . The football world would be stunned if Coventry defeated Arsenal on home turf today, but even back in 1999 it was a big surprise when Gordon Strachan’s team turned over the Premier League title challengers on Boxing Day. Goals from Gary McAllister and Mustapha Hadji had given the Sky Blues a 2-0 lead at the break, and while Freddie Ljungberg pulled a goal back in the 67th minute for Arsenal, Robbie Keane restored the two-goal advantage five minutes later. A rare league strike away from home for Davor Suker set up a tense final four minutes but Coventry held on for what is to date their last win against the Gunners. Former Coventry striker Robbie Keane helped his side to a 3-2 festive period victory against Arsenal . 4. Oldham 3-6 Manchester United, 1991 . Remember when players would celebrate after scoring against former clubs? Well Dennis Irwin didn’t just do it once, he did it twice, after netting a brace on first return to Boundary Park since leaving Oldham for Manchester United – and gesturing wildly with his arms on both occasions. United gave youth a chance in this clash, and Oldham fans should have known better than to chant ‘donkey’ at Bryan Robson’s half-time replacement, as Ryan Giggs soon silenced his critics with a fine burst of pace on the way to scoring United’s sixth goal. 3. Charlton 4-2 Chelsea, 2003 . It was the first year of Chelsea under Roman Abramovich but it would be a miserable first Christmas under the Russian owner as it took Charlton just 42 seconds to get stuck into Claudio Ranieri’s turkeys. John Terry had levelled following Hermann Hreidarsson’s first minute opener, but Matt Holland nodded the Addicks back in front 11 minutes before the break. Charlton extended their lead to in incredible 4-1 margin after half-time through Jonatan Johansson and Jason Euell, with Eidur Gudjohnsen’s 72nd minute reply for the big spending Blues nothing more than scant consolation at the Valley. Matt Holland celebrates putting Charlton into a 2-1 lead against Chelsea in 2003 . Claudio Ranieri (left) and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink look dejected during the defeat . 2. Chelsea 4-4 Aston Villa, 2007 . A year before rescuing a draw against Arsenal, Villa were involved in another Christmas cracker as they severely dented Chelsea’s title aspirations at Stamford Bridge. A Shaun Maloney double gave Villa a 2-0 lead, only for Zat Knight to receive a red card which paved the way for Andriy Shevchenko to grab a rare brace and equalise in the 50th minute for Chelsea. Villa looked finished when Alex put the Blues ahead, only for Martin Laursen to equalise at 3-3 with 18 minutes left. Chelsea 4-4 Aston Villa saw eight goals, two penalties and three red cards . Michael Ballack wheels away in celebration of his second half free-kick at Stamford Bridge . Ricardo Carvalho was one of two Chelsea players to be sent off by referee Phil Dowd . Ricardo Carvalho’s red card evened up the numbers, but Chelsea seemed to have stolen victory two minutes from time through Michael Ballack’s free-kick. But Ashley Cole saw red having handled the ball to deny Villa a goal in the final minute, allowing Gareth Barry to rescue a point for O’Neill’s outfit from the penalty spot. 1. Derby 4-4 Manchester United, 1970 . A relic from a bygone era in football. The legends read off like any other big clash, Denis Law, George Best, Bobby Charlton, Dave Mackay and Archie Gemmill among the big hitters. The game was pretty decent too, with Law scoring twice along with Best to help United come from 2-0 down to lead 3-2 at Derby. The Rams hit back to lead 4-3 only for Brian Kidd to equalise for United. But there is an old school winter feel to this game which will never be seen again. Snow covered pitches added a different challenge to players rather than a cause for complaint at the nearest snowflake. Check out the packed out Baseball Ground too. They sure don’t make stadiums like that any more. It is games like this which prove you don't need perfect under-soil heated stadiums or tika-taka passing to have a superb game of football or a Boxing Day classic.","Sportsmail reveals the top 10 Boxing Day clashes .

"A Northern California woman pleaded not guilty Tuesday to multiple road-rage charges before asking the judge to set her bail at $100, all the while grimacing and gesticulating wildly in court. Dierdre Orozco, 50, is accused of trying to run two young women off I-80 north of Sacramento Saturday. Days earlier, she had been arrested and released because of another road-rage incident. Scroll down for video . All smiles: Dierdre Orozco, 50, was grinning in court Tuesday as she pleaded guilty to a slew of charges in connection to two separate road rage incident . Bizarre antics: The woman at one point pretended to steer a wheel while in court . Facing justice: The 50-year-old grimaced wildly and pretended to smoke an imaginary joint (left) The victims of Saturday's event filmed Orozco yelling and honking as she swerved her huge silver Ford Explorer Sport Trac pickup truck into the women's tiny Mazda. At one point, the dramatic video shows Orozco pulling her car in front of the victims — forcing them to stop — and claiming to be a highway deputy. Orozco, of Santa Clara, was charged with two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, two counts of false imprisonment, unlawful use of a badge, reckless driving and resisting arrest. At her initial court appearance Tuesday, the woman sat in her red jail garb flashing smiles and making odd gestures. KCRA cameras inside the courtroom captured the moment Orozco pretended to steer a wheel, made the horns gesture with her hand and pretended to smoke a joint and take a swig out of an imaginary bottle. Orozco's bail was initially set at $250,000, but the figure did not sit well with the woman. As the prosecutor was asking to raise the amount to $500,000, Orozco chimed in, asking the judge to 'put it at $100.' After spending the hearing pulling faces and playing with her hands, Orozco finally got a chance to speak, telling the court she would like her case to be handled in 'the most expeditious way.' The four people involved in the two separate road-rage incidents have sought a restraining orders against Orozco. Caught on video: Deidre Orozco, 50, is seen pushing two young women in California off the road and then blocking their path with her huge silver truck . Orozco got out of her vehicle and tried to convince the victims that she was a highway deputy (left). She was later arrested by the real cops and booked on traffic charges for the second time in five days (right) The Highway Patrol said the Saturday incident began after Mazda passenger Delanie Strykul made a rude gesture because Orozco’s Ford Explorer had been tailgating. Strykul said the woman cut them off twice, then slowed down to drive alongside their car. 'When she did that, I threw up my hands and flipped her off,' Strykul told CBS Sacramento. That got Orozco enraged, said Strykul and her companion, who 'feared for their lives.' 'She pulls in front of us and then pulls her car horizontal and stops us,' Strykul told CBS. The young woman frantically called the California Highway Patrol while keeping her phone camera rolling, recording the confrontation. ‘She just hit our car. She just hit our car. She's pushing us off of the road. Yes, she's pushing us off the road. She's coming for us,’ Strykul tells a CHP dispatcher on the video, her voice shaking. ‘Please help us.’ The video shows the Explorer forcing their Mazda onto the shoulder as the Mazda's driver screams. ‘I could not believe this was real. I was sitting there going, 'This has to be a joke,"" Strykul told The Associated Press on Tuesday. At one point, Orozco emerges from her truck and repeatedly knocks on Strykul's window and flashes an ID card claiming to work in law enforcement. Investigators said the badge was actually an ID card for a national chain of senior centers called Visiting Angels. Passenger Delanie Strykul (left) filmed the scary incident with Orozco and was eventually able to find the real cops to assist her (right) The young women manage to pull away — but Orozco gets back in the truck and begins to follow them. 'She did the whole zig-zag in three lanes with her flashers on, kind of like what a police officer would do if they were trying to slow down traffic,' Strykul told CBS. They eventually were directed to an interstate exit where a highway patrolman was waiting to make the arrest. Five days earlier, Orozco had been arrested for an alleged hit-and-run in nearby Roseville. After the accident, police told the Auburn Journal, Orozco proceeded to drive to her friends’ house where she threw rocks through the windows, vandalizing the home and threatening to kill the people inside.","California driver Dierdre Orozco, 50, is back in jail after she attempted to run two young women off I-80 near Sacramento .

"Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino will not panic if there are no major additions to his squad during the January transfer window. The Argentinian arrived at White Hart Lane in the summer following a successful stint as Southampton boss - with six new players also joining Spurs as Pochettino, as well as chairman Daniel Levy and technical director Franco Baldini, acquired the talent they felt could help them return to the Champions League. After a shaky start to the campaign, Pochettino now has his side playing some good football and, with a Capital One Cup semi-final against Sheffield United and a Europa League tie against Fiorentina on the horizon, Spurs sit just four points outside the Barclays Premier League's top four. Mauricio Pochettino says he is happy with his squad, after Spurs have shown improvement in recent weeks . United States international DeAndre Yedlin will link up with the squad in the new year after a deal was originally struck with his current club Seattle Sounders in August. But the 21-year-old is likely to be one for the future and, although Pochettino has been linked with a string of central defenders, he insists he would be happy if he is left with his current crop come February 1. American defender DeAndre Yedlin, 21, will join up with Tottenham in January, after agreeing a deal in August . 'We have a lot of chats and have I told him all my thoughts,' Pochettino said of transfer window discussions with Levy. 'We have common sense, when the window opens in January we will start to decide but so far we are very happy with our squad. 'I am happy, it's not about if you sign or not. I'm happy here and I'm happy with our squad. I never put pressure (on the chairman). Pochettino brought in six signings over the summer, including Federico Fazio and Benjamin Stambouli . 'We need to understand in football, when you are a head coach you need to try to explain to the chairman, sporting director, my thoughts and advice and then decide the best for the team.' Pochettino's squad will certainly come under scrutiny in the days leading up to the opening of the transfer window with home games against Manchester United and Chelsea following a Boxing Day trip to bottom side Leicester. But, with the potential of a fully-fit squad, it will be a good chance for the coach to show what strength he already has at his disposal - or indeed show the weaknesses that need improving with a dip into the transfer market.

"Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has banned his players from having their cars driven to the Old Trafford exit gates - so they have to mingle with supporters and sign autographs. The Dutch boss wants to improve fan engagement among his squad and his new policy recently saw Colombian striker Radamel Falcao ordered off the team bus to chat to eager fans who gathered in chilly temperatures at the club's Carrington training base.

"The response from Gareth Bale’s representatives this week when consulted by Sportsmail could not have been more emphatic. Asked if it was a fair assumption that Bale would not be going anywhere soon the message was: ‘correct, and you can leave out the word “soon”’. Bale joined Real Madrid last summer to win trophies. In just over 12 months he has won the Spanish Cup, the Champions League, the European Super Cup and the World Club Cup. In three of those four games he scored a crucial goal and in the other he fulfilled a dream by winning a major honour in his home city, Cardiff. For Bale the move has been a massive success and he is not about get off the trophy train after only one and a half seasons. Bale scores Real Madrid's second goal in the final of the World Club Cup in Marrakech . The Welsh star kisses the Club World Cup trophy, his fourth since joining Real Madrid the summer before last . He had the chance to join Manchester United the summer before last. Their offer came very late but was greater than Real Madrid’s and Bale could still have pulled the plug on the Spain switch and move to Old Trafford, but he chose to go ahead with the transfer to the Spanish capital and there is no desire to change course now. Neither is there any desire to move Bale on from Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. When Bale scored Real Madrid’s second goal against San Lorenzo last weekend to ensure his team won the World Club Cup club president Perez could be seen calling out ‘Bale!’ as he celebrated high in the Stade de Marrakech. When Perez spent £86m (100m euros) on Bale last summer he was criticized for replacing the popular Mesut Ozil and that criticism intensified when Bale struggled with injury and Marca’s front page declared he was suffering from a slipped disc that would need surgery. His gamble has been completely justified however and he is not about to let United take the player in January having beaten them to the punch less than two seasons ago. The Welsh winger has developed a knack of scoring in Real Madrid's most important games . Bale poses with fellow former Tottenham star Luka Modric after winning the Champions League last season . Carlo Ancelotti and assistant coach Paul Clement would also be in complete opposition to the move. When I asked Clement about the variety of Real Madrid’s attacking options he told me last month: ‘It’s a nice position to be in. With Bale the dynamic of the team is different. It breaks quicker. It looks to penetrate in behind more.’ Bale is a major reason why Real are now so unstoppable. They have the players to pass their way through teams but Bale gives them a more direct route to goal. With the player, the manager and the president all against any move it is difficult to see how United could prise him away from the Bernabeu. Their greatest hope could be that poll that revealed 54 per cent of supporters in favour of a sale at £120m. Manager Carlo Ancelotti (left) and President Florentino Perez (centre) are both keen to hold on to Bale . Some Real Madrid fans prefer the subtlety of Spanish midfielder Isco to Bale's pace and power . Despite interest from Manchester United there is no appetite from the player, or the club, for a move . Over 30,000 fans responded to Diario AS’s survey and you might have expected the club’s supporters to have been more vehement in their opposition considering all that Bale has done for the team in such a short time. A large portion of them are one-eyed when it comes to style of play and prefer Spanish international Isco’s more subtle flicks and tricks to Bale’s power and pace. The idea of the club making a profit on Bale and then going out to buy Marco Reus appeals to some. There is no apparent evidence of the Welshman having learned Spanish and while David Beckham also failed to speak the lingo in his four years at the club he got by with a fondness for the limelight that Bale shows no signs of developing. Like David Beckham, Bale has failed to learn Spanish, and he brings less showmanship than the Englishman . Real are keen to keep the 'BBC' frontline of Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo together . That linguistic reticence has contributed to the feeling of some that he would be replaceable. But for every fan that argues a big offer should be accepted there is another who will recall the four trophies that Madrid have won since he arrived – only three were won in the three years previous – and make the case for him being kept right where he is at any price. Bale is happy living in the ‘La Finca’ neighbourhood of Madrid close to Ronaldo and Karim Benzema the players he has formed the BBC strikeforce alongside. The Bale, Benzema, Cristiano trio looks set to keep Real Madrid at the top of world club football for the foreseeable future. Manchester United have many obstacles to cross if they are to persuade the world and European club champions to break it up.","Gareth Bale joined Real Madrid for £86m in 2013 .

"Manager Alan Irvine has praised West Brom starlet Liam O'Neil after his emergency full debut. The midfielder was not initially in the squad for their 3-2 Capital One cup win over Hull but was called on after Chris Baird pulled out through illness. The 21-year-old discovered he was starting just hours before kick-off and played a major part in Albion's victory on Wednesday. Youngster Liam O'Neil (centre) only found out he was playing against Hull two hours before kick-off . The 21-year-old put in an impressive display and played a big part in two of West Brom's goals . His cross led to Brown Ideye's opener and his 87th-minute corner finally fell to Gareth McAuley, who volleyed in to set up a grandstand finish. Saido Berahino won the game a minute later as Albion stunned the Tigers to progress to the fourth round and book a trip to Bournemouth. O'Neil had only previously made three substitute appearances for the Baggies but Irvine hailed his impact. West Brom manager Alan Irvine (right) was very impressed with his young charge's performance . 'Liam only found out he was playing on the afternoon of the game because Chris complained of feeling unwell,'  Irvine told the club's official site. 'I have to say I thought he was outstanding and showed us what he is really capable of doing. 'It was a superb exercise for us because we managed to get full games out of so many players who needed them. 'To get a performance and result like we did as well only adds to the satisfaction.' O'Neil will now hope to play more regularly for the Baggies, starting with the visit of Burnley on Sunday .","West Brom praised young midfielder Alan Irvine for his role in Wednesday's 3-2 win against Hull .

"Former West Ham and Watford boss Gianfranco Zola has been appointed the new manager of Serie A side Cagliari. Zola, 48, has previous connections with the club having spent the final two years of his playing career there after a seven-year spell at Chelsea prior to that. Earlier in the week La Gazzetta dello Sport suggested that the 48-year-old was favourite for the job with the Serie A strugglers and could set to be appointed during the two-week winter break. Former Watford and West Ham boss Gianfranco Zola is favourite for the Cagliari job according to reports . Zdenek Zeman has been sacked by Cagliari with the club struggling in Serie A this season . Zola, who played for Cagliari between 2003 and 2005, has not had a job since resigning from Watford in December 2013 following a poor run of form. Zeman was appointed in July and guided Cagliari to a 4-1 victory over Inter Milan in September, but the Rossoblu have won only one match in 12 subsequent fixtures. Last Thursday's 3-1 defeat to Juventus proving to be the final nail in Zeman's reign, which left Cagliari languishing three points adrift of safety in 18th place, with no win in their last eight games.

"Addison Cresswell died of a heart attack after taking cocaine at a Christmas party, an inquest heard . A top showbiz agent who represented Jonathan Ross and Michael Macintyre died of a heart attack after snorting cocaine at a Christmas party, an inquest heard. Addison Cresswell, 53, who helped launch the careers of many of Britain's top comedians, died on December 23 last year - just 72 hours after he had taken the drug. His wife Shelley, who did not attend the party, woke in the middle of the night to find her husband gasping for breath beside her, a coroner was told. He was taken to hospital where he later died. Today St Pancras Coroner, Jacqueline Devonish, ruled he had died a 'drug related' death. Miss Devonish added that pathologist . Professor Marco Novelli, who carried out the post mortem, confirmed 'cocaine had been taken three days prior to death, but there was no use . within the last 72 hours. 'The . pathology report showed he had suffered from an acute myocardiac . infarction along with a coronary artery atherosclerosis triggered by . cocaine usage. 'On the balance of probabilities the death was drug related.' She added: 'His work was clearly very stressful in working with the media. 'It . is clear he did engage in occasion use of cocaine but this did not . occur with family or at home but seemed to occur only at social events. 'His . wife said at the Christmas party he attended 72 hours before his death . he took cocaine, the toxicology report confirms this. 'He . was not a drug abuser in so far as he was not dependent on drugs. He . took drugs occasionally and I am satisfied this was the cause of death.' She recorded a verdict of drug related death. Cresswell's management company 'Off the Kerb' has represented Alan Carr, Jo Brand, Jack Dee and Lee Evans. Through the firm 'Open Mike' he also produced Live at the Apollo. Cresswell represented Jonathan Ross, left, and Michael McIntyre among many other comedy talents. Creswell died in hospital a few days before Christmas last year, and inquest was told . The inquest heard that Cresswell, who had been hospitalised in 2007 with cocaine psychosis, had a history of heart problems as well as drug and alcohol abuse. In a statement read Mrs Cresswell, who was too distressed to attend the inquest, said: 'He sometimes took cocaine on the odd occasion after a long period of work as a way of letting go and releasing stress. 'I never witnessed his drug use first hand. He never took cocaine at home and we never discussed it.' Referring to his time in hospital she said: 'After a long party he was hospitalised with a diagnosis of stress and cocaine. The comedy agent also represented Jo Brand, pictured. His family said they were still in 'shock' following his sudden death . 'The incident scared Addison and he stopped attending late night social engagements. In the last eight years he attended the odd social occasion after a media event but these were few and far between.' Mrs Cresswell described her husband as a very 'private' man. 'His life was sometimes hectic and stressful, but he was very happy, he had achieved a happy medium between work and his personal life. His brother, William Luke Cresswell, said: I believe he took cocaine socially but not with family. It was such a shock.' Paramedic Sean Leatham, who treated Cresswell at his home in Thornhill Crescent, Islington, said: 'We were called at about 2.51 to reports of a 53 year old man in cardiac arrest. 'We arrived at 2.56pm. We saw a woman upstairs performing ineffective CPR on a man on the floor. We told her to step away. 'There was no pulse and no breathing efforts so we performed CPR. We then cleared a space so we could perform advanced life support.' He added: 'As we maintained life support we took a medical history from his wife, which established stress and a previous case of pneumonia. 'He had taken cocaine at a party 72 hours ago and had been complaining of chest pains for 24 to 48 hours before.' Cresswell was rushed to University College Hospital where doctors carried out eight cycles of CPR and administered adrenaline but without success. He was pronounced dead at 5am. Comedian James Cordon tweeted his condolences shortly after the manager's death . TV host Dermot O'Leary also paid tribute to Cresswell - describing him as a 'Titan of the industry'","Comedy agent Addison Cresswell, 53, died on December 23 last year .

"The challenging festive period is often a time in which Premier League titles can be won and lost. With fixtures piling up and squads feeling the strain, the statistics show that some teams cope much better than others. Here, Sportsmail delves into the most fascinating facts and stats from the Premier League Boxing Day fixtures of the past. Manchester United are the kings of Christmas . When it comes to picking up three points on Boxing Day, Manchester United reign supreme having lost just one of their 22 fixtures (a 3-1 defeat against Middlesbrough in 2002). With that impressive tally giving the Red Devils an 86.4 per cent Boxing Day win ratio, it's no wonder that the Old Trafford club have collected 13 Premier League trophies, often being known for hitting form during and after the festive period. Juan Sebastian Veron was in the Manchester United team the last time they lost on Boxing Day, in 2002 . United went 2-0 down to Hull City last season, but came back to win 3-2 and continue their Boxing Day form . United fans have come to expect victories immediately after Christmas with just one defeat in 22 years . Lukas Podolski scores for Arsenal against West Ham during last year's Boxing Day fixture at Upton Park . Arsenal are just behind Premier League rivals United with a 68.2 per cent win ratio having won 15 of their 22 Boxing Day clashes while drawing six and losing just once. In third place are Liverpool who could do with some festive cheer after a difficult start to the 2014-15 Premier League season, but the Reds are without a Boxing Day victory since the departure of Rafael Benitez in 2010. Both Arsenal, with 15 wins, and Theo Walcott (centre), with six goals, have an excellent Boxing Day record . Walcott's goal against West Ham last season was his sixth on Boxing Day, the most of any current player . Everton and Aston Villa beware . Three of the 20 current Premier League teams are without a win on Boxing Day with Burnley, Hull and Swansea losing every single December 26 fixture they have played in. Hull have never won in the Premier League on Boxing Day, and may not get a better chance than last year . However, as those three sides have played just seven top flight Boxing Day fixtures between them, we must look elsewhere to discover who may be dreading Friday afternoon the most. Of the Premier League teams to have played over 19 Boxing Day fixtures, Aston Villa have recorded a disappointing 13.6 per cent win ratio with just three victories 22 fixtures making Paul Lambert's side the worst Boxing Day team in Premier League history. A Gareth Bale hat-trick saw Villa lose  in 2012, part of their record as the league's worst Boxing Day club . Ki Sung-Yueng scored the only goal from the penalty spot as Everton lost on Boxing Day last year . Despite 22 years of top flight experience, Everton have picked up just six wins while drawing on seven occasions. Newcastle also seem to suffer from a Christmas hangover winning only 20 per cent of their Boxing Day games which doesn’t look like improving anytime soon with a visit to Old Trafford ahead of them. Gareth Barry loves Boxing Day . Over the years, certain players seem to have a knack of popping up with vital festive goals for their teams. Robbie Fowler leads the way with eight goals scored for Liverpool and Manchester City between 1994 and 2004. Thierry Henry and Robbie Keane were also masters of finding the net on December 26 with seven goals each during their time in the Premier League. Robbie Fowler scores one of his two goals against Leeds United on Boxing Day 1997 at Anfield . Fowler has found the net eight times on December 26, making him the Premier League's Boxing Day leader . Of the stars still plying their trade in the Premier League, Arsenal's Theo Walcott tops the goalscoring list with six. Everton midfielder Gareth Barry is the surprise name on our list, netting three times for Villa and once for City. With Mark Hughes' Stoke visiting Goodison Park on Friday, Barry will no doubt be looking to continue his festive form. Gareth Barry scores from the spot against Arsenal in 2008, the third of his four career Boxing Day goals . Barry will hope his surprising Boxing Day form can help Everton overcome their disappointing league form .

"A 'happily married' couple are attempting to sue the owners of a website that claims to expose cheaters after they were shocked to find their own photos and malicious posts about them on the social media site. Jared Powers and Winona Valdez of Sacramento, California, claim they’ve been happily - and faithfully - married since 2009. But when Powers recently googled his own name he was stunned to find anonymous posts on Cheaterville.com accusing him of being unfaithful, along with photographs of him and his wife - including on their wedding day. Scroll down for video . Happily married? Jared Powers and Winona Valdez of Sacramento, California were shocked to find their details on a site exposing cheaters . When Powers googled his own name he was stunned to find anonymous posts on Cheaterville.com accusing him of being unfaithful . Power said he felt ‘shocked, angry and betrayed,’ after reading that he was allegedly ‘gay, married and having an ongoing affair with another man.' Plus that he was also 'looking for sex on craigslist.’ The couple strenuously deny all the claims made on the site about them. ‘We're very private people. We have an honorable marriage,' Valdez told ABC News. She claims the photos were stolen from her Facebook page and then posted on the cheating website, which has the tagline: ‘Don’t be the last to know.’ Cheaterville founder James McGibney claims he started the site not to hurt people, but to provide a database of information about two-timers. Valdez claims this photo from her wedding day was stolen from her Facebook page and then posted on the cheating website . The couple are furious about appearing on the site and have filed a defamation lawsuit suing not only the people responsible for the anonymous posts, but also the website's owners . ‘It was not started for revenge or malicious intent. It was designed to warn people. And I'm never going to change that thought,’ he told ABC. Cheaterville provided Powers and Valdez with the I.P. Address . of the person who posted their photos, but the couple say . they don't know them. They are furious about appearing on the site and have filed a defamation lawsuit attempting to sue not only the people responsible for the anonymous posts, but also the website’s owners. The federal lawsuit claims the couple suffered ‘severe distress, loss of reputation and economic damages’ as a result of the postings. The website, which has the tagline: 'Don't be the last to know,' claims to help expose relationship cheaters . An attorney for Cheaterville argues that the website isn't legally responsible for content posted by third parties. According to the lawyer, liability can only be attached to the person who made the statements and cites the example that Facebook isn’t liable if someone defames another person on that social media platform. The couple claim Cheaterville goes further than just allowing people to air their gripes, which is legal. They are confident their lawsuit will succeed if they can argue that the site actually helps users create content, because its business plan is specifically based around attracting slanderous and libelous comments.

"Another man has been sprung impersonating an army officer - possibly to get a discounted coffee - after being confronted by an actual veteran. Christian Parmer, 21, a former U.S. Army Combat Engineer, told The Daily Mail he was at Fresno International Airport on Monday going through security when he noticed the apparent officer sitting down drinking a Starbucks. What stood out to Parmer was the fact the man had his hat on inside - which is against protocol -and he informed a police officer who was walking by. 'I just knew he wasn't military, but I could hear him talking about being in the EOD,' Parmer said. Scroll down for video . Sprung: This 44-year-old man was approached by a veteran at Fresno International Airport, and after some questioning admitted he was not actually an army officer . Imposter: The man's story changes numerous times, but he says the perfectly-fitting uniform belongs to his stepson and that he had nothing else to wear that day . Legitimate: Former U.S. Army Combat EngineerChristian Parmer, 21 - pictured here at his wedding with wife Sarah - said he knew immediately the man in the uniform was not an army officer and alerted airport police . Impersonating a veteran is illegal under the Stolen Valor Act. The airport police officer asked Parmer - who served for over three years - to accompany him to speak to the man. The two then interrogated the man, with Parmer filming the encounter and later uploading it to YouTube. 'If you're EOD, what's the R.E. factor of C4?' Parmer asks in the video. 'What's your MOS?' The phony quickly folds, and admits the uniform actually belongs to his stepson. He curiously said he didn't have anything else to wear to the airport that day to pick up his father. 'None of his story made sense, he was all over the place,' Parmer said. The man also admitted to having an arrest record, stemming from a domestic violence charge 'four or five years ago'. Parmer said the man is 44 and from California. He was told to move along but was not further reprimanded. 'I'm glad he got caught - people can't go around acting like that,' Palmer told The Daily Mail. Fox News then confirmed with the Starbucks in the terminal that he had received a discount of 20 percent on his coffee. Parmer said after serving over three years and seeing out his contract, he left the army to be with his wife, Sarah, and get a different kind of job. Earlier this month, a Pennsylvania man was caught a similar situation. Sean Yetman, 30, was spotted parading around Oxford Valley Mall dressed in camouflage fatigues and wearing military honors that he couldn't possibly have been awarded. A YouTube video of a confrontation between him and Ryan Berk, a Purple Heart recipient, who was immediately suspicious of Yetman's mismatched uniform. Sean Yetman, the 'phony' army ranger who was confronted at a Pennsylvania shopping mall on Black Friday by a decorated Afghanistan vet, has previously pleased guilty to impersonating a police officer . A Bucks County Court summary shows that in May 2003 he pleaded guilty to impersonating a public servant. Yetman has refused all offers to speak to the media since the incident, but his fiancée told Army Times that he has ‘spiraled into a deep depression’ since being exposed. Adrienne Lally said Yetman lost his job and has had a nervous breakdown. ‘The phone calls do not stop, and we are now hearing death threats. All of this has us concerned for our children and their safety,’ she wrote via email. ‘He is a good man with a very big heart and this backlash has spiraled him into a deep depression.’ Under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, it is illegal for an individual to fraudulently portray him or herself as a recipient of any of several specified military decorations or medals with the intent to obtain money, property or other ‘tangible benefit.’ Yetman, who insists on the video that he is who he says he is, may have been using the uniform as a means to obtaining military discounts at the mall.","Man, 44, was sprung at Fresno International Airport .

"Pope Francis celebrated Christmas Eve with a late-night Mass in St Peter's Basilica after making a phone call to refugees in Iraq who have been forced to flee their homes by ISIS. In the phone call, the Pontiff told refugees at the tent camp in Ankawa, northern Iraq, that they too were like Jesus and were forced to flee because there was no place for them. His call of Christmas greetings came as the Vatican prepared to host the Mass, with the Pope already unveiling a statue of the baby Jesus in a nativity scene. Scroll down for video . Pope Francis swings incense around the statue of the baby Jesus after it was unveiled in St Peter's Basilica earlier this evening . The Pontiff then bent down to kiss the figure of Jesus in the nativity scene as he prepared for the traditional Mass in the Vatican . Before the ceremony, the Pope called Iraqi refugees forced out of their homes by Muslim militants to pass on his Christmas greetings . The Pope carries the statue of the baby Jesus during the Mass, where he said Christmas is a time to remember God's message of peace . Earlier this week, the Pope had written a Christmas letter to the Christians of the Middle East expressing his closeness to them . The Pope told the refugees: 'You're like Jesus on this night, and I bless you and am close to you. 'I embrace you all and wish for you a holy Christmas.' The Ankawa camp houses mostly Christian refugees forced to flee the onslaught by militants of ISIS. In a letter to Middle East Christians penned earlier this week, Francis urged them to remain in the region, where Christian communities have existed for 2,000 years, and to help their fellow Muslim citizens present 'a more authentic image of Islam' as a religion of peace. Pope Francis has written a Christmas letter to Christians in the Middle East to express his closeness to them at a time of 'afflictions and tribulations' Pope Francis holds a cross in the late night service in St Peter's Basilica, which marks the start of a busy festive period for the 78-year-old . The Mass came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins, including lusting for power and suffering from 'spiritual Alzheimer's' During the Mass hours later in St Peter's, Francis echoed some of the themes he raised in the phone call as he reflected on the Nativity scene. 'How much the world needs tenderness today!' he said. 'God's patience, God's closeness, God's tenderness.' In his homily, the Pope, wearing white vestments, said Christmas is a time to remember that God's message of peace 'is stronger than darkness and corruption'. He said: 'The question put to us simply by the infant's presence is, ""Do I allow God to love me?"" Do we have the courage to welcome with tenderness the difficulties and problems of those who are near to us?' It is the second Christmas season for Pope Francis as leader of the Roman Catholic Church and being elected last year. The Mass marked the start of a busy few weeks for the 78-year-old that includes New Year's Eve vespers and 2015 greetings a few hours later. On January 6 he will celebrate Epiphany Mass, and on January 11 he will baptise babies in the Sistine Chapel. A day later he gives his annual foreign policy address to diplomats before boarding a plane for a week-long trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines. Today he focused his concern on those weeping in the world this Christmas, singling out refugees, hostages and others suffering in the Middle East, Africa and Ukraine as he prayed for hope and peace during his traditional Christmas Day message. Anguish for children who are victims of violence, including in the recent terrorist attack on a Pakistani military school, tempered the pontiff's speech, which he delivered from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. Tens of thousands of Romans and tourists crowded into St. Peter's Square to hear Francis deliver the 'Urbi et Orbi' message - Latin for 'to the city and to the world'.

Cardinals gather around to pray around the statue of the baby Jesus during Christmas Eve mass in St Peter's Basilica . The service in the Vatican came just days after Francis excoriated the Vatican bureaucracy for a laundry list of sins, including lusting for power and suffering from 'spiritual Alzheimer's'. Many of the same cardinals, bishops and priests who received the dressing down were on hand in St Peter's Basilica for the Mass. Several have spoken out in recent days saying Francis was merely asking them to examine their consciences, as any Jesuit spiritual director would do, and to use the Christmas season to heal. Meanwhile, thousands of pilgrims also flocked to Bethlehem to travel to the Church of the Nativity for traditional Christmas Eve celebrations. On a crisp sunny day, revellers crowded into Manger Square, stopping in restaurants and admiring the Christmas tree in the town, where Jesus is believed to have been born. Scout troops could be heard playing bagpipes, horns and drums, while street traders sold Santa hats and special sesame sweets for children.

Monks hold up the cross as they parade from Jerusalem to Bethlehem outside the Church of Nativity as part of their annual Christmas Eve celebrations . The procession through the town, where Jesus is believed to have been born, was led by Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal, who led Midnight Mass in Bethlehem . The celebrations brought a boost to the area after a difficult year, which saw Israel battle Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip during a 50-day war over the summer. The Church of the Nativity, built over the grotto that Christians believe is the site of Jesus' birth, was flanked by a towering Christmas tree and a large poster in Arabic and English that read 'All I want for Christmas is justice.' Palestinian tourism minister Rula Maaya said: 'Our message this Christmas is a message of peace like every year, but what we added this year is that all we want from Christmas is justice.

'Justice for our people, justice for our case and the right to live like all other people in the world in our independent state without the occupation.' A procession was also led by Latin Patriarch Fouad Twal from his Jerusalem headquarters into Bethlehem, passing through Israel's concrete separation barrier, which surrounds much of the town. Israel built the barrier a decade ago to stop a wave of suicide bombings but Palestinians view the structure as a land grab that has stifled the town's economy. The celebrations brought a boost to the area after a difficult year, which saw Israel battle Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip during a 50-day war over the summer . Street traders sold Santa Claus hats and masks, and handed out sesame sweets to children where the people began to gather . Mr Twal said he hoped 2015 will be better than the past 'difficult' year. He explained: 'I hope next year there will be no separation wall, and I hope we will have bridges of peace instead.' One of the pilgrims making the trip to the Bethlehem was Irene Adkins from Lorain, Ohio. A Palestinian policewoman hands out flowers to pilgrims in Bethlehem this afternoon as they waited to enter the Church of the Nativity . Visitors lit candles inside the Church of the Nativity, where a gold star embedded on the floor marks the spot where Jesus was believed to have been born .

It feels wonderful.' Meanwhile Simon Bassett, a British tourist, came to Bethlehem with his wife and three-year-old daughter. He said: 'We're very happy to share Christmas with the Palestinian people and we hope that the peace and joy that comes with Christmas will spread from this place to the whole earth and that the people of all races will learn to live in harmony together.' And as Christmas Day was ushered in around the world, Christians celebrated Mass at churches and cathedrals around the globe.

"Just in time for Halloween, Titan has put on a ghostly show near its north and south poles. Saturn's moon produced a strange glow from massive emissions of two trace gases that moved along its dawn-dusk line. These regions are curiously shifted to the east or west, so that dawn is breaking over the southern region while dusk is falling over the northern one. High in the atmosphere of Titan, large patches of two trace gases glow near the north pole, on the dusk side of the moon, and near the south pole, on the dawn side. Brighter colors indicate stronger signals from the two gases, HNC (left) and HC3N (right); red hues indicate less pronounced signals . Researchers are baffled as to why these gases have moved off the poles – a phenomenon that conflicts with how scientists believe Titan's atmosphere behaves. The pair of patches was spotted by a Nasa while investigating the chemical make-up of Titan's atmosphere. It has stumped scientists because they believed that concentrated pockets of gas such as this could not exist in the moon's upper atmosphere due to its ferocious winds. 'This is an unexpected and potentially ground-breaking discovery,' said Martin Cordiner, an astrochemist at Nasa. 'These kinds of east-to-west variations have never been seen before in Titan's atmospheric gases. Explaining their origin presents us with a fascinating new problem.' With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere . The mapping comes from observations made by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (Alma), a network of high-precision antennas in Chile. Researchers were able to obtain spatial maps of chemicals in Titan's atmosphere from a 'snapshot' observation that lasted less than three minutes. With its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry, Titan resembles a frozen version of Earth several billion years ago, before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere. Because Titan is smaller than Earth, its gravity doesn’t hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly, so the atmosphere extends 370 miles (595 kilometres) into space. As on Earth, the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons, although the seasons on Titan are about seven Earth years long. Titan's ‘water’ is liquid methane, CH4, better known on Earth as natural gas. Regular Earth-water, H2O, would be frozen solid on Titan where the surface temperature is -180°C (-292°F). With Titan's low gravity and dense atmosphere, methane raindrops could grow twice as large as Earth's raindrops. As well as this, they would fall more slowly, drifting down like snowflakes. But scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades. Titan's atmosphere has long been of interest because it acts as a chemical factory, using energy from the sun and Saturn's magnetic field to produce a wide range of organic, or carbon-based, molecules. In this study, the researchers focused on two organic molecules, hydrogen isocyanide (HNC) and cyanoacetylene (HC3N) that are formed in Titan's atmosphere. At lower altitudes, the HC3N appears concentrated above Titan's north and south poles. But the highest altitudes, the gas pockets appeared to be shifted away from the poles. These off-pole locations are unexpected because the fast-moving winds in Titan's middle atmosphere move in an east–west direction, forming zones similar to Jupiter's bands, though much less pronounced. Within each zone, the atmospheric gases should, for the most part, be thoroughly mixed - not distinct as is seen in these gases. The researchers do not have an explanation for their findings yet. 'It seems incredible that chemical mechanisms could be operating on rapid enough timescales to cause enhanced 'pockets' in the observed molecules,' said Conor Nixon, a planetary scientist at Nasa. This true colourimage captured by Cassini before a distant flyby of Saturn's moon Titan shows a south polar vortex, or a swirling mass of gas around the pole in the atmosphere of the moon . 'We would expect the molecules to be quickly mixed around the globe by Titan's winds.' At the moment, the scientists are considering a number of potential explanations, including thermal effects, previously unknown patterns of atmospheric circulation, or the influence of Saturn's powerful magnetic field, which extends far enough to engulf Titan. Further observations are expected to improve the understanding of the atmosphere and ongoing processes on Titan and other objects throughout the solar system. Studying this complex chemistry may provide insights into the properties of Earth's very early atmosphere, which may have shared chemical characteristics with present-day Titan. The complex and dynamic atmosphere of Titan displays multiple haze layers near the north pole in this view .","Maps of Saturn's moon Titan reveal shining patches of trace gases .

"WhatsApp is set to add voice calls to its app for the first time in a bid to take on Skype and other messaging firms. The move is expected to open up major new markets for the firm Facebook bought for $19bn. It will allow users of the app to make voice calls to contacts in the same way they would send a message. The screens of the feature were recreated by a Dutch web site from code in the app . Dutch site AndroidWorld uncovered the screenshots in test code. The 'screenshots' above have been created by AndroidWorld.nl's Sander Tuit, who extracted layout files, images, and text from the raw code of the app hosted on WhatsApp's website. It is expected the feature will work exactly like text or picture messages. Users will be able to use either their handset or a bluetooth headset to make calls. A phone-like page will show calls made an received. Earlier this month the firm, the firm updated its app to make it harder to avoid WhatsApp messages, or at least claim that you haven't seen them. The Facebook-owned app will display two blue ticks in the bottom right-hand corner of an individual message to show that it has been read. And clicking on the message will show you the precise time the recipient opened and read it. The app update is available across all mobile platforms. From now, a single grey tick means the message has been sent, a double grey tick means it has been delivered, and two blue ticks mean it has been read (pictured) More information about the features can be found on WhatsApp's FAQ page. Before the update, there were only two types of tick - a single grey tick meant the message had been successfully sent, and a double grey tick meant it had been delivered. Now, when a message has been sent, delivered and read, the double grey tick turns blue. In a group chat, the second ticks appear when all participants in the group have received the message. WhatsApp, the global messaging system owned by Facebook, has begun using a new encryption program aimed at protecting users' conversations from unwanted surveillance and snooping. The messaging service, which has 600 million users, added the new encryption to its last update for Android smartphones, according to Open Whisper Systems, the San Francisco-based software group. Privacy advocates say WhatsApp's decision to incorporate so-called 'end-to-end' encryption will help users communicate without the fear of someone reading their messages. WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum has said he's deeply committed to user privacy because he grew up in the Soviet Union during the 1980s, when his mother and other adults routinely assumed that authorities eavesdropped on their phone calls. The two blue ticks only appear when all participants in the group have read the post. To see what time the messages were read users can now press and hold down on a particular post. Selecting the Message Info option reveals the time the message was read, and in the case of group messages, what time each member read it. WhatsApp has rolled out the changes to all variations of its app, across iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Nokia S40, Nokia S60 and BlackBerry 10. Users need to update the app on their devices to see the changes. However, these changes have divided opinion, especially on Twitter. Some users are concerned the update makes it harder for them to ignore others, and makes it easier for people to keep tabs on them. As @the_baba1 wrote: 'So WhatsApp now shows blue ticks to indicate a message has been read. Now stalk with more vengeance.' Twitter user @carpocarp said: 'The WhatsApp blue tick is going to ruin friendships,' while @archielbar added: 'Those blue ticks will be the death of some of us!' But not all Twitter users were concerned about the update - @tnicole91 explained: 'I don't get why some people are stressed about this new WhatsApp blue tick. 'For me, if I don't feel like replying, I just don't.' In a group chat, the blue ticks only appear when all participants have read the message.To see what time the messages were read, users can now press and hold down on a particular post and select the Message Info option. In the case of group messages, this reveals what time each individual member read it (pictured) WhatsApp explained the changes and revealed what the new check marks look like on an official blog post . In an official blog post, WhatsApp tried to reassure users who may be concerned about why a person hadn't received or read their messages. 'If you only see a single check mark next to your message, there is likely nothing wrong with WhatsApp or your phone,' explained the developers. 'There may be several reasons why your message has been sent, but not delivered to your chat partner such as their phone might be off, they could be sleeping, especially if they live in a different time zone, they might be experiencing network connection issues or they might have seen the notification on their screen, but did not launch the app - especially common if the recipient uses an iPhone.' It is not currently possible to opt out of this feature. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which has a similar feature on its Messenger app. When a message is opened and read, a tick appears in the message list and the time it was read appears in the bottom right-hand corner of the post. Apple's iMessages also use this feature.","Move will open up major new markets for the messaging app .

"It's a long way from Tasmania, where Princess Mary of Denmark grew up in a small brick house  on a quiet residential street. Danish officials have shared pictures of the stunning Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, where Princess Mary, Crown Prince Frederik and their four children call home. Dating back to the 1700s, the rococo style interiors are on full display including richly decorated walls, beautiful murals and intricate crystal chandeliers. Scroll down for video . Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen, one of Denmark's many royal residences, is made up of four identical palatial buildings . Princess Mary, Prince Frederik and their children (pictured on holiday in Greenland in August) call the Amalienborg palace home . Pictured is the  banquet hall in Amalienborg, featuring beautiful crystal chandeliers and gold detailing on the doors and ceiling . The Frederik VIII's Palace, also known as Brockdorff's Palace, was fully restored before Mary's family moved in in 2010 . Danish artist John Korner completed a wall painting in the banqueting hall, as part of the restoration completed four years ago . Pictured is the modest brick childhood home of Princess Mary in the riverside suburb of Taroona, in the Tasmanian capital Hobart . The Amalienborg palace complex is made up of four identical buildings which stand around an octagonal courtyard. Frederik VIII's Palace, also known as Brockdorff's Palace, is the residence of Mary, Frederik and their children Prince Christian, nine, Princess Isabella, seven and three-year-old twins Prince Vincent and Princess Josephine. The other three castles that make up the complex are Christian VII's Palace, Christian VIII's Palace and Christian IX's Palace. Frederik VIII's Palace, which was built between 1750 and 1760, was given a complete interior and exterior restoration before Mary and Frederik moved in in 2010. The royal couple personally selected 10 Danish artists to paint modern artworks on the palace's walls and ceilings, including John Kørner and Kathrine Artebjerg.

For Christmas this year the Danish Royal family have gathered at Fredensborg Palace in the country's north. Queen Margrethe and Prince Consort Henrik are hosting Mary and Frederick's family, along with Prince Joachim, Princess Marie and their children Henrik and Athena. Including the Danish Queen's sisters - Queen Anne-Marie of Greece and Princess Benedikte - and extended family members there oculd be up to 50 people celebrating the festive season at the palace, Billed Bladet reported.

"Arrested: Devon Coley, 18, was arrested on Monday after posting a threat to police on social media . Police have increased security at some stationhouses and made at least four arrests over threats made since the deadly shootings of two officers last weekend, and the mayor vowed on Wednesday to protect officers. Emergency Services Unit officers and swat teams were providing additional protection at two Brooklyn precincts, where they were stationed starting Tuesday. Graffiti reading, 'kill the cops' lined the streets of Brooklyn as cops searched for suspects threatening police safety. Police said on Wednesday they were remaining vigilant while investigating the origin of the threats, which they didn't detail. Meanwhile, an 18-year-old was facing charges of making a terroristic threat after authorities said he put up a menacing photo and message online on Saturday hours after the afternoon ambush of Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos by a gunman who had signaled his plans on social media. Teenager Devon Coley posted a photo on his Facebook page Saturday night of a gunman shooting at a patrol car, symbols showing a gun pointed at an officer's head and a caption with his local precinct's number and '73 next,' according to a court complaint. His lawyer, Daniel Ades, said on Wednesday that the state terroristic-threats law was being misapplied. 'Nobody's condoning threats against police,' he said, but 'even if this is proven, it doesn't amount to a crime.' He noted that the law requires a 'reasonable expectation or fear' that a threat meant to influence government or intimidate the public is about to be carried out. Prosecutors sought $250,000 bail for Coley, who was already facing unrelated gun possession and other charges, the New York Post reported. Court records show a judge released him without bail on the threats charge. Officials said they had assessed hundreds of online postings and calls to emergency lines, initiating about 40 threat probes, with about half of those being closed or referred to other agencies. The police department said one 52-year-old man had been arrested after walking into a Manhattan stationhouse and saying: 'If I punch you in the face, how much time will I get?' and refusing to leave. Increased threats: Police have increased security at two New York City stationhouses while investigating threats against them in the wake of the deadly shootings of two officers last weekend . Incriminating post: Devon Coley, 18, allegedly posted this photo of a man shooting police along with the caption, '73 next' indicating he was targeting the 73rd precinct . In addition, two Staten Island residents were arrested in separate incidents on Tuesday.  A 16-year-old named Yasin Shearin was arrested on a charge of making a terrorist threat and a 46-year-old man was charged with making a false report. Mayor Bill de Blasio denounced the various threats Wednesday and said the city 'will protect the men and women who protect us.' 'New York City stands with our police officers in this time of tragedy, as we do every day, and our city will not be intimidated by those spouting hateful, violent messages,' he said in a statement. In Colorado, a 33-year-old military veteran was arrested Monday for posting online threats calling for the killing of current and former police officers under the name 'Vets Hunting Cops.' And in Northern California, presidents of the three biggest Northern California police unions warned that recent anti-police sentiments are threatening officers' safety. Recent demonstrations against police brutality have devolved into tasteless vilification of officers, including chants calling for dead police officers, the union heads said in a letter posted online Tuesday. Stationed: NYPD swat team members now stationed outside 79th and 81st precinct stationhouses after alleged threats from the Baltimore based gang the Black Guerrilla Family . Police said on Wednesday they were remaining vigilant while investigating the origin of the threats. A confidential informant told cops about rumors of a gang plot to 'shoot it out' at the station houses, reported the NY Post. The gang member who supposedly made the threat served three years in jail for robbery and attempted murder, reports the NY Post. Cops were varied in their opinion of  how serious the threat was to their safety. A senior police official told the NY Post, 'We’re investigating that threat, but at this time, it does not appear to be credible.' President of the Sergeants Benevolent Association, Ed Mullins, seemed to think the threat was a cause for concern. Amping up security: A confidential informant told cops about rumors of a gang plot to 'shoot it out' at the station houses so they are increasing security accordingly . 'I’m told it’s credible,' said Mullins . 'We’ve got emergency service personnel providing additional security outside of precincts. It’s credible.' This is the second supposed threat against police that comes from the Black Guerilla Family this month. CBS reports that the 75th and 104th precincts in Queens also received telephone bomb threats on Tuesday but that both buildings were swept by the bomb squad and cleared. Earlier this month,police were instructed to wear bulletproof vests and also bring extra ammo because of a 'verified' threat that they were being targeted by the Baltimore based gang. On Saturday, Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos were killed by a gunman who had posted online about his plans to attack police. Ramos and Liu worked in the 84th precinct, which is also in Brooklyn. Early on Saturday morning, before murdering officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, Ismaaiyl Brinsley turned up unannounced at his ex-girlfriend's home in Owings Mills, Maryland and pointed a gun to his head, according to Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce. NYPD officers: The gunman  fired a fatal round of bullets at Wenjian Liu (left) and Rafael Ramos (right) Gunman: Brinsley killed himself after he was chased into the subway by cops following the murders . Victim: Shaneka Thompson, pictured, managed to talk her ex-boyfriend Ismaaiyl Brinsley, 28, out of shooting himself on Saturday but he shot her instead and went on to kill two police officers in Brooklyn . His ex, Air Force reservist Shaneka Thompson, managed to talk him out of taking his life - before he turned the gun on her instead. After his attack on Thompson, he rode a Bolt bus to New York - as police started tracking Thompson's cellphone in a bid to follow him. After arriving in New York City, he took the subway to Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where he dumped his ex-girlfriend's stolen cell phone. Around this time, Baltimore County Police sent the NYPD a fax alerting them to Brinsley and his intentions - but it did not reach cops on the streets in time. Brinsley identified his targets at Tompkins Avenue in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, then instructed passersby to watch before firing four shots at the two police officers in their car. He then ran into the subway station but a waiting train closed its doors. With police making chase, he then shot himself dead. On Tuesday, uniformed cops had laid bouquets, lit candles and left toys around the street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of the city where a crazed gunman shot dead officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu. In mourning: Slain NYPD officer Wenjian Liu's wife, Pei Xia Chen, comes back from the 84th precinct and needed assistance standing and officers helped her back to her home . Ignoring requests: Despite calls from New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio to curb protests until after the funerals of slain NYPD officers, demonstrators took to the streets to exercise their first amendment rights . They were joined by mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, who also laid flowers at the site in a show of unity with the police force, elements of which say the mayor had turned against them before the deaths. Wenjian Liu's wife, Pei Xia Chen, needed assistance standing as officers helped her back to her home following the news. De Blasio later led city officials in a moment of silence at 2.47pm Monday - exactly three days after Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on officers Ramos and Liu as they sat in their patrol car. Officers amassed at the memorial fell silent to honor their fallen comrades, as city leaders urged people around New York and the country to do the same. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of New York City on Tuesday evening to condemn police brutality, ignoring calls from New York's governor, the city's mayor and others calling for restraint in the wake of recent news. Protesters, carrying signs reading ‘Jail Killer Cops’ and 'Stop The War On Black America' marched en masse to demand justice for those who have died recently at the hands of police. The rallies began in Union Square and outside City Hall and protesters then marched through midtown Manhattan. Some protesters chanted 'Hey-hey, ho-ho. These racist cops have got to go' and 'How do you spell racist? N-Y-P-D.' as they marched along Fifth Avenue. The demonstrations went on despite calls by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday for a hiatus on demonstrations until after the funerals of the two NYPD cops - Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu - murdered by Ismaaiyl Brinsley on Saturday. Organizers ignored de Blasio's call for the march to be cancelled and said there was no reason to 'give in to hysteria' and call off the event. At first, marchers stayed on the sidewalks as a large police presence, with officers - some wearing riot helmets and face shields - keeping protesters from impeding holiday traffic.","Devon Coley, 18, was arrested on Monday allegedly targeting the 73rd Brooklyn precinct on his Facebook page .

CELTIC (4-2-3-1): Gordon (Zaluska 46'); Matthews (Lustig 46'), Ambrose (O’Connell 46'), van Dijk (Findlay 46'), F.Twardzik (Izaguirre 46'); Kayal (Johansen 46'), Biton (Mulgrew 46'); McGeouch (Griffiths 46'), Commons (Henderson 41')  McGregor (Boerrigter 46'); Pukki (Fridjonsson 46') Sporting all purple and the No 26 jersey, the 31-year-old hadn’t played a competitive game since April 2012 because of a succession of knee injury complications. This felt just like being back in the big time for the £9million man, even in the pre-season environment of a stadium less than half full. It was all of six minutes before he was required to use his invaluable full stretch, throwing himself right to claw away Marvin Stefaniak’s diagonal drive. ‘It felt like a big moment for me,’ said Gordon. ‘It was an awkward shot to the far corner. When he hit it, I thought it was going to be more comfortable than it was. ‘It was full stretch in the end but I was happy at that, got a decent hand on it to keep it out and get it wide. It settled me down a little bit. ‘I was a little bit nervous but I get that before every game. Friendlies can feel like not a proper game but it did in this place, a nice stadium, and it was noisy behind me. ‘That was probably good for me to help me concentrate on the game, an added help rather than a hindrance. It felt like a normal match. ‘I’ve worked really hard over the past couple of years to get to this point and, although it was only 45 minutes, it’s definitely a step in the right direction.’ On target: Kris Commons opened the scoring for Celtic in the first half . Gordon has been patient to build towards making his career comeback this season, including a lengthy training spell with Rangers last term. His tolerance for waiting will have its limits, though, as he sets himself targets to play as much as possible to make up for lost time. ‘I just want to play games,’ said the former Hearts and Sunderland  goalkeeper. ‘I’ve done a reasonable amount of training over the past few months, since January. It’s the game  situations I am looking forward to getting into now. ‘That’s what I want. Doing that has been a large part of my life and not to have that over the past couple of years has been difficult. It was nice to get a piece of that back — then get a clean sheet.’ Lukasz Zaluska replaced Gordon at the break but there was one switch forced upon the manager that gave more cause for concern. As Gordon put his injury woes well behind him, scorer Kris Commons hobbled off just before the interval, nursing a thigh problem after a thudding challenge by over-physical Dresden defender Michael Hefele. Deila reported no ill effects thanks to the precautionary withdrawal and Commons should be passed fit for the Champions League second qualifying round return leg against KR Reykjavik at Murrayfield  on Tuesday. The teams wore black armbands and observed a moment’s silence before kick-off as a mark of respect for 10 people killed in a horrific motorway bus accident in the early hours of yesterday morning. New man: Ronny Deila is now looking ahead to Celtic's Champions League second round qualifier on Tuesday . The home crowd then cranked up the atmosphere, even though this was only a friendly, the bulk of  the din coming from behind  Gordon’s goal in the first half. That said, the comeback star ensured his defenders could  understand his ire clearly. He  certainly made himself heard as errant marking gifted Luca Durholtz a chance, which he fluffed at the back post. Celtic were smartly into the lead below a searing sun on eight  minutes. Teemu Pukki, playing through the middle, shielded the ball well with his back to goal and Commons read the signals to latch on to the lay-off with a sweetly struck, low left foot drive past an unsighted Benjamin Kirsten. This was the sixth match of  Celtic’s new season and Deila had  no wish to sap any energy from influential players ahead of what he hopes are five more Champions League qualifiers. Taking a cue from the World Cup, there were water breaks midway through each half — not something that will trouble Celtic in the  domestic season. Dynamo, relegated to the third tier of the German game, start their league next week. So with Tuesday’s tie in mind — then either Legia Warsaw or  St Patrick’s the following week —  there was no surprise when Deila started an entirely different XI in the second half. That included Stuart Findlay and Eoghan O’Connell as a centre-half pairing, and Icelandic Under-21 international Holmbert Fridjonsson — too often frustrated by taking a heavy touch — up front. Much misfiring from the hosts had meant Gordon wasn’t relentlessly  occupied. Instead it was Zaluska who ended up picking the ball out of  his net. Emilio Izaguirre cleared Stefaniak’s clipped finish off the line but it fell to the feet of Sylvano Comvalius, who took time to select his spot and fire home from six yards.","Craig Gordon keeps a clean sheet in long-awaited return .

"When Xabi Alonso arrived at Bayern Munich, some were sceptical. Why had Bayern effectively traded a young, homegrown star in Toni Kroos, for an ageing Spaniard in Alonso? A few weeks later, Alonso is already being heralded as a new hero. The Spanish international has established himself as the new rock at the centre of Bayern's midfield, winning man of the match in his first two appearances for Bayern. In just five Bundesliga games, the former Liverpool man has had 679 touches, and made 558 successful passes, giving him a pass completion rate of 89 per cent. The high point came on Saturday afternoon in Cologne, where Alonso not only secured Bayern's defensive structure in a somewhat reckless 3-3-4 formation, but also set about breaking as many records as possible. Xabi Alonso confounds his critics in emphatic fashion with some scintillating displays for Bayern Munich . Alonso has proven his passing talent remains undiminished despite the midfielder being 32 years old . Alonso completed 175 passes against Cologne on Saturday, more than the entire opposition team . His 175 completed passes in 90 minutes were more than opponents FC Cologne managed as a whole team. He also had 206 touches of the ball, smashing the previous Bundesliga record, which Spain and Bayern team-mate Thiago had set at 177 last season. Alonso remained humble after the game, saying “it's nice (to have broken the record), but I'll have to look at the statistics myself. The German press were less reserved, singing Alonso's name from the rooftops. “Alonso is the new linker and thinker in Bayern's game!” cried Bild. Welt described him as a “phenomenon”, and calculated that the Spaniard had touched the ball around every 26 seconds in the 2-0 win over Cologne. The former Liverpool and Real Madrid man touched the ball 206 times against Cologne, a Bundesliga record . This graphic shows the successful 175 passes that Alonso made in Bayern Munich's 2-0 win over Cologne . Given that Alonso only cost Bayern around 6.5 million pounds, Premier League fans may be wondering why the major English clubs did not make more of an effort to sign him. Upon Alonso's arrival, he did admit that he was reluctant to return to England for fear of tainting his Liverpool legacy, and also said that Pep Guardiola had been a huge factor in his decision to go to Bayern. With only a two year contract, Alonso is seen as a short term solution for Bayern, and the club reportedly chose to sign him rather than Sami Khedira for that reason. In a couple of years, Alonso is expected to make way for the younger midfielders emerging from Bayern's youth set up. For now, though, the new signing's immediate impact in Bayern's midfield is particularly crucial given their current injury crisis. With Javi Martinez, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Holger Badstuber all out long term, Bayern's options in central defence and defensive midfield have taken a severe hit. Alonso has filled the gap effortlessly. A major factor in Alonso turning down moves to the Premier League this summer was Pep Guardiola . The Spaniard won the man of the match award in his first two games for the Bavarian side this season . Worries remain, however, over Alonso's own fitness. The Spaniard is reportedly suffering from long term ankle problems, and apparently only takes part in full training once or twice a week. For the rest of the time, he is limited to light jogging. Pep Guardiola expressed his concerns about Alonso's fitness earlier in the month, saying: “he can't do everything. We must help him. He can't play every game with this much energy, or he'll be dead in a month”. That, even in the figurative sense, would be a disaster for Bayern. For while the team struggles to adapt to new tactical innovations and serious injury blows, it is Alonso who is plugging the gaps. It is Alonso driving them to victory. It is Alonso keeping the Bayern ship steady. If he stays fit, the gentleman Spaniard could prove to be the signing of the year.","32-year-old Xabi Alonso has quickly won over any skeptics to his signing .

"Created: . 13:55 EST, 19 August 2014 . Labour frontbencher: Shabana Mahmood has been accused of ‘encouraging mob rule’, after she joined an anti-Israel protest which forced a Sainsbury’s supermarket to close . A Labour frontbencher was accused of encouraging mob rule last night after she boasted of taking part in an anti-Israel protest that forced a supermarket to close. Shabana Mahmood lay in the street outside a Sainsbury’s store in Birmingham alongside dozens of pro-Palestine campaigners, protesting against the fact that it was ‘stocking goods from illegal settlements’. Her ‘direct action’ forced the supermarket to close for several hours on a busy Saturday, the MP claimed. She then used YouTube to brag about her actions, calling for a boycott of Israeli goods – in direct contravention of Labour policy. But a Sainsbury’s spokesman disputed Miss Mahmood’s account of what happened, saying the store was closed for ‘less than 30 minutes.’ Last night the Muslim MP, who speaks for the party on tax and growth policy, was accused of ‘stirring up tensions’ by Jewish leaders. They said the Birmingham Ladywood MP was promoting public disorder, and branded her behaviour ‘completely inappropriate’. Labour said Ed Miliband had spoken to Miss Mahmood, who told him she does not support a boycott of Israel. But critics said this did not go far enough and called on her to apologise. Simon Johnson, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, said: ‘It is completely inappropriate for a Member of Parliament to promote public disorder that forced a supermarket to close. We believe that she has been made aware of her party’s opposition to boycotts and has back-pedalled, but an apology is yet to be heard.’ Vivian Wineman, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ‘Such rabble rousing is extremely irresponsible.’ In her YouTube video on August 2, Miss Mahmood said: ‘I’m just here, it’s Saturday afternoon, at a peaceful protest outside a Sainsbury’s store in central Birmingham.  It’s half past three and the store has actually just shut as a result. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: In a video posted on YouTube Miss Mahmood boasted of her involvement in the protest in the Sainsbury’s store in central Birmingham on August 2 . Action: Miss Mahmood was involved in the ‘direct action’ protest which saw dozens of pro-Palestine campaigners lie down outside the store in Birmingham city centre, forcing it to close . ‘That’s about four-and-a-half hours of . business that Sainsbury’s is losing for supporting the goods from the . Israeli settlements that are illegal under international law.’ Her . comments are in direct opposition to Labour policy. In March last year, . Mr Miliband told the Jewish Chronicle he thought boycotts of Israel . were ‘totally wrong’. Since then, several other supermarkets have been . targeted. They include a Tesco in Birmingham where protesters stormed . the store, threw food and fought with police. Tory . MP Mike Freer said: ‘Once again we see the ugly side of Labour and the . weakness of Miliband. His unwillingness or inability to rein in a front . bench spokesman who is encouraging these sort of targeted attacks speaks . volumes. MP: Critics have demanded that Miss Mahmood, pictured after she was elected in May 2010, apologise . ‘For any Parliamentarian to encourage mob rule as a way of protesting is shameful.’ A . Labour spokesman said: ‘Ed Miliband has been clear that Labour does not . support boycotts of Israel and we resolutely oppose the isolation of . Israel. ‘Labour remains committed to a comprehensive peace based on . a two-state solution, international law and a secure Israel alongside a . secure and viable state of Palestine. Having spoken to her, Shabana has . made clear that she does not support calls for a boycott of Israel but . supports the proper labelling of goods from the region.’ Speech: At a pro-Gaza rally in Hyde Park on August 9, she told the audience of tens of thousands of people to take 'practical action' to join in the Israeli boycott . Outspoken: In a video posted online she told the crowd: 'We managed to close that store for five hours at peak time on a Saturday. This is how we can make a difference.' Anger: Jewish groups said the Birmingham Ladywood MP was guilty of 'promoting public disorder', and branded her behaviour 'completely inappropriate' Jewish . community leaders have warned that the targeting of  supermarkets risks . importing  Middle Eastern violence into the UK. Over the weekend, . Sainsbury’s removed kosher foods from a  central London store amid . fears  it would be ransacked by demonstrators.

Kyle, who earned 10 caps for his country, left his last club Ayr United earlier this year and is now working 12-hour shifts on the Regina Baltica at Lerwick.

"Manchester United’s sense of injustice over Wayne Rooney’s red card on Saturday has been heightened by their private view that defender Luke Shaw was the victim of a headbutt by West Ham forward Diafra Sakho. United manager Louis van Gaal made the slightly peculiar claim on Saturday night that Rooney’s foul of Stewart Downing in the second half of his team’s 2-1 win at Old Trafford was no worse than some tackles committed by their opponents. However it was an alleged incident between Shaw and Sakho that infuriated United as the teenage full-back left the stadium sporting a huge shiner beneath his left eye.

The Manchester United captain was sent off for a rash challenge on Stewart Downing (L) United would not comment publicly on the matter but at one stage in the second-half Shaw was seen remonstrating with a linesman who he clearly felt should have picked up the incident. On Sunday night, the FA had no record of a complaint and will wait to see if there is anything in the report of referee Lee Mason when it drops on Monday morning. Shaw was also critical of the decision to send off Rooney and claimed his tackle was no worse than a trip on him by Sakho earlier in the game. 'We have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza’s red card as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn’t stop play,' said Shaw. 'Earlier in the game, Sakho did the same to me. 'But I just focus on winning games and I’ll keep doing that.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"The death of a high-profile mystery shopper known as 'the master of disguise' has sent shivers through the tight-knit world of mystery shoppers and led some to speculate that she was attacked because of her work. Marjorie Hillerman, 61, was found December 9 in the parking lot of Livermore Premium Outlets in northern California with a severe head wound. She died a week later. Police are baffled by her death. The injuries to her face and head suggest she could have fallen. However, the wounds could have been delivered by an attacker. At least one friend fears she was murdered. Scroll down for video . Victim: Marjorie Hillerman's injuries were revealed while she was in a parking lot for the Livermore Premium Outlets on December 9 . The Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition, a trade group that represents people who pose as customers to evaluate customer service at stores and restaurants, has warned its members to be on guard and wary of attack, the San Jose Mercury-News reports. 'We don't believe she just fell. She wasn't that type of person. She was just too on top of things,' Pamela Olmstead, president of the Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition and a friend of Hillerman, told the newspaper. 'It has frozen our community. That's the impact she had on us.' Hillerman was well-known among mystery shopper and had a reputation for being able to quickly change her appearance so that store clerks wouldn't recognize her. No one saw what happened that day, and no CCTV tape is available, the website reported. Police told the website that it does not appear a robbery took place. Friend: Pamela Olmstead, a friend of Marjorie Hillerman, has said Hillerman was known as 'the master of disguise' Speaking about the investigation, Officer Steve Goard told Bay Area News Group 'It's been a struggle. It could have been a fall or an assault; it could be any number of things. ...It's baffling.' 'There's nothing that leads us in any one direction,' he also said. Goard also told the media outlet that it doesn't seem the 61-year-old Hillerman got inside Livermore Premium Outlets whatsoever. She had all of her items and her rental car was unharmed, he also said. In a release issued earlier this month, Livermore police said 'We received information from the public regarding a white 4-door sedan that was seen leaving the area around the same time as the incident.' Hillerman's friend Pamela Olmstead of the Independent Mystery Shoppers Coalition told Bay Area News Group that Hillerman often spoke at conferences for the mystery shopper industry. Olmstead also stated that the upcoming conference will include safety instruction. Bizarre: No one saw what happened that day at the outlet mall, and no CCTV tape is available . Speaking to NBC Bay Area, Olmstead said 'What I fear happened is that either someone wanted something she had, or they hit her with a car and left out of fear.' 'It's my hope somebody's going to be watching this and say ""Hey, I saw that incident, I saw what happened"" and come forth and tell somebody so we can find out what happened,' Olmstead also said. Speaking about her friend's nickname, Olmstead told NBC Bay Area 'Margie could go from being a brunette to a blonde to blackhead to long hair, wearing jeans to wearing a skirt in a matter of seconds.'

"Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has accused the Football League of attempting to 'kill' the beleaguered Championship side. The Italian had his appeal against being disqualified as a director dismissed on Monday after a Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) rejected Cellino's appeal after deciding his tax evasion conviction in Italy was an offence of dishonesty. As a result the 58-year-old has to step down as director, cut ties with Leeds and not partake in any significant influence over the club until April 10, when his conviction becomes spent under UK law. Massimo Cellino (centre) watches Leeds play Brentford at Griffin Park with the away fans back in September . 'They cheated. We got there and we were not able to fight,' Cellino told the Sun. 'We did not expect it to be arbitration. We expected a court, where you can challenge and put in your case. 'This was an ambush. It was a three-man panel, all three from the League,' added Cellino. 'The League are trying to hurt the club, that's my only conclusion. The club will not fall apart because I'm stepping away.' Cellino is evidently furious that he failed the Football League's fit and proper person test in December due to his conviction for tax evasion in Italy: . 'They say I am not fit and proper but I have put more than £30million of my own money into this club and I'm not here to make quick money for myself. When I arrived we were more than £55m in debt. Now the debt is £13m, I have cleaned this club.' Massimo Cellino's appeal against the decision to disqualify him from owning Leeds has been rejected . Cellino (right, pictured in April 2014) and Leeds said they were 'surprised and disappointed' with the decision . In its judgement the PCC stated on Monday: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. 'We therefore conclude that Mr Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'. 'As a result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015.' On the pitch, Leeds have not won since December, despite a late equaliser against Birmingham on Saturday . In a statement on the Leeds United website, Cellino and the club made a short comment on Monday's decision: . 'Mr Cellino would like to thank the fans, sponsors and members of the wider footballing community that have given him overwhelming support, not just since the disqualifying order was issued but since he arrived at the club. 'We are surprised and disappointed by the verdict, however we are continuing to take legal advice. 'We will release further statements in due course.' A Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by Tim Kerr QC has rejected an appeal by Leeds United President Massimo Cellino against the recent decision by the Board of The Football League that he is subject to a disqualifying condition under its Owners' and Directors' Test. The PCC found that the reasoned judgment of the Italian Court, once it had become available, was for an act involving dishonesty as determined by the Board in its original ruling in March 2014. Mr. Cellino's appeal against that original decision had been upheld on the basis that it could not be concluded that the offence necessarily involved a 'Dishonest Act' for the purposes of the Test. Once the reasoned judgment became available, the Board considered the matter again and concluded that it clearly demonstrated that Mr. Cellino's offence did indeed involve acts that would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. In its judgment, dismissing Mr Cellino's appeal against the decision, the PCC states: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr. Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. We therefore conclude that Mr.Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'. As are result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015. The Football League will provide any assistance requested by Leeds United to help it minimise, as far as possible, the effect this decision has on the Club while Mr. Cellino serves his period of disqualification. A Football League spokesman said: 'The Football League's sole objective throughout this process has been to ensure that our regulations, as democratically approved by our member clubs, are complied with. These regulations uphold principles relating to club ownership that are widely recognised to be in the interests of the game and have the support of the other football authorities, the Government and football supporters generally.' The constitution of the PCC was agreed between the two parties ahead of last week's hearing and The Football League would like to thank Tim Kerr QC and the other members of the panel for their time. In addition, a further misconduct charge against Mr. Cellino and the Club for failing to supply the Italian Court judgment to The Football League when it first became available will be heard by a Football Disciplinary Commission in line with League regulations in due course.","Massimo Cellino had been disqualified from being allowed to run Leeds United after a tax evasion conviction in Italy .

"George H.W. Bush must spend at least some of Christmas in the hospital after doctors ordered him to remain under observation for a second night following his admission for shortness of breath. The 90-year-old former president will stay at Houston's Methodist Hospital on Wednesday night 'as a precaution until doctors can evaluate whether he is healthy enough to return home. He was rushed to the hospital on Tuesday night with shortness of breath as wife Barbara read 'Twas the Night Before Christmas to children with NFL star JJ Watt at a public event. Family spokesman Jim McGrath said Bush - who is the oldest living president - had a 'good day' and his prognosis 'remains positive.' Scroll down for video . George H.W. Bush is being kept for observation at Methodist Hospital in Houston 'out of abundance of caution' on Tuesday night. He is pictured here at a Houston Texans game on November 23 . Bush is the oldest living former commander in chief. He was hospitalized for seven weeks in January 2013 for a bacterial infection and a cough - but later discharged . Barbara Bush read 'Twas The Night Before Christmas with Houston Texans player JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts on Tuesday before her husband's hospitalization was announced . It's not known whether the former commander in chief will be allowed to return home on Thursday to celebrate at least part of Christmas with his family. Bush spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care at the same hospital while being treated for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues. He was discharged in January 2013, after nearly two months in the hospital. President Barack Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii, has been notified about Bush's hospital admission. 'President Obama and the first lady send their good wishes to the former president and the entire Bush family during this holiday season,' said White House spokesman Eric Schultz. Bush made two public appearances last month. He attended an event at Texas A&M University with his son, former President George W. Bush, and served as the coin-toss captain for the Houston Texans during a Nov. 23 game that honored the US Armed Forces. The elder Bush was a naval aviator in World War II — at one point the youngest in the Navy — and was shot down over the Pacific. Mrs Bush and Watt were the special guests for the Radio City Christmas Spectacular in Houston . Methodist Hospital in Houston is the top-rated hospital in Texas and is nationally ranked, as well . Bush served two terms as Ronald Reagan's vice president before being elected the nation's 41st president in 1988. After one term, highlighted by the success of the 1991 Gulf War in Kuwait, he lost to Democrat Bill Clinton amid voters' concerns about the economy. The elder Bush has skydived on at least three of his birthdays since leaving the White House. In June, he celebrated his 90th birthday by making a tandem parachute jump near his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the winter, Bush and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston. Bush, also a former U.S. ambassador to China and CIA director, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease that has forced him in recent years to use a motorized scooter or wheelchair for mobility. Bush's wife, Barbara Bush, made a surprise visit with Houston Texans' JJ Watt at the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts in Houston on Tuesday evening to perform 'Twas the Night Before Christmas.' It's not clear whether she was with the 41st U.S. president when he experienced his shortness of breath . Methodist Hospital is rated as the top hospital in Texas by US News & World Report. It is ranked nationally, as well. Patriarch: George H.W. Bush's son George W. Bush served two terms as president.

"It wasn’t just Ben Stacy’s astonishing arrival in 1975 as a baby with blue skin that shocked doctors. The 37-year-old descended from an extraordinary family in Kentucky - and although the colour soon diminished from him, his lips and fingernails still went blue when he became cold or angry as a child. He came from an isolated family whose members were born with a condition that discoloured them, as a result of a coincidental meeting of recessive genes, intermarriage and inbreeding in the 1800s. Family history: Ben Stacy, 37, left, of Fairbanks, Alaska, is descended from a isolated eastern Kentucky family with an extraordinary colour defect . The story began when French orphan Martin Fugate settled on the banks of Troublesome Creek to claim a land grant in the early 19th century and married a red-haired woman named Elizabeth Smith. She had a very pale complexion - and their union brought on the ‘methaemoglobinaemia’ genetic mutation, also known as met-H, which reduces an individual’s ability to carry oxygenated blood. Minnesota-based blood expert Dr Ayalew Tefferi said the whole story is ‘fascinating’ and shows how society and disease can intersect - as well as the ‘danger of misinformation and stigmatisation.’ ‘If I carry a bad recessive gene with a rare abnormality and married, the child probably wouldn't be sick, because it's very rare to meet another person with the (same) bad gene,’ he told ABC News. Mr Stacy was born and taken to the University of Kentucky Medical Center, where doctors were amazed by his blue skin and quickly prepared a blood transfusion before his grandmother butted in. Heritage: Mr Stacy came from a family born with a condition that made them discoloured, as a result of a coincidental meeting of recessive genes, intermarriage and inbreeding in the 1800s (colourised photo) Couples: Ben Stacy is pictured with his wife Katherine, left, and his parents Hilda and Alva Stacy are seen right . She explained that he looked like his ancestors in Troublesome Creek and his great-grandmother Luna, who died aged 84, was once called ‘the bluest woman I ever saw’, reported ABC News. 'If I carry a bad recessive gene with a rare abnormality and married, the child probably wouldn't be sick, because it's very rare to meet another person with the (same) bad gene' Dr Ayalew Tefferi, blood expert . MailOnline tracked down Mr Stacy to the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, where he now works as a water plant supervisor. He gained a wildlife management degree from Eastern Kentucky University. The Fugate family tree shows Martin and Elizabeth had a blue boy called Zachariah who married his mother’s sister. Their son named Levy married into a nearby family and they had eight children. One of these children was Luna, who married John Stacy and had 13 children. Ben Stacy comes from this family line, reported ABC News. His mother Hilda Stacy, 56, lives in Hazard, Kentucky. There are other relatives in the Stacy line still alive in Virginia and Arkansas. MailOnline found Mr Stacy has a wife named Katherine Stacy in Alaska and they appear to have four children. Rural: The Fugates lived in an isolated part of eastern Kentucky and had little opportunity to mix with others . Diagram: Methaemoglobinaemia is . a recessive gene (shown by the small r), so rarely produces 'blue' people . As eastern Kentucky has become vastly more populated than the early 19th century, and as more genes are married into the Fugate family tree, there were far fewer children born with the condition. 'Luke was just as blue as Lake Louise on a cool summer day' Dr Charles H. Behlen II on seeing Luke Combs, a descendant of Fugate branch . The blue people in Kentucky began to disappear in the early 20th century as families moved apart and the disease therefore became less common as inbreeding reduced, reported ABC News. Looking at the old family portrait, they appear to have been either Photoshopped or made up to mimic characters from children's cartoon the Smurfs, but science proves that the condition is real. The family was first discovered in 1958 when Luke Combs, who was a descendant of another branch of the Fugates, took his white wife to a hospital and doctors ended up paying more attention to him. ‘Luke was just as blue as Lake Louise on a cool summer day,’ Dr Charles H. Behlen II said in 1974. Fortunately for the sufferers, there are no serious problems associated with the disease.","Isolated family in Kentucky started producing blue children in 1800s .

"A top Australian scientist has complained that basic classroom maths just doesn't add up. Australia's chief scientist Professor Ian Chubb said the subject is irrelevant and doesn’t prepare students for the workplace. He argued that this 'disconnect' needed to be investigated thoroughly as basic maths techniques like interpreting data, basic calculations and using graphs were not being applied properly in the workplace. Scroll down for video . Basic classroom maths does not prepare students for the workplace it has been argued by Australia's chief scientist Professor Ian Chubb . The issue needs to be investigated thoroughly as basic maths techniques were not being applied properly in the workplace . News.com.au reported that a new study, conducted by the Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers, the Australian Industry Group and the Office of the Chief Scientist, examined 12 workplaces including engineering, drafting, manufacturing, retail, mining and defence. Prof Chubb said as maths was at the core of many careers, the study had implications for individuals as well as workplaces. The study recommended that school-based research should look at how to help classroom maths reflect what is needed outside of the classroom. It was also advised that the Australian Curriculum directed schools in how to transfer maths skills to the workplace. Basic mathematics content in the national curriculum could be taught through a range of contexts . There should be an emphasis on the 'real life' application of maths, Australian Association of Mathematics Teachers chief executive officer Will Morony said. 'Unless we in schools take particular actions to help students transfer their skills, students won’t be successful in the workplace,' he said. 'Otherwise we will still have this disconnect between the classroom and from what the workplace needs.'

"Police have released new information today in the death of a college student who was killed in 2012, including a chilling note that was left next to the girl's body. This Sunday will mark the two year anniversary of the murder of Faith Hedgepeth of Hollister, North Carolina, whose killer still remains at large. Among the new details being made available to the public is the existence of a note that was scribbled on a fast food bag left next to the University of North Carolina student's naked body, which read, 'I'm not stupid bitch jealous.' Scroll down for video . Tragedy: UNC student Faith Hedgepeth was found dead in her off-campus apartment on Sept. 7, 2012 . Chilling: The note left next to the victims bed (above) read, 'I'm not stupid bitch jealous' The note is believed to have been left by her killer. Other new details include the gruesome way the 19-year-old died, with WNCN reporting her body was found in a pool of blood, and blood spatter was found on the wall and bedroom closet door of her apartment. She was naked from the waist down and had her shirt pulled up over her breasts. Investigators also discovered semen on her body, thought to be left by her killer, that matched a man's DNA found elsewhere in the apartment. An autopsy determined that she had been beaten to death, dying of blunt force trauma to the head. 'As we approach the two-year anniversary of Faith's death, we're issuing an appeal to the public for help in finding her killer and with that help, we can bring some peace to Faith's family by bringing her killer to justice,' said Chapel Hill Police Chief Chris Blue. 'We've conducted an extensive investigation and we have excellent evidence. This is a very strong case. What we need to do is connect that case to Faith's killer.'

'Still not knowing after two years, it's really hard,' said the victim's mother Connie. Hedgepeth was discovered dead in her off-campus apartment on Sept. 7, 2012, at 11 am by her roommate, Karena Rosario. The girls had spent the previous evening out at a local club, returning home at around 3 am. Rosario then left their apartment at around 4:30 am, the last time anyone saw Hedgepeth alive. Her family is hoping this new information gets authorities the information they need to catch their daughter's killer. 'Still not knowing after two years, it's really hard,' said her mother Connie. 'But to me, the biggest question is why?' The young woman's father, Roland, seems  concerned with this happening to other young woman in the area. 'Whoever did this, whether it was one person or multiple people, are very likely to do it again and these people, or persons, are walking around free,' he said.

"A nine-year-old boy with a brain tumour told there was 'no hope' has defied expectations to beat cancer for the second time - just in time for Christmas. Shane Edwards, from Bradford, was first diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in February 2012, when he was just six years old. After undergoing two major operations, radiotherapy and months of chemotherapy, scans showed he was cancer-free and his family believed he had beat the disease. But they were hit with another bombshell in July this year, when they were told his cancer had returned. Doctors broke the heartbreaking news that there was 'no hope', but his family begged them to continue treatment. Joy: Shane Edwards (front) has been given the all-clear from cancer in time for Christmas, much to the relief of his mother Tracy,  brother Kyle (left) and and twin brother Scott . Due to Mrs Edwards' insistence, Shane received treatment and was taking chemotherapy tablets at home. Three months later, to their utter relief, a scan has revealed Shane has defied medics - as the tumour seems to have disappeared. He is now looking forward to spending Christmas day with his twin brother Scott, his two older brothers, Callum, 11, and Kyle, 12, and his parents Tracey and Philip. Mrs Edwards, 33, said Shane has just finished his fourth round of chemotherapy and the family will spoil the youngster this Christmas after such a traumatic year. 'We were devastated when the doctors told us the cancer had come back,' she said. 'Shane had been clear for over two years and we could not believe it. It is such a relief to hear the tumour has gone once again. 'We thought there would be a little bit of shrinkage following the chemotherapy, but we didn't expect the tumour to be totally gone. 'Now we can really celebrate Christmas without the worry of thinking about it. All the boys are going to be extra spoilt this year.' Shane will still have to undergo two further courses of chemotherapy at Leeds General Infirmary, which will finish in March, but doctors have dropped his regular scans from every three months to every six months. Mrs Edwards has also thanked a number of friends, family and well-wishers that helped raise money to pay for treatment, and for items on Shane's wish list, such as a petrol buggy. She and her husband were completely devastated when Shane was first diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2012. Brotherly love: Shane (left) with his twin, Scott. The youngster has just finished his fourth round of chemotherapy and the family are looking forward to celebrating this Christmas . After suffering intense headaches, and doctors ruling out various causes, he was eventually sent for a scan. His parents were devastated to be told he had a particularly fast-growing tumour called a grade 4 glioblastoma. According to Cancer Research UK, only about 20 in 100 children (20 per cent) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years. A glioblastoma is an aggressive and fast-growing form of brain tumour. Fast growing tumours are much more likely to come back after treatment than slow growing tumours. The outlook is not good for people with more aggressive grade 3 and 4 tumours. Only about 20 in 100 children (20 per cent) diagnosed with glioblastoma will live for five years. Many adults live for less than a year. Source: Cancer Research UK . Despite the poor odds, Shane underwent two major operations as well as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. His parents were delighted to hear the treatment had kept the cancer at bay. Months of regular scans came back clear, and they believed they could breathe a sigh of relief. However,  another headache he suffered in July this year rang alarm bells, and further tests showed the tumour had returned. Following the chemotherapy tablets and a recent scan, Shane's consultant in paediatric oncology, Dr Sue Picton, confirmed the tumour seemed to have disappeared, although he would have to continue his chemotherapy until the course is complete. Dr Picton said: 'This is really great news for Shane and his family. 'We're really pleased that the tumour seems to have responded so well to the chemotherapy treatment, and while not out of the woods just yet, this response to chemotherapy is much better than I expected.' Mrs Edwards added: 'I could not thank the staff at Leeds General Infirmary enough. They are all really good with Shane.'","Shane Edwards was diagnosed with a brain tumour in February 2012 .

"Leeds owner Massimo Cellino has had his appeal against being disqualified as a director dismissed, the Football League has announced. A Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by Tim Kerr QC rejected the appeal after deciding his tax evasion conviction in Italy was an offence of dishonesty. Cellino will now have to step down as a director, cut ties with Leeds and undertake not to have any significant influence over the club until April 10 when his conviction becomes spent under UK law. Massimo Cellino's appeal against the decision to disqualify him from owning Leeds has been rejected . Cellino will now have to step down as director, cut ties and agree not to have a significant influence until April . In its judgement, dismissing Cellino's appeal against the Football League's decision to disqualify him, the PCC stated: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. 'We therefore conclude that Mr Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'. 'As a result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015.' In a statement on the Leeds United website, Cellino and the club made a short comment on Monday's decision: . Cellino (right, pictured in April 2014) and Leeds said they were 'surprised and disappointed' with the decision . On the pitch, Leeds have not won since December, despite a late equaliser against Birmingham on Saturday . 'Mr Cellino would like to thank the fans, sponsors and members of the wider footballing community that have given him overwhelming support, not just since the disqualifying order was issued but since he arrived at the club. 'We are surprised and disappointed by the verdict, however we are continuing to take legal advice. 'We will release further statements in due course.' Cellino and Leeds will also face a further misconduct charge for failing to supply the Italian court judgment to the Football League when it first became available. 'This will be heard by a Football Disciplinary Commission in line with League regulations in due course,' said the Football League. The league also said it will provide any assistance requested by Leeds to help it minimise the effect on Cellino's disqualification. A Football League spokesman said: 'The Football League's sole objective throughout this process has been to ensure that our regulations, as democratically approved by our member clubs, are complied with. 'These regulations uphold principles relating to club ownership that are widely recognised to be in the interests of the game and have the support of the other football authorities, the Government and football supporters generally.' The findings of the hearing reveal that Leeds director Andrew Umbers claimed in a witness statement there was 'a real likelihood of insolvency' if Cellino was disqualified. The findings state: 'Mr Umbers explained that he is now a director of the club, and gave reasons why, in his view, there is good reason to fear severe adverse consequences for the club if Mr Cellino is disqualified from owning and operating it, and even 'a real likelihood of insolvency'.' A Professional Conduct Committee (PCC) chaired by Tim Kerr QC has rejected an appeal by Leeds United President Massimo Cellino against the recent decision by the Board of The Football League that he is subject to a disqualifying condition under its Owners' and Directors' Test. The PCC found that the reasoned judgment of the Italian Court, once it had become available, was for an act involving dishonesty as determined by the Board in its original ruling in March 2014. Mr. Cellino's appeal against that original decision had been upheld on the basis that it could not be concluded that the offence necessarily involved a 'Dishonest Act' for the purposes of the Test. Once the reasoned judgment became available, the Board considered the matter again and concluded that it clearly demonstrated that Mr. Cellino's offence did indeed involve acts that would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. In its judgment, dismissing Mr Cellino's appeal against the decision, the PCC states: 'We consider that the judge's findings of fact and her description of Mr. Cellino's state of mind based on them, is of conduct which would reasonably be considered to be dishonest. We therefore conclude that Mr.Cellino has been convicted of an offence involving a 'Dishonest Act' within the meaning of the rules, and that he is accordingly subject to a 'Disqualifying Condition'. As are result of this decision, Massimo Cellino is disqualified from acting as a 'Relevant Person', as defined by Football League regulations until 10th April 2015. The Football League will provide any assistance requested by Leeds United to help it minimise, as far as possible, the effect this decision has on the Club while Mr. Cellino serves his period of disqualification. A Football League spokesman said: 'The Football League's sole objective throughout this process has been to ensure that our regulations, as democratically approved by our member clubs, are complied with. These regulations uphold principles relating to club ownership that are widely recognised to be in the interests of the game and have the support of the other football authorities, the Government and football supporters generally.' The constitution of the PCC was agreed between the two parties ahead of last week's hearing and The Football League would like to thank Tim Kerr QC and the other members of the panel for their time. In addition, a further misconduct charge against Mr. Cellino and the Club for failing to supply the Italian Court judgment to The Football League when it first became available will be heard by a Football Disciplinary Commission in line with League regulations in due course.","Massimo Cellino had been disqualified from being allowed to run Leeds United after a tax evasion conviction in Italy .

"Bizarre claims: Igor Girkin said the bodies had been dead for days and reeked of decomposition . The rebel commander blamed for shooting down flight MH17 has made bizarre claims that bodies at the crash site 'aren't fresh'. Pro-Russian separatist Igor Girkin has claimed corpses near the debris died days before the plane took off. According to rebel website Russkaya Vesna, the leader was told by people at the scene in eastern Ukraine that 'a significant number of the bodies were drained of blood and reeked of decomposition.' Girkin, also known as Strelkov and allegedly a former Russian intelligence agent, also suggested that a large amount of blood serum and medications were found in the wreckage. The information has not been confirmed but the commander said: 'Ukrainian authorities are capable of any baseness.' He was said to be among the laughing rebels that filmed the plane as it crashed . Footage is said to have captured him gleefully bragging: ‘That was a blast – look at the smoke!’ while a fireball rose from the debris. The extraordinary footage – apparently filmed by the shooters themselves – charts the terrible final moments of the doomed airliner. A voice believed to be that of Strelkov – dubbed ‘Igor the Terrible’ – announces: ‘The plane was hit!’ He adds: ‘Look at those black spots, these are the parts, flying … it was a blast … look, look, black smoke!' As a pall of smoke was seen coming from the crash site, he wrote a triumphant war cry on Twitter, saying: ‘We warned you – do not fly in ""our sky”.’ The Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777 was shot down Thursday, killing all 298 people aboard. Shortly after the passenger plane was downed, Strelkov – seen smirking in propaganda photos – tweeted a boastful message claiming responsibility. At the time, he apparently believed he had shot down an Antonov-26 military plane of the Ukrainian Air Force, saying it landed near a mine named Progress. His chilling message read: ‘In the area Torez we just hit down An-26, it’s lying somewhere in the mine 'Progress'. ‘We warned you – do not fly in 'our sky'. And here is the video confirmation of the “bird dropping”. Boasting militant: The former Russian intelligence officer was said to be among the laughing rebels filmed the plane as it crashed yesterday . ‘Bird fell near the mine, the residential sector was not disturbed. Civilians are not injured.’ Later as the horror became clear, the tweet was deleted. Strelkov, who minutes earlier had been boasting about his ‘military’ success, seems to have gone to ground once he realised his catastrophic mistake. A man of mystery with at least three names, Strelkov believed by Ukraine to be a serving Russian colonel in the Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) of the country’s army – a charge firmly denied by Moscow. He commands pro-Russian forces now in control of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, but his enemies suspect he is a direct agent of the Kremlin.

"A 90-year-old veteran who was shot by a sniper during the Second World War had the bullet lodged in his hip for 69 years. Jack Mansell was just 21 when he was shot during Operation Market Garden in Arnhem, The Netherlands. The former vet from West Bromwich, West Midlands, thought the bullet had passed right through him in the attack - which saw 17,000 Allied troops perish. Bullet: Pte Jack Mansell, pictured in uniform aged 19, left, and at his brother's grave in 2004, right, had a bullet lodged in his hip for 69 years . Private Mansell went to doctors for an x-ray 30 years later following an abdomen injury and discovered the artillery was still in his hip. The bullet remained inside Pte Mansell, who fought in the Second Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment, until his death on November 14, 69 years after the infamous attack. Pte Mansell, who lost his beloved wife Evelyn ten years ago after a long illness, was cremated at West Bromwich crematorium on November 22 and the bullet was found among his ashes by staff. Five regimental standard bearers attended the service,  where a bugler played The Last Post in his honour. More than 300 friends and family, who raised . £620 for Help for Heroes, also attended to pay their respects. Remains: The bullet, pictured in its slightly melted state, was found among the veteran's ashes by staff at West Bromwich crematorium . Speaking after the service the veteran's nephew . Kevin Edwards, 53, said: 'During the 1980s Jack injured his abdomen . while moving some metal at work. 'A . routine hospital x-ray showed showed a bullet located in his right hip. 'All those years ago Jack had though the German bullet had passed . through him - in fact it was still lodged in his body. It was left there as it gave him no trouble. 'Later . in his life he used to tell people about the bullet in his right hip. He had loads of x-rays afterwards and they always asked if he wanted it . out but he said it didn’t bother him. Heroic: Pte Mansell, who fought in the Second Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment, was awarded these medals for his service . In honour: The hero, pictured with his nephew Kevin Edwards, at his brother's grave in 2004 . 'He lost his brother during the war, and he was a very proud man, never considered himself to be a hero even though he was. 'He was put up against the wall and a firing squad twice, after that he always said he could face anything. 'When he was cremated we asked them to keep an eye out for the bullet, but never thought it would make it out. 'Then when we collected his ashes the people from the crematorium also handed us an envelope. Happy life: Pte Mansell, pictured at home with his dog Buffy, died on November 14. His beloved wife Evelyn, right, died 10 years ago following a long illness . 'Inside was the bullet, it is a bit melted, but still we know what it is. 'He was a very popular well loved man. Men like him are literally a dying breed, and should never be forgotten. Operation . Market Garden took place between 17 and 25 September 1944 in the . Netherlands and Germany. It was hoped the mission, the largest airborne . operation at the time, might bring the end to the war by Christmas 1944. The . goal was to force an entry into Germany over the Lower Rhine. At first . the operation was successful, but at Arnhem, the British 1st Airborne . Division encountered far stronger resistance than anticipated. In . the ensuing battle, only a small force managed to hold one end of the . Arnhem road bridge and they were eventually overrun on 21 September. Pte Mansell was part of an anti tank unit when his team were landed by gliders. After fighting tanks for several days, he was shot by a sniper in the hip. The bullet is thought to have remained in its original state in his hip until his death. It only changed shape when the hero's body was cremated at the end of November. 'He was a wonderful man, he got me my job at the same factory he worked in. 'His war stories were amazing, I could sit and listen to him for hours.' Julie Wilds, Pte Mansell's daughter, added: 'My . dad was a very easy going, family orientated man. He was a massive . baggies fan and still went to a lot of matches in his old age. 'Despite . the amazing things he had done he didn’t really talk about it till his . later life, but when he did, the stories I’ve been told were amazing.' Pte Mansell was part of an anti tank unit when his team were landed by gliders in the attack. After fighting waves of tanks for several days it was only when he was forced to pull back that Pte Mansell was shot by a sniper through his right hip. The veteran was taken in by a Dutch family after his injury - but was hunted down by the Nazis and hauled away to a Prisoner Of War camp. There he was twice put in front of a firing squad after helping to sabotage German train lines - but lived to tell the tale. His nephew Kevin Edwards said: 'He was captured and became a prisoner of war, he was set to be shot by a firing squad along with a few others but he managed to escape. 'I'm not sure how he did it but he managed it and that is when he was taken in by the Dutch family. 'It's incredibly because he managed to escape again hours before he was due before the firing squad. 'His brother wasn't killed in the same war where Uncle Jack was shot, he was killed a month before the war ended in Germany. 'He was only 18 at the time but he stepped on a landmine in Klebe in Germany and died instantly.' After spending a year in Germany working as an Army dispatch rider after the war he returned to his native West Midlands and worked as a sheet metal engineer. He lived at home until just a few months ago when ill health forced him into a nursing home, where he died.

"Rangers striker Kenny Miller has opened the door to a shock Scotland return — if he gets an emergency SOS call from national team boss Gordon Strachan. The 34-year-old retired from the international scene last August after scoring the last of his 18 goals for Scotland in a 3-2 defeat to England at Wembley. Despite Strachan wanting Miller to stay on, the travelling from Canada, where he played for Vancouver Whitecaps, to Scotland was largely behind the veteran forward’s decision to call time on his Scotland career after 69 caps. Return? Kenny Miller has opened the door on a shock return to the Scotland national team . Finisher: The forward retired last August after moving to Vancouver Whitecaps in Canada . Now Miller is back at Ibrox and, while he has no plans to come out of international retirement for good, he revealed he would never let his country down if injuries and suspensions hit hard in the upcoming qualifying campaign for the European Championship Finals in France 2016. ‘If a call came in a time of crisis, I would find it hard to say no because everyone knows what playing for my country meant to me,’ said the striker. ‘I made that decision (to retire) purely on the travel from Vancouver for the games. MLS doesn’t shut down like our own domestic league in Scotland so I was maybe missing one or two games because of the travel and I wanted to be fair to myself, Scotland and Vancouver. ‘I’m back home now and I haven’t thought about doing a U-turn or anything like that. But if that call was to ever come then I think everybody knows what my answer would be. But I won’t be making any calls myself.’ Miller also admits he would be delighted if the next generation of strikers — like Steven Naismith, Steven Fletcher and Ross McCormack — can end Scotland’s 18-year wait to appear at major finals. He said: ‘If you look at the team at the moment, things are going fantastic and they have got a lot of players in that position coming through. ‘You’ve got Naisy, Fletch and wee Rossco who has just moved to Fulham for big money (£11million). These lads are coming in and doing a great job. I believe we are moving under the right direction with the manager and I’m happy to sit and watch the boys hopefully reach the Euros.’ Rangers manager Ally McCoist, meanwhile, admitted there was still room for improvement after his side’s latest tour match, despite recording a 2-1 victory over US third-tier side Sacramento Republic. Despite being pleased at his team’s second-half performance, the Ibrox boss was left displeased by the lack of urgency his side showed before the break, going behind to a goal from Carlos Martinez before second-half goals from Darren McGregor and Ian Black secured the win. Monumental: Miller celebrates after scoring against England at Wembley last August . Room for improvement: Rangers boss Ally McCoist has taken his side on tour to the US . McCoist said: ‘You could see in the second half we were a lot better but I thought up until then there was a lack of aggression in our play. I don’t mean we should be running around kicking people. I just mean we should be attacking the ball, passing the ball quicker, dictating the tempo. ‘That was lacking in the first half but the second half was night and day. For me, the biggest difference in the second half was that Darren McGregor and Marius Zaliukas attacked the ball. It’s not rocket science. Our performance was better and that came from the centre backs setting the tone for the whole team.’ Ahead of tonight’s friendly against Victoria Highlanders in Vancouver Island, McCoist has injury worries over winger Fraser Aird and defender Richard Foster, who limped off with a tight hamstring. Miller and Lewis Macleod also left Bonney Field with minor knocks. McCoist said: ‘The top of Fraser’s knee has swollen up but it’s coming down and he’s getting ice treatment on it. I’m just a bit concerned we’re flying to Canada and that may keep the swelling up. ‘Hopefully I’ll try and get Fraser involved again in Canada but we’ll need to wait and see how he is. Foster’s hamstring is tight and Kenny Miller and Lewis Macleod took a couple of kicks.’","Miller may return to Scotland team, if boss Gordon Strachan wants him .

"The man charged with stabbing a 14-year-old teen to death after she interrupted hum burglarizing her suburban Chicago home sent chilling text messages to her mother from the girl's stolen cell phone, a court heard today. The heartbroken mother of Kelli O'Laughlin - who found her daughter lying face down in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor on October 27, 2011 - took to the stand Friday for the first day of the murder trial of John L. Wilson, Jr. Brenda O’Laughlin revealed how she first believed Kelli had committed suicide after finding her with a knife nearby at their home in Indian Head Park and called 911. Keli died in hospital that night, but at about 11.30am the next day, Brenda started receiving disturbing texts from her daughter's smart phone, according to The Chicago Sun-Times. 'Hello Brenda,' read the first message. Murder: John L Wilson Junior, 38, right, is in . court today charged with the first-degree murder of 14-year-old Kelli . O'Laughlin, left, in her suburban Chicago home . Heartbroken: Brenda and John O'Laughlin attend the murder trial of John L. Wilson, Jr. in Chicago on Wednesday . Leafy: Locals said the incident at 6309 Keokuk . Road, pictured, came after summer burglaries in the area in which a . suspect used Google to target homes . Homicide: Kelli O'Laughlin,was remembered by school friends as a happy, fun girl who always wore a smile . 'She wanted to tell you something before I killed her,' read another text. At 12.30pm, Brenda’s cellphone showed an incoming phone call from Kelli’s phone, but she didn't answer. At 3.04pm, she received the text: 'You’ve got two minutes to text me before I break the phone.' She replied to that message asking: 'Who are you and what do you want?' Then, according to The Huffington Post, came the most haunting text. 'You will know soon when I come see you,' it said. The other person added something about how he or she is looking at photos on Kelli's phone. Brenda texted back: 'Can you send me a picture of you, so I can look at you a lot?' There was no reply, and the phone was turned over to police. The prosecution allege that Wilson, a 38-year-old parolee, used a landscaping rock wrapped in a red knit cap to smash a window and break into the O'Laughlin's $500,000 house. They claim Kelli surprised Wilson in the family room during the break-in when she got home from school about 3.40pm. Wilson allegedly grabbed an eight inch carving knife from a butcher's block and stabbed Kelli in the neck, back and chest. One of the wounds pierced her aorta. He then allegedly dragged her body from the family room into the kitchen, before ransacking the home. Wilson allegedly fled with a bowl of coins, an iPod Touch and Kelli's phone. Prosecutors say he caught a cab home and used the coins to pay for the fare. Kelli was discovered by her mother at around 5.30pm. Heartbroken: Brenda O'Laughlin - seen here attending a celebration for her daughter Kelli's 15th birthday the year after she died - was sent haunting texts from Kelli's phone following the murder . Fond memories: The popular teenager was known for her sweet and happy nature . Wilson was arrested on November 2, after police tracked Kelli's cell phone. Agents learned that Kelli's phone had been traveling with another around Chicago. They allege the second phone belonged to Wilson. However Wilson was not in possession of Kelli's phone when he was arrested. DNA recovered from the knit cap matched Wilson. Three witnesses also identified him from a line up. Wilson has an extensive history of criminal violence, including a combined nine years spent in prison for carjacking in 1993 and aggravated battery in 2001. His most recently received an 11-year sentence for robbery. He was taken into custody in August 2002 and paroled on November 16, 2010, the Chicago Tribune reported. Wilson’s attorney, John Paul Carroll, questioned whether Kelli had committed suicide during his opening statement. Brutal murder: Kelli O'Laughlin, 14, was stabbed to death in her own home in October 2011. The murder trial for her alleged killer started this week . He informed the jury that, if she did not, they have to decide whether the police have charged the right person with her murder, The Sun-Times reported. Carroll said no blood was found on any of the clothes that Wilson was wearing the day Kelli died.

Carroll added that while DNA belonging to other people were also found on the knit cap, not just Wilson's.

"People with homes in the infamous ‘Tornado Alley’ live in fear of the destruction that can be wreaked by devastating twisters. But one scientist thinks states in the centre of the U.S. could be protected from destructive storms, by erecting three giant walls. The physicist said that the walls, which would measure 1,000ft (300m) tall, could stop the flow of air from north to south to prevent the formation of tornadoes, but a number of scientists are sceptical about the idea. One physicist thinks states in centre of the U.S. that lie in the relatively flat area of 'Tornado Alley' could be protected from destructive storms by erecting three giant walls . A tornado, or 'twister', is a violently rotating column of air that is in contact with both the surface of the earth and a cloud. Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, but they are typically in the form of a visible condensation funnel, whose narrow end touches Earth and is often encircled by a cloud of debris and dust. The most extreme tornadoes can attain wind speeds of more than 300mph (483 kph), stretch more than two miles (3.2km) across and stay on the ground for dozens of miles, or more than 100km. Tornadoes have been observed on every continent except Antarctica. However, the vast majority of them occur in the Tornado Alley region of the U.S. - they can occur nearly anywhere in North America. An F5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. Rongjia Tao, of Temple University, Pennsylvania, told USA Today: ‘If we build three east-west great walls in the American Midwest....one in North Dakota, one along the border between Kansas and Oklahoma to the east, and the third one in south Texas and Louisiana, we will diminish the tornado threats in the Tornado Alley forever.’ To support the vast height, the walls could have to be around 150ft wide and the magnitude of the structures would be enough to weaken flows of air that are responsible for the formation of the deadly twisters, Dr Tao will explain at the American Physical Society in Denver next week. The largest of the storms in Tornado Alley are formed from violent clashes between warm northerly flows of air and cooler southbound air. Huge tornadoes form in the region as it is relatively flat from the Dakotas to Texas with no mountains to disrupt this flow of air and weaken it. But giant walls could potentially solve this problem and cripple the air currents, according to Dr Tao. However, not all scientists agree that his idea could be effective. Rongjia Tao of Temple University, Pennsylvania, proposed the building of three east-west great walls in the American Midwest (illustrated), which he claims will 'diminish the tornado threats in the Tornado Alley (shown by the orange ring) forever' Tornado researcher Harold Brooks of the National Severe Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla told USA Today that Dr Tao’s idea simply ‘wouldn’t work’. He cited China, which has plenty of mountains as an example of why not, as the country has deadly tornadoes despite its east to west mountain ranges. Dr Brooks said: ‘This is essentially a case of a physicist, who may be very good in his sub-discipline, talking about a subject about which he is abysmally ignorant.’ The project would also be incredibly expensive with walls potentially costing $60bn for 100 miles, according to Dr Tao’s estimates. Meteorologist Mike Smith of AccuWeather Enterprise Solutions dismissed the plans for the walls as ‘nonsense’. He said: If supercell thunderstorms with F-5 tornadoes could laugh, they would have a hearty chuckle as they “attacked” the wall. If tornadoes can go up and down mountains (and they can!), they would go over/through the wall.’ The aftermath of a tornado in Oklahoma last May, which killed 24 people and destroyed 1,200 homes. While scientists are keen to find ways of curbing nature's destructive power, a number of experts have dismissed Dr Tao's idea of erecting giant walls in 'Tornado Alley' as 'nonsense'","A physicist from Temple University, Pennsylvania thinks that three 1,000ft walls could throttle air flow to prevent the formation of tornadoes .

"Fielding annoying questions from relatives during the holidays is pretty much unavoidable, but one cocky teenager has come up with an inventive solution to silence those annoying relatives by handing them a pamphlet of pre-prepared answers. When Arianna Simon, a 17-year-old from Rockland, New York, sat down for Thanksgiving last month she proceeded to hand out her carefully printed hand-out which included answers to the boring generic questions that she just wasn't prepared to answer at the dinner table. The leaflet covered hot topics for the teenager including what college she might attend, if she has a boyfriend and her age. The three-page pamphlet was entitled 'Frequently asked questions' and included a smiling pic of Arianne looking her best on the front cover. Arianna Simon, a 17-year-old from Rockland, New York, has come up with an inventive solution to silence those annoying relatives by handing them a pamphlet of pre-prepared answers to their boring generic questions . Inside was a message explaining the purpose behind the hand-out. 'If you refrain from asking me these questions that I have nicely provided you the answers to, we will have a happy and loving thanksgiving. Thank you,' she wrote. Arianna then went on to answer the boring questions with a certain amount of sass. For instance in answer to questions about she age she wrote: 'I turned 17 in October.. yes, I know time flies. I have also gotten taller, that happens when you grow up.' The original idea came from her mom she recent explained. 'I was talking to my mom about how much I hate answering the same five questions over and over during the holidays, so she hinted that I just make a handout for my family,' the teen told The Huffington Post. 'She was beyond shocked when I actually followed through with her idea.' Arianna produced her debut pamphlet just before Thanksgiving dinner and it seemed to go down a winner. 'When I handed them out on Thanksgiving, it was more of a gag joke than anything else. Everyone thought the idea was great and took it well,' she explained. 'I was surprised though, because I didn't have anything to talk about with some family members! Overall, I think the pamphlet was a hit and I loved not talking about the same things.' The reaction was so good in fact that she has another handout planned for the dinner table on Christmas Day. 'During the holiday season, most teens get stuck answering the same questions over and over again,' she told The Stir. 'I realize that some people are genuinely interested in what you have to say, but sometimes I find that these generic questions are just used to fill the silences. I love talking to my family members, but I feel like so much time is wasted while answering repetitive questions.' Once they move past the generic pleasantries, Simon hopes that she and her relatives will be able to move on to more enjoyable and substantial topics. The idea proved such a hit for Arianna at Thanksgiving that she will be handing out more pamphlets round the table on Christmas Day .","Arianna Simon, a 17-year-old from Rockland, New York, has come up with an inventive solution to silence  annoying relatives by handing them a pamphlet of pre-prepared answers to their boring questions .

"Three people were arrested yesterday in connection with the murder of a mother of five who was stabbed to death as she tended her horses in the New Forest. One of those in custody was being held on suspicion of murdering 47-year-old Pennie Davis, who was knifed in broad daylight. Another was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice and the third with assisting an offender, Hampshire detectives said. Scroll down for video .

Mrs Davis, who had been married five times, was discovered lying in a paddock in Beaulieu on Tuesday afternoon by her husband of just four months, Pete Davis. He was seen ‘sobbing his heart out’ next to her body. More than 150 members of the public had responded to a police appeal for information to help find the killer. Mrs Davis lived with her husband five miles from where she died in the village of Blackfield. She worked at a small branch of Sainsbury’s there. Detectives admitted they faced a difficult job delving into Mrs Davis’s complex personal life, her business affairs and also her involvement as a director in several electrical companies in recent years. A specialist police team was searching the River Beaulieu yards from the scene for a murder weapon. Mrs Davis’s family declined to comment on the arrests. One woman, who said she was a family member, said: ‘We don’t want to say anything that could sabotage the inquiry.’ This weekend more than 40,000 visitors, many unaware of the investigation, flocked to the New Forest for a giant two-day Autojumble motoring fair on the Beaulieu estate nearby.

"Arsenal begin their whistlestop tour of New York today when they touch down in the Big Apple. The Gunners will cram plenty during their four day stay: daily training sessions, fan parties, coaching clinics and Saturday’s clash against Thierry Henry’s New York Red Bulls on Saturday. For the club, it’s a chance to plant commercial roots in a country they are yet to crack on a big scale. But for the players, it’ll be an opportunity to plant their own seeds - in manager Arsene Wenger’s head - ahead of the new season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch some great Thierry Henry moments at New York Red Bulls . Wilshere posted this selfie from New Jersey with team-mates Flamini and Rosicky on Instagram . Of course, for some, the need to make an impression on the Gunners boss will be greater than others. Aaron Ramsey, for example, knows he’ll have an integral role in Arsenal’s trophy charge next season having established himself as the club’s premier central midfielder. Likewise, Kieran Gibbs knows he’s almost certain to start the season as the club’s first-choice left-back having seen off the challenge of Nacho Monreal. However, others aren’t so fortunate. Arsenal players Mathieu Flamini, Nacho Monreal, Tomas Rosicky, Kieran Gibbs and Aaron Ramsey on board their flight to the USA . Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky are all smiles as they fly out from Luton . And here, Sportsmail takes a look at the Gunners’ travelling party who’ll want to make it BIG in New York.Wojciech Szczesny Almost certain to start the season as the club’s No 1. But the imminent arrival of David Ospina from Nice will raise further question marks over the Pole’s position as first-choice goalkeeper. Ospina impressed for Colombia during the World Cup and will arrive in north London intent on dislodging Szczesny between the posts. It’s not the first time Szczesny’s role has come under scrutiny during his time at Arsenal, but a strong pre-season will help reinforce his position as the club’s undisputed first-choice keeper.Carl Jenkinson The right-back may have thought his time had come when Bacary Sagna left for Manchester City earlier this summer, but the arrival of Mathieu Debuchy from Newcastle means Jenkinson will play second-fiddle again. But it could get worse for the youngster, with Wenger known to be in the market for another right-back. They have held talks over a move for Atletico Madrid’s Javier Manquillo and have been linked with Catania right-back Gino Peruzzi. A strong showing in America could be enough to persuade Wenger that Jenkinson can fill the role as reserve right-back. Aaron Ramsey boards the plane at Luton Airport as Arsenal head to New York . Nacho Monreal Was signed by Arsenal in January 2013 as the man to replace injury-prone Kieran Gibbs as the club’s first-choice left-back. However, the move has not gone as planned for the Spaniard. Gibbs’ form has been first-class since Monreal’s arrival, while those niggling injuries that have blighted his career seem to have cleared up. Monreal expressed his concern at his lack of playing time to Wenger last season and won’t want another year of warming the bench. Can he breathe life into his Gunners career here in America? Mikel Arteta It’s contract time for the former Everton man. He has less than 12 months on his existing Arsenal deal leaving his future at the club uncertain. He wants to stay at the Emirates Stadium and says he will talk to Wenger in the coming weeks to clarify his future. Talk of the club signing a new holding central midfielder will not have gone unnoticed by the Spaniard. Some strong performances in pre-season, starting against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday, could go a long way to securing his place in the starting XI…and a new contract. Arsene Wenger speaks at the Emirates Business Breakfast in new Jersey on Thursday . Mathieu Flamini Like Arteta, knows his place in the Arsenal’s team is under threat given the club’s pursuit of a new central midfielder. Having started the season well, his performances tailed off towards the end of the season. It is likely to be Ramsey and one other to start in central midfield next season. Flamini, by nature, is more suited to a defensive game than Arteta, though the Spaniard is a much better passer - a trait Wenger prefers. A good summer campaign from Flamini and Arteta could be enough to convince Wenger he already has enough in central midfield going into the new season.Jack Wilshere It’s not been the most memorable few months for the midfielder. He missed the majority of the final few weeks of last season with a foot injury, before playing a peripheral role in England’s disastrous World Cup campaign. And as if things couldn’t get any worse, the spotlight was back on the the 22-year-old again last week after he was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a summer break in Las Vegas. Wilshere is at a crossroads, he knows it and so do the Arsenal coaching team. Competition in central midfield is fierce, but Wilshere certainly has the ability to play alongside Ramsey. Playing and training well here in America will certainly help his cause. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain goes through his paces at the Arsenal training ground before the players flew out . Abou Diaby Arsenal’s forgotten man. The Gunners need for a bona-fide world class holding midfielder is clear - but in Diaby they may already have one. As always, the biggest obstacle towards the Frenchman playing a key role for Arsenal next season will be his fitness. Can he stay clear of injury long enough to have a sustained run in the team? If so, then Wenger may not need to splash the cash on signing Sami Khedira, Lars Bender or Morgan Schneiderlin.","Gunners only game of the tour is against New York Red Bulls on Saturday .

"The widely acclaimed movie 'Selma' about the 1965 Civil Rights movement has disappointed at least one moviegoer: a leading historian of President Lyndon B. Johnson. The director of the LBJ Presidential Library in Austin, which hosted a major civil rights summit this year that was headlined by four U.S. presidents, said the film that opens in theaters Thursday incorrectly portrays Johnson as an obstructionist to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 'Selma' is based on the 1965 marches from the Alabama cities of Selma to Montgomery that were led by King. At the time, marchers were calling for voting rights. Scroll down for video . Historian: Mark Updegrove is seen left with President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and Rep. John Lewis in April 2014.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Dispute: Updegrove said Johnson and King had disagreements but not like the film suggests. They are seen speaking in July 1964 . LBJ Library Director Mark Updegrove said the film unfairly casts Johnson as a sort of composite character who represents the obstacles blacks faced in getting civil rights laws passed. What history shows, Updegrove said, is that Johnson and King had a partnership. He said Johnson and King had disagreements but not like the film suggests. Updegrove called the portrayal unfortunate given the current climate following the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police. 'When racial tension is so high, it does no good to suggest that the president of the U.S. himself stood in the way of progress a half-century ago. It flies in the face of history,' Updegrove said. A spokeswoman for Paramount Pictures, the studio that released the film, did not immediately return messages for comment Wednesday. 'Selma' is nominated for four Golden Globe awards, including best picture for a drama and best director. In April, Updegrove and the LBJ Library commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act with a summit that included appearances by four of the five living U.S. presidents. President Barack Obama closed out the event with a speech that lauded Johnson's congressional deal-making and push for greater racial equality.

"Arsene Wenger has revealed Arsenal have 'high expectations' for 17-year-old Gedion Zelalem, but admits the whizzkid won't be ready for first-team action for at least another six months. Zelalem has already played at clubs in Germany, America and now England. His youth career started at Hertha Berlin, in the city where he was born, but he followed his family to the United States in 2006 and played for MSC United and Bethesda Soccer Club, before joining Olney Rangers. The latter is where Arsenal picked him up from 12 months ago, aged 16, and in January he made his first-team debut in an FA Cup match against Coventry, making him the first player born after Wenger joined Arsenal to play for the club. Midfield: Gedion Zelalem tackles Mikel Arteta during a training session at London Colney earlier this week . 'I honestly think Gedion has the talent to become a great player, but that will be decided in the next two or three years because he has to show that he has the mental level required to be a top-level competitor,' said Wenger ahead of Arsenal's friendly against the New York Red Bulls on Saturday. 'He is a creative player and he can create a spark, an opening with his passing, his vision through the lines. If he manages to develop his physique and keep his qualities, he can be a very important player. Let's hope he will do it. 'I believe he is a very young, promising talent who was educated here [in the United States]. Today it is too early for him to play for us but I would say in one year we will know more about him.

"The government’s emergency committee was convened today to discuss the devastating disease which is threatening Britain’s ash trees. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson chaired a meeting of Cobra with officials from Number 10, government agencies and scientists to consider how to stem the spread of the killer fungus ash dieback. Ministers have been warned the disease is untreatable, with an estimated 100,000 trees already destroyed after being found to be infected. The Cobra committee will discuss how to respond to the ash crisis, which could see 80million trees destroyed . The Government's chief scientific adviser briefed the hour-long Whitehall meeting, which included officials from the Forestry Commission and the devolved administrations. Mr Paterson said: 'We have had an assessment of the state of the disease. 'We also had an assessment of the current survey, where we are looking at 2,900 10km squares right across the United Kingdom. This was a meeting that brought in the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland showing that, right across the UK, we are determined to work together. 'We also had a presentation on possible solutions - at the moment we do not have a cure for the disease - and also measures we might take having established the survey, which should be completed by the middle of next week.' On Monday Mr Paterson imposed a ban on the import of ash trees amid predictions the ‘devastating disease’ could wipe out 80million British trees. Scientists have warned tackling the crisis would 'change the countryside significantly.' However, Mr Paterson has been accused by a Tory MP of dither and delay in taking action.Zac Goldsmith said the Mail that ministers should have acted eight months ago when reports first came through that the ash dieback disease had entered the country. He has put down a parliamentary motion demanding that ministers plough money into research into plant health and a new rapid reaction force to deal with disease threats. Mr Goldsmith, the environmentalist MP . for Richmond in south west London, said: 'The government is finally . doing the right thing, but it took far, far too long, and for ash at . least, it may be too late. We should have sprung into action when the . fungus was found over eight months ago. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has been accused by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith of not acting fast enough to tackle the crisis . 'We have already seen that the longer these problems are ignored, the greater the cost of dealing with them, which is why we need more resources to be allocated now to prevention and rapid reaction. 'Among other things, that means better screening and control at our borders by government, and more use by the horticultural and landscaping industry of our domestic nurseries. 'We need a different approach; one that puts biosecurity ahead of promiscuous trade.' Mr Paterson will be challenged about his handling of the crisis when he is grilled by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs select committee on Tuesday. Committee chairman Anne McIntosh, a Tory MP, said there are 'many questions to be answered'. 'The government needs to me more alert to plant health. I want to know when the department first knew about this. The Horticultural Trades Association say they first wrote to Defra about the disease in 2009 - I will be asking him about that. 'Successive governments have been underfunding plant health. The department is now increasing the funding available, but why did they not do this before?' She added: 'I want to know why we are importing ash saplings. Why do we rely so heavily on imports for so many popular trees? 'Are saplings more prone to this disease? How will it impact on mature trees, and have we become more prone because of the extreme wet weather we have been having? 'And I will be asking whether there are any other potential diseases threatening popular trees.'","Environment Secretary Owen Paterson chairs Cobra meeting amid warnings 80 British trees could be wiped out .

"Tragic: Dylan Cecil was playing on a slipway when he lost his footing . The grieving mother of a four-year-old boy who was swept out to sea has hit out at internet trolls who set up a Facebook page containing fake messages from her son. Dylan Cecil’s body has still not been found since he fell from a slipway into treacherous waters during a family visit to the seaside. His parents, Darren Cecil and Rachel McCollum, both jumped in to the sea after their son fell but could not save him, and have since been keeping a vigil on the beach at Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset. A page on the social networking site called ‘RIP Dylan Cecil’ contains a message from a user masquerading as Dylan that reads: ‘To my mum, my daddy and sisters and seaside grandparents I love you all. Am in heaven waiting on you all.’ It continues: ‘I’ll be looking down on you :-) x Sent from the rainbow and flowers and sunshine in heaven...X.’ Miss McCollum, 27, who had previously used her own Facebook account to say her ‘heart, soul and life [have been] ripped apart’, later responded to the false messages. She wrote: ‘How low can people be? I tried saving my son and a page [is] set up speaking like they are him. ‘I’m distraught he is still missing at sea, I ain’t slept at all and to find someone pretending to be my son has destroyed me even more.’ Other internet users expressed their disgust at the Facebook group, with one responding: ‘I’m reporting this page – you are disrespectful trolls.’ Another added: ‘Take this page down, you insensitive ghoulish t**** – he is not your child to mourn and debate, the parents have enough anguish already.’ Scroll down for video .

Before he was swept out to sea, Dylan . and his sisters, Faith, three, and one-year-old Alice, had been staying . with their grandparents, while Miss McCollum and Mr Cecil, 30, took a . short break in Dorset. The couple returned from their break on Sunday . and took their children to the shore that evening, when Dylan fell off . the slipway into the water, in an area which is notorious for its low . visibility and powerful currents. Miss McCollum said yesterday: ‘I can’t get closure. He is still lost. What can I do? I did all I could. ‘He was playing on the end of the jetty and he was less than a metre away from me and he slipped. ‘He lost his footing. He went under. I jumped in straight away, as did his dad, but we both got pulled by a whirlpool. ‘He went straight away. He never came back. I got dragged myself. I knew. I knew he was gone.’ Bad taste: Ghoulish internet trolls posted this message pretending to be Dylan Cecil . Anger: Dylan's devastated mother Rachel McCollum immediately made her feelings known once the fake profile emerged . Looking out to sea, she added: ‘He was beautiful. He was absolutely beautiful. I couldn’t ask for a better kid. ‘He was polite, well-mannered, . gorgeous. I don’t want him lost at sea. He needs to be with me.’ Placing . an arm around her shoulder, her father told her: ‘He will come back.’ But she replied: ‘He won’t  come back.’ Yesterday a witness told how she . helped pull Mr Cecil and Miss McCollum out of the water after they had . frantically tried to save their son. Claire Holbrook, 28, a nurse who had . been visiting the beach with her seven-year-old daughter Leah, said: ‘I . heard a scream [and] noticed two adults, who had walked past us earlier, . in the water. Outpouring of sympathy: Dozens of wellwishers have left candles and flowers at the scene where Dylan was last spotted on Sunday evening . Helpless: As more passers-by laid flowers at the scene, Dylan's desperate mother said her four-year-old son 'needs to be with me'. ‘The woman was yelling, “Help me, my little boy is dead” and the dad claimed he was stuck. Dylan Cecil, four, has been lost at sea since disappearing from Burnham-on-Sea on Sunday evening . ‘A group of people rushed to help the mum, and another man and myself helped the dad. ‘By that time he was nearly gone . himself – he was just so exhausted – so we dragged him out and put him . in the recovery position. It wasn’t until about ten minutes later that . we realised that there was also a little boy in the water – there was . just no sign of him.’ She continued: ‘[The] mum was frantic. She was just absolutely inconsolable – but they fought until the end. ‘I think deep down we all knew he was . dead straight away because he never came back up. It was like he had . gone somewhere.’ Miss McCollum has also placed a small Winnie the Pooh . teddy bear among the numerous flowers in place on the sea wall, close to . where a huge heart with Dylan’s name written in the middle has been . carved into the sand. An onlooker said: ‘She said that her . daughter went up to her last night with the teddy and said that it was . now called Dylan. 'She looked absolutely exhausted. She put a well-loved . Winnie the Pooh teddy on the wall and told a police officer that it was . her kids’ favourite show.’ An official search to find Dylan – . involving the RAF, RNLI, coastguard and local hovercraft crews - was . called off on Monday afternoon, but volunteers continued to scour the . water yesterday.

"Experts may be concerned that a faulty thruster on the Philae lander could potentially scupper the Rosetta mission, but its lead scientist is so confident of success that he already has the triumphant moment of landing tattooed on his leg. British scientist Dr Matt Taylor is one of the most important people involved in the European Space Agency's mission to land on a comet for the first time and has become a Twitter sensation. The Rosetta Project Scientist has caused a stir on the social network because of his unorthodox appearance, involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet, which he got in January. Scroll down for video . Dr Matt Taylor, Rosetta Project Scientist, has caused a stir on Twitter because of his unorthodox appearance, involving bright shirts and an array of body art (pictured) Dr Taylor, from north east London, is so positive that the mission to land on the comet will be successful that he has already had the moment permanently etched on his body. He told BBC Breakfast: ‘I'm incredibly confident that we're going to nail this landing. I'm confident enough to have it drawn on my body.’ As he showed off the design on his right thigh, Dr Taylor said: ‘That's my prediction for later today, that we get the lander on the comet.’ The scientist is so positive that the mission to land on the comet will be successful that he has already had the moment permanently etched on his body (pictured) Earlier this morning, Esa's Rosetta probe released its Philae lander to attempt the first ever landing of a spacecraft on the surface of a comet. The separation was confirmed at 9.03am GMT, with pictures of Philae approaching the comet expected throughout the day before it lands on the surface at 3.30pm GMT. But the success of the mission now hangs in the balance after a thruster on Philae was found to be faulty. Mission controllers say there is a 50 per cent chance the cold thruster positioned on top of the lander will work, and without it, Philae will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet. The cold thruster was designed to push Philae closer to the comet. Dr Taylor, the son of a brick layer, was reportedly told to cover his tattoos at media events in the past, but his appearance seems only to have increased his popularity. Twitter users praised Dr Taylor for being ‘a proper cool scientist’ and ‘definitely not boring’ after he appeared on the European Space Agency live stream and BBC Breakfast wearing a multi-coloured shirt emblazoned with illustrations of glamorous women, which he teamed with shorts, which showed off his tattoos. To convince his new team of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. This video shows the creation of the tattoo . Esa has successfully made contact with the Philae lander after it separated from the Rosetta spacecraft this morning at 08.35am GMT. It is now heading towards the comet and is expected to attempt to land on the surface at 4pm GMT. Pictured right is Paolo Ferri, Head of Mission Operations, celebrating making contact . When Philae touches the surface of the comet it will fire harpoons into the surface to keep it anchored there. To keep it attached to the surface a thruster at the top will push it down as the harpoons fire. But at the moment the thruster does not appear to be working. This means the lander will have to rely solely on its harpoons to stay attached to the surface. It will have to hope they grab the surface immediately and keep the lander anchored there. If they don’t, the force of firing them could send it floating off into space. 'We’ll need some luck not to land on a boulder or a steep slope,’ said Stephan Ulamec, Philae Lander Manager at the DLR German Aerospace Centre. One Twitter user wrote: 'Dr Matt Taylor is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt, sleeve tattoos. Rad,' while another said: ‘Matt Taylor causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning.’ Dr Taylor studied at the University of Liverpool and Imperial College London, winning a PhD in space plasma physics . He has worked at the European Space Agency since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013. The role was a real change from his previous job, which was studying the physics of the northern lights, The Guardian reported. Professor Mark McCaughrean, senior science advisor at ESA, who appointed Dr Taylor, said that he took a chance on the young scientist as he would have to come up to speed with the mission quickly and gain the trust of older experts who had been working at ESA for decades. To convince them of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. In January this happened, and a school friend turned tattoo artist etched a reminder of the ambitious mission on his leg. In his profile on the Rosetta project website, Dr Taylor says: ‘The opportunity to work on Rosetta was huge and I cannot begin to describe the excitement associated with this mission. It really is just so cool.’ Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles (30 km) away from 67P .","Dr Taylor is the Rosetta Project Scientist at the European Space Agency .

"Joey Barton admits that if Queens Park Rangers are to survive in the Premier League then they’ll have to do all of the hard work at Loftus Road. Harry Redknapp’s bottom-placed side have lost all six matches on the road this term with an aggregate score of 2-15. Their latest away-day reverse came at Barton’s former club Newcastle at the weekend as they went down to a 1-0 defeat. Joey Barton, talking to team-mate Nedum Onuoha, insists QPR will have to reply upon their home form . At home they have fared slightly better, picking up eight points from a possible 18, and they face fellow strugglers Leicester City in the capital on Saturday. And, after another below-par display away from West London, Barton concedes that fortunes at home will determine their top-flight fate. ‘You’ve got to pick yourself up in this league very quickly,’ said the 32-year-old, who skippered the team at St James’ Park. Moussa Sissoko (right) celebrates after scoring for Newcastle against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday . Barton, talking to QPR boss Harry Redknapp on Saturday, couldn't prevent his side losing 1-0 at Newcastle . ‘We’ve been very good at home recently. That’s got to be the priority for us - turning Loftus Road into a fortress and making it a difficult place for teams to come to. ‘Credit to the lads, we’ve done that all season. Anything away from home in the Premier League is a bonus.’ The R’s managed just four shots on target at Newcastle and Redknapp said his side lacked the pace to trouble the hosts, who were depleted in light of injuries to nine first-team players. And Barton certainly feels their latest away loss was an opportunity missed. Queens Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp's (left)  side lost 1-0 to Newcastle to go bottom of the table . ‘The overriding feeling (after Saturday) was disappointment,’ he said. ‘We weren’t really at the races. ‘It was an understrength Newcastle side - one that has been in great form - but one we felt we could do a number on. ‘We could have done with (three points) in our current predicament. We’ve had a number of great performances of late but we haven’t put as many points on the board as we’d like to. ‘We’re extremely disappointed (with where we are) but there’s a long way to go.’ Holland international Leroy Fer, in action at Newcastle, is adamant their away form must improve quickly . Barton’s midfield comrade Leroy Fer, meanwhile, has not given up on their away form, but admits it needs to pick up if they’re to avoid relegation back to the Championship. ‘We will need to start getting something away from home if we are to stay up,’ said the Holland international. ‘We know that's important and it's something we are keen address quickly. We have two home games coming up against sides around us (Leicester and Burnley) and we have to win them.’","Harry Redknapp's side are currently bottom of the Premier League .

"Football agents are threatening to injunct the FA from introducing new FIFA regulations in April, following world football’s ruling body washing their hands of controlling the game’s middlemen. The Association of Football Agents met on Friday and will take legal action against the fresh set of rules governing their conduct. That is if their complaint to the European Commission and a couple of planned meetings in Germany fail to resolve the turmoil. Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA that represents almost all the UK’s agents, said: ‘We will have no option. It’s a total disgrace that FIFA are passing the buck to national associations having recommended an unworkable code. And it will be the Wild West out there, with anyone able to act as agents.’ Radamel Falcao's (right) agent Jorge Mendes (left) could soon have to adhere to a new set of regulations . Mel Stein, chairman of the AFA, insists agents will have no option but to take legal action against the FA . The FIFA recommendations include national associations registering only intermediaries of ‘impeccable character’, all deals annually published online, agents’ fees limited to three per cent and no monies earned by them for negotiating deals for players under 18. The FA, Premier League and Football League have been discussing how best to cope with FIFA opting out. All have serious concerns about how the system will work in Britain and abroad, especially in under-developed football territories. A FIFA spokesperson said: ‘The new approach is about having better control of the activity and follows a lengthy, in-depth reform process with numerous options considered.’ Sepp Blatter's FIFA has decided to opt out of trying to control football agents . There is no chance whatsoever of Gordon Taylor, 70-year-old chief executive of the PFA, being asked to resign by his management committee — be it for running up huge bookmaking debts or making deplorable comparisons this week between the Hillsborough disaster and the Ched Evans case. Taylor surrounds himself with ultra-loyal staff at his private fiefdom. Graham Bean, the former FA compliance officer who was brought in for a period by Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino to stabilise the troubled club, is himself facing a £100,000 pension fraud charge in Manchester on January 19. Bean will vigorously defend the charge, brought by HMRC. He will claim to have been victim of a pension scam by a professional advisor who has fled the country after being struck off by the Financial Services Authority. ITV Sport, who have rights to the Africa Cup of Nations starting on January 17, will be producing all their programming from London — sending no one abroad. Cameroon players train ahead of the Africa Cup of Nations - ITV will not be sending anyone to the tournament . Yet the BBC are spending licence-fee money funding an army of over 20 personnel. They will be going to Africa to service the overblown website, Radio 5 Live and the World Service. The Republic of Equatorial Guinea’s London embassy report numerous visa applications from the BBC. There is a worry at the top of BBC Sport that the Corporation will lose one of their flagship rights properties this year. The two most vulnerable are Match of the Day highlights and the Open championship. The golf contract is most in danger of being lost to Sky after 2016 — which Sports Agenda was the first to reveal as a significant threat last July. One thing is for sure. If Sky do capture the Open, there will be no more ridiculous schedule clashing with the Lord’s Ashes Test, which happens again this summer. Rory McIlroy won The Open at Hoylake live on the BBC last year but the tournament could be on Sky in 2016 . There has been an understandably negative reaction in Scotland to flu-hit Mo Farah pulling out of Saturday's Great Edinburgh cross-country international. It is the third time in less than six months he has let down athletics fans north of the border, following his withdrawals from Glasgow’s Diamond League meeting and the Commonwealth Games. Meanwhile, Lord Coe would like to see cross country included in the Winter Olympics to encourage African interest. Joe Williams, from Coe’s first athletics club Sheffield’s Hallamshire Harriers, represented GB in cross country the last time it was included — 1924. Mo Farah's withdrawal from the Great Edinburgh cross-country international has caused a stir . If departing chairman Giles Clarke fails to win enough county support to stay on the England Cricket Board in a new president’s role, Glamorgan chairman Barry O’Brien, a London lawyer, will challenge Notts’ Peter Wright for the vice-chairmanship vacated by Colin Graves succeeding Clarke.","Football agents are threatening legal action against the FA after FIFA provided a recommended code of practice they refuse to control .

"The 31-year-old accused of murder and 13 counts of attempted murder after going on a devastating hit and run rampage in Cardiff has been named as Matthew Tvrdon. An angry crowd yelled abuse at his . police van as he arrived to appear at Cardiff Magistrates' Court accused of murdering Karina Menzies, 31, who was killed when . she was hit by a white Iveco van outside Ely Fire Station in the city on Friday. Tvrdon, who was only named this morning, is also charged with four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and dangerous driving - making a total of 19 charges. Matthew Tvrdon denied murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility . Accused: The van containing Matthew Tvrdon drives into Cardiff Magistrates Court this morning surrounded by police . He looked relaxed as he was released from his handcuffs and brought into the courtroom at just after 10am. Unshaven and wearing a black jumper, he was asked to confirm that he had no home address, 'Unfortunately, at the moment I was between moving out,' he told the court in a calm voice. In a soft Cardiff accent he confirmed his date of birth as November 13, 1980, before he was remanded in custody and told he will appear at Newport Crown Court tomorrow. Matthew Tvrdon pleaded guilty to killing Karina Menzies but denies her murder . Catrin Evans, prosecuting, said Tvrdon is charged with murder, 13 counts of attempted murder, four counts of actual bodily harm and one of dangerous driving. 'They should be sent to the Crown Court along with the dangerous driving, which was the first incident that occurred,' she said. She argued against granting him bail and said there had been 'concerns' about his mental health and that since his arrest he had been to the Caswell Clinic in Bridgend for psychological assessment. More than a dozen people were injured in . the crashes after the first incident was reported in Crossways Road, Ely, at . 3.30pm on Friday. Two of the injured adults were left in a critical condition and five children also received treatment after the driver of the white van brought bloodshed to the streets of the Welsh capital. Catrin Evans, head of complex casework unit for the Crown Prosecution Service, Wales said yesterday: 'With legal proceedings now under way, I would like to stress that the defendant retains the right to a fair trial. 'It is important that the criminal justice process is allowed to run its course without hindrance and I would therefore ask that nothing is placed in the public domain that may undermine this.' Last night it was revealed that mother Karina Menzies, who saved her children from a terrifying hit-and-run rampage, suffered from a crippling disease which meant she could not save herself. The 32-year-old managed to throw her daughters to safety before she was hit by a van and killed in an unprovoked attack on Friday. Custody: As Tvrdon's police van left court after the hearing, a group are seen hurling abuse at him in the background . Guards: There was a large police presence at the court in Cardiff today as the crime has caused widespread revulsion . The mother-of-three could not run away from the vehicle because her legs had been severely weakened by a progressive nerve condition. She was one of 14 pedestrians, including seven children, hit in the 30-minute spree of horror as a driver sped through suburban streets, mowing down families on their way home from school. Last night, Miss Menzies’ brother Craig paid tribute to his ‘hero’ sister, saying: ‘She died saving her kids. 'She’s got them out of the way and, at the same time, put herself between them and the van to prevent it hitting them. She’s let the van take her. Selfless: Karina Menzies (left) died after . saving the lives of her children, including one of her daughters (right), during the hit-and-run carnage . ‘She would have done this instinctively because that is the person my sister was. She was the bravest, kindest, most loyal person in the world and I can’t believe she’s gone.’ The tragic death of hit-and-run victim . Karina Menzies is the second tragedy for her family - because her . mother was strangled eight years ago. Mother-of-five Sharon Menzies (right) was just 45 when she was killed by her boyfriend after a work romance turned sour. Her . family say Karina 'went off the rails for a while' after the death of . her mum - but was getting her life back together before she was killed. A family friend said: 'How could tragedy strike twice for a family like this? They are heartbroken. 'It really hit them hard after their mother died. Karina . mixed with some of the wrong people, got into drugs and got into . trouble. But she was determined to get back on track for the sake of her kids. She was doing so well and now she is gone.' Security . guard Brian James, 63, left his wife to move in with Sharon after a romance at the YMCA in Cardiff where both worked in 2004. But after six weeks the relationship turned sour and Mrs Menzies asked him to leave her house. Cardiff . Crown Court heard James tried to make amends with wife Carol - but she . too refused to have him back. James then went back to Mrs Menzies and . grabbed her by the neck during a bitter row. Mr Menzies addressed more than 200 friends and relatives who gathered yesterday to lay flowers and stage a vigil at the spot where his sister was hit. While Miss Menzies reacted quickly to save her daughters, she could not escape the vehicle because her legs were weakened by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, friends revealed. The condition, which damages nerves outside the spine and brain, meant she would not have been able to get away from the oncoming van fast enough. Friend Julie Crook said: ‘Karina . saved her kids but she couldn’t run. She had CMT and it affected her . hands and feet. She found it really hard to run. She was very unstable . on her feet. She wouldn’t have been able to run away. She would have . just fallen if she tried.’ Mrs Crook insisted her friend would not have thought of herself as a hero for saving her children. ‘She was very humble,’ she added. ‘She would have said: “I did what any mother would do.”’ Police officers are investigating the theory that the driver may have deliberately targeted mothers and children because he was angry after a row with his wife. He dumped his van and fled on foot but was arrested outside the Merrie Harrier pub in Llandough just minutes later. There have been claims that the man reversed back over some of the people he hit and reports that he was carrying a weapon, thought to be a crook lock, which he allegedly used to batter some of those who had been knocked down. While Miss Menzies is the only fatality, two others are in a critical condition in hospital and five children are receiving treatment. Others hit include two schoolgirls aged . around ten, who moments before had been browsing birthday cards in a . shop; a mother and her son, who was riding a bike; and a couple who were . seen on CCTV pushing their two-year-old in her pram moments before the . van swerved across four lanes of traffic and mounted the pavement.

Murder suspect Matthew Tvrdon (right) grew up in a respectable family - but had an obsession for cars, it was revealed today. Tvrdon is the eldest of three sons to his nurse mother Mary and Slovakian-born father Milan. Neighbours say he moved out about two years ago from his family home in a four-bed semi-detached house at the end of a cul-de-sac in Roath, Cardiff. 'He was obsessed with cars and had different cars all the time,' one neighbour said. 'He had an enormous American car at one time which took up three spaces. 'He also had a big 4x4 at one stage but he was always in different cars.' Matthew grew up in the quiet cul-de-sac just half a mile from Cardiff magistrates court where he yesterday appeared accused of murder and 13 attempted murders. His mother Mary, 62, and father Milan, 66, were yesterday away from their home which was being guarded by police. The couple have two other sons David, 28, and Josef, 23. The neighbour said: 'They are a lovely family. I’ve lived her for 25 years and there have never been any problems. 'Their mum Mary is a nurse and dad Milan is very polite and lovely. He was in business but has retired. 'Mary is very caring and thoughtful and I know I could get any help from them at any time. 'I remember Matthew pushing his brother in his pram and playing football in the street outside. It is hard to believe any of this. 'I had seen him come and go in the last year and a half. 'I don’t like the word strange but it is fair to say he was different. But he was always polite and friendly.' Other neighbours said Tvrdon was believed to have left home to move in with a woman. One said: 'All we know is that she was a good few years older than him but he seemed very happy at the time.'

"The Three Bears are behind Felix Magath’s bid to become Rangers’ new technical director. Sportsmail understands the former Fulham boss has aligned himself with Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor in the hope they can become the new powerbrokers at Ibrox. Magath snapped up £200,000 of shares in the club having been alerted to the potential at Rangers during a visit to Murray Park with the Cottagers last summer. He has held preliminary discussions with representatives of the three businessman in Scotland this week and both parties are open to further discussions. Manager Felix Magath pictured in the dugout during his time in charge of Fulham last year . The 61-year-old wants to overhaul Rangers’ entire coaching and scouting structure based on the German model – with responsibility for recruiting and developing players resting with him. A head coach would assume responsibility for the first team with transfers in and out at that level decided jointly – in line with the European model. Whether the former Stuttgart and Bayern Munich manager’s dream is realised, however, depends on the Park-led consortium getting the keys to the door. Currently with around 20 per cent of the club, the Three Bears - together with Dave King and American Robert Sarver - are hopeful of wresting control from the Mike Ashley-Easdale brothers axis presently ruling the roost. With the club fast running out of money and already £3million in debt to Ashley, the current powerbrokers look increasingly vulnerable to market forces. Rangers beat Dumbarton last time out with Dean Shiels (right) wrapping up a 3-1 victory at Ibrox . Sarver, the financier who owns the Phoenix Suns NBA team, is still awaiting a response to his increased £20m offer – plus a £6.5m loan – he tabled earlier this week. Significantly, however, it would require 75 per cent of shareholders to approve the issue of fresh capital to the American in order for his takeover to get off the ground – a threshold the Three Bears, King – with 15 per cent – and myriad other parties could prevent him from reaching. King insists he is not working ‘in concert’ with the Three Bears to exact boardroom change – but both parties do share a common goal. Despite the worsening financial situation, neither the Easdales nor Newcastle owner Ashley have indicated they are willing to sell up yet. King’s campaign last year to deny the club season-ticket money has hardened the board’s attitude to him in particular. Phoenix Suns owner and financier Robert Sarver increased his Rangers takeover bid to £20million . Given the transfer of shares over the past few weeks, however – with Laxey selling their stake to the Three Bears – an EGM calling for the removal of existing directors is an increasingly viable route for either King or the Park consortium. King is believed to be keenest on this road to power but, as of Friday night, had yet to play his hand. Park, Letham and Taylor are favouring a more low-profile strategy but their link with Magath will undoubtedly increase their standing among floating voters. On Friday night the German said: ‘I don’t want to comment on my stock dealings, that’s private. I spent the Christmas holidays in London and actually visited someone in Glasgow but I don’t want to comment on whether there has been talks with the club either.’ Magath has been out of work since leaving relegated Fulham in September but his reputation as a sharp football brain is undiminished. Dave King bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club this month and is keen to protect the club for the fans . Famous for scoring Hamburg’s winner against Juventus in the 1983 European Cup Final, he managed the German club before spells at Nurnberg, Eintracht Frankfurt and Werder Bremen. Over three seasons at Stuttgart, he developed players such as Andreas Hinkel, Kevin Kuranyi, Philipp Lahm, Mario Gomez and Alex Hleb. He left Stuttgart for Bayern Munich where he won two doubles but his subsequent success at Wolfsburg put even that in the shade. They avoided relegation on the last day of the season in 2007, but the following year he took them to fifth and in 2009 won the Bundesliga. Schalke 04 was the next stop but an initial second place finish proved the high water mark and following his dismissal in March 2011 relegation- threatened Wolfsburg again came calling. Although he kept them afloat, Magath left the club for a second time a year later. That opened the door to his first job outwith Germany at Fulham last February but after failing to keep them up he was fired in September. Magath gestures at a press conference held during his spell as manager of Bayern Munich in 2006 .","Felix Magath wants to become technical director at Rangers .

"U.S. consumers have not turned out in force for the final shopping days before Christmas, suggesting that traditional retailers will just meet industry sales forecasts in a season marked by deep discounts and growing encroachment from online rivals led by Amazon. Super Saturday - the last pre-Christmas Saturday, which fell on December 20 this year - failed to make up for spotty performance this season. That included a disappointing Black Friday, the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday that is typically one of the busiest shopping days of the year. 'The past weekend will not save this holiday season,' said Craig Johnson, president of the retail and consumer product-oriented private equity fund Customer Growth Partners. Slow but steady: Despite slow sales during Super Saturday and the days leading up to Christmas, U.S. retailers are still expected to hit a sales growth target of 3.4 percent . 'But combined with online sales, it would certainly save the year from being a dismal one.' Johnson said if sales hold up in the next few days and the week after Christmas, retailers may finish close to his company's November and December forecast of 3.4 percent growth in store and online sales. He estimates that Super Saturday weekend sales, which include store and online, rose 2.5 percent to $42 billion this year. The National Retail Federation (NRF), the leading industry trade body, forecast a 4.1 percent rise in holiday sales this year, including online and store sales. The NRF is hoping to meet its expectations amid falling gasoline prices, lower U.S. unemployment and consumer spending which showed signs of increasing during the first two weeks of December. Promotions heated up in the past five days but that did not boost store traffic materially, said Keith Jelinek, senior managing director of FTI Consulting. Most retailers offered an additional 20 to 30 percent off on top of 30 to 40 percent discounts on a wide range of products, Reuters found during a series of visits to three dozen stores in Chicago over the weekend. Best-sellers during the season included Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone 6, toys based on the Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) animated movie 'Frozen,' and winter clothing such as coats from retailers like Macy's Inc (M.N) after a cold spell last month. Home appliances including mixers, coffee makers and food processors from chains like Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Lowe's Companies Inc (LOW.N) JC Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N) were also particularly popular, industry-watchers said. Threat: Online rivals like Amazon are each year making it easier for shoppers to not venture into stores . Super Saturday sales rose 0.5 percent to $9.15 billion from $9.1 billion a year ago, according to early estimates by ShopperTrak, which surveys spending at brick-and-mortar stores. This fell short of the firm's $10 billion sales forecast for the day, founder Bill Martin told Reuters. Analytics firm RetailNext, which tracks specialty stores and large footprint retailers, said sales dropped 8.9 percent over the weekend versus a year ago, and store traffic dipped 10.2 percent. However, customers who did hit the stores spent more. Specialty stores in the United States include chains like Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N) and large footprint retailers include Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target. 'Even with this drop in growth, Super Saturday was still better compared to Black Friday,' said Shelley Kohan, vice president of retail consulting at RetailNext. 'It generated a tad more in terms of sales on slightly less traffic.' Promotions earlier in November took a toll on in-store sales during the Thanksgiving weekend, when total spending fell by 11 percent from a year earlier. Highly discounted categories like consumer electronics and home improvement, which have had a strong season this year, continued to do well on Super Saturday. The apparel segment, which has had one of its worst years, also picked up momentum, although not enough to offset slower growth in the past two months. Experts including Craig Johnson said the growth in apparel is occurring on the back of heavily discounted pricing, so margins this year will be weak in most of the category. FTI Consulting's Jelinek pointed to a jump in online shopping this past weekend which, he said, will bring relief to retailers with physical stores who also have an online presence. 'The majority of retailers will be flat to negative in their bricks and mortar business but their online sales will show significant double-digit increases. This should boost the overall sales number.","Slow sales during Super Saturday and the days leading up to Christmas .

"Former Fulham manager Felix Magath has bought a one per cent stake in Rangers and wants to have a key role in the future of the ailing Ibrox club. Magath, who was sacked by the Championship outfit in September, purchased the shares late last year, and it is understood he has held discussions with one of the groups vying for control of the club. The 61-year-old has no interest in returning to the dugout but rather sees a role for himself as technical director at the club's Murray Park training complex where he can oversee the work with future Rangers talent.

Rangers beat Dumbarton last time out with Dean Shiels (right) wrapping up a 3-1 victory at Ibrox . On Friday, Magath refused to answer questions when asked about his stake in the club. He said: 'I don't want to comment on my stock dealings, that's private. 'I spent the Christmas holidays in London and actually visited someone in Glasgow but I don't want to comment on whether there has been talks with the club either.' Magath gestures at a press conference held during his spell as manager of Bayern Munich in 2006 .

"It has been around 30,000 years since the ancestors of modern-day humans are thought to have wiped out the ancient Neanderthals. But new research shows that the extinct species could be taking revenge on us from beyond the grave by making us more vulnerable to potentially killer diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Neanderthals and modern humans are thought to have co-existed for thousands of years and interbred, meaning Europeans now have roughly 2 per cent Neanderthal DNA. Scientists at Edinburgh University have shown that the genetic similarity between Neanderthals and non-African modern human populations must have arisen after interbreeding in Europe and Asia . These 'legacy' genes have been linked to an increased risk from cancer and diabetes by new studies looking at our evolutionary history. However, it is not all bad news, as other genes we inherited from our species' early life could have improved our immunity to diseases which were common at the time, helping us to survive. However scientists looking into the Neanderthal genome believe their DNA could also have made us more resistant to ancient diseases, helping us to evolve . Speaking to MailOnline, professor Chris Stringer, research leader in human origins at the Natural History Museum in London, said: Neanderthals had been evolving outside of Africa of thousands of years and had been exposed to diseases which our species had not come into contact with. 'Studies have shown we could have taken part of our HLA system, which effects our white blood cells, from them. 'We got a quick fix to our own immune system by breeding with Neanderthals which helped us to survive. 'Studies have also already been published which show that humans outside of Africa are more vulnerable to Type 2 diabetes, and that is because we bred with Neanderthals, while those who stayed inside Africa didn't.' The HLA system helps white blood cells to identify and destroy foreign bodies when they enter the system. Last year researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities announced that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer had been discovered in the Neanderthal genome, and last month Nature magazine published a paper from Harvard Medical School suggesting . that a gene which can cause diabetes in Latin Americans came . from Neanderthals. By examining the genes found in the toe bone of a female Neanderthal, scientists have been able to build up a more complete version of early human history and how modern-humans evolved. Analysis of the DNA found that Neanderthal families were highly interbred, both among themselves, and among other early humans such as Denisovans. The research potentially suggests that Neanderthals became extinct not because early humans killed them, but because they bred with them and incorporated their DNA into the much larger human population. Last year researchers from Oxford and Plymouth universities announced that genes thought to be risk factors in cancer had been discovered in the Neanderthal genome . Next month the Natural History Museum will stage an exhibition, Britain: One Million Years of the Human Story, describing Homo erectus, an early human species that first populated Britain about 900,000 years ago, and displaying life-size models of Neanderthals, a later species. Neanderthals may not, however, be the only contributors to modern human DNA. New studies suggest that during one period, between 100,000-500,000 years ago, there were up to seven species of early human alive at the same time. People from sub-Saharan Africa, have DNA suspected to come from Homo heidelbergensis - the Heildelberg Man - a primitive ancestor, while some Asian groups carry DNA from the Denisovans.","Humans wiped out Neanderthals around 30,000 years ago .

"Enough is enough: Energy Minister John Hayes has called for an end to onshore wind farms . A furious coalition row erupted today after a junior Tory minister declared that the relentless march of onshore wind farms is at an end. Insisting ‘enough is enough’, energy minister John Hayes said turbines had been ‘peppered around the country’ with little or no regard for local opinion. He said existing sites and those in the pipeline would be enough to meet green commitments with no need for more. ‘Even if a minority of what’s in the system is built we are going to reach our 2020 target,’ he said. ‘I’m saying enough is enough.’ But at an early-morning showdown with his boss - Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey - Mr Hayes was told he does not decide government policy. Mr Hayes told the Mail he had commissioned research on the impact of wind turbines on the landscape and whether they drive down house prices. He has also asked scientists to examine noise complaints and more sinister suggestions that the turbines endanger military aircraft by blocking radar signals. The intervention by Mr Hayes, who became energy minister in last month’s reshuffle, will delight 100-plus fellow Tory MPs who have urged David Cameron to take a more sceptical approach to onshore wind power. It does however risk a clash with the Liberal Democrats, who are enthusiastic advocates of renewable energy. A source close to Mr Davey said today: 'John does not decide government policy. There will be no change. We are in a coalition government, not a single party government and definitely not a single minister government. 'We are determined to make sure the coalition lives up to the Prime Minister’s pledge to make it the greenest government ever.' At a meeting of ministers at the Energy department this morning, Mr Davey made clear his anger at Mr Hayes. 'Ed is of the opinion that he ultimately signs off renewables policy. He is the Secretary of State. John is not in the Cabinet and he is not Secretary of State,' the source added. In a statement later Mr Davey said: 'There has been no change to Government policy on renewable energy, as collectively agreed by the Coalition Cabinet. Energy Secretary Ed Davey today slapped down Mr Hayes, insisting onshore wind has 'an important role to play' in Britain . 'Onshore wind is one of the cheapest . renewables, which is why we’ve been able to cut the subsidy.  It has an . important role to play in our energy future.' However Mr Hayes suggested the . controversy over turbines was giving other sources of renewable power – . such as offshore wind, solar and tidal power – a bad name. ‘The onshore wind debate is skewing . the whole debate, which is not good for the Government, not good for . people and not good for the renewables lobby,’ he told the Mail. ‘We can no longer have wind turbines imposed on communities. I can’t single-handedly build a new Jerusalem but I can protect our green and pleasant land. ‘Firstly, I have asked the planning minister to look again at the relationship between these turbines and the landscape. ‘It seems extraordinary to have allowed them to be peppered around the country without due regard for the interests of the local community or their wishes. ‘We have issued a call for evidence on wind. That is about cost but also about community buy-in. We need to understand communities’ genuine desires.’ Mr Hayes said policy should not be based on some ‘bourgeois left article of faith’. ‘These things are about the people and I am the people’s minister,’ he added. Controversial: The Energy Minister said onshore wind farms are turning people against other sources of renewable energy such as offshore alternatives and solar power . ‘I want to look at a broader analysis of the effects – I mean house price values, and other quality of life issues. I want to look particularly at noise, so I have asked the Institute of Acoustics to look at the noise issue from a completely independent perspective. ‘There is a case where people had to move from their family farm because of noise. It is very often the case that local authorities don’t have the wherewithal to address these planning issues.’ Mr Hayes said defence ministers had agreed to investigate claims of radar interference from the spinning blades. The Government has set a target of increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind farms to 13 gigawatts by 2020. But in an indication of a shift in Government policy, ministers announced this summer that the subsidy for onshore wind power generation would be cut by 10 per cent this year. Approvals for onshore wind farms – . around 3,800 turbines are in operation – have however reached record . levels, according to figures published yesterday. RenewableUK, . the wind industry trade body, said in a statement: ‘For the first time . in five years, the UK is seeing a rise in the amount of UK capacity . approved at a local level.’ There . was a 15 per cent increase in approval rates for smaller onshore . projects with capacity of less than 50 megawatts last year compared with . the previous year, it said. Applications for new wind farms have to be made to councils, and around a half are refused. But under the existing system, energy companies often win on appeal to the planning inspectorate. Campaigners took heart from a court ruling in May, in which villagers in Hemsby, on the edge of the Norfolk Broads, succeeded in blocking four 350ft turbines after a judge agreed their right to preserve their landscape was more important than renewable energy targets. Tory MP Chris Heaton Harris, who has led calls for a rethink on wind power, said of Mr Hayes’s remarks: ‘This is a huge step forward. These awful turbines do nothing for the environment – they barely reduce CO2 – they force up energy bills and put more people into fuel poverty. ‘It’s about time the Government listened in this way. Communities will be delighted that they may now be spared the torment they have seen others go through when turbines go up.’ Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson, an arch-sceptic on climate change, said: ‘I would welcome the minister’s statements. I would hope they would translate into a moratorium. An additional problem is that wind power is one of the most expensive forms of generating electricity there is. ‘At a time when there is so much concern both from households and industry about the cost of energy, that too should be a decisive argument against going this way.’ But Labour seized on the coalition row about the future of wind farms. Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said: 'Britain needs a clean, diverse and secure energy supply – but this Government appears clueless when it comes to delivering clean energy and fair bills. 'With energy bills skyrocketing, what hard pressed people urgently want is action but instead we have a shambles of a Tory-led Government which can't even agree with itself.' Greenpeace Energy Campaigner Leila Deen said: 'John Hayes’ petulant outburst adds to the Coalition’s growing energy shambles and to a deepening divide within Government between those who care about green growth and the economy and those who just want more oil and gas. 'Here is a new minister veering off brief and publicly contradicting his bosses. His comments threaten jobs and his approach will drive up energy bills.'","Onshore wind farms give other renewable energy sources a bad name,  Energy Minister John Hayes tells the Daily Mail .

Costume Institute, and is renowned for attracting fashion's most famous faces. However, in spite of it's reputation as the most stylish night of the year, some guests still manage to get it wrong. Katie Holmes, usually preened to perfection, looked more like Belle from Disney's Beauty And The Beast, in a . huge yellow Marchesa gown.

"British experts have successfully bred a rare species of frog that is so poisonous it can kill ten men. The blue poison dart frog is only 2.5cm long and is usually found in the tropical forests of Costa Rica and Brazil. But the species is under threat in South America, where their habitat is being destroyed. Now animal experts at Walford and North Shropshire College have successfully bred one of the deadly amphibians in their lab. Scroll down for video . A blue poison dart frog, found naturally in the tropical forests of Costa Rica and Brazil, has been successfully bred at Walford and North Shropshire College . Despite its diminutive size, the tropical frog can kill ten men with a single dose of its venom . Simon Metcalfe, the animal technician who led the project, said: 'Although eggs were laid on several occasions, the students had been unsuccessful in getting the eggs to progress to tadpoles. 'They had always gone mouldy and not formed. After researching environmental conditions required and their breeding behaviour, a few adjustments were made and we waited for the first clutch of eggs to be laid. Until now the eggs that had been laid had gone mouldy and not formed properly. But after researching environmental conditions and breeding behaviour, the scientists were able to successfully breed a frog . The Blue Poison Dart froglet will grow to be just 2.5cm long when it reaches adulthood . There are more than 100 different species of poison dart frogs and all range between less than an inch to two and a half inches in body length . They are brightly coloured to warn predators they are dangerous. It is the skin that contains the frog's poison. They feed mostly on spiders and small insects such as ants and termites, which they find on the forest floor using their excellent vision. They capture their prey by using their long sticky tongues. 'Now all our research and effort has . paid off and our first froglet was moved out of water and on to dry . land, its metamorphosis now complete.' A male and female blue poison dart frog were donated to the college by a student who left to join the army. Once the pair had produce a fertilised egg, the team placed it in an inside pond, where it took 12 weeks for the froglet to develop. The team of four experts set the water's temperature at 27C (80F), and lit it with UV lights, to recreate the conditions of the frog's natural habitat. But despite the frog's fearsome reputation, the students have nothing . to fear from the tiny frog because it only becomes venomous after . eating certain toxic tree barks and insects in the wild.

"The new software download is intended to bring older iPhones in line with the functions of iPhone 4S - including a new instant-messaging app, iMessage, and the iCloud service which shares music between your Apple devices . The release of Apple's latest iPhone iOS 5 software has been met with widespread anger and frustration from users as the tech giant struggles to cope with massive demand. 'Error 3200' even became a trending topic on Twitter as users were repeatedly confronted with the message as they tried to download the free package of updates intended to bring older iPhones into line with the functions offered by the iPhone 4S. What makes the glitch so unusual is that Apple rarely struggles to cope with demand for its services. Ironically, the inability of Apple's servers to cope may be due to the power of social networks to spread news of yesterday's release after 'Downloading iOS 5' became a trending topic. It's traditional for geeks to be on the edge of their seats in advance of any new Apple software launch - but social networks may have ensured that a wider audience than usual was aware the instant the software - which includes BlackBerry-stye instant messaging - was available. Apple's woes come as BlackBerry itself struggles to appease its increasingly angry users as an outage of email, messaging and internet services stretched into a third day. It is the biggest outage in years for BlackBerry users, and strains their relationship with an already tarnished brand. To help Apple users get quicker access to the new software tech sites yesterday began to offer workarounds and complex 'cheats'. The download is a free update for the operating systems of iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch, accessible via Apple's iTunes software. These devices alert the user that a new update is available when paired with a PC, and you simply agree to download it. The jump in demand could be seen at internet exchanges such as the LINX one in London which showed a multi-gigabit-sized increase that coincided with the launch of the iOS 5 download . The jump in demand could be seen at internet exchanges such as the LINX one in London which showed a multi-gigabit-sized increase that coincided with the launch of the iOS 5 download. A LINX spokesman said, 'We can see that there is a jump in traffic that coincides with the launch of iOS 5.' Apple declined to comment earlier today. While thousands of iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad users were left looking at the 'Error 3200' others managed to eventually download it albeit at an extremely slow pace. As the software launched, many users . complained of slow download speeds, with some asking plaintively 'Has . anyone successfully downloaded iOS 5 yet?' Not all users encountered the 'Error 3200' message, but most found the process excruciating. Soon questions about the error flooded Mac forums and social networks. One Twitter user said, 'Steve Jobs . has only been gone a few days and we are already experiencing the start . of the techpocalypse.' Unlike BlackBerry's high-profile collapse this week, 'Error 3200' seems eminently curable - just keep trying. Other glitches reported with the software include the iCloud music service refusing logins.","News of release 'trending' on social networking site behind surge in interest .

"The great-grandmother, pictured last year, made a 'significant contribution to children's literature' Nina Bawden, who wrote 48 books including the popular children’s story Carrie’s War, has died aged 87. The award-winning novel set during the Second World War was based on her own childhood evacuation to South Wales. It has been studied by schoolchildren as part of the national curriculum and been adapted for stage and screen. Miss Bawden died yesterday at her home in North London, surrounded by her family, including son Robert. She was regarded as one of the few writers of recent times to create successfully for both adults and children, and was admired for her depictions of childhood. She once said she liked writing for children because ‘most people underestimate their understanding and the strength of their feelings and in my books for them I try to put this right.’ In 2002 her husband Austen Kark, the managing director of BBC World Service, was killed and she was badly hurt in the Potter’s Bar train crash. She campaigned to get answers and later received almost £1million in compensation. In one of her last books, Dear Austen, she told the story of the crash in the form of letters to her late husband. Her publisher Lennie Goodings called her ‘a gently fierce, clever, elegant, wickedly funny woman’. Miss Goodings added: ‘She wrote slim books but they were powerful and extraordinarily acute observations about what makes us human. She was a wonderful storyteller and she was writing to the end.’ Miss Bawden often used personal experience in her work. Her first children’s book, The Secret Passage, published in 1963, was written for her three children after they found one in their cellar. The Outside Child told the story of a girl who finds she has a half-brother and sister from her father’s first marriage. The author had a half-sister who had been sent away to live with cousins. Miss Bawden won a scholarship to Oxford and studied alongside Margaret Roberts, who later became Margaret Thatcher. She was made CBE in 1995 and in 2004 received the prestigious ST Dupont Golden Pen Award for literature. The author of more than 40 books was hailed as an influence on young writers. She is pictured left, in 1997, and right, with her husband Austen Kark, who died in 2002 . Nina Bawden's most popular novel Carrie's War, left, which is based on her experience as an evacuee during the Second World War, and Dear Austen, right, one of her last books which follows the 2002 Potters Bar train disaster which killed her husband Austen Kark . Playwright Sir David Hare, whose play . The Permanent Way, about the privatisation of the railways, featured Mrs . Bawden, paid tribute to the writer. He said: ‘I am extremely sad to hear of Nina’s death. ‘Nina . was an uncomplicatedly good woman, whose long fight to obtain justice . for the victims of the Potters Bar crash was a model of eloquence, . principle and human decency.’ Francesca Dow, managing director of Penguin children’s division, said: ‘We are hugely saddened by the death of Nina Bawden - as proud publishers of Nina’s work for Puffin, and for each of us here on a personal level. ‘Nina was a wonderful storyteller, brilliant at stepping into the minds of her characters and conjuring up a powerful sense of time and place. ‘Such is the appeal and power of her . classic novels - including Carrie’s War and The Peppermint Pig - that . they continue to sell strongly today. ‘Nina . has made a significant contribution to children’s literature and been . an influence on many younger writers. She will be sorely missed.’ She is survived by a son, a brother, two step-daughters, nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. Two more from the writer's published list include the adult novel Circles Of Deceit, published in 1998, and children's tale The Peppermint Pig, published in 1977 . Nina Bawden wanted to be a war reporter before she turned to and enjoyed a phenomenally successful career as a novelist. She was the author of more than 40 books, for both adults and children, and was still writing just days before she died, at the age of 87. Born Nina Mabey in Ilford in 1925, her mother was a teacher and her father a marine engineer. A war-time evacuee, she was 14 when she was sent away with the rest of her grammar school at the beginning of the Second World War. Bawden stayed with several different families before returning to London in 1942 and her most famous book, Carrie’s War, drew on her experiences in Wales. Despite being eight when she wrote her first novel, Bawden harboured ambitions to ‘expose things’ as a journalist. But in Oxford, where she read politics, philosophy and economics, she published her first short story, in a magazine. She married Harry Bawden, an ex-airman, soon after graduating but at 22, she was expecting her first baby and so turned down job offers in journalism. ‘I actually hadn’t been using contraception but I thought if you didn’t want a baby then you couldn’t have one - this is a joke nowadays but that was how I felt,’ she said. ‘So I gave up my job because my mother said I couldn’t have a job and a baby, and I decided I had better concentrate on my writing.’ The scene of the Potters Bar crash in 2002, which badly injured Nina Bawden and killed her husband Austen Kark . Bawden had two sons with her first husband and a daughter with Austen Kark, who she met on a London bus. Her son Nicholas Bawden, who had experienced mental health problems, died aged 33, in 1981. His family learned that his body had been pulled out of the Thames months after he had gone missing. Her daughter Perdita Kark also died in March this year, while her other son Robert Bawden is a doctor. One of the characters in Bawden’s Booker prize-shortlisted novel Circles Of Deceit, published in 1987, was based on Nicholas. Bawden could not remember the Potters Bar rail crash, in which her husband was one of seven people killed. ‘I remember getting on the train and sitting down,’ she said. It was only when she woke up in hospital covered in plaster that she discovered her husband had not survived. Bawden, whose ankle was smashed and her arm, leg, shoulder, collarbone and several ribs broken, was in hospital for months after the tragedy. The author, who campaigned to get answers after the accident, featured in a David Hare play on the crash. In 2010, Bawden’s 1970 novel The Birds On The Trees was shortlisted for the Lost Man Booker Award, a special edition of the prize awarded by public vote.","Author, who died at her home in north London home this morning, was still writing in the days before her death .

"Nick Clegg has given up on the idea of stopping Tim Farron from taking charge of the Lib Dems if he is ousted as leader after the election. The Deputy Prime Minister and his supporters had hoped that a leading contender on the right of the party like Danny Alexander could mount a challenge. But allies of Mr Clegg have told MailOnline that left-winger Mr Farron is 'unstoppable', and could mount a challenge even if the Lib Dems are returned to government in a new coalition. Scroll down for video . Senior Lib Dems now believe Tim Farron is certain to triumph as party leader when Nick Clegg is forced to leave the political stage . Some opinion polls put the Lib Dems behind both Ukip and the Greens, with experts predicting the party could lose up to half of its 57 MPs in May. Mr Clegg has vowed to lead his party into the election, and will refuse to step down if he gets the Lib Dems back into government, regardless of how few of his MPs survive. Party sources suggest he could even cling on for several months if the Tories or Labour can take power without the Lib Dems for a 'transitional period'. But hopes of a Lib Dem minister mounting a challenge against Mr Farron are fading fast. 'Tim is unstoppable now,' said one senior Lib Dem source. 'He is a relentless campaigning politician. 'He replies to every tweet, he speaks to every councillor, he turns up to every dinner. He's got the time because he has never had to run a department.' Mr Farron, pictured hugging Mr Clegg in 2012, is seen to have spent the last five years build support amongst the party's 40,000 members while others have been 'tarnished' while serving as ministers in the coalition . Mr Farron has previously been dismissed by some in his party as a 'cheeky chappie telling jokes about Margaret Thatcher and the miners'. But he is understood to have built huge grassroots support, unencumbered by taking difficult decisions in coalition. Supporters of Mr Clegg insist that if he gets the Lib Dems back into a coalition after the election, his position is safe. 'He will be able to go on and on,' said on MP. 'But that doesn't mean Tim won't try to find a way to position himself as a leader in the wings.' Mr Clegg had hoped that his close friend Mr Alexander would have been able to succeed him as leader, to prove the party was serious about being a force in government. Allies saw Mr Alexander as the standard-bearer of the 'responsible' wing of the party. Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has been considered to be 'on manoeuvres' for the last 12 months, raising his personal profile and distancing himself from Tory George Osborne. But he has a huge struggle to cling on to his own seat in the Scottish highlands, and has been tarnished in the eyes of many Lib Dem activists by his close association with Tory austerity. Allies of Mr Clegg had pinned their hopes on his close friend Danny Alexander as the standard-bearer of the 'responsible' wing of the party . Energy Secretary Ed Davey has already thrown his hat into the ring, declaring his willingness to lead the party if it 'falls' to him. He said it was 'not unreasonable' that he and others wold launch a challenge 'when Nick Clegg hangs up his clogs as leader'. He added: 'If one day it falls to me to lead it, then obviously, I'd like to do that.' But he faces a strong challenge from the Tories in his seat, and has failed to impress some of his colleagues. 'If Ed Davey didn't exist as a politician, no-one would invent him,' said one Lib Dem MP. Health minister Norman Lamb is also being urged by colleagues to prepare a leadership bid, but he and his wife are reluctant to embrace the degree of exposure the job would involve. If Mr Clegg is forced out, there is some doubt about who will be in charge in his absence. Sir Malcolm Bruce, the party's deputy leader, is standing down at the election so would not be in the Commons. Vince Cable, who was caretaker leader before Mr Clegg took over, was once tipped as a successor. Health minister Norman Lamb is being urged to prepare a leadership bid, while Energy Secretary Ed Davey has said he would be interested in the job when Nick Clegg 'hangs up his clogs' But his leadership chances suffered a fatal blow when his old friend Lord Oakeshott carried out polling designed to undermine Mr Clegg. Mr Cable denies having any knowledge of the plot, and friends say he has not spoken to Lord Oakeshott since. In a fresh setback, Mr Clegg sacked Mr Cable as the party's economic spokesman for the election campaign, handing the high profile role to Mr Alexander. It means he will debate with Mr Osborne and Labour's Ed Balls, with Mr Cable on the sidelines. Mr Clegg has refused to speculate on his future after the election, but insisted he had survived a barrage ofcriticism from all sides since entering coalition in May. Earlier this month he told BBC One's Andrew Marr show: 'Look I've tried to deal, with as much good grace as I can muster, all the criticism I get day in/day out, left, right and centre. 'It is unsurprising - if it wasn't me, whoever would be leader of the party - that you get that kind of incoming flack because what we're doing is deeply unsettling to the vested interests on right and left in British politics.'","Deputy PM has given up hope of an alternative successor, say friends .
