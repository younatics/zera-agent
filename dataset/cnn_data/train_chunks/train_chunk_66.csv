"Washington (CNN) -- A filing on behalf of basketball superstar LeBron James dismisses as ""rank speculation"" claims by a Washington lawyer that he is the athlete's biological father, saying the man has ""delusions"" about alleged family ties. Lawyers for James and his mother filed papers in federal court Monday seeking to dismiss a pending lawsuit. Leicester Stovell alleges the NBA all-star and his family have been involved in a cover-up to deny paternity, by committing fraud and misrepresentation. The 14-page document said Stovell had completely failed to prove any of the facts alleged in his June 23 complaint. And they said he was motivated only by fame and money, calling Stovell's actions a ""fanciful hope for celebrity."" The lawsuit claims Stovell met James' mother, Gloria, in a Washington bar and restaurant in 1984, when she was visiting from Ohio. She was 15 or 16 at the time, and Stovell says they had sex only once, and was informed by Gloria James months later that she was pregnant. He claims she told him the child would be named LeBron, similar to Leicester Bryce, Stovell's first and middle names. Stovell is asking for unspecified millions of dollars in damages, and says he has been trying for three years to establish paternity, which he hopes would lead to financial and commercial opportunities. He is a solo legal practitioner in the District of Columbia, and filed the lawsuit on his own behalf. He alleges a DNA test that showed he was not James' father was falsified. James' attorneys, Frederick Nance and John Burlingame, dismissed those suggestions in often mocking tones aimed at the plaintiff. ""Stovell's claims for millions of dollars from his putative son and Gloria James are based upon rank speculation,"" said the court filing, ""that a man who claims that as a 29-year-old lawyer he got a 15-year-old girl pregnant during a one-night stand and who never contributed a penny in child support would earn millions in commercial endorsements by crawling out of the woodwork after the child he never gave a thought to became an NBA star."" James, a native of Akron, Ohio, recently left the Cleveland Cavaliers to sign with the Miami Heat for what is believed to be one of the richest sports contracts in history. He is the reigning most valuable player of the NBA, and has carefully cultivated a public image as one of the most popular and talented athletes. The complaint filed June 23 by Stovell said, ""I recently have concluded that a comprehensive, sophisticated and well-funded effort might well have been under way for quite some time, perhaps beginning in its present form as early as when defendant LeBron James was in high school, to frustrate identification of his real father, and that there is a likelihood that the father in question is me."" James' lawyers think otherwise. ""Stovell may truly believe that he is the father of LeBron James, even though a DNA test has told him otherwise. But his delusions do not give rise to a cause of action against either Gloria or LeBron James."" Public records show Stovell is a former government attorney with the Securities and Exchange Commission. He filed a lawsuit in 2002 against the agency, alleging racial discrimination. Federal court records show the case was settled when the SEC paid him $230,000, while not admitting fault.","Man claims to be LeBron James' biological father .

"(CNET)  -- Cisco Systems on Wednesday unveiled Cisco Umi, its consumer-focused telepresence offering that lets people connect to each other using videoconferencing on their HD television in their living rooms. Cisco Umi (pronounced YOU-me) is a telecommunications system that requires a mix of Cisco hardware and hardware you'll already need to own. The Umi service includes a Cisco-issued high-definition camera with an embedded microphone, a set-top box, and a remote, but you'll need your own HD TV (1080p) and Internet connection to use it. There is no external microphone, but you can recalibrate the audio quality. Cisco's algorithms cancel external noice and bring the voices in the foreground. Video calls and video messages are at the center of the Umi service, but the remote will also let customers manage their contact list, profiles, and settings. In addition, Umi will also record videos capable of being uploaded to Facebook and YouTube, or attached in an e-mail message. Umi's VoIP element is also strong, with the ability to place and receive video calls from friends and family from other programs equipped with VoIP video calling, specifically Google video chat. In addition, Umi has certain user controls that will allow owners to block unwanted callers, and lock the Umi system so that others can't use it in your absence. There's also a privacy shutter that clicks off the camera and goes into audio-only mode for those moments that aren't fit to be viewed. If 1080p isn't available, Umi will adapt the bandwidth to drop down to 720p or even 480p quality. As analysts predicted, the hardware alone will cost $599, with a $24.99 monthly service fee. Cisco will make Umi available on November 14 at Best Buy, with preorders beginning today. The hardware components will also be available at Magnolia Home theater. In addition, Cisco and Verizon will bring Umi to Verizon Fios fiber-optic network customers early in 2011. Meanwhile. peripherals maker Logitech has its own HD video-calling product coming out today at the company's announcement of Logitech Revue with Google TV. ""We believe consumers want the best and most seamless experience which means HD video calling not only from TV to TV, but also TV to PC or Mac (or vice versa),"" Erik Kintz, VP and general manager of Logitech's video business, said in a statement. ""We also believe consumers will want a free service and one that is integrated into a broader entertainment experience, which is why Logitech is excited to introduce an integrated HD video calling offering with Google TV."" Cisco will market its Umi system with a mall tour to give prospective customers a chance to try the product hands-on. The $600 price point could be a hard sell for casual users accustomed to free VoIP services like Skype. In addition, Cisco will likely air commercials featuring Canadian actress Ellen Page, in a reprisal of her role in a series of ads to promote Cisco's telepresence for business. In reaction to Cisco's Umi, Skype invoked Moore's Law, the essence of which is that technology gets faster, smaller, and cheaper over time. ""Buy a $599 device and it can be subject to obsoletism at the hands of mass-market options that sell for 1/2, then 1/4, and eventually 1/10 the price. And, when unbeatable lower cost, high performance options are readily available, spending at the top-end can be like throwing money away, especially if you are buying a video calling system and there is no one else to call,"" Skype's Jonathan Christensen said in a blog post.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- It's been a year since the parents of a severely disabled child made public their decision to submit their daughter to a hysterectomy, breast surgery and drugs to keep the girl forever small. Today, the couple tell CNN, they believe they made the right decision -- one that could have a profound impact on the care of disabled children worldwide. The profoundly disabled girl known as Ashley, now 10, has achieved her full height,  4 feet 5 inches. ""The 'Ashley treatment' has been successful in every expected way,"" Ashley's parents told CNN exclusively in a lengthy e-mail interview. ""It has potential to help many others like it helped our precious daughter."" While unwavering in their belief in the treatment, Ashley's parents continue to insist on anonymity. In the year since Ashley's parents went public, not only did the hospital that sterilized Ashley admit it broke Washington state law, but also the doctor who treated Ashley committed suicide. As scrutiny of the case deepens, so too does the chasm in the medical community: Is it mutilation, with doctors ""playing God"" -- or, is stunting growth a liberating option for caregivers and the disabled children who will need constant care for the rest of their lives? Ashley is now 10 years old and, at 4 feet 5 inches tall, has achieved her full height and weight, 63 pounds. The treatment permanently closed her growth plates and took more than a foot off her anticipated height. ""Ashley did not grow in height or weight in the last year, she will always be flat-chested, and she will never suffer any menstrual pain, cramps or bleeding,"" say her parents, who felt it important to publicly address their decision after repeated interview requests, in the hopes of sharing their experience with other families. They responded by e-mail only, to protect the family's identity. (Read the complete interview) Ashley's current state -- to them -- is the definition of success. She was born brain-damaged, with a condition described as static encephalopathy, or cerebral palsy. One of her doctors described her mental capacity as that of a 6-month-old, dependent upon her parents to meet every need. She does not walk or talk; she's fed through a tube and wears diapers. When Ashley was 6, her parents approached Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center in Seattle, Washington, for the operations. They believed this would make it easier to cuddle and carry a child who can do little more than lie propped on a pillow. Weight and height are the ""worst enemy,"" they write, for children such as Ashley, for whom they've coined the term ""pillow angels."" In 2004, Children's Hospital performed a hysterectomy, removed Ashley's breast buds and gave her high-dose estrogen to retard growth and sexual maturation -- a procedure that has risks, but to date has not harmed her, her parents say. While the ""Ashley treatment"" was first published in the October 2006 issue of the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, it wasn't until the family posted its blog last year that a firestorm erupted in the blogosphere, with responses from ""inhumane"" and ""perverse"" -- to ""walk in our shoes."" ""If parents of children like Ashley believe this treatment will improve their children's quality of life, then they should be diligent and tenacious in providing it for them,"" her parents write. ""We have a sacred duty to do what we believe is right for our children."" But in Ashley's case, what her parents thought was right wasn't legal. In May 2007, Children's Hospital admitted it broke state law by giving Ashley a hysterectomy without a proper court review. To perform any such treatment today would require a court order, as well as review by a panel of experts in medicine and ethics and people with disabilities, says Dr. Douglas Diekema of Treuman Katz Center for Pediatric Bioethics, the consulting ethicist on Ashley's case. So, will doctors stop the growth of more children like Ashley? Right now, no growth-attenuation therapy is being administered by other doctors anywhere in the nation, according to pediatric experts. Supporters wonder whether another factor, the suicide in September of Ashley's endocrinologist, Dr. Daniel Gunther, may have slowed wider adoption of the treatment. ""We know from reliable sources his treatment of our daughter was a source of energy and motivation for him,"" Ashley's parents write. ""He was frustrated about being blocked from providing this treatment to other children in need. He strongly believed this treatment should be available to them."" The family appears to be the lone voice with that opinion; CNN shared the family's comment with Children's Hospital, but did not get a response. In media reports, colleagues and family members were said to believe Gunther's suicide was not related to the treatment of the girl. Another complicating factor -- some doctors remain adamant the treatment shouldn't be available. ""Adults can consent. But for a child, we're making decisions for them and hoping in our heart of hearts we are making the right decisions,"" says Dr. Nancy Murphy, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Children with Disabilities. Murphy will push for consensus among doctors at a pediatrics conference later this year, but acknowledges strong discord as critics continue to insist that keeping children small reduces them to a permanent infant-like condition, denying the basic human right to experience an adult body, adult feelings and adult relationships. But for Ashley, that may be moot. ""[This disability] shatters the reason we become parents: to watch kids grow, to be part of their lives and to launch into their own lives,"" says Murphy. ""When you have a child with lifelong dependency, you don't get to launch your kid, and your caregiver options are limited."" But like many other people with disabilities, 43-year-old Anne Rader, who also has cerebral palsy but in a much less severe form than Ashley's, sees the treatment as dehumanizing -- and perhaps most significantly -- irrevocable. ""The parents are not seeing the potential of the child; they are seeing a baby,"" says Rader. ""People with disabilities have to look at the potential of our lives: of available new technology, new equipment, medical advances. Things can change so quickly now."" Some ethicists, too, remain staunch in their assessment that the ""Ashley treatment"" is a violation of not only human dignity, but also of a physician's oath to do no harm. ""I think mutilating surgery involving removal of breast buds is indefensible under any circumstances,"" says Arthur Caplan, the chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. ""Growth retardation is not a substitute for adequate home aides and home assistance."" Ashley's parents remain convinced what they did for Ashley is the most loving choice they could have made for their daughter and want that for other disabled children.

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- A Seattle cartoonist who drew a cartoon about the Prophet Mohammed has been warned by the FBI about death threats made against her by a radical cleric with ties to al Qaeda, an FBI agent said Tuesday. ""She should be taken as a prime target of assassination,"" terror suspect Anwar al-Awlaki purportedly wrote about cartoonist Molly Norris in an English-language magazine called Inspire that claimed to be a publication of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. ""This campaign is not a practice of freedom of speech, but is a nationwide mass movement of Americans"" who are ""going out of their way to offend Muslims worldwide,"" the article signed by al-Awlaki continued. Al-Awlaki is himself being sought in Yemen for his alleged role as a planner of the failed bombing of a Detroit-bound passenger plane on Christmas Day last year. Norris has been advised to take precautions to ensure her safety, said FBI Special Agent Marty Prewett. ""The FBI is always reviewing and assessing information it receives,"" Prewett said. ""Whenever the FBI comes into possession of information of a threatening nature to an individual, we let that person know so they can take appropriate security measures. That is the case here."" Prewitt declined to comment on where Norris is and whether she is receiving protection from law enforcement. Al-Awlaki also threatened eight other cartoonists, journalists and writers from Britain, Sweden and Holland. Norris kicked off a controversy in April with a cartoon published online about an imaginary group called ""Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor"" that proposed an ""Everybody Draw Mohammed Day"" on May 20. Norris said in media interviews at the time that she was inspired by the furor created from an episode of the show ""South Park"" that depicted the Propeht Mohammed dressed in a bear suit. Comedy Central, which airs ""South Park,"" aired an edited version of the episode after the show's creators received threats. Norris' cartoon inspired a campaign to create pictures of the Islamic prophet across the internet with over 100,000 people signing up on a Facebook page. A Pakistani court ordered access to Facebook there cut off for two weeks. Competing sites blasted the campaign also drew tens of thousands of followers. Many Muslims find drawings and other depitcions of the Prophet Mohammed to be deeply offensive. Norris said the consequences of the drawing were unintended. ""I wasn't savvy,"" the cartoonist said in an interview last month with City Arts Magazine, where many of her cartoons were published.  ""I didn't mean for my satirical poster to be taken seriously. It became kind of an excuse for people to hate or be mean-spirited. I'm not-mean spirited,"" Norris said. An editor at City Arts said neither the magazine nor Norris had any comment on the death threats against her. Adam Raisman, a senior analyst for the Site Intelligence Group, which monitors Islamic terror groups online communications, said al-Awlaki's threats constituted a continued effort to reach a wider audience and should not be taken lightly. ""The prophet is the pinnacle of Jihad [for al-Awlaki and his followers],"" he said. ""It is better to support the prophet by attacking those who slander him than it is to travel to land of Jihad like Iraq or Afghanistan."" In February an ax-wielding man broke into the home of Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard who has been targeted by extremists for his drawing of Mohammed. He and his grandaughter hid in a fortified ""panic room"" during the attack.","Cartoonist Molly Norris began a controversy with an online cartoon in April .

"(CNN) -- Nationalists held a narrow lead in Kyrgyzstan's parliamentary elections, the country's election commission said Monday. Of the 87 percent of the votes counted by Monday morning, the Ata Zhurt party had won 8.6 percent, said Nuriya Iskanderova, a consultant for the commission. The other four main parties followed with narrow margins separating them. The pro-government SDPK (Social-Democratic Party of  Kyrgyzstan)  won 7.97 percent of the counted votes; followed by the . Arnamys Party (7.12 percent); the Republic Party (7.02 percent) and the Atameken Party (5.94 percent). The election commission has to announce final results within two  weeks, said Klara Sooromkulova, a member of the election commission. Voters in the Central Asian nation went to the polls Sunday to elect a new parliament. The elections come after a year that has seen the president flee the country and ethnic riots that left hundreds dead. International monitors did not report any major complaints on election day, though local observers from the political parties were more vocal with their concerns, Sooromkulova said. Voter turnout was high, especially in the south of the country, she said, including a 56 percent turnout in the capital, Bishkek. The new government will have to rebuild ""the entire infrastructure of the government, as well as the rebuilding of social cohesion and trust between ethnic groups,"" said Kanat Saudabayev, a top official with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was deposed in April and was replaced by Roza Otunbayeva, who became the first female president of a Central Asian nation. Two months later, at least 356 people were killed and about 400,000 fled their homes in a wave of violence between ethnic Kyrgyz and Uzbeks. Shortly after that, Kyrgyz voters approved a new constitution that puts more power in the hands of parliament, reducing the president's role. ""Following the June situation of unrest and violence, it was not easy to organize the elections,"" Sooromkulova said. Kyrgyzstan hosts a United States air base which is an essential supply route for NATO personnel and equipment into Afghanistan, called Manas Transit Center, as well as a Russian military base, Kant, just outside of the capital Bishkek. Nearly 2.9 million people were eligible to vote for 120 lawmakers in a parliament called the Jogorku Kenesh, the Central Election Commission said. There were 850 international election observers representing 32 organizations and 52 countries. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.","NEW: By Monday morning, 87 percent of the votes have been counted .

"(CNN) -- A week of Nobel Prize announcements comes to a climax on Friday with the unveiling of the winner of the Peace Prize, perhaps the world's most prestigious award. But who's going to win it? Guessing can be tricky, not least because the names of the nominees are secret. We do know that there are a record number of nominees this year, since committee head Geir Lundestad has said 199 individuals and 38 organizations are in the running. And the Norwegian Nobel Committee seems to like springing surprises. Few had heard of Iranian lawyer Shirin Ebadi before she won the prize in 2003, or of Kenyan environmentalist Wangari Maathai before she got it the following year. And while practically everyone has heard of the 2009 Nobel Laureate, President Barack Obama, practically no one expected him to win the prize within a year of taking office. That said, it's always fun to guess, so here are some of CNN's top contenders: . Liu Xiaobo: The leading Chinese dissident was sentenced to 11 years in prison late in 2009 for inciting subversion of state power. He's the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. His sentencing prompted a groundswell of support for him from former Peace Prize laureates and perennial contenders. Vaclav Havel, the hero of Czechoslovakia's 1989 Velvet Revolution (who never won the Nobel Prize), retired South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who did, in 1984) and the Dalai Lama (1989) were among a group of intellectuals who publicly urged the Nobel Committee to give the prize to Liu shortly after he was sentenced. American writer Kwame Anthony Appiah, the head of the American PEN center, a literary and human rights organization, nominated Liu in January, he said.' The Wall Street Journal reported in February that Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said it would be ""totally wrong"" for ""such a person"" to win the Nobel Peace Prize, and that the comment was later scrubbed from the official transcript of the briefing. The Irish bookmaking Paddy Power has already paid out on bets for him to win the prize, it announced Wednesday after a surge in betting led it to suspect that information had leaked. Memorial: Born of the violence and repression that accompanied the final days of the Soviet Union, the Russian human rights group now focuses on monitoring ""hot spots"" or conflict zones within the country -- a task that has proven deadly. The group's leading activist in Chechnya, Natalya Estimirova, was kidnapped and murdered in July 2009. She was shot in the head and the chest, and her body was dumped in the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. Estimirova had worked in Chechnya for more than 10 years and had openly criticized Chechnya's Moscow-backed president, Ramzan Kadyrov, and his methods. Her murder outraged human rights activists worldwide. Human Rights Watch, the Committee to Protect Journalists, the European Union and the United States were among those appealing to Russia to conduct a transparent investigation of the crime. Mary Robinson: The first woman to be president of Ireland went on to be the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, a post she held from 1997 to 2002. After she left the United Nations, she founded a new organization, Realizing Rights, which aims ""to put human rights standards at the heart of global governance and policy-making and to ensure that the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are addressed on the global stage."" Robinson also is a member of the Elders, a group of leading statesmen and stateswomen brought together by former South African president Nelson Mandela -- himself a Nobel Laureate -- to support peace building and try to address the major causes of human suffering. The 13 current, former and honorary Elders include six Nobel Peace Prize winners. Robinson trained as a lawyer and has argued cases before the European Court of Human Rights, the European Court in Luxembourg, and Irish courts. Morgan Tsvangirai: The longtime leader of the opposition to Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe entered an uneasy power-sharing agreement with his rival in 2009, becoming prime minister. Tsvangirai has led the Movement for Democratic Change since 1999, surviving three assassination attempts, beatings and imprisonment. He rejects the charge that he ""sold out"" or gave legitimacy to Mugabe with the power-sharing agreement. ""The country was confronted with chaos and anarchy. We rescued our country and saved it in order to have the long-term stability that we are looking for,"" he told CNN last month. He continues to press for ""a credible and legitimate election"" in Zimbabwe, he said. Sima Samar: The chairperson of Afghanistan's Independent Human Rights Commission, Samar is a medical doctor who fled Afghanistan when its communist regime arrested her husband in 1984. She remained in exile until 2002 when she was appointed as a women's affairs minister in Afghan President Hamid Karzai's transitional administration. She's done work on human rights around the world, not only in Afghanistan. She served as the United Nations special rapportuer for human rights in Sudan from 2005 to 2009, and was considered for the post of U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, according to an organization which tries to predict Nobel Peace Prize winners. ""She has been under frequent attacks both from conservative religious leaders and from Islamist radicals, and she is a prominent voice for the rights of women,"" the Peace Research Institute Oslo said, adding that she ""does invite respect by being a principled and outspoken proponent of human rights and the need for a true reconciliatory process."" PRIO is not connected to the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which chooses the winners. Its director, Kristian Berg Harpviken, also considers the Democratic Voice of Burma news agency and the Special Court for Sierra Leone to be top contenders. CNN's Kristie Lu Stout, Robyn Curnow and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Mario Vargas Llosa says he is surprised and ""very grateful""

"(CNN) -- Brent King says it still ""takes my breath away"" to talk about his daughter in the same sentence as the man who killed her. But he takes comfort in the knowledge that new California legislation named after his daughter, Chelsea King, will help protect other people's children from sex crimes. ""If this legislation would've been in place before, Chelsea would still be with us,"" King said, speaking Tuesday about Chelsea's Law, which he and his wife, Kelly, worked on with state Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher. Chelsea's Law is awaiting Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's signature after unanimously passing the Senate and Assembly in a rare display of bipartisanship. Formally known as AB 1844, the bill creates mandatory sentences of life without parole for specified violent sexual offenses against children. Another major provision of the 62-page bill is lifetime parole for people who commit certain sex crimes against minors. Read the complete text of the bill . It's not the only proposed legislation to arise out of the heinous acts of registered sex offender John Gardner III, who admitted in March to killing 17-year-old Chelsea King. A few days after her body was found, he led authorities to the remains of 14-year-old Amber Dubois, who had been missing for more than a year. Gardner was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life without parole for the murders and an attack on a jogger. The deaths of the young girls provided impetus for a flurry of tougher proposed laws aimed at protecting children. Dubois' father is behind three assembly bills concerning law enforcement response to missing children. Among the legislative proposals: . -- Creating a rapid response team in the state Attorney General's Office to help find abducted children. -- Reducing the minimum time for reporting a missing child from four hours to two. -- Enhanced training for police officers who search for missing children. The four bills are on their way to Schwarzenegger's desk after being fast-tracked through the Legislature. Chelsea's Law also has an urgency clause that means it will take effect as soon as Schwarzenegger signs it. The Dubois bills do not have an urgency clause and would take effect in January 2011. The bills could have a ripple effect as King actively tries to get other states to adopt similar legislation. Read how Chelsea's killer targeted others . The speed of passage was rare for the California legislature, but not without precedent from other child safety legislation, said Mark Klaas, president and founder of KlaasKids Foundation, a nonprofit devoted to fighting crimes against children. ""California has a history of responding very strongly to vicious sex crimes against kids, especially in an election year,"" Klaas said. ""When you have the fresh memory of a beautiful young girl murdered by a person who shouldn't have been out in the first place, they're going to respond accordingly."" He cited the passage within months of a three-strikes law named for his daughter, Polly, who was abducted during a sleepover and murdered in 1993. Jessica's Law, which increased penalties for certain crimes against minors, also passed within months of being introduced, Klaas said. Klaas said he believes the Dubois bill will have a more immediate effect than Chelsea's Law. ""Sentencing gets a lot of publicity, but they rarely seem to deliver on the promises. Other administrative bills are less colorful and more localized, but they have a possibility of helping shore up infrastructure,"" he said. Gardner was paroled September 26, 2005, after serving five years for two counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child younger than 14 and a single count of false imprisonment for attacking a 13-year-old neighbor. Under Chelsea's Law, lewd and lascivious acts on a minor will carry a mandatory sentence of life without parole. The ""one-strike"" provision applies to forcible sex crimes against minors that include aggravating factors, such as the victim's age or whether the victim was bound or drugged. ""Because of what he'd done previously to the 13-year-old girl, he would have been given life without the possibility of parole,"" Brent King said. ""He never would've been let out, and Chelsea never would've been harmed."" King and other supporters say the bill is the most sweeping reform of its kind in recent California history, touching upon sentencing and parole as well as treatment and funding. Opponents of Chelsea's Law call it another feel-good measure that pushes registered sex offenders further to the fringes of society. ""No matter how slight the offense, everyone in California is included in the same net, ridicule, rules and restrictions,"" said a San Diego woman whose adult son is on the registry for improperly touching a 16-year-old girl. He lost custody of his son. As a result of residency restrictions, he had to move in with his parents, she said. The mother asked that her name be withheld for fear of reprisal against her family. ""Our constitutional rights are violated daily, and no one in this country cares,"" she wrote in an e-mail. ""This new law is yet another 'feel good' law that further damages families of those on the registry, and will no doubt add millions of tax burdens to taxpayers."" The woman and her son live in the same neighborhood where the Kings lived when Chelsea was alive. After Chelsea disappeared, the King family asked neighbors to tie blue ribbons around trees in her memory. The King family relocated to Illinois a few weeks ago. ""Every morning, I awaken to blue ribbons tied to the trees across the street. A daily reminder that we are now lepers,"" the San Diego woman said in her e-mail. ""What happened to Chelsea was an unimaginable tragic event caused by one sick individual."" In response to criticism that the legislation took a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to punishing sex offenses and managing paroled sex offenders, Fletcher amended the bill in committee. It now includes criteria for assessing the risk of recidivism and, based on that risk, placing certain paroled sex offenders under greater supervision. The bill also calls for those risk assessment ""scores"" to be included in the offenders' online profiles on the Megan's Law website, California's version of the sex offender registry. ""We will be instituting a dynamic risk assessment, which means it can change on a monthly basis and it will be based on a whole series of factors, not just the crime,"" said Fletcher, who introduced the legislation in the state assembly in April. The bill also allows the use of polygraphs in parole supervision. ""This legislation provides experts with better tools than the ones available now to assess risk. If you have a sex offender who's not compliant, their risk assessment level will go up, they'll get more visits and supervision,"" Fletcher said. The amended legislation also addresses funding for changes expected to cost tens of millions of dollars over the next decade, according to a preliminary study by the state Legislative Analyst's Office. The crime of petty theft will be downgraded to a misdemeanor, clearing clogged court dockets and freeing space in jails and prisons. Despite its broad sweep, Brent King says the bill's cornerstone is the one-strike provision. ""It was my and Kelly's belief that there was no reason that we could find that people who targeted young children violently could ever be reformed, so why give these violent sexual predators an opportunity to strike twice? That was our premise and it grew from there,"" he said. King said he has identified four states that are interested in adopting similar legislation but he would not name them. ""I think California has taken such a strong step forward that I'm excited about taking Chelsea's Law across the nation.""","Chelsea's Law is one of four bills stemming from murders committed by John Gardner III .

"London, England (CNN) -- Metropolitan police in London, England, appealed Monday for further information about last month's death of a man who worked for a British intelligence agency and whose naked body was found in a padlocked duffel bag in his bathroom. Police also released surveillance camera images of Gareth Williams taken August 15, about a week before officials discovered his body on August 23. In addition, police said they would like help identifying ""a man and a woman, both of Mediterranean appearance,"" between the ages of 20 and 30 and who were seen entering Wiliams' apartment building late one evening in June or July. ""This remains a complex unexplained death enquiry,"" Det. Chief Inspector Jacqueline Sebire said in a statement Monday. Williams worked at Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), Britain's intelligence agency for monitoring communication and keeping government data secret, the agency told CNN. He was widely reported to have been on loan to MI6, the foreign intelligence service, in London. The crime scene did not seem to reveal much information. ""There was no sign of any forced entry to the property, and no signs of disturbance inside,"" police said, adding that robbery did not appear to be a motive. ""We do not believe there is any property missing from the flat,"" the police statement said. ""There is no suggestion the items within the flat were specifically posed. No drugs, or indications of drug usage were recovered."" An August 25 autopsy ""established no obvious cause of death,"" police said. ""Extensive forensic tests at the flat in Alderney Street and from the samples taken at the post mortem continue,"" police said. ""Initial indications from the toxicology examinations show no trace of any alcohol or routine or recreational drugs. Testing for any other substance continues."" Police believe Williams was last seen alive on August 15, when surveillance cameras show him shopping in the West End and Knightsbridge areas of London. He had returned August 11 from a trip to the United States, police said Monday.","His naked body was found stuffed inside a locked bag in his bathroom .

"(CNN)  -- Caroline Wozniacki underlined her status as women's top seed with a battling straight sets 6-3 6-4 victory over former champion Maria Sharapova in their last 16 clash at the U.S. Open on Monday. The 20-year-old Dane withstood the customary onslaught from Sharapova to emerge victorious after just under two hours of compelling action on the Arthur Ashe Stadium Court at Flushing Meadows. Sharapova, desperate for another grand slam title after clawing her way back up the rankings following shoulder surgery, made an impressive start but an astonishing string of double faults in the fourth game saw her fall 3-1 behind. In customary style she immediately broke back with her best tennis of the match, but then lost her own service again leaving Wozniacki to serve out for the first set. The second was again a tight and closely fought affair, but in the seventh game Sharapova chose the wrong moment for her ninth double fault and she was behind again. Wozniacki held to leave Sharapova to serve to stay in the championship and the former world number one was forced to bravely save a match point before closing to 4-5. But Wozniacki, beaten by Kim Clijsters in last year's final, made no mistake when she served for the match, closing it out with the first of two match points. It was her first win over former world number one Sharapova. She will now play Dominika Cibulkova in the quarterfinals after the Slovakian's impressive 7-5 7-6 win over another former champion Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia. Ranked 45, Cibulkova is the lowest ranked player remaining in the draw, but performed well above her status to outlast Kuznetsova. Also through to quarterfinals is Estonia's Kaia Kanepi, who came from a set down to beat Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer 0-6 7-6 6-1 in a thriller on the Louis Armstrong Stadium Court. Wickmayer, a semifinalist at Flushing Meadows last year, looked to be cruising to victory as she swept the opening set without the loss of a game, but 31st seed Kanepi battled back to level on a tiebreaker and swept through the decider. Russia's Vera Svonareva was also victorious on day eight, advancing 6-1 6-2 at the expense of Germany's Andrea Petkovic. It was a comfortable win for the seventh seed, who will now play in her first U.S. Open quarterfinal.","Caroline Wozniacki beats Maria Sharapova in last 16 at U.S. Open .

"(CNN) -- Almost as soon as it was confirmed, the visit of reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il to China was over Monday. State-run news outlets in China confirmed Kim's visit Monday. Kim met with Chinese President Hu Jintao in Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin Province, on Friday, the state-run Xinhua news agency of China reported Monday. Kim said he hoped for an early resumption of six-party talks to ease tension between North and South Korea, the news agency reported. The six-party talks involve South Korea, North Korea, China, Japan, Russia and the United States. Delegates to the talks had sought to disarm North Korea of nuclear weapons, but North Korea ended the talks last year. The North acted after the United Nations Security Council condemned North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket. The Security Council said the launch violated a resolution banning ballistic missile testing. North Korea also expelled U.S. nuclear experts and U.N. nuclear inspectors after the Security Council's rebuke. On Monday, the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Kim as saying that North Korea ""is not willing to see tensions on the peninsula."" He also expressed a desire to ""maintain close communication and coordination with China in pushing for an early resumption of the six-party talks."" Kim was in China from last Thursday until Monday, Xinhua reported. Kim's visit to China was seen as related to his anticipated transfer of power to his son, Kim Jong-un, the Yonhap news agency of South Korea reported last week. Upon leaving Monday, Kim sent a message of thanks to Chinese President Hu, which was quoted by the official Korean Central News Agency.  He touted relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and China. ""During our visit to the northeastern region of China where the revolutionaries  of the elder generation of the two countries created the history and tradition  of the DPRK-China friendship through the bloody struggle against imperialism we  more keenly realized how dear the DPRK-Sino friendship is as it is cherished  deep in the hearts of the two peoples and weathered all trials of  history."" The North Korean leader predicted a long-lasting ""friendship"" between the nations and wished the Chinese people well.  ""I sincerely hope that the fraternal Chinese people would achieve greater  successes in the efforts to build a comprehensively well-off socialist society  on the basis of the scientific outlook on development under the leadership of  the CPC with you as general secretary,"" his letter to Hu said. Kim's trip coincided with former President Jimmy Carter's visit to North Korea, during which Carter secured the release of a U.S. citizen who had been sentenced to eight years hard labor for crossing the Chinese border into North Korea. The man, Aijalon Mahli Gomes, arrived home with Carter Friday afternoon in Boston, Massachusetts. The Chinese president, meanwhile, said ""there had been some new developments"" since the United Nations Security Council condemned the sinking of a South Korean warship in March. A South Korean investigation concluded that North Korea sank the ship. Several Western nations said they agreed with that conclusion, but the Security Council did not specifically name North Korea when it condemned the sinking in July. The Xinhua news agency did not elaboration on what Hu was referring to when he spoke of ""new developments.""","The North Korean leader visited China, a state-run news agency reported .

"SRINAGAR, Indian-administered Kashmir (CNN) -- The chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir tendered his resignation Tuesday after he was accused of being involved in a 2006 sex scandal, his adviser said. Omar Abdullah denies any link to a prostitution ring, saying he has stepped down to clear his name. Omar Abdullah, 38, delivered his resignation to the state governor after opposition member Muzaffar Hussain Beigh accused Omar of a connection to the prostitution scandal during a session of the state legislative assembly. Muzaffar served as the deputy chief minister in the previous government, when several top pro-India officials were arrested on charges they misused their authority to force girls and women into a prostitution ring in Kashmir. Omar denied being involved in the scandal, but said he could not ""continue in the office following the allegation"" and would not serve again until he is cleared of the charges. ""This is not an ordinary allegation, but a highly serious one. I cannot continue in office until I am cleared,"" Omar said in the state assembly. He then drove to Raj Bhawan, the official residence of New Delhi-appointed governor N. N. Vohra, to deliver his resignation, according to Devender Rana, Omar's political adviser. The governor is consulting constitutional and legal experts before deciding on the resignation. The chief minister refused to talk to journalists outside the governor's residence. The Times of India newspaper Tuesday quoted highly placed sources in India's Central Bureau of Investigation as saying that Omar's name never came up in the prostitution probe. Omar came into office in January following elections in late 2008 that saw the highest voter turnout in the region in nearly 20 years, since the eruption of a secessionist insurgency. Voters went to the polls in large numbers, despite a separatist call for a boycott of the voting. Most recently, the chief minister has been working to defuse tensions that are still running high following the arrest of four police officers in the probe of the alleged rape and murder of two young Muslim women in May. Two people have died and many have been injured in more than 300 violent clashes between Muslim protesters and Indian security forces stemming from the case. The arrests included the former police chief of south Kashmir's Shopian district and three of his subordinates, who are accused of ""destruction of evidence"" and ""dereliction of duty"" in connection with the deaths, which occurred in the town of Shopian. Kashmir has been in the throes of a bloody secessionist campaign for nearly two decades in which, according to official figures, 43,000 people have been killed. Various rights groups and non-governmental organizations here, however, dispute the official statistics -- claiming that the number killed during the last two decades is twice the official figure.","Chief minister of Indian-administered Kashmir tenders his resignation .

"New York (CNN) -- Now that the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has denied landmark status for a building, near ""ground zero,"" that could house a proposed Islamic center and mosque, the Muslim organization behind the project says it will begin moving forward with efforts to make the building ""a model for community service and engagement."" The commissioners voted unanimously against landmark status for 45-47 Park Place. It and an adjoining building already connected on the inside, 49-51 Park Place, are owned by real estate developer Soho Properties, which intends to build the Islamic center two blocks north of the former site of the World Trade Center. In a statement on a new website devoted to the project now called Park51, the project's planners said, ""Until the resolution of the landmarks issue this morning, we were unable to emerge from stage one, as we could not be clear on the impact of a designation on the architecture and design of the building or its program spaces, activities or programming. We are eager to begin working with our partners, supporters, neighbors and communities, to build a community center for everyone."" ""It had been a whirlwind in the past four months, one in which we have worked tirelessly to realize an American dream which so many other share,"" Sharif El-Gamal, the chief executive officer of Soho Properties, said. ""The outpouring support has exceeded our expectations. We are Americans; Muslim Americans. We are businessmen, businesswomen, lawyers, doctors, restaurant workers, cab drivers, and professionals of every walk of life represented by the demographic and tapestry of Manhattan,"" El-Gamal said. While the public vote was the focus of much debate about the planned Islamic center and mosque, the commission could not have prevented the developers from building such a community center. The commission, by designating the building a landmark, could only have prevented Soho Properties from demolishing the building or significantly altering its exterior. Muslims have been praying peacefully in the building already. ""We believe that Park51 will become a landmark in New York City's cultural, social and educational life, a community center to promote the American values we all aspire towards and to realize a better city for all,"" said Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf, the religious leader of the Cordoba Initiative, which will inhabit the building. ""We will continue going forward with the project. It's a project that will build bridges,"" said Oz Sultan, spokesman for the Cordoba Initiative. It says the group is ""committed to promoting positive interaction between the Muslim world and the West."" Cordoba opposed landmark status for the five-story building because it would like to build a taller, modern building. ""It's not minarets,"" said Sultan, who described a mock-up of the proposed center as consistent with the latest architecture found in New York City. New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city leaders support the Islamic center. Opponents, including former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, have argued against a mosque being so close to the scene of the nation's worst terrorist attack. ""Peace-seeking Muslims, pls understand, Ground Zero mosque is UNNECESSARY provocation; it stabs hearts. Pls reject it in interest of healing,"" tweeted Palin last month on her Twitter account. The Anti-Defamation League, an organization that battles anti-Semitism and other forms of bigotry, is asking that the Islamic center and mosque be built farther away from ground zero in consideration of families who lost loved ones during the September 11, 2001, attacks. ""Building an Islamic Center in the shadow of the World Trade Center will cause some victims more pain -- unnecessarily -- and that is not right,"" said the organization in a written statement. The Landmarks Preservation Commission pointed out prior to its decision that it would have nothing to do with the planned use of the structure. ""The purpose of tomorrow's vote is to decide whether the building has a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or value as part of the development, heritage or cultural characteristics of New York City, New York State or the nation,"" commission spokeswoman Elisabeth de Bourbon said Monday. Most recently the home of a Burlington Coat Factory retailer, 45-47 Park Place was completed in 1858. The Landmarks Commission described it as ""a prominent example of the store and loft structures that dominated the dry goods warehouse districts of Lower Manhattan"" during the era.","NEW: A Muslim group says it will begin moving forward with plans for an Islamic center near ""ground zero""

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- A court in northern Japan found two Greenpeace activists guilty Monday for stealing whale meat, but suspended their sentences, Greenpeace Japan said. The Aomori District Court ruled that the activists, Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki, will only have to serve one-year terms if they commit a crime in the next three years, Greenpeace said. In a press conference after the verdict, Sato said Greenpeace would appeal the case. He said Monday's sentence was ""unfair"" and ""preventing the citizens' right to know."" Suzuki said in a statement that the sentence was disproportionate and undeserved. IWC's shame: Japan's whale slaughter . ""We set out to reveal the truth about the government's whaling program, but instead have been punished, while those behind the misuse of public money walk free,"" he said. The case highlights rising tensions between anti-whaling activists and Japanese officials. Japan's whaling has drawn sharp criticism from environmental advocacy groups, who claim it involves the cruel slaughter of whales so that meat can be sold in markets and restaurants. Japanese officials say their hunts are permitted under rules that prohibit commercial whaling but allow whaling for scientific reasons. Greenpeace has said a tip led Sato and Suzuki to a whaling ship smuggling the whale meat onto the black market. In a press conference, Sato announced that they had found 23 kilograms (50.7 lbs) of whale meat in a box they intercepted. He showed the whale meat in the box, and alleged a systematic, large-scale embezzlement within Japan's whaling program. Greenpeace delivered the whale meat to the Tokyo prosecutor's office days later. The police moved, but not on the Greenpeace allegations. ""They dropped the case and we are the ones who got arrested,"" Sato said in an interview earlier this year. Sato and Suzuki were arrested in June 2008 and charged with trespassing and theft. They faced up to 10 years behind bars. Regardless of the reason, police said, it was theft because Greenpeace admitted that it intercepted the box. Reaction outside of Japan was swift. Protests were held around the world in support of the men, who came to be known as the ""Tokyo Two."" And a U.N. human rights body declared Japan's trial of the men a violation of human rights. Joji Morishita of the Japan Fisheries Agency has said the government recognizes the right of protest, but activists will be punished if they break Japan's laws. But Greenpeace International's executive director, who traveled to Japan for the ruling, said Monday that the organization was determined to get the activists' ""unjust"" conviction overturned. ""Activists are not criminals, and to treat them as such has a chilling effect in society, undermining the quality of democracy,"" Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said in a statement after Monday's ruling. In July, a Japanese court found Peter Bethune, an environmental activist from New Zealand, guilty on five charges, ranging from assault against whalers to trespassing into a whaling vessel. He was given a two-year suspended prison sentence and five years' probation Wednesday by a Tokyo district court judge for throwing butyric acid at a whaling ship, jumping aboard and attempting to make a citizen's arrest of the captain.","NEW: Greenpeace International's executive director says the ruling is ""unjust""

"(CNN) -- Investigators pleaded Monday for swift public help in reconstructing events leading to the disappearance of a 10-year-old Hickory, North Carolina, girl after casting doubt on her stepmother's story. ""We are running out of time, folks,"" Police Chief Tom Adkins told reporters Monday afternoon. ""The longer this thing goes, the likelihood [is] that this outcome will not be positive."" Zahra Clare Baker was last seen sleeping in her bedroom about 2:30 a.m. Saturday, according to Hickory police. She was reported missing about 2 p.m. Saturday by her father, Adam Baker, and stepmother, Elisa Baker. Adam Baker is cooperating with investigators, Adkins said. But Elisa Baker has been jailed on an outstanding warrant for a bad-check charge, prosecutors said, and Adkins said unspecified ""inconsistencies"" in her statement ""has led us to believe that she has not been truthful to us."" ""At this point in the investigation, we are having a very difficult time establishing a true timeline,"" Adkins said. ""We are looking for the public to help us. We need teachers. We need doctors. We need store clerks. We need anyone who has seen this girl in the last week, the last month. Anything they feel is important for us to know, we need the public to call us."" Adkins told reporters earlier Monday that it is unlikely Zahra had run away, and police said over the weekend that the possibility that she was abducted by a stranger was ""less likely than once anticipated."" A ransom note was found at the house, Adkins said Monday afternoon, but ""We are questioning the validity of that note."" Zahra is described as being about 5 feet 1 inch tall and weighing 85 pounds. She has brown hair and blue eyes, and according to CNN affiliate WCNC, she's a cancer survivor. The girl uses a prosthetic leg and hearing aids. The hearing aids have been found, but not the prosthesis, Adkins said. Elisa Baker was arrested Sunday morning on four counts of writing worthless checks, said Eric Farr, a spokesman for the Catawba County District Attorney's office. No attorney was listed in court papers, he said. Farr said she faces other charges in different counties, including a felony larceny count and other bad-check charges. She is being held on $31,500 bail. Adkins said Adam Baker faces similar charges, but police have held off serving an arrest warrant while he cooperates with police. Adkins said Sunday that a small fire had been reported at the residence the morning Zahra is thought to have vanished. He said ""some evidence"" was recovered from the scene, but would not elaborate on what connection the fire may have with the investigation. The FBI is assisting Hickory police in the investigation, officials said. Authorities ask anyone with information to contact the Hickory Police Department.

While double Olympic champion Adlington, Goddard  and Tancock each claimed second golds in the 800m freestyle, 200m individual medley and 100m backstroke respectively, it was again Australia's day in the pool. The 23-year-old Coutts added 4x100m freestyle relay gold to her three individual titles -- which all came in different disciplines -- as the Australians set a new Games record of 3:36.36 in retaining their title. Leisel Jones completed a breaststroke double for the third successive time with victory in the 100m, becoming only the third woman to win nine golds since the Games began 80 years ago.

"Madrid, Spain (CNN) -- Spanish police said Tuesday they have arrested five more people in connection with a male prostitution ring involving trafficked men. The five were arrested for crimes related to prostitution and the rights of employees, the Spanish National Police said in a statement. The arrests took place at three male brothels in central Madrid, police said. Last week, police announced the arrest of 14 people as part of the investigation into an organization dedicated to the sexual exploitation of men, the first bust of its kind in Spain. The men had all been trafficked from Brazil. One of those trafficked was a 16-year-old Brazilian boy who was found to have performed sexual services for the organization for almost three weeks, Spanish police said Tuesday. His pictures were on a website for the brothel where he was working, they said. Police said the ringleaders picked up 60 to 80 men in Brazil and gave them each a travel bag and an airline ticket. The men were lied to about the work they would be doing and the money they would be making, police said. Initially they were told they would have to pay back only the cost of the airline ticket, but instead they were asked for amounts exceeding 4,000 euros ($5,066), police said. The leader of the ring, based in Palma, sent the men to various brothels, gave them cocaine, poppers -- alkyl nitrites that produce a rush when inhaled -- and Viagra, and put them to work as male prostitutes, police said. The network advertised in newspapers and on websites that displayed the men's photographs, police said. The websites offered different sexual services in both the brothel or at private homes and hotels, police said Tuesday. Investigators have also found that the trafficked men remained at each brothel for about 21 days and were available to clients 24 hours a day. In each house was an average of eight to 10 men, the vast majority of Brazilian origin, police said. The men were forced to give up half of their earnings in addition to daily expenses of up to 200 euros (about $250), police said. If the men complained, the network resorted to threats, including the threat of death, police said. The leader of the organization, known as ""Lucas,"" was arrested in the first phase of the operation. He was responsible for knowing the situation of each man and obtained their payments through bank transfers, police said Tuesday. The investigation, initiated by the Immigration Networks and Falsified Documents Unit of the National Police of Granada, included similar units in the Balearic Islands, Barcelona, Alicante and Leon as well as Brazil's Interior Ministry. CNN's Laura Perez Maestro in London, England, contributed to this report.","Spanish National Police announced the arrests Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- As he works around the clock trying to reach 33 trapped miners in Chile, an image flashes through Brandon Fisher's mind: the clothes he saw hanging in their lockers. They left them behind on August 5, the day they went into the depths of the gold and copper mine. ""Seeing things like that, it really gets you thinking,"" he said in an interview with CNN. Outside the mine, family members are keeping vigil at a place they call ""Camp Hope."" Meanwhile, Fisher and a small crew of American drillers are the tip of the spear for Plan B, one of the three drilling teams racing to rescue the miners buried 2,300 feet below the ground. On Thursday, Chilean Mining Minister Laurence Golborne said the Plan B drill was expected to break through into the area where the miners are trapped by Saturday. It's a moment Fisher and other rescuers have been looking forward to for weeks. Fisher said the Schramm T-130 rig -- normally used for boring water holes -- was 61 meters (200 feet) away from its target Thursday night. It appeared likely that it would reach the miners ahead of the Plan A drill, normally used for drilling ventilation chimneys in mines and the Plan C method, normally used to drill for oil. ""You can't predict the down times, the breakages, the formation issues,"" Fisher said. ""I've felt since we got here, that as long as we had some luck on our side, we'd have a good chance of breaking through first."" Fisher is based in Berlin, Pennsylvania, in the heart of the state's mining country, thousands of miles from Chile. His company, Center Rock Inc., aided in the rescue of nine miners who were trapped for more than four days after the 2002 collapse of the Quecreek Mine. He has drilled oil, gas and water holes -- and the foundation for the Trump Tower in Chicago, Illinois. But those assignments pale in comparison to the difficulties of rescuing 33 men who became trapped when the copper and gold mine they were working in collapsed around them. Even in the toughest times at the Atacama Desert mine, he said, thinking about the workers and their families has fueled rescuers' efforts. ""That quickly sets you to where you need to be,"" he said. ""You look down at your feet and you realize that 2,000 feet below us, there's 33 guys that are in a whole hell of a lot worse situation than we are."" Depending on whether engineers decide to encase the rescue shaft with steel casing, the 33 miners could be extracted from the collapsed San Jose gold and copper mine between two and 10 days after breakthrough. Fisher, who only knows a few Spanish words, said he's still not sure what he'll say when they meet face-to-face. ""I think it's just going to be a lot of handshakes and hugs ... It's going to be an absolutely overwhelming sensation,"" he said. CNN's Karl Penhaul contributed to this report.","Chile's mining minister says the Plan B drill could break through Saturday .

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal has reached the semifinals of the Japan Open in Tokyo, but the tournament's second seed Andy Roddick is out. Top seed Nadal beat Russia's Dimitry Tursunov 6-4 6-1 in just 72 minutes in Thursday's quarterfinal, despite having been a break of serve down in the opening set. The Spaniard will next face Serbia's Viktor Troicki, who put out Guillermo Garcia-Lopez -- Nadal's conqueror in last week's Thailand Open semifinals. ""It's good for the confidence to keep winning after taking an important title like the U.S. Open,"" the 24-year-old Nadal told the official ATP website. ""When I go on court and I see a full stadium like here today, it is very nice. It is good for everyone."" However, it was not such a good day for 28-year-old American Roddick, who had a match-point in the final set of his quarterfinal, before going on to lose 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) to fifth seed Gael Monfils. It is the second year in a row Monfils has made the semifinals in Japan, and the Frenchman will be hoping to go one better on Saturday by defeating Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic. The unseeded Stepanek received a walkover to the next round, after Finland's Jarko Niemenen was forced to pull out of the tournament due to illness. Meanwhile at the China Open, top seed Novak Djokovic moved one step closer to defending his title in Beijing after defeating France's Gilles Simon. Djokovic came through 6-3 6-2 and the Serbian will now play big-serving American John Isner in the semis. Isner, ranked 22 in the world, upset fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko of Russia 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 to book his match-up against the world number two on Saturday. World number four Andy Murray did not make the semifinals however, beaten 6-4 6-2 by Croatia's 17th-ranked Ivan Ljubicic. Ljubicic will play David Ferrer after the eight-seeded Spaniard stunned Sweden's No. 3 Robin Soderling 6-2 6-4. In the women's tournament, new world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki moved into the semifinals with a 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 victory over former top-ranked Serbian Ana Ivanovic of Serbia. The 20-year-old Dane, who will be officially unveiled as Serena Williams' successor at the summit next week, will play Shahar Peer on Saturday after the Israeli 15th seed ended the run of young Swiss prospect Timea Bacsinszky with a 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 win in the final last-eight match. Second seed Vera Zvonareva thrashed French Open champion Francesca Schiavone 6-0 6-2 to also reach the last four, where the Russian will take on home hope Li Na. The Chinese ninth seed defeated Latvian qualifier Anastasija Sevastova 7-6 (8-6) 6-3. Italy's Schiavone has now qualified for the end-of-season WTA Championships along with Australia's Samantha Stosur, who she beat in the final at Roland Garros. Wozniacki, Zvonareva, Williams and U.S. Open champion Kim Clijsters had already sealed places in the eight-woman event in Doha.","Rafael Nadal beats Russia's Dimitry Tursunov in the quarterfinals of Japan Open .

THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: We're wrapping up the first week of November, and we're glad to have you along for the ride. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Fort Hood Shootings . AZUZ: ""A horrific outburst of violence."" That is how President Obama described yesterday's deadly shooting at a military post in Texas. A gunman opened fire on a soldier processing center at Ft. Hood, killing at least 12 people and wounding dozens of others. According to military officials, the alleged gunman is in custody. Authorities said there was no immediate information about a motive behind the attack, but the Army has asked the FBI to help look into the suspect's background. You can get the latest details on this developing story at CNN.com. Health Care Debate . AZUZ: Back in the nation's capital, the debate over health care reform is ratcheting up. The House of Representatives might vote on its health care bill this weekend. And yesterday, that bill, which has been backed primarily by House Democrats, picked up the support of two big groups: AARP and the AMA. AARP is the country's largest organization of older Americans. The group's head says the house bill meets AARP's goals when it comes to health care reform. The AMA, or American Medical Association, is one of the nation's most influential medical groups. It said the bill doesn't represent its views perfectly, but it's close enough to earn the AMA's support. Many people, including most House Republicans, are opposed to the $1.1 trillion bill. Yesterday, they held a rally at the U.S. Capitol to speak out against it. One of their main criticisms is that the public option that's included in the bill is basically a government takeover of the country's health care system. Republicans have offered their own proposals, but they've been rejected by Democrats, who are in the majority in the House. Yesterday, leaders from both parties spoke out against each other's plans. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: This weekend, the House of Representatives is likely to vote on Pelosi-care. This bill is the greatest threat to freedom that I have seen in the 19 years I have been here in Washington. Taking away your freedom to choose your doctor. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE SPEAKER: Anything you need to know about the difference between the Democratic bill and the Republican bill is that the Republicans do not end health insurance companies' discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. Let that stand. That's scandalous, the fact that it exists. I don't understand why we have not heard the American people who have said that pre-existing conditions should not be a source of discrimination. Benefits Extended . AZUZ: The House has passed a couple of economic measures that could help out two groups of people: the unemployed and first-time home buyers. The first part of this legislation extends the amount of time that people can collect unemployment benefits, something that millions of Americans are depending on right now. In all states, people who are out of a job could continue getting unemployment for an additional 14 weeks. But in states with an unemployment rate higher than 8.5 percent, the benefits would be extended for 20 weeks. The second measure is also an extension. This one is for an $8,000 tax credit that's available to people buying a home for the first time. The Senate passed this legislation on Wednesday, and President Obama is expected to sign it into law today. Tribal Leaders Summit . AZUZ: Yesterday, he took part in a White House conference with Native American leaders. During his speech, the president said that the U.S. government was guilty of mistreating Native Americans in the past, but he wants to build a new relationship between tribal leaders and the government. In order to do that, he's ordered federal agencies to offer ideas on how Native American tribes can take part in government decisions. There are 564 federally recognized tribes in the U.S. About two-thirds of them were represented at yesterday's conference. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Who is the current secretary-general of the United Nations? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Kofi Annan, B) Kurt Waldheim, C) Ban Ki-moon or D) Boutros Boutros-Ghali? You've got three seconds -- GO! Ban Ki-moon became the 8th U.N. secretary-general on January 1, 2007. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Safety Assessment . AZUZ: Last week, Ban Ki-moon said that the U.N. is determined to carry out its mission of helping the people of Afghanistan build a better future. The statement came after an attack in the Asian country which claimed the lives of five U.N. workers. The United Nations is making some changes to its security measures in Afghanistan. Sara Sidner explains how. (BEGIN VIDEO) SARA SIDNER, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: After the targeted attack on U.N. staff members here in a guarded guest house in Kabul that left five U.N. members dead, the United Nations has decided to make some changes. They are, for right now, sending out about 600 foreign workers here, and they're going to assess right now the security situation for their staff. They're sending those workers out for about three weeks, and then intend to bring some of them back. But first, they want to figure out how to beef up security here. Now, we understand though that the U.N. is very, very adamant that they are not pulling out of Afghanistan. They are simply looking at the security situation, obviously, after that traumatic time where five of their colleagues died. We should also mention that U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is asking for about $85 million to beef up security here. Sara Sidner, CNN, Kabul. (END VIDEO) Military Vaccines . AZUZ: Some U.S. forces serving in Afghanistan and Iraq may be getting their H1N1 flu shots soon. Just like with civilians, the military has a priority list that says who should get the vaccine first. But as Barbara Starr explains, there are some hang-ups in getting the doses out, even to the people at the top of that list. (BEGIN VIDEO) BARBARA STARR, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT: As Americans wait in lines across the country to get the H1N1 vaccine, the Pentagon this week finally began shipping limited vaccine supplies to troops fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. Under Pentagon guidelines, tens of thousands of troops on the front line and those headed to war are the top military priority to receive the vaccine. Even so, supplies are severely limited. Only half of what is needed is now on the way. GEOFF MORRELL, PENTAGON SPOKESMAN: Right now, we don't have enough to even take care of all of them. STARR: The Pentagon is defending plans to offer the vaccine to detainees at Guantanamo Bay, as well as those in Iraq and Afghanistan. Prisoners are considered to be high risk, but a lower military priority than troops, health care workers and civilian personnel. STARR (Question): I haven't heard an assurance that detainees will get it after civilians in this country. MORRELL: Barbara, Barbara, Barbara, Barbara, you are presuming that I have the knowledge or the wherewithal to tell you the protocols that are being used for the general population. All I can do is speak to what the priorities are in this department. STARR: Troops at home also a priority because they will be called upon to help in towns across the country if the crisis grows. The military's top homeland defense commander has teams that could move into action. GEN. GENE RENUART, COMMANDER, U.S. NORTHERN COMMAND: It would be to provide things like potentially logistics, movement of supplies, maybe additional health care providers that could assist in immunization. STARR: The Pentagon stopped counting the number of troops that have come down with H1N1 back in July, when world health authorities declared a global pandemic. But privately military officials say the number of cases continues to grow, and recently, Defense Secretary Robert Gates received his vaccine. Barbara Starr, CNN, the Pentagon. (END VIDEO) Promo .

"London, England (CNN) -- A detailed and well-preserved Roman parade helmet -- complete with fine facial features on its face mask, tight curly hair, and a griffin-topped cap -- sold at auction Thursday for 10 times its estimated amount. The helmet sold at Christie's auction house in London for 2.28 million pounds ($3.6 million). It had been estimated at 200,000 to 300,000 pounds (about $316,000 to $475,000). The buyer of the helmet was not immediately known. The Tullie House Museum in Carlisle, near where the helmet was found in May by a person with a metal detector, had launched a public fundraising appeal to try to procure the helmet as the centerpiece for a new Roman gallery. Christie's called the Crosby Garrett helmet -- so named for the village where it was found, about 45 miles south of the Scottish border -- an ""extraordinary example of Roman metalwork at its zenith"" and said it dates to the late 1st to 2nd century A.D. ""The Crosby Garrett helmet sets itself apart by virtue of its beauty, workmanship, and completeness, particularly the face mask, which was found virtually intact,"" Christie's says. ""In addition, the remarkable Phrygian-style peak surmounted by its elaborate bronze griffin crest appears unprecedented."" The helmet is made of two sections: the tall pointed helmet and the face mask. The latter has openwork eyes, which would have allowed the wearer to see during the cavalry sports events -- known as hippika gymnasia -- when it would have been used. The face has incised eyelashes on the upper and lower lids, herringbone eyebrows, and pierced nostrils, all framed by three rows of corkscrew curls. At the peak of the cap is a small griffin, seated with its wings outstretched, revealing the incised feather detail. Its right paw is raised and rests on the rim of a small amphora. Colorful streamers may have been attached to the helmet when it was worn, Christie's says. Arrian of Nicomedia, a Roman provincial governor under Hadrian, wrote the only surviving contemporary source of information on cavalry sports events, according to Christie's. He describes cavalrymen divided into two teams that took turns to attack and defend, and suggests that wearing the helmets was a mark of rank or excellence in horsemanship. ""Participants would also carry a light, elaborately painted shield, and wear an embroidered tunic and possibly thigh-guards and greaves, all of which would contribute to the impressive spectacle,"" Christie's says. ""These events may well have accompanied religious festivals celebrated by the Roman army and were probably also put on for the benefit of visiting officials. The displays would have been intended to demonstrate the outstanding equestrian skill and marksmanship of the Roman soldier and the wealth of the great empire he represented."" The helmet is one of only three that have been discovered in Britain complete with face masks, Christie's says. The first was found in 1796 and is now at the British Museum in London, and the other was found around 1905 and is at the Museum of Antiquities in Edinburgh, Scotland. The helmet was offered for sale along with other antiquities, including Egyptian pottery and Etruscan and Greek gold jewelry. Tullie House Museum said a benefactor pledged 50,000 pounds ($79,000) toward its fundraising appeal to bring the helmet back to the region, on condition the public matched the amount. In all, the museum said it hoped to raise 80,000 pounds ($127,000) in order to obtain financing from other organizations for an auction bid. ""Tullie House's archaeology collections are extensive with a particularly important collection of Roman Cumbria material, especially from Carlisle and the Hadrian's Wall area,"" it said. ""In the development of its collections, Tullie House prioritizes artifacts that are judged to be of high importance to the local heritage and to ensure that items remain or are returned to Cumbria."" Carlisle was an important military center in Roman times, when it was known as Luguvalium. The first Roman fort in Carlisle was built in 72 and 73 A.D. during the initial conquest of northern Britain, at a strategic point overlooking the confluence of two rivers, and just west of the main north-south road, which was used regularly by troops, according to the museum.","The ancient headwear sold for $3.6 million .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Before the late 1960s Formula 1 was a quite different sport. The first thing that a casual observer would notice -- looking at pictures from this era -- is that the cars were void of any sponsorship. Semiconductor makers Intel and AMD slug it out on the racetrack and in the market place . Racing legends Juan Manuel Fangio, Jack Brabham and their contemporaries would lap the circuits of the Formula 1 Championship without branded baseball hats and overalls, without any stickers on their cars or without having to attend events to keep their sponsors happy. Towards the end of the 1960s, engine manufacturers began to realize the potential of advertising on their cars, and started to increase the size of their own logos. It wasn't until 1968 that the first corporate sponsor made it onto a Formula 1 car, when the championship-winning Lotus team introduced the logo of Imperial Tobacco's Gold Leaf brand on the side of their cars. Thereafter, Formula 1 and sponsorship became inseparable. While the drivers and the teams would still continue to battle it out on the track, Formula 1 has become as much about the business as about the racing. Today, the combined budget of all 11 teams is said to be in excess of $2.5 billion and the largest portion of this money is provided for by sponsors. Repeated market research has revealed that consumers consider Formula 1 ""sophisticated, dynamic and prestigious"". Some of the larger sponsors commit hundreds of millions, over several years, to associate their brands with these appealing characteristics. The question remains, what exactly sponsors receive in return for investing such large sums. Obviously, the larger sponsors will receive a good size logo on a visible spot of the car or even become title sponsors such as ING with Renault or AT&T with Williams. Good television coverage has the potential to create outstanding results as the sport is watched by between five and seven billion people every year, providing work for an army of 10000 accredited journalists. In 2005, the total advertising value of Formula 1 has been estimated at $5.2 billion or $0.74 per viewer. But what are the benefits apart from that fleeting glimpse of a logo when the car roars past the grandstands at 250 mph? Clearly sponsorship is about more than visibility of a logo. Modern sponsorship contracts in Formula 1 are tailored to the needs of both the sponsor and the team. This often includes activities and promotions outside of the Formula 1 World Championship calendar. Melissa Berry, marketing manager for financial and news wire service Reuters, a sponsor of the Williams F1 Team explains: ""Our sponsorship contract with Williams F1 allows us access to the team's drivers to help promote our brand and our business. ""Indeed, Williams F1 drivers have played a part in promoting Reuters products over the past few years. We also have the rights to use Williams F1 imagery to enhance our marketing communications materials and customer events."" Sponsoring a Formula 1 team also gives a company the possibility to tap into a vast network of potential customers among its fellow sponsors, as the sport has already attracted some very strong brands from various different sectors. Rival semiconductor manufacturers Intel and AMD sponsor BMW Sauber and Ferrari respectively. And other sponsors include drinks conglomerates Pernod Ricard and Diageo, and telecommunications giants Vodafone and AT&T. This gives an unrivalled networking opportunity for blue chip companies. Where else but at Grands Prix can senior executives of consumer electronics giants casually rub shoulders with hedge fund managers and the bosses of IT firms? This opportunity to network and exchange business ideas is a benefit of sponsoring a Formula 1 team not to be overlooked . Reuters' contract with the Williams F1 team has delivered just that, says Berry: ""The team boasts the strongest stable of global business brands as sponsors, some of which are also our key customers or business partners -- for example RBS, Allianz, Accenture and Lenovo. ""The Williams F1 Paddock Club plays host to many senior executives from these companies over the course of a season and this can provide a platform for valuable business discussions or introductions."" For the drivers this means that apart from having to deliver during the race, they also have to attend corporate events of their sponsors and appear in their adverts. Hence we see Alonso and Hamilton looking implausibly chummy in commercials for Spanish bank Santander. While seen as distracting by some, it is something the top drivers cannot afford to do without. Without sponsorship revenue a driver is worthless to his team, as Christijan Albers found to his cost when he failed to bring in the promised sponsorship to Spyker. Juan Manuel Fangio and Jack Brabham competed in an era without commercial exposure -- and without anything like the financial reward. Thanks to sponsorship deals today's drivers like Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso reap the benefits of their commercial exposure in the form of much higher salaries.

"New York (CNN) -- President Barack Obama blasted his Iranian counterpart Friday for what he called offensive and hateful remarks about the September 11 attacks. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad blamed the United States for the 2001 terrorist attacks, an accusation that triggered a walkout Thursday by several United Nations delegates. ""Well, it was offensive. It was hateful,"" Obama said in part of an interview with BBC Persian released by the White House. ""And particularly for him to make the statement here in Manhattan, just a little north of ground zero, where families lost their loved ones -- people of all faiths, all ethnicities who see this as the seminal tragedy of this generation -- for him to make a statement like that was inexcusable,"" Obama said. Obama said Ahmadinejad's comments stand in contrast to the sympathy expressed by the Iranian people in the aftermath of the attacks. ""And it just shows once again sort of the difference between how the Iranian leadership and this regime operates and how I think the vast majority of the Iranian people, who are respectful and thoughtful, think about these issues,"" Obama said. British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said at the United Nations on Friday that Ahmadinejad's ""bizarre"" remarks were meant to distract attention from Iranian issues that generate media headlines. Ahmadinejad delivered a fiery speech before the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday, criticizing Washington, capitalism and the world body itself. Though incendiary statements from Ahmadinejad are nothing new, tension in the hall grew as the Iranian leader recounted various conspiracy theories about the September 11 attacks. ""Some segments within the U.S. government orchestrated the attack,"" Ahmadinejad told the General Assembly. He followed with the claim that the attacks were aimed at reversing ""the declining American economy and its scripts on the Middle East in order to save the Zionist regime. The majority of the American people, as well as most nations and politicians around the world, agree with this view."" That appeared to be the last straw for many of the diplomats. Representatives from the United States, Britain, Sweden, Australia, Belgium, Uruguay and Spain walked out while Ahmadinejad asserted that the U.S. government was involved in the attacks or allowed them to happen as an excuse to go to war in Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama, who had delivered his address to the General Assembly earlier, had already left the grounds before Ahmadinejad spoke. Mark Kornblau, a spokesman for the U.S. mission to the United Nations, issued a statement saying, ""Rather than representing the aspirations and goodwill of the Iranian people, Mr. Ahmadinejad has yet again chosen to spout vile conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic slurs that are as abhorrent and delusional as they are predictable."" The head of the National September 11 Memorial said his organization's work is made even more important by Ahmadinejad's statements. ""While the impulse may be to ignore the rant of an individual who has consistently demonstrated a refusal to accept basic historic facts, including the murder of millions during the Holocaust, we cannot,"" said Joe Daniels. ""Because someone like Ahmadinejad espouses and expresses such lies publicly, we at the National September 11 Memorial and Museum must lead the preservation and presentation of the authentic history of what occurred on 9/11,"" he said. ""This history not only includes the worst of humanity in the execution of the heinous terrorist attacks, but also the best of who we can be through how this country and much of the world came together to support those in need."" Ahmadinejad went on to compare the death toll in the September 11 attacks to the casualty count in the wars in Afghanistan in Iraq. ""It was said that some 3,000 people were killed on September 11th, for which we are all very saddened,"" he said. ""Yet, up until now in Afghanistan and Iraq, hundreds of thousands of people have been killed, millions wounded and displaced, and the conflict is still going on and expanding."" Ahmadinejad's speech was hailed as a gift from God at Tehran's weekly Friday prayers, Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency reported. ""We do not consider the remarks as those only belonging to the president himself, rather as a divine gift to the [Iranian] nation,"" said Hojjatoleslam Kazzem Sediqi, who led the prayer session Friday.","Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's U.N. speech hailed as ""divine gift"" in Iran .

"(CNN) -- A collision between a bus and a train in the Ukraine on Tuesday left 42 people dead and nine others injured, officials said. The crash took place when a commuter bus and a railway locomotive collided in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, according to Ukraine's Emergency Situations Ministry. The accident occurred at an unguarded train crossing near the village of Maksimovka on the stretch between the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, the ministry said. According to preliminary information, the bus was carrying 51 people as it was driving over the crossing. Are you there? Share your photos and  videos . Railway officials told Ukrainian news agencies that the crossing was closed for cars, and the warning lights were on. A preliminary investigation showed that the bus driver ignored the warning light signals and violated safety rules by crossing the passage when the train was approaching it, the officials told local agencies. The driver of the train survived, but it was not immediately known if he was injured. President Viktor Yanukovych expressed his condolences for the victims' families and declared Wednesday a national day of mourning, according to the president's press office. The government will pay 100,000 Ukrainian hyrvnas (about U.S. $12,600) to the victims' families, according to the emergency ministry.","NEW: Ukrainian president declares national day of mourning .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Prosecutors in the Anna Nicole Smith drug trial paid rent, utilities and moving expenses so a key witness could testify this week, according to testimony Wednesday. Smith's former nanny said the government also picked up the tab for eight family members to travel with her from the Bahamas to Los Angeles, California, for the trial. Quethelie Alexie and her sister-in-law, Nadine Alexie, both testified in the sixth week of the trial of Smith's boyfriend-lawyer Howard K. Stern and Drs. Khristine Eroshevich and Sandeep Kapoor. They are accused of a conspiracy to provide drugs to an addict and using false names on prescriptions for Smith. Both women worked for Smith in the Bahamas for several months after the birth of her daughter in September 2006. They were fired two months before Smith died in a Florida hotel in February 2007. ""I left Anna in a bad condition,"" Quethelie Alexie said. The Haitian native spoke in Creole through an interpreter. While her testimony was intended to give jurors details of Smith's drug use in the wake of her son's death, a key part of it was stricken from the record. Judge Robert Perry ordered the jury to ignore it after she varied from what she said earlier during a preview for the judge. The defense also worked to cast doubt in jurors' minds by questioning Quethelie Alexie about the financial arrangements she made with prosecutors before she agreed to testify. Quethelie Alexie said she told prosecutors she and her sister-in-law would only travel to the United States if they could bring their six children and Nadine Alexie's husband. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office is paying for their travel and hotel expenses. She told prosecutors when she arrived in Los Angeles on Sunday that she needed additional financial help to pay her rent and utilities for her home back in the Bahamas, she said. ""I knew I had all of my things to pay, and I didn't know how to do it,"" Quethelie Alexie testified. The government will also help her relocate to a new home because she is afraid for her safety after her testimony, she said. She testified that she was in fear because a police officer in the Bahamas once threatened her. ""My life is going to be in trouble now,"" Quethelie Alexie said. The two women are expected to continue their testimony when court resumes Friday.","The prosecutors agreed to pay rent and utilities for Smith's former nanny .

"(CNN) -- Comedian Stephen Colbert used his signature humor last week to focus the nation's attention on a very serious issue: the treatment of the hardworking people who produce our nation's food supply. Some members of Congress complained that Colbert's testimony before the House Immigration Subcommittee was undignified; others took issue with his invocation of Christian values. Colbert's deadpan humor may have been slightly irreverent, but he did the country a service by highlighting congressional inaction on immigration reform and pointedly referencing the issue's moral dimension. Responding to a question from California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu about his interest in migrant workers, Colbert became uncharacteristically serious , even invoking the words of Jesus, who said that ""whatsoever you did for the least of my brothers, you did it to me"" (Matthew 25:40). Colbert, who is a practicing Catholic, noted that in today's troubled economy, there are many ""least brothers."" He added, ""I don't want to take anyone's hardship away from them or diminish it or anything like that. But migrant workers suffer, and have no rights."" These were not idle comments. Christians take Jesus' words as a call to show justice and mercy to those at the very bottom of the social hierarchy. It is a call that Jesus embodied in his own life, as he engaged with Samaritans, lepers, prostitutes, tax collectors and others treated as outcasts in society. Jesus summarized his mission as bringing good news to the poor, freedom for prisoners, recovery of sight for the blind and release for the oppressed (Luke 4:18-19). Caring for migrant farmworkers is one way that Christians today -- including Christian lawmakers -- should follow Jesus' example. In 2009, the National Association of Evangelicals, which represents some 45,000 churches with millions of constituents, issued a call for immigration reform. In the past year, we have held numerous meetings with members of Congress and with White House officials, and we have conducted forums, news conferences and other public events. In one of those events, veteran evangelical civil rights leader John Perkins called immigration reform ""the civil rights struggle of our day."" Why? While some agricultural operations have become highly mechanized, growing fruits and vegetables is still labor intensive. For decades, farmers have relied on migrant workers, primarily immigrants, to do this difficult but essential work. Despite this massive and predictable need, our immigration laws make little provision for the legal entry of immigrant farmworkers. Still, the crops must be picked: Our economy and food security depend on it. So each year, growers hire tens of thousands of undocumented workers to do some of the most backbreaking jobs in America. As a result, Americans enjoy an abundant supply of affordable produce and our economy enjoys a substantial boost. As testimony by Colbert and others pointed out, there is a dark side to this story. Undocumented farmworkers are poorly paid, enjoy few rights and live in fear of deportation. Full disclosure: I descend from generations of farmers and am married to the daughter of a migrant farmworker. I know that farmers face losses from potential labor shortages during critical periods and risk hefty fines for hiring workers without employment visas. State and local governments educate the children of migrants but don't reap the benefits of their investment because the graduates are not allowed to work legally and become taxpaying citizens. (Undocumented immigrants, of course, pay sales taxes, and many pay Social Security and income taxes, though they are ineligible for most public benefits.) None of this is new information to the representatives who gathered in the Immigration Subcommittee hearing last week to listen to testimony on the proposed AgJOBS legislation. Immigration reform has been debated for years. The basic elements needed to fix our broken immigration system are clear. They include securing our borders, fixing our broken legal immigration system and providing an equitable pathway to earned legal status for the currently undocumented. Business, agriculture, labor, faith and immigrant advocate groups are in broad agreement on the solutions. It is an issue on which President Obama and former President Bush, and many leaders in both parties, have agreed. And yet, after 21 months on the job, the 111th Congress has failed even to seriously debate the issues. No bill has come to a vote at even the subcommittee level. Politicians may resent Colbert's jokes, but they can scarcely blame the comedian if their constituents are exasperated by congressional inaction on this and other critical issues, despite the many promises on the campaign trail. By mischaracterizing immigration reform as amnesty and open borders (nothing could be further from the truth), pandering to voters' fears and prejudices, and putting short-term political gain ahead of the national interest, they have lost legitimacy in the minds of many. If a slightly irreverent comedian can help to prick the nation's conscience and move us to finally rectify this long-standing injustice, then we welcome his intervention. Members of Congress should smile, swallow their medicine and do what they know is right. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Galen Carey.","Galen Carey says in House testimony, Colbert serious about morality of immigration reform .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Mexican President Felipe Calderon has a new Twitter account name -- FelipeCalderon. Not terribly catchy but an improvement over his previous moniker -- presidente_FC. Calderon, who had solicited suggestions for his new account name, announced the choice Wednesday morning. ""It only involves a change in name since it will maintain its history,"" Calderon's announcement said. A look at his account Wednesday morning showed that he had more than 111,000 followers and that he follows 54 people, including a noted Mexican writer who died last week. Anyone interested in more tweets about the Mexican government also can follow two existing accounts -- PresidenciaMX, which highlights the president's activities, and GobFed, which reports on the federal government's activities. Calderon is not the only Latin American leader to have an account on Twitter, a social networking and blogging site. Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez also tweets, under the name chavezcandanga. He had nearly 800,000 followers Wednesday morning and followed seven accounts, including one about the writings of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Chavez has acknowledged that the account is his and uses it to send messages to Venezuelans, particularly those who send him posts. There are at least two Twitter accounts for Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, though it could not be determined Wednesday whether either is official. Each account has more than 24,000 followers. There is a Felipe Calderon page on Facebook that has more than 600,000 users who ""like"" it, the social network site's designation for members who could be considered fans. The Facebook page is elaborate with a detailed biography, more than 500 photographs and eight videos, but there is no way to confirm that it is an official page sanctioned by the Mexican president. Both the Twitter account and the Facebook page contain messages to Calderon, some of them lauding his efforts while others are critical of his governance.","Felipe Calderon announced the new name Wednesday morning .

"(CNN) -- Condoleezza Rice's personal memoir of her family history hits the book stands Tuesday. In ""Extraordinary, Ordinary People,"" the former U.S. Secretary of State recalls much of her family's time during the Civil Rights era in Birmingham. Rice has said that she will write a memoir about her eight years in the White House but felt she could not do so until people understood the ""personal and implausible journey"" she had taken from being born in 1950s segregated Alabama to being named the first female African-American to lead the State Department. All of this happened, Rice said, due to her parents, John and Angelena Rice. A guidance counselor/preacher and school teacher respectively, Mr. And Mrs. Rice never made more than $60,000 annually, Rice said. Despite being raised in a city resistant to quality education for blacks, Rice's parents used their meager resources to provide their only child with piano lessons at 3. She also took French and ballet. She never learned to swim as a child because Birmingham Public Safety official Eugene ""Bull"" Connors forbade blacks and whites from sharing public swimming pools. But Rice's parents refused to let the racial tensions limit her potential. ""Even if I could not have a hamburger at a Woolworth's counter, my mom taught me that I could be President of the United States,"" Rice said at an author panel during the 10th annual Book Expo America in May. Rice is a long-time Republican, despite being mentored in international affairs by the Josef Kobel, the father of Democratic Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, who became the first female Secretary of State, according to Albright's State Department biography. Rice said her family's introduction into the GOP resulted from a Jim Crow ""poll test."" The now illegal practice of requiring black voters to answer questions before being permitted to vote, poll tests were ""the teeth of Jim Crow,"" Rice said. While her mother answered the name of the first U.S. President George Washington correctly and was allowed to vote, her father was asked to identify the number of beans in a jar, she said. Unable to do so, John Rice later learned of a woman poll worker who would allow him to vote if he aligned himself with the GOP. ""And that is how my father became a Republican,"" she said. While they did see Rice to on to graduate from Stanford University, and eventually become a provost there, her parents never lived to see her in the White House. Her mother lost a 15-year-battle with breast cancer in 1985. Her dad died just before George W. Bush was inaugurated. Still she recalls them showing her a photo of an eight-year-old Condoleezza RIce standing outside the White House where she believes it was grandfather who told her at the time: ""You may be standing out here now, but you will be working in there someday."" ""Extraordinary, Ordinary People"" is available in hardcover, in e-book format and as an audio book read by Condoleezza Rice herself.","The book recounts Rice's life story from 1950's segregation to her appointment as Secretary of State .

"(CNN) -- It was the soccer foul seen round the world -- a knee to an opponent's groin. It didn't earn a red card and an ejection for Bolivian President Evo Morales, but it was caught on video -- and in this viral world of YouTube, it got him a lot of unwanted attention. Morales apologized Thursday for his intemperate action, saying he had fallen into a trap. The player he kneed in the groin in a friendly soccer game Sunday had kicked him in the leg and then literally added insult to injury, Morales said at a news conference. ""The player who kicked me started to insult me and offend me and I very much regret my reaction,"" Morales said. ""I ask forgiveness to the sportsmen, to the players, to the player. But after kicking me, it was another insult, a reaction. ""Again, I ask for forgiveness. Sport is integration, but later I realized it was a trap,"" Morales said. La Paz Mayor Luis Revilla disputed that assertion Thursday, assuring that there was no trap, according to the Hoybolivia.com news site. Nor did the player in question insult Morales, the mayor is reported to have said. ""It was simply a soccer game that because of those incidents became a situation that drew much attention,"" the news site quotes Revilla as saying. ""But I hope there are more soccer games between authorities and institutions to ratify that sports integrate, that it can be beneficial for all citizens."" The action unfolded Sunday in game between a team put together by Morales and a squad of city workers from La Paz, the capital of Bolivia. Morales is seen on the silent video going up to the player, lifting his right leg and pointing at it. The Bolivian president then swiftly knees the opponent in the groin, turns around and walks away. The man, identified by the state-run ABI news agency as Gustavo Daniel Cartagena, falls on his back, clutching his groin with his left hand. Morales said Thursday he had been kicked hard on purpose, differentiating the blow from what happens when two players collide going after a loose ball. He also said the foul against him was intentional because it happened within two minutes of the game starting. He said he went to speak with the referee after he was kicked to ask why he would allow such rough play. Morales said he then went up to the player to remind him that it was only a soccer game but was met with insults and offenses that made him lose his composure. The president said he has an agreement that when his team plays friendly games against squads from institutions or other agencies, the other side must consist of officials from those places. But ABI reported that local media said many members of the team that played against Morales on Sunday -- including Cartagena, the kneed player -- were not government workers and were brought in just for the game. And, Morales indicated, at least one member of the opposing team was trying to goad him. ""After that happened, I thought about what a great error it was,"" Morales said. ""Not so much for the kick he gave me, which he made me feel -- sure there was pain -- but for the insult. I complained because his spikes left a mark. I think it was the second time. But it remains clear that I fell into a trap.""","The incident occurred Sunday in a friendly game against a team of city workers .

"Oviedo, Florida (CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Wednesday awarded the Medal of Honor -- the nation's highest military decoration -- to Staff Sgt. Robert J. Miller, a Green Beret who died after willingly taking fire to protect U.S. and Afghan soldiers. The citation read at a solemn White House ceremony in Washington, D.C., honored Miller for ""conspicuous gallantry ... at risk of life above and beyond the call of duty"" and ""extraordinary acts of heroism"" on January 25, 2008, when a patrol he led was ambushed in Afghanistan. Miller killed at least 10 insurgents and wounded dozens more in repeatedly exposing himself to enemy fire ""in keeping with the highest traditions of military service,"" the citation said. Miller is the seventh service member to receive the Medal of Honor for actions during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama gave a detailed account of the combat in which Miller was killed, describing how the small group of U.S. and Afghan soldiers came under fire in a narrow valley from protected enemy positions above. Realizing the peril of the situation, Miller ordered his team to fall back, but then ""did something extraordinary,"" Obama said. ""Rob moved the other way, toward the insurgents,"" to draw their fire so his team could back off safely, the president said. The others could hear Miller firing and calling out enemy positions amid overwhelming enemy fire, Obama said. ""Then over the radio, they heard his voice,"" Obama continued. ""He had been hit. But still he kept calling out enemy positions, still he kept firing, still he kept hurling grenades. Then they heard it. Rob's weapon fell silent."" Five members of his team were wounded, Obama said, but all survived. He quoted one of the survivors as saying, ""I would not be alive today if not for his ultimate sacrifice."" Some of the dozen team members at the ceremony were red-eyed when Obama asked them to stand, and the president cited them and all U.S. fighting forces in Afghanistan for their commitment to the mission of preventing the country from again becoming a haven for terrorists to launch attacks on the United States. ""Every American is safer because of their service, and every American has a duty to remember and honor their sacrifice,"" Obama said. Miller's parents, Maureen and Philip Miller, stood onstage with Obama as the citation was read. They earlier told how they take consolation that their son gave his life so others could live. ""If it wasn't for Robert's actions, they could have easily been killed,"" Maureen Miller said. Miller's father added: ""We have a sense of awe and amazement of what he did and a feeling of pride."" Sgt. James Lodyga, Miller's commander in Afghanistan, described the battle in the village of Barikowt, near the Pakistani border, as being like ""fish in a barrel."" ""Enemy on right, on the left. Robby immediately started firing,"" Lodyga said. An Army commendation noted the young man's character. ""Only 24 years old, Miller impressed everyone on his team. Although the youngest member of A Company, 3rd Battalion, 3rd Special Forces Group [Airborne], Fort Bragg, N.C., he quickly earned a reputation for taking on difficult challenges,"" the Army said. His mother relayed a perspective only a parent could have. ""I'm feeling humbled by it,"" Maureen Miller said. ""He was just our kid, not too long out of the annoying teenager stage, and he was doing all this."" She had a notion, though, of her son's outlook on life. ""Robert wore his favorite shirt which said, 'Cowards die many time before their death. The valiant never taste of death but once,' "" she said. The fallen soldier's sister, Nancy, pointed out that ""he was always concerned about looking out for others."" Lodyga said Miller did just that. ""Robby was shot in the side and he shot those who shot him,"" the sergeant said. ""He kept firing until he succumbed to a shot under the armpit. I don't know how to put it into words. I know Robby saved our lives, Absolutely he's a hero. I thank him a lot."" The Medal of Honor is given for exceptional acts of gallantry, ""bravery or self-sacrifice"" and must involve risk of life, the White House said. At Miller's home in Oviedo, Florida, his parents fly the U.S. flag -- and display two stars in a window. ""The blue star flag is anyone in active service. Gold star is designation that they are fallen in battle,"" Philip Miller said. ""They are in memory of our son and a proud memorial for him."" For Miller's parents, Wednesday's ceremony at the White House was an important step on the long road to healing. The parents were told at his funeral more than two years ago that the decorated Green Beret would be receiving another commendation. ""There was a sense that it wasn't finished and that there was something left to be done,"" Maureen Miller said. ""Now this part of the chapter will be closed."" The slain warrior's mother said she was looking forward to ""finally getting it over with and a sense of closure. We will always miss Rob and there will always be a hole in our heart."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: President Obama presents the award at a White House ceremony .

"(CNN) -- Alberto Contador will ride for a new team when he seeks his fourth Tour de France title next year, after deciding not to renew his contract with Astana. The Spanish cyclist made the announcement on Wednesday, just three days after winning the sport's premier event for the third time in four years. ""Alberto Contador has rejected the ultimatum of the Astana team, who had asked for a definitive answer to its offer of a contract renewal for the coming seasons,"" read a statement from his spokesman, the UK Press Association reported. ""Contador had asked for time to consider his future, given the importance of this decision. Although the positions of both parties were not so far apart, the team wanted to know urgently whether or not the winner of the Triple Crown would lead the team in 2011, and that's where the positions began to differ."" The 27-year-old joined Astana -- which is owned by a group of state-run companies from Kazakhstan -- in 2008. Contador claims third Tour de France title . He had won the Tour for the first time with the Discovery Channel team in 2007, but Astana were not allowed to enter the following year after doping scandals. Contador claimed the title again last year despite an uneasy relationship with Astana teammate Lance Armstrong, the seven-time champion who was making his racing comeback after a short retirement. Armstrong's team faces hearing over jerseys . With Armstrong leaving after the 2009 event to form his own team, RadioShack, Contador was the clear leader of Astana this year despite the successful return by Alexandre Vinokourov, who had quit in 2008 after being banned for blood doping. Contador has yet decide where he will ride next year, his spokesman said. ""After winning the 2010 Tour de France, Alberto Contador wants to have time to calmly explore all possibilities available to him to ride during the coming seasons, but so far none has been excluded,"" the statement said.","Three-time Tour de France winner Alberto Contador decides to leave Astana team .

"(CNN) -- The Mercedes team has denied reports that seven-time world Formula One champion Michael Schumacher must improve next season or face having his three-year contract cut short. The 41-year-old has struggled in his comeback season, having retired in 2006, and has been outperformed by young teammate Nico Rosberg. Rosberg, 25, is seventh in the drivers' standings with four races to go -- while Schumacher is 76 points back in 10th as Mercedes has been unable to emulate the success of the double world champion Brawn team that the German manufacturer took over at the end of last year. German newspaper Bild reported this week that Schumacher's future was in doubt unless he did better in 2011, but Mercedes-Benz Motorsport vice-president Norbert Haug dismissed those claims while talking to reporters at a conference at the Japanese Grand Prix. ""Of course there was no ultimatum,"" Haug said after Friday's practice sessions at Suzuka, a circuit where Schumacher has won six times and was eighth in both runs. Rosberg was 10th and 11th. Red Bull duo top practice times . ""I think Michael again showed today his class, his full commitment. We are currently a little bit handicapped with our car, but I have no complaints and no regrets that we're going to achieve our target. ""Michael is, for me, as good as he ever was and probably even better. He's relaxed, concentrated. He doesn't need anybody to defend him, certainly not me, but we are very happy with the job he's doing and we need to give Nico and him a better car."" Haug admitted that Rosberg had done a better job in getting the best out of his car, and acclaimed him as the best of the young drivers on the F1 circuit. ""It's not easy for anybody to compete against such a guy, and Michael does that quite well -- not always in qualifying but if you look throughout the season, if you take into consideration that he was not in Formula One for three years, we are heading in the right direction and there is certainly not an ultimatum,"" he said. Meanwhile, reports have claimed that Mercedes could face competition from another German team in the near future, with Porsche considering a return to the grid for the first time since 1964. Porsche provided engine for McLaren when the English outfit won five world drivers' and manufacturers' titles in the 1980s, but has not been involved in motorsport's elite class since 1991. The Financial Times Deutschland reported on Friday that Porsche was considering a comeback, while the company's new chairman Matthias Muller hinted as much to the Autocar website. He suggested that Audi, which is also owned by Volkswagen and has previously said it is not interested in racing in F1, may focus on LMP1 prototype sportscar racing. ""With LMP1, there are two classes and two brands: Audi and Porsche. We do not like both to go into LMP1, that is not so funny. So therefore we have to discuss whether it makes better sense for one of the brands to go into LMP1, and the other brand into Formula One. So we will have a round-table to discuss the pros and cons,"" he said in an interview at the Paris Motor Show.","German newspaper Bild claims that Michael Schumacher has been told to improve .

"(CNN) -- Shows at SeaWorld in San Diego, California, are expected to resume on schedule Wednesday, a day after a 12-year-old male killer whale died. The whale showed signs of being ill only on Monday, the park announced. The cause of death for Sumar won't be known until a necropsy is complete, SeaWorld said. Results may not be known for several weeks. ""It's a very sad day,"" spokesman Dave Koontz told CNN on Tuesday. ""He was a great young killer whale. He was sharp."" Sumar, who weighed about 5,000 pounds, had been at SeaWorld San Diego since 2001, coming from an Ohio park. He was one of seven killer whales at SeaWorld and was able to exhibit about 100 ""behaviors,"" Koontz said. The killer whale had no medical history or problems with behavior, the spokesman said, adding that there was no evidence of communicable disease. ""He had a great disposition."" ""Trainers had noticed that Sumar was acting lethargic yesterday [Monday] afternoon. Park veterinarians began a regimen of antibiotics to help try to stabilize his condition while they attempted to determine the cause of his illness,"" a SeaWorld statement said. ""His condition worsened today and a decision was made to cancel the 12:30 p.m. Shamu show, so that trainers and veterinarians could continue to devote their full attention to Sumar. Despite these efforts, Sumar did not survive."" Orlando, Florida-based SeaWorld was recently fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, after an animal trainer was killed by a whale in Orlando in February. SeaWorld, which also has a location in San Antonio, Texas, said it would contest the violations. The last killer whale to die at the San Diego venue was Splash, who was sickly when SeaWorld adopted him. He was nursed back to health and lived 15 years until 2005. No public memorial for Sumar has been planned, although fans will be able to comment on the park's Facebook page, Koontz said.","Killer whale dies at SeaWorld in San Diego .

"(CNN) -- On October 12, 2000, a suicide bomber attacked the USS Cole as it refueled in Aden, Yemen. A rubber boat packed with explosives detonated, killing 17 and wounding at least 37 more. Ten years later the destroyer -- also known as DDG 67 -- is in port at Norfolk, Virginia, after returning just a month ago from a mission in the Gulf of Aden, according to Command Duty Officer Lt. Torsten Becker. The ship's crew and others commemorated the 10-year anniversary Tuesday at Naval Station Norfolk. ""We lost 17 of our shipmates that terrible morning 10 years ago, but they were far more than just our sailors,"" said Adm. J.C. Harvey Jr., commander of U.S. Fleet Forces Command. ""They were your fathers, your sons and daughters, your sisters and brothers. They coached Little League. They loved to work on cars. They ran track and played football. They acted in high school plays. They loved life, they loved living and they loved you. ""They were proud to serve,"" he said. ""... We remember them here in this special place, where we can keep them close."" Harvey and current Cole crew members laid a wreath before a memorial honoring those who died, after their names, rank and hometowns were read. Guests were asked to rise and ""Taps"" was played. Harvey also spoke of the heroism of the Cole crew who worked for three days to save the ship and tend their injured crewmates following the explosion. They acted with no electrical power and no shipboard communication system to coordinate efforts, he said. ""The first 48 hours provided no opportunity for rest, and when they did find a moment to lay down, it was on a hot steel deck under a blazing sun,"" he said. ""... They were on their own, and what help there was, was far away."" ""Ask any of our Cole sailors today about their actions during the fight to save the ship and I believe they'll all tell you the same thing -- 'We were U.S. Navy sailors, and we did what we had to do. We just did our jobs.' ""No greater testament exists to the courage and tenacity of the Cole crew of October 2000 than the USS Cole today,"" he said. ""We brought Cole back, healed her wounds and made her ready to serve once again, just as we did with so many of the Cole sailors who were also so grievously wounded that day."" The Navy has made changes in the decade since the incident, he said. Recruits must now undergo a drill on the same type of boat as the Cole, where they must put out fires, battle flooding and tend to wounded people -- very like what the Cole crew did following the blast. The bomb blast 10 years ago ripped a 40-by-60-foot hole in the side of the ship, according to the U.S. Navy. Over 14 months, shipyard workers in Pascagoula, Mississippi, replaced 550 tons of steel plate and 275 miles of cable. After $250 million of repairs and updates, the Cole returned to duty in April 2002. Glass cases on board the USS Cole display three American flags to commemorate the terrorist attack, according to the U.S. Navy. The first is the flag that was flying when the attack occurred. Another draped the coffin of a fallen crew member. The third was flown upon the ship's first return to the Gulf of Aden after the attack. A plaque commemorates the victims, and the deck is inlaid with 17 stars to serve as reminders of those who died. ""I used to play a little game with myself: say all their names every time I stepped on a star,"" said Daren Jones, one of 40 sailors who were on board during the attack and served with the renovated vessel's crew of 350. ""I think it sends a message of what kind of country we have and what we're willing to do to keep our ships back at sea,"" Jones told CNN in 2002 when the ship redeployed. In December 2000, an investigation found that the USS Cole had not fully implemented its security plan the day of the attack. ""They didn't do everything they said they were going to do,"" a Pentagon official familiar with the investigation told CNN then. The Cole was operating under an alert level that warns of ""an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist activity"" but with no particular target. That threat condition calls for a standard list of anti-terrorism measures, including one that requires that ""unauthorized craft should be kept away from the ship."" The blast occurred when a small boat that appeared to be friendly pulled up alongside the Cole and exploded. In an online video, ""USS Cole 10 Years Later,"" the Navy touts improved security measures resulting from the Cole attack. ""The attack of the Cole prompted a shift in damage control training throughout the Navy,"" the narration reads. And when recruits train in ""mass casualty,"" clocks are set at 11:18, time the USS Cole was attacked. Meanwhile, the Cole's legacy can still be felt on board today, said Becker, who had just joined the Navy at the time of the attack but was not yet stationed on the Cole. ""We're just more situation-aware on the anti-terrorism portion of it,"" he said. Becker recalled his feelings when the Navy assigned him to the Cole: ""It was a surreal feeling knowing what it had gone through."" In his latest deployment aboard the ship, Becker helped rout out pirates in the Gulf of Aden, which bears the name of the port in the attack. ""Initially it was kind of unusual,"" Becker said. ""But once we got down to business, it (the attack) was not on the forefront."" Terrorism emanating from Yemen remains a major threat to the United States, according to a recent assessment by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""American analysts now consider al Qaeda's affiliate organization in Yemen a more pressing threat to U.S. national security than the central leadership as the Yemen-based outfit is increasingly agile and looking for opportunities to strike abroad,"" the report said.","NEW: Wreath laid at memorial during ceremony .

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The military opened a hearing Tuesday for Maj. Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army psychiatrist accused of last year's Fort Hood shootings, then adjourned it almost immediately. Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in a shooting spree at the Fort Hood Army base in Texas. The hearing will determine whether Hasan will be court-martialed -- which could potentially lead to the death penalty. Col. James Pohl, who is presiding over the hearing, rejected a defense request to close the hearing to the public, then adjourned to consider a defense request to delay the hearing until November because of a scheduling conflict. It will continue Wednesday morning at 9 a.m. (10 a.m. ET), he ruled. The defense has until midnight to submit its argument to Pohl for delaying the hearing until November 8, said retired Lt. Col. Thomas Rheinlander, a Fort Hood spokesman. Hasan, 40, was brought on base under tight security and entered the courtroom in a wheelchair. He is paralyzed from the upper chest down after civilian police shot him four times during the incident. Hasan looked alert, ""but when they wheeled him in, he gripped the sides of his wheelchair to make sure he didn't fall out. His legs were strapped to the chair,"" said NPR reporter Wade Goodwyn. Goodwyn was one of 10 journalists chosen by lottery to be in the court. CNN was on the base but not in the court. Hasan wore his Army fatigues uniform and a knit cap to help regulate his body temperature due to the paralysis, Goodwyn said. Family members of two victims were also in court, including Jessica Hansen, whose fiance, Staff Sgt. Patrick Zeigler, was severely injured in the shooting. He is still in the hospital being treated for his injuries. Family members leaned forward to watch Hasan come in, but neither they nor Hasan showed much emotion, the NPR reporter told CNN. When the hearing gets under way, there will be graphic accounts of what happened during the shooting, but Goodwyn said ""today's testimony -- all related to procedures and such -- wasn't the type anyone would emotionally react to."" During the proceeding, called an Article 32 hearing, officials will consider the evidence against Hasan and decide whether the case will move forward to a court-martial. Both the defense and prosecution can present witnesses and evidence. Army prosecutors have refused to speak publicly about the case or release a witness list. They are expected to call every person wounded in the shootings, as well as others, to provide a second-by-second account of what happened on November 5, 2009. John Galligan, Hasan's civilian attorney, had wanted the hearing closed to the public, but his motion was denied. Hasan, a U.S.-born citizen of Palestinian descent, faces 13 counts of first-degree murder for allegedly opening fire at the Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood, killing 12 soldiers and a civilian. He also is charged with 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder for the 30 military personnel and two civilians wounded at the center, where soldiers prepare to deploy for Afghanistan and Iraq. The shootings at the nation's largest Army post, in central Texas between Dallas and San Antonio, shocked the nation and raised questions about whether a so-called homegrown terrorist had operated within the military system without detection. The Article 32 hearing is not expected to provide answers to why Hasan, who had communicated with a known Islamic extremist and made anti-U.S. comments, was promoted nonetheless. At the time of the shootings, Hasan was scheduled to deploy to Afghanistan, military officials said. The FBI has said it was aware of communication between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, a Yemeni-American cleric who has promoted jihad against the United States and other Western countries. But investigators had determined those contacts were ""consistent with research being conducted by Maj. Hasan."" Clerics at the Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center in Falls Church, Virginia -- which Hasan attended when he lived in the area -- described him as a loner. Shaikh Shaker Elsayed said they were not successful in finding him a wife, and Imam Johari Abdul-Malik said some people believed Hasan changed after his mother's death in 2001. Legal jockeying so far indicates the Article 32 hearing will be contentious. Last week, Galligan said he instructed Hasan not to cooperate with a government-ordered psychiatric evaluation. Col. Morgan Lamb, the officer overseeing the case, had indicated in January that the military would not ""meet with, test or examine"" Hasan until after the Article 32 hearing. But in a recent memo obtained by CNN, Lamb said he reversed his decision after the defense said in court last month that it may introduce mental capacity evidence for consideration in the case. Galligan denied the defense had made such a statement. The hearing could stretch into November, with the prosecution set to present its case through October 29, followed by a one-week recess when Fort Hood will mark the first anniversary of the shootings, referred to by some as ""5/11."" For Jessica Hansen, the fiance of wounded Staff Sgt. Zeigler, the hearing will be the first step of what she believes will be a long process to bring justice to the victims. With all the attention on Hasan as the hearing approached, she said she ""cringed"" at how some of those wounded in the shootings struggled alone and unnoticed. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Suspect Nidal Hasan wears his Army uniform and a knit cap as he is wheeled into court .

"(CNN) -- For nearly 50 years Ron and Valerie Taylor have been filming sharks at close quarters, bringing the lives of the ocean's most fearsome predators to TV and the big screen. Ron, 76, was a spear fisherman before he and Valerie started working with film and TV companies who wanted shark dramas. The conflict of hunting one day, then capturing the underwater life with a 16mm camera the next, led Ron to forsake spear hunting for full-time filming. Getting close to sharks, including the few species dangerous to humans, has put the Australian couple in treacherous situations. One of the most perilous came in 1969 when the couple had to fend off a school of sharks off the coast of South Africa while filming them feast on a dead whale. Valerie has also been bitten three times, yet despite the hazards of the job both remain in awe of sharks and committed to their protection. They blame the voracious appetite of people for shark fins for endangering many shark species. ""World wide sharks are in serious danger, mainly for shark finning,"" Ron Taylor told CNN. ""The Asian market just can't get enough of sharks fin; the price has gone way up. Even Australian fishermen are taking shark fins now in the Great Barrier Reef. ""Some species of sharks are protected, like the Great White Shark... but with other species of sharks there are no restrictions."" The Taylors hope their captivating underwater footage has helped educate people that sharks deserve respect and protection. However they admit that some of their work may have been viewed as adding to the negative image that sharks are dangerous. ""To some extent the documentaries perpetuate the myth, because they see people with sharks, but whenever you see documentaries with divers in the water and sharks around, those sharks have been attracted with bait,"" said Ron Taylor. The couple filmed the live shot for 1975 film ""Jaws"" and did not expect their work would have the affect of almost scaring a generation from swimming in the sea. ""The problem was that [""Jaws""] was so well done that people believed that the sharks really were like that, that there was a vendetta against sharks and Valerie and I got a lot of criticism... the number of people learning to dive dropped off. So the dive shops were very unhappy about Valerie and I being involved in a film that reduced their commercial possibilities."" Yet the Taylors remain committed to raising awareness of the importance of marine biodiversity and shark protection. ""You've just got to tell your story well and have good imagery. And you can make a big difference to the way not only the government but the people on the country can view their marine wilderness areas, which should be looked at the same as national parks on land,"" said Valerie Taylor. Ron Taylor added: ""We really need no-take zones where marine creatures have a chance to reproduce unmolested and the fishermen don't want it. The want to be able to take fish from everywhere. We need marine national parks with no-take zones.""","Australian couple have been filming sharks for nearly 50 years .

"(CNN) -- A submarine found by anti-drug police in Ecuador last week cost $4 million to build and could have hauled 6 to 10 metric tons of cocaine, a top U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official said Wednesday. The fully functional submarine was built at a drydock at a clandestine complex that housed 50 people, said Jay Bergman, Andean regional director for the DEA. Authorities found the sub hidden in marshland under triple-canopy jungle, Bergman told CNN's ""American Morning"" program. ""This is the first seizure of a clandestinely constructed fully operational submarine built to facilitate trans-oceanic drug trafficking,"" the DEA said in a statement last week. ""Traffickers historically employed slow-moving fishing boats, sail boats, pleasure craft go-fasts,"" Bergman said last week. ""The advent of the narco-submarine presents new detection challenges for maritime interdiction forces. The submarine's nautical range, payload capacity and quantum leap in stealth have raised the stakes for the counter-drug forces and the national security community alike."" The vessel utilizes twin screws and is diesel-electric powered, the agency said. It is about 98 feet (30 meters) long and 9 feet (nearly 3 meters) high from the deck plates to the ceiling. It has a periscope and an air-conditioning system.","Submarine could have hauled 6 to 10 metric tons of cocaine, DEA says .

"Clarksdale, Mississippi (CNN) -- The soul man howled into the microphone, his voice busting through the ceiling of the dimly lit Mississippi juke joint. He sang of love and sex, cheating scoundrels and lying fools. ""... Doin' the booooom booooom! ..."" He danced, he grooved. At times, his voice hit notes so high, the walls of the ramshackle place shook. ""Cat got lungs!"" shouted one in the small crowd. Soul wannabes enter juke joints with caution: Stabbings and flat-out beatings have befallen artists who don't meet expectations. Yet on this night, not far from the fabled crossroads where, according to legend, bluesman Robert Johnson gained guitar mastery in exchange for his immortal soul, there was a most unexpected surprise: A Massachusetts Yankee tore it up at one of the toughest joints in the Mississippi Delta. Eli ""Paperboy"" Reed sang for more than three hours for an audience of no more than 15. Men named Red, Bubba and Sledge nodded with approval. And word on the street was out: Been a long time since somebody like the Paperboy has come through! It's been more than 18 months since that performance. The Paperboy is now hitting the big stage. Signed by Capitol Records last year, he and his band, the True Loves, released their first album under a major label last week. The album, ""Come and Get It,"" combines soul-ratcheting spunk with 1960s-style ballads. At its core is an age-old R&B tradition: lyrics of love and being driven wild by women. When he hits stride, Reed unleashes raw sexual energy through deep-bellied hollers, explosive bursts from his band and auctioneer-like rapidity. ""... There's gonna be an explosion, baby. Gonna be a-, gonna be a-, gonna be a- ... Owwwwwwwwwwwwwww!!! ..."" Kicked back in his apartment in Brooklyn, the 26-year-old Reed laughs about how far he's come. ""There was a lot of very lucky coincidences that I fell into,"" he says. And he's got big-time backing. Mike Elizondo, who has produced stars like Eminem, Dr. Dre and 50 Cent, is the producer for ""Come and Get It."" While Elizondo is best known for his hip-hop music production, he is ecstatic about this new gig. He first heard of Reed from a business partner about two years ago and then watched him on YouTube. ""My jaw was on the floor."" ""I played it for Justin Timberlake and a couple other people. I was like, 'Dude, you've gotta check this kid out.' "" Blues, gospel and the 'strange cat' The son of a former music critic, Reed got into music at an early age. By the time he was 13, he was practicing the harmonica eight hours a day. He'd cut up around the house with his father, who strummed the guitar while his son belted out. In high school, instead of poring over algebra books, Reed studied the likes of Sam Cooke and other R&B greats, listening to their tone, as well as the heart and soul they put into their music. He played saxophone and guitar in a jazz band in high school. When he performed, he wore his grandfather's hat, and soon got dubbed ""Paperboy"" for his 1950s newsboy looks. The name stuck. Shortly after high school graduation, at the age of 18, the Jewish kid from Brookline, Massachusetts, set out from his parents' home to the heart of the nation's blues country. He was heading to the Mississippi Delta to work for a jumpstart blues radio station. But shortly after he arrived, his partner went broke. He was soon on stage at local juke joints, fronting a band and playing four hours a night. ""I found myself thrust into it from the word go, playing all the time,"" he says. ""I pretty much immersed myself in this culture 24 hours a day."" He stayed in Mississippi for about a year before heading to the University of Chicago. But his real education wasn't at the university; it came on the South Side, where he teamed up with gospel singer Mitty Collier and began singing at her church. He says his skin color -- he was often the only white guy performing for crowds in Mississippi and Chicago -- was never a hindrance. In fact, he says, African-Americans often respected him more than whites did. ""Once people see that you're enthusiastic and love the music and that I could sing ... everybody was very forgiving of it."" At juke joints, he says, the audiences were working-class folks ""just there to have a good time."" They never got out of hand with him or the band, he pauses, ""unless they're really drunk."" When he gets a chance, he still goes back to Red's, the first juke joint he ever played in Clarksdale. Along the way, Reed has picked up fans from Natasha Bedingfield to Nick Lowe to Daryl Hall of Hall & Oates. Earlier this year, Hall had Reed perform on his Web show ""Live from Daryl's House,"" where musicians play along with Hall at his place in New York. Hall ranks Reed in the top 5 of those who have played on his show. ""I look for unique people and I look for really talented people, and he fits that bill all the way,"" Hall says. ""The guy is a strange throwback of the time, but he doesn't do it like an Elvis impersonator. He's the real thing."" Reed has since traded in his paperboy hat for a pompadour. His outfits now more resemble characters out of the hit TV show ""Mad Men."" Hall says he was so stunned by Reed's looks that he pulled out pictures from his youth to show the budding musician. ""He was dressed in almost identical clothing as me,"" Hall says, laughing. ""He's a strange cat."" But, he adds, of Reed's authentic style: ""I don't know how he does it, to tell you the truth. He's a musical time traveler."" Producer Elizondo agrees. ""He's doing something that nobody his age is doing."" The new album -- with most of its songs written by Reed -- was recorded live in Boston over 12 days. Six days were spent tracking the rhythm section, and another six days to track the band's horns and strings. ""Sonically, it stands up to anything that's out there,"" Elizondo says. Like everything in the music business, the verdict is still out on if Reed catches on in the mainstream. To that end, Hall says that ""there is no mainstream that matters"" anymore. ""It's all about enthusiasm and fanaticism to your particular thing,"" Hall says. ""And that's more important than being mainstream. It always was, really."" And there's no doubt about Reed's soul. Hall and Elizondo say his audience will grow at the grass-roots level as more and more people hear his stuff. When they see him live, Elizondo says, ""it'll be a party from beginning to end."" Boston Red Sox fans will get their first taste of that next Tuesday, when Reed sings the national anthem at Fenway Park.","Eli ""Paperboy"" Reed released his first album under a major label last week .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Twelve jurors must decide whether the marriage of a Mexican soap opera actress to a California pizza delivery man was a fact built on love or fiction designed to fool immigration agents. The question is apparently not easy for jurors who told the judge late Wednesday that they needed to return for more deliberations Thursday. Their answer could send the couple to prison. Jurors can compare the tearful testimony of the actress proclaiming love for her husband to evidence that she engaged in a romance with a photographer less than a year after her wedding. The prosecutor argued Fernanda Romero paid Kent Ross $5,000 to be her husband in June, 2005 so she could get a U.S. work visa. ""Why would anybody have to be paid to marry her?"" asked defense lawyer Michael Nasitir, pointing to the beautiful actress-singer-model. Romero and Ross were both 23 when they had a Los Angeles wedding. Only the bride's mother and a handful of others attended, but Romero said a larger wedding was impossible because he is a Mormon and she's a devout Catholic. There was no honeymoon, which Special Assistant U.S. Attorney James Left argued was evidence of a sham marriage. ""You'd figure they could go somewhere, Palm Springs, San Diego,"" Left said during closing arguments Wednesday. They did have pictures together, which the prosecution suggested were staged to show immigration officials who would decide on her green card. When immigration agents conducted a surprise ""bed check"" at Romero's Los Angeles apartment in October, 2007, they found her, but not him. They found Ross at a Hollywood apartment, they testified. Romero testified that she really loved Ross when they got married and she intended to build a life with him. The first months were ""very loving, fun,"" she said. ""We socialized together, passionate. It was the honeymoon stage."" But his drinking and late-night cavorting split them just seven months after their wedding, she said. ""We started to fight a lot, sweat a lot, throw things. It was not healthy."" Her defense lawyer argued jurors only have to conclude that the marriage was real when it began. ""There are all kinds of marriages,"" Nasitir said. ""No one else knows if people are in love."" The case is unusual because marriage fraud charges are usually litigated by immigration authorities rather than prosecuted as criminal cases. U.S. District Judge Manuel Real blocked the defense from using much of the evidence they said would show it was only investigated because Romero was turned in by a vengeful photographer angry that she rebuffed his romantic advances. She met Markus Klinko at a Hollywood casting call about the same time her marriage was ""on the rocks,"" she said. Klinko, a 49-year-old Swiss native, is the star of his own reality TV show, Bravo's ""Double Exposure."" Romero said the relationship initially was ""professional and creative,"" but she eventually engaged in a ""short affair"" with Klinko as he helped with her modeling career. ""I felt very pressured and I was vulnerable,"" Romero said as she cried. ""It was the biggest mistake I've done in my life."" Her friendship with Klinko turned into a nightmare when she decided to end the affair, she said. ""Mr. Klinko wanted more and more and he knew I wasn't able to give it to him,"" she said. Klinko threatened to turn her in to immigration officials, she said. ""He was losing it, he was very psycho,"" Romero said. ""I was very scared, because he wouldn't stop."" The federal complaint against Romero said the immigration investigation began after agents were given evidence gathered by a private detective hired by Klinko. When Klinko testified for the prosecution last week he said it was ""completely incorrect"" that his motivation was to get Romero deported. Instead, the investigator was gathering evidence to be used in a lawsuit against Michael Ball, the founder and owner of the Rock & Republic fashion company, Klinko said. The criminal complaint named Ball as a target of the federal investigation, alleging that he helped arrange the sham marriage while Romero was modeling for his company. Klinko said his lawyer turned the evidence over to the government only because he feared Klinko might be extorted by Ball. ""My case has never been against Fernanda,"" Klinko said after his testimony. ""I wish her the best."" They could get between 15 and 21 months in prison if convicted, though such cases usually produce shorter sentences, according to the prosecutor. Romero's show business career began in Mexico at age 16 when she joined the ensemble Frizzby, her Internet Movie Database biography says. The group toured Mexico and Central America, releasing two top-10 singles, it says. She started hosting television shows and appearing on commercials in Mexico when she was 18, it says. Romero has appeared in print and TV ad campaigns for Rock and Republic, Clean and Clear, Pepsi, Apple and JCPenney, it says. ""She was cast in Telemundo's original production 'Wounded Soul,' where she was not only a lead actress, but also a lead singer, performing two songs in the soap opera's soundtrack,"" her online biography says.","Jurors told the judge Wednesday they needed more time to decide .

"Morganton, North Carolina (CNN) -- Sheriff's deputies, police and firefighters began draining a pond Wednesday night as they resumed their search for the body of a missing 10-year-old North Carolina girl. The pond is next to a site investigators combed overnight in hopes of finding Zahra Clare Baker, whose disappearance is now being investigated as a homicide. The girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, has been jailed on a charge of obstruction of justice after police said she admitted to writing a ransom note found at the family's Hickory, North Carolina, home. The search ran until 1 a.m. Tuesday, and between 15 and 25 investigators were working past nightfall Wednesday in cool, damp weather to drain the neighboring pond. The site under scrutiny Tuesday night is more than 20 miles north of Hickory. Zahra's father, Adam Baker, frequently worked there hauling loads of wood and brush to be fed into a wood chipper and turned into mulch, witnesses said. Baker was on the scene during the Tuesday night search aimed at finding the girl's body, Burke County Sheriff John T. McDevitt said Tuesday night. ""He seems concerned,"" McDevitt said. ""But I don't know how sincere his concern is."" Zahra reportedly suffered from bone cancer and used a prosthetic leg and hearing aids. The hearing aids have been found, but not the prosthesis, Hickory Police Chief Adkins said. The case is an emotional one for investigators and a high priority, Catawba County District Attorney Jay Gaither Jr., told reporters after Elisa  Baker's initial court appearance Wednesday morning. ""The facts are disturbing as we know them at this point,"" he said, adding, ""We want the best, but we fear the worst."" Flanked by two attorneys, Elisa Baker wore a bright pink jumpsuit and was handcuffed and chained at her wrist and ankles at her court appearance. She was informed of the felony charge against her, which carries a penalty of more than two years in prison upon conviction. Asked if she understood, she affirmed that she did in a low voice. The bond on the obstruction of justice charge is $40,000, in addition to the bond of more than $30,000 she faces on charges unrelated to Zahra's disappearance. Her next scheduled court date is November 3. Her attorney, Scott Reilly, said he would be filing a motion to get the bond reduced, calling it ""excessive."" The maximum bond for such a charge is usually $10,000, he said. Reilly said his client is scared, emotional, upset and worried about her family. Asked what she has said about Zahra, he said he was not at liberty to discuss the girl. Though Zahra was reported missing Saturday afternoon. Her father and stepmother reported she was last seen sleeping in her bed about 2:30 a.m. Saturday. But Hickory Police Chief Tom Adkins said Tuesday authorities have been unable to find anyone outside Zahra's immediate family who has reported seeing her in the past month, and investigators are not sure how long she has actually been missing. A search warrant application filed in the case said it began with a call about a burning mulch pile at the family's home about 5:30 a.m. Saturday. Firefighters found a Chevrolet Tahoe with its passenger door open and a power company envelope with handwriting on it on the front windshield, the search warrant said. Firefighters notified police, who approached the SUV and smelled gasoline coming from inside. The note written on the envelope was addressed to a ""Mr. Coffey,"" identified in the search warrant as Adam Baker's boss, Mark David Coffey. ""Mr. Coffey, you like being in control now who is in control,"" the note said, according to the search warrant. ""We have your daughter and your pot smoking red head son is next unless you do what is asked 1,000,000 unmarked will be in touch soon."" In the bottom right, the note said, ""no cops,"" according to the warrant. Coffey and his only daughter were at the residence at the time of the fire, the warrant said. CNN affiliate News 14 Carolina reported Coffey owns the home. Adam Baker called police about 2 p.m., saying someone had poured gas in his car and left a note saying they had his boss' daughter, according to the search warrant. Baker told police he believed the person who left the note had kidnapped Zahra. The Bakers consented to a search of their home, the warrant said. A cadaver dog indicated the possible presence of human remains in or on the Chevrolet Tahoe as well as a burgundy Toyota Camry on the property, it said. Authorities were testing swabs taken from the Tahoe to determine if blood was also present, according to the warrant. Brittany Bentley, who is married to Elisa Baker's nephew, told HLN that the girl ""wasn't in very good living conditions, not at all for a 10-year-old."" ""I remember Elisa coming out of the bedroom one day, saying her hands hurt from spanking Zahra so much,"" she said. ""I know she spanked way too hard, what I consider beating."" She said the girl was locked in her room and ""I know about letting her out five minutes, just to eat and that was it."" North Carolina social services officials declined to comment on the case. Elisa Baker's sister, Carrie Fairchild, said she and other relatives were estranged from her sister after a falling-out with their father over money the Bakers owed him. She also told HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" that her sister frequently made up stories that she was suffering from a variety of illnesses. ""She always had 10 to 20 illnesses that she said were wrong with her,"" Fairchild said. ""You couldn't believe anything she ever said.""

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 1 Maria Sharapova gained revenge over China's Zheng Jie as she reached the second round of the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford. The Russian fifth seed lost to Zheng in her previous hard-court outing three months ago, but triumphed 6-4 7-5 on her return to the surface on Tuesday night at the oldest women-only event on the tennis calendar. Sharapova reached the quarterfinals of the American tournament last year as she continued her slow recovery from shoulder surgery, and made a solid start to her preparations for this year's U.S. Open by beating the world No. 23. The 23-year-old will next play unseeded Olga Govortsova of Belarus. ""Our match at Indian Wells was a really scratchy match. I wasn't playing very well there,"" Sharapova told the WTA Tour website. ""Today I served really well but returned quite poorly. I returned well when I had to, but I'll work on that going forward. Improving with every match is really the goal, and working myself towards the Open."" Defending champion Marion Bartoli also progressed, beating American Ashley Harkleroad 6-1 6-4 to set up a clash with former world No. 1 Ana Ivanovic, who was handed a wild-card entry. ""I'm desperate to be back in the final of a Grand Slam. That's my main goal,"" said French fourth seed Bartoli, the 2007 Wimbledon runner-up.

"Devecser, Hungary (CNN) -- The aluminum plant at the heart of the deadly toxic red sludge spill in Hungary will resume production at the end of the week, government officials said Wednesday. And the chief executive of the plant, who was arrested on Monday, has been released pending trial, his lawyer Janos Banati said. Zoltan Bakonyi, the chief executive of the MAL aluminum plant, was detained Monday, accused of public endangerment and harming the environment, authorities said. The announcement came on the same day officials said a ninth person had died from the toxic spill. The European Union said Wednesday the rescue phase of the operation has concluded. The main priority is now is cleaning up, said Laurent de Pierrefeu, an EU official on the ground at the scene of the spill. The red sludge leaked from a reservoir at the plant in Hungary and streamed through villages and into the Danube, Europe's second largest river. The plant will be guarded by police and will be monitored by the government, the country's disaster relief commissioner said at a news conference Wednesday. Workers in Hungary have been racing to build three emergency dams to stem an expected second toxic spill from the plant. Some 500,000 cubic meters of toxic red sludge is in the plant's reservoir, whose wall shows signs of ruptures and cracks, said Gyorgi Tottos, a spokeswoman with Hungary's emergency services department. Officials say it's only a matter of time before the wall breaks and spews the sludge across the landscape, she said. The amount of sludge that remains in the reservoir is about half the amount that spilled out more than week ago, inundating three villages and leaving the landscape covered in red. Crews were also trying to remove a layer of liquid from the top of the sludge in the reservoir in order to make the mud less mobile if the wall breaks. The aluminum company said in a statement Saturday it was doing its utmost ""to avoid further damages and to reinforce the injured deposit."" The company said it has performed extensive maintenance work and renovations in the past decade and had followed safety regulations. It has also established a relief fund for victims of the spill and was attempting to help in finding accommodations for residents who were evacuated. About 800 people had to leave the village of Kolontar, downstream from the reservoir, and hundreds of soldiers were ready to rescue inhabitants of a nearby village if the wall collapses.

"(CNN) -- A police officer jailed on a first-degree murder charge in a two-state shooting rampage was on his computer at the time of shootings and could not have committed them, prosecutors said Tuesday evening. Brian E. Dorian, 37, was to be released on his own recognizance Tuesday night, and charges against him will be formally dismissed Wednesday, Will County State's Attorney James W. Glasgow announced. ""I feel horrible that Brian Dorian went through this,"" said Glasgow, adding that evidence at the time and identification in lineups merited the charges. ""At no time did we stop looking for exculpatory evidence."" A forensic analysis of Dorian's home computer and its activity put Dorian at home at the time of the shootings, authorities said. The officer also told them he was watching sports programs and using e-mail. John Dorian, the officer's father, told CNN affiliate WLS he was ""relieved"" and ""never doubted his son."" Police now are looking at other leads in the shootings. Earlier in the day, Dorian appeared in court via a hookup from the Will County Jail. He did not speak but his attorney entered a not guilty plea, WLS reported. Several friends and relatives wore T-shirts bearing the message ""Free Brian."" ""There's an innocent man sitting behind bars and somebody else is running around out there knowing that he got away with it. It's not fair,"" Jill Aggen, a friend of Dorian, told WLS. ""No doubt in my mind. He's not capable of it."" Dorian, an officer with the Lynwood Police Department, was arrested Friday in the killing of one person and the wounding of three others in the spree, which occurred south of Chicago, Illinois. He was held on a probable cause warrant, and bail was set at $2.5 million. Dorian, who according to WLS has been on medical leave for an injured shoulder the past year, was taken into custody Friday at his residence, said authorities. The shootings began about 10:30 a.m. October 5 at a construction site near Beecher, Illinois. The gunman killed one worker at the site and wounded two others, police have said. An hour later and about 10 miles away in Lowell, Indiana, authorities believe the same gunman opened fire again -- this time on a local farmer. Keith Dahl was shot in the left shoulder, arm and elbow, and then was robbed. Dahl told Lake County (Indiana) Sheriff's Detective Robert Martinez that the gunman approached him on his farm and started a conversation about bees before beginning to shoot. The gunman was believed to be using a revolver -- possibly a Colt .38-caliber or .357 Magnum -- because no shell casings were found at either scene, Lake County Sheriff Rogelio ""Roy"" Dominguez said.","Police officer to be freed in Illinois, Indiana shootings .

"(CNN) -- A 19-year-old woman shot early Saturday at an off-campus party near Seton Hall University in New Jersey has died, hospital and police officials said. Four others were shot and wounded at the party in East Orange, New Jersey. Police are looking for a suspect and have offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. The victim was identified by Seton Hall's interim president as Jessica Moore, a sophomore honors student from Virginia. ""We extend our most heartfelt condolences to Jessica's family and friends,"" Seton Hall Interim President Gabriel Esteban said in a statement. ""Please know that we share in your grief and that we will be praying for you in the difficult days ahead. ""As we move forward from this senseless tragedy, we will look for peace and healing through our faith, and through the love and support of friends and family."" Officials said the shootings occurred when a man who unsuccessfully tried to crash the party returned with a handgun and opened fire. Area police and college officials pledged to work around the clock to solve what East Orange Police Director Jose Cordero called a ""horrific"" crime. Three of the victims were Seton Hall students, one a New Jersey Institute of Technology student, and a New York resident, Cordero said. ""The shooter picked the wrong city to do this crime,"" said East Orange Mayor Robert L. Bowser. ""He will be apprehended."" The incident occurred in East Orange -- about a mile from the Seton Hall campus -- at 12:17 a.m. Saturday during a party at a private residence, officials said. A man described as being in his mid-20s became involved in an altercation when he entered. He left the house, rented by a graduate student, and returned moments later with the handgun. The victims, two men and three women, were taken to University Hospital. Four suffered non-life threatening wounds, said Cordero, who, like other officials, would not identify them. Hospital officials will not release their conditions, spokeswoman Stacy Newton said. It wasn't immediately clear if the shooter, who was still at large Saturday afternoon, is a student. He is described as a black man, between about 5 feet, 11 inches tall, and 6 feet, 2 inches tall, and having a stocky build and a scruffy full beard. Counseling services are being offered to Seton Hall students. A prayer service was scheduled for Saturday night. Police were looking at surveillance video in the neighborhood for potential evidence.

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Mahmoud  Ahmadinejad is scheduled to visit Lebanon areas bordering  northern Israel  on Thursday as the Iranian president faces threats by a member of Israel's leadership. Ahmadinejad is on a Lebanon tour, his first state  visit to the country. Many Lebanese applaud Iran for helping rebuild parts of their country. But the visit to Beirut and now the scheduled tour of the border area has sent alarm bells for some in Israel. Israeli Knesset member Arieh Eldad has suggested that military  action might be needed. ""It   is our responsibility to stop anyone  who publicly calls for our   destruction,"" said Israeli Knesset member Arieh Eldad  from the   far-right National Union party. ""That responsibility means us  doing something and  not waiting for the  world to do something. If a  situation arises in which  Ahmadinejad is in  the cross-hairs of the IDF  (Israel Defense Forces), he should  be  killed."" The Iranian president is scheduled to visit Hezbollah stronghold villages such as Bint Jbeil and Maroun al-Ras, places that were at the heart of fighting in the 2006 war between  Hezbollah and Israel. The debate has raged in Israel on what to do when Ahmadinejad gets to those areas. ""I think the best thing Israel can do is to make sure President Ahmadinejad goes back to Iran safely and he continues to be the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran because he himself is causing more damage to the regime and helping Israel than any other Iranian president could,"" said Meir Javendanfar, a Middle East analyst.

"(CNN) -- Former world No. 3 David Nalbandian has continued his latest comeback from injury by reaching his first semifinal of 2010 at the Legg Mason Classic in Washington, but top seed Tomas Berdych suffered a shock defeat. The Argentine is now ranked a lowly 117th after missing both the French Open and Wimbledon due to a hamstring problem, but proved too strong for Andy Roddick's conqueror Gilles Simon on Friday. The 28-year-old, playing his first tournament since April, came from behind to beat the French 13th seed 3-6 6-2 6-3 and set up a clash with Croatian No. 4 Marin Cilic. ""I feel good. I will just try to keep believing in my game and play the best I can,"" Nalbandian, who missed most of 2009 due to hip surgery, told reporters. ""During practice I know I can go far. Without playing matches, it's tough to know how far you can go."" Nalbandian, four times a semifinalist in Grand Slams and the Wimbledon runner-up in 2002, made a poor start as he trailed 3-0 in the opening set and was then a break and 0-40 down before battling back to level the match. He took a 2-0 lead in the third and sealed his best result since losing to Novak Djokovic in the quarterfinals in Monaco. Cilic romped into the last four with a 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 win over Janko Tipsarevic, and now has a 5-0 career record against the Serbian. In Friday's opening match, world No. 8 Berdych crashed out as he lost 6-4 3-6 6-2 to Belgium's world No. 62 Xavier Malisse. Malisse will next take on eighth seed Marcos Baghdatis after the Cypriot ousted Spanish No. 3 Fernando Verdasco 7-6 (7-3) 6-4. Berdych was playing his first tournament since losing in the final at Wimbledon in early July. The Czech said he would not return to the tournament, being unhappy to have to play in mid-afternoon just 10 hours after his previous match. ""This is a pretty bad experience for a tournament where I'm first seeded. I thought I could get some better times with a No. 1 seed,"" Berdych told reporters. ""It's the reason I'm not going to be here next year. In the first set I felt like I was still sleeping. I was not 100 percent ready and that's disappointing. I wanted to play better."" Meanwhile, second seed Samantha Stosur failed to reach the semifinals of the women's San Diego Open, losing 6-4 6-3 to Italian Flavia Pennetta on Friday. The fifth seed's reward for eliminating the French Open runner-up is a clash with Russia's two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova, who defeated American teenager CoCo Vandeweghe 7-5 6-2 after trailing 5-2 in the opening set. Polish fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska thrashed Israeli No. 7 Shahar Peer 6-2 6-0 to earn a semifinal with Slovakia's Daniela Hantuchova, who came from behind to beat young Russian Alisa Kleybanova 2-6 6-4 6-3. World No. 3 Caroline Wozniacki reached the final of her home Copenhagen Open on Saturday, with the Danish top seed beating Russia's Anna Chakvetadze 6-1 2-6 6-4. She will play seventh seed Klara Zakopalova on Sunday after the Czech upset China's No. 2 Li Na 6-3 1-6 6-4.","David Nalbandian to face Croatian fourth seed Marin Cilic in Washington semifinals .

"(CNN) -- An alien with a lemon-shaped head and a jazz-themed encounter with a UFO at the Glastonbury Festival are among hundreds of UFO sightings detailed in the latest batch of documents released Monday by the UK's Ministry of Defence. A sketch of a UFO made by a witness following a sighting in 1993. Fourteen files, containing over 4,000 pages of UFO sightings from 1981 to 1996, have now been placed on Britain's National Archives database and are publicly available online. The sightings range from lights in the sky to close contact with aliens, and the files contain detailed analysis on some of the UK's most popular cases -- a number of which remain officially unexplained. In one incident in 1995, two men in their 20s from Staffordshire, central England, told police they saw an alien with a lemon-shaped head descend from a hovering UFO and tell them ""We want you; come with us."" In another sighting recorded by defense officials in 1994, two women at the Glastonbury music festival reported seeing a UFO floating above the jazz stage . However, 90 percent of cases have been accounted for. Multiple sightings of a brightly illuminated oval object in London during 1993 and 1994 were later explained as an airship advertising the launch of the Ford Mondeo car. In 1993, more than 30 reports of illuminations over central England during a six-hour period led to senior defense staff being briefed, before it was established that the lights had been caused by a Russian rocket re-entering the atmosphere . The documents reveal that in 1996 there were 608 sightings, a dramatic surge from the previous year's 117. However, this may have less to do with exceptional levels of extra-terrestrial activity, than with the release of blockbuster film ""Independence Day"" and the popularity that year of sci-fi TV series ""The X-Files."" David Clarke, a UFO expert and journalism lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University who has studied the files, said: ""Obviously, films and TV programs raise awareness of UFOs and it's fascinating to see how that appears to lead more people to report what they see."" Clarke's comments certainly correspond with the other periods of high-frequency sightings in Britain -- one of the other busiest years was in 1978, the same year in which Steven Spielberg's alien-themed ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" was released. The files also shed new light on Britain's own 'Roswell', the Rendlesham Forest sightings of December 1980 in which American air force men saw a series of mysterious lights in the trees at the perimeter of an air base used by the U.S. Air Force. The then government of Margaret Thatcher was quick to dismiss the incident, but a letter from a former chief of defense staff in 1985 warned that the affair could prove a 'banana skin' for the Ministry of Defence. ""The case has puzzling and disquieting features which have never been satisfactorily explained ... which continue to preoccupy informed sections of the public,"" said the letter. Other documents reveal a UFO incident in Belgium between 1989 and 1990 when Belgian Air Force F-16 fighters were scrambled to intercept abnormal, brightly-lit, triangular flying objects reported by police and others. In November 1993 General Wilfried de Brouwer, chief of operations in the Belgian Air Staff, confirmed that the fighters had locked-on to something with their radar but were unable to explain what it was. The MoD affirmed that there had been no threat to the UK and that it has never detected a ""structured craft flying in UK airspace that has remained unidentified."" This latest release of documents represents the fourth set of UFO files released  since 2008 as part of a three-year project in conjunction with the National Archives.","Newly released files contain over 4,000 pages of UFO sightings .

"(CNN) -- Juan Martin Del Potro has begun training again, raising hopes he may be fit to defend his U.S Open title at Flushing Meadows later this month. The Argentinean has been out of action since the Australian Open in January after having surgery on his right wrist but was included in the list of entrants for the New York tournament, which starts on August 30. He denied a rumor last month that he was already back on the court, but a picture posted on Del Potro's Twitter account showed the 21-year-old practicing again - racquet in hand. See Juan Martin del Potro back in action . He wrote: ""How beautiful it is to come back and hit the ball, I can tell you it was a light session but I had the racquet in my hand once again."" Del Potro had been battling with his injury for a long time before opting to go under the knife after his fourth round defeat by Marian Cilic at the Australian Open. His solid form last season led to him climbing to number four in the rankings, largely thanks to landing his maiden major title at the U.S. Open. Del Potro beat Rafael Nadal in the semifinal before he denied Roger Federer a sixth straight title by beating the then world number one in a five set thriller. After that he made the final of the season-ending Barclays ATP World Tour Finals in London but fell to Nikolay Davydenko in the final, before his fourth round exit in Melbourne. Del Potro has already confirmed he will play in the Thailand Open in September, but now he faces a race against time to regain full fitness before the U.S. Open begins.","Juan Martin del Potro returns to training after recovering from wrist surgery .

"New York (CNN) -- Bail was set Wednesday at $500,000 for a New York  film student accused of slashing a cab driver's throat  after asking the driver if he was Muslim. Michael  Enright pleaded not guilty last month in the August attack, and the judge said then he would wait to set bail  for Enright until he was medically cleared from Bellvue Hospital Center's psychiatric ward,  where he was ordered for mental evaluation in early  September. The Manhattan district attorney's office said if bail is made,  Enright must wear a monitoring bracelet and  surrender his passport as well as adhere to an 8 p.m.  curfew. Enright is facing charges of  second-degree attempted murder as a hate crime, second-degree assault as a  hate crime, second-degree aggravated harassment as a hate crime, and  fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon in the August 24 incident, according to New York police. Cab driver Ahmed Sharif survived the attack. The Taxi Workers Alliance said Sharif, 43, a practicing Muslim originally from Bangladesh, was slashed across the neck, face, shoulder and hand. Bleeding profusely, Sharif escaped and flagged down a police officer, who arrested Enright. Authorities said Enright was intoxicated at the time of the incident; they found an empty bottle of scotch in a backpack he had with him. The attack occurred amid public debate over plans to build an Islamic cultural center and mosque to be called Park51 two blocks from the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center. Enright, 21, was a film student at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan. People who know him described him after his arrest as someone who worked to build bridges across religious and ethnic boundaries.  They were ""shocked and dumbfounded,"" said Robert Chase, executive director of Intersections International. Enright volunteered with the nonprofit group, which partially funded a trip he took in the spring to Afghanistan. As part of his thesis, Enright shot a film on American soldiers serving there, Chase said. CNN's Marina  Landis contributed to this report.","Defendant Michael  Enright's bail is set at $500,000 .

"(CNN) -- The eight people on a civilian cargo plane that crashed in the Afghan mountains near Kabul on Tuesday are presumed dead, a spokesman for Afghanistan's minister of transport said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said the crash occurred before 8 p.m. around 25 to 30 kilometers (15 to 18 miles) east of Kabul International Airport. Ros Mohammad, deputy minister of transport, said the crash took place around Mahipar Mountain east of the capital. A source from the Afghan air force said the cargo plane took off from Bagram air base and was landing at Kabul airport, which amounts to a 30- to 45-minute flight. The source wasn't authorized to speak about the matter and asked for anonymity. Preston Murray, president of Michigan-based National Air Cargo, said he could not specify the nationalities of those on board, but did not believe any to be American. The plane is owned and operated by Trans Afrique of Ghana, he said. National Air Cargo is a customer, he said. National Air Cargo received reports ""that the plane was on the radar and then it wasn't,"" Murray said. An ISAF statement said the plane was not an ISAF aircraft, and Lt. Col. John Dorrian, ISAF spokesman, said the aircraft was from Uganda. ""Early reports indicate the plane is an L-100 Hercules aircraft, the civilian equivalent of a military C-130,"" the statement said. ISAF said the airport is expected to remain open. Afghan and ISAF service members were conducting the search-and-rescue mission. The incident comes on the same day a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at a NATO helicopter after it landed in Kunar province. That strike killed an Afghan interpreter and wounded eight people -- seven NATO-led service members and an Afghan police officer. There were 26 people on the craft. Earlier this year, 44 people were killed when a plane crashed in the mountainous Kabul region. It had been en route in May from Kunduz to Kabul. The plane was carrying 38 passengers and six crew members when it crashed at 13,500 feet (4,100 meters).

"Editor's note: Journalist Karl Penhaul spent several weeks tracking the gangs of the Mexican underworld, the corrupt officials who support them and the cops trying to halt the violence. Mexico police round up gang suspects in Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas. CAMARGO, Mexico (CNN) -- There are no welcome signs on the approach to Camargo. It's a hardscrabble Mexican border town and home turf for ""Los Zetas,"" a gang of hitmen and corrupt former special forces cops on the bankroll of the Gulf Cartel. Local journalists explained if we went there we'd be getting ""tangled up in the hooves of the horse."" They said Zeta gunmen recently smashed one reporter's fingers with a hammer as a warning to the media to stay away. The plaza was deserted -- for a few minutes at least. Then the throb of engines broke the Sunday morning peace. Scores of pickup trucks with heavily tinted windows began circling. Occasionally a window would crack open. We were clearly being watched. A black SUV pulled up alongside the soda stand. One of the occupants stepped out. First I saw the ostrich skin cowboy boots, then the highly polished 9 mm pistol strapped to his side. It was loaded with a longer-than-usual ammunition clip, custom-made to pack extra bullets. It was a brazen flouting of Mexican law to carry a gun that way. No words. Not even a stare. But his message seemed unequivocal. Our visit to Camargo lasted just 20 minutes. Taking the strong hint, we immediately left town. Much as we wanted to explore the underbelly of the drug war raging in Mexico, it was clear the capos, or bosses, and their hired guns were in no mood to talk. Their business thrives best in the shadows. Our best chance of getting some insight was to track down a cast of peripheral characters who live in the gray areas, somewhere between the extremes of right and wrong. The hospitality was little better in nearby Miguel Aleman. Customers, even an argumentative drunk, fell silent as we ordered a beer in a dingy cantina. A couple of tired-looking prostitutes retreated to a far corner. They may have been down on their luck but they knew talking to outsiders wasn't worth the cost. Here the Zetas are well-known for enforcing their law of silence at gunpoint.  Watch Mexican cops on the hunt for gang members Â» . Along this stretch of the border Los Zetas are kings. From here their bloody reach stretches far across Mexico and deep into Central America. They run immigrant smuggling, drug trafficking, prostitution rackets, video piracy and local politics. In the glitzy industrial city of Monterrey, we met a marijuana dealer smoking his own merchandise in the bathroom of a dance club. The man, whom we can't name for his safety, explained how he had been recruited at gunpoint two years earlier by the Zetas to be what they call a ""landowner"" (terrateniente in Spanish) -- in charge of cocaine distribution in a handful of neighborhoods. He said Zeta gunmen bundled him into a truck and with assault rifles aimed at his head they gave him three options -- pay them $100,000, begin working for them or die. Over the next few days, he said, the same gunmen scared off or killed rival drug dealers, leaving him in charge of what he said was a $4,000-a-day business. It all ended, he said, when Mexican soldiers kicked down his door. He was never detained but his cover was blown. Local Zeta commanders thanked him for not ratting on them by giving him permission to retire from the business. But recently he's gone into business for himself selling $2 bags of pot. He realizes working independently of the Zetas may be fatal. ""Maybe I'm stupid or something, but I don't know how to do anything else. If they catch me it's simple, they'll kill me. It's just not allowed to work freelance,"" he said. An old friend of mine in Monterrey knew the marijuana peddler well and vouched for his story. He never made good on his promise to give us a recorded account. He went on a 24-hour drug binge. When we caught up with him again he was smoking crack, sweating profusely and paranoid his former paymasters would exact revenge. Mexico's tit-for-tat vendettas look like uncontrolled chaos. Mob assassins are no longer content with efficient execution-style killings. Sinaloa cartel hitmen regularly place pig masks on the faces of their Juarez cartel victims. And in a grim seasonal touch, killers in Juarez decapitated a cop and placed a Father Christmas hat on his severed head. But in a sidewalk cafe in Guadalajara, ""Jose"" explains there is a clearly defined set of narco-rules that must be followed. A small-time Latin American cocaine trafficker I've known for years introduced me to Jose. Jose is old school. He tells me he's been in the cocaine trade since the early 1980s almost since it began, has worked internationally and done a stretch in prison . ""From the outside it might look like the cartels are just going around killing people. But on the inside there's a code of conduct, rules. You might not want to kill somebody but you have to because it's all about respect,"" he said. ""This cannot work if there's no respect. Above all, the capos use logic to solve the problems."" Jose added that he believed groups of corrupt officials and law enforcement officers were using the militarization of the border region not as a means to crush the drug cartels but as a way of forcing them to pay a bigger slice of the drug profits as bribes. ""The authorities and the cartels use the rule of 10. By that I mean for every 10 kilos of cocaine we move, we have to give three to the authorities and keep seven for ourselves,"" he explained. ""When times are bad the authorities may arrest somebody or grab an entire consignment and that's a way for forcing up their percentage take."" Jose's assertion might seem like feverish conspiracy theory if it weren't for the growing list of Mexican officials, ranging from local cops and foot soldiers to generals and men at the highest levels of law enforcement, who've been busted for allegedly profiting from the drug trade. In November, Mexico's former drug czar was detained on suspicion that he may have accepted $450,000 a month in bribes from drug traffickers. He had been in charge of the attorney general's office that specializes in combating organized crime.","""Los Zetas"" gang of hitmen and ex-cops run rackets from U.S. border across Mexico .

"(CNN) -- A lesbian couple has applied to adopt a child after Florida's child advocacy agency announced it won't fight a court ruling that found the state's ban on such adoptions unconstitutional. Jennifer Haseman and Hillary Jovi, who were unaware of Tuesday's announcement by the state, called Family Services of Metro Orlando, central Florida's child protective contractor, to begin the process of adoption. The couple believed they could make their dream a reality after a September decision by the Third District Court of Appeal that lifted Florida's three-decade ban on gay adoption. ""We've wanted to adopt ever since we discussed wanting a family,"" said Jovi, who said she has had a 12-year relationship with Haseman. ""We always wanted to have our own children and adopt."" The couple, formerly from New York, had considered moving back there just for the opportunity to adopt a child. Both women have battled infertility. The Florida Department of Children and Families said any appeal by the state agency was likely to be unsuccessful following opinions from the appeal court and a circuit court judge in Miami. Gov. Charlie Crist ordered the department to stop enforcing the ban after the circuit court ruling. ""I don't think for us it is about sexual orientation so much as it is about a kid that deserves a second chance with a good parent or parents,"" said DCF spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner. The ACLU of Florida represented licensed foster parent Frank Martin Gill, who wanted to adopt two boys who had been placed in his care after the Department of Children and Families removed them from their home for neglect. He sued to have the adoption ban overturned. ""We are happy to hear that DCF wants to bring this case to an end and allow the Gill family to get on with their lives,"" said Howard Simon, ACLU of Florida executive director. But, the director says, the case is not yet final. ""What is needed now is a similar statement from Florida Attorney General Bill McCollum that will formally end this case and allow judges to decide -- on a case-by-case basis -- what is in the best interests of children."" Ryan Wiggins, spokeswoman for McCollum, said, ""We appreciate the announcement, and look forward to a conversation with DCF about what the next actions will be."" The attorney general office has until October 22 to file an appeal. Florida was the only remaining state to prohibit gay adoption. The state agency said Wednesday it has removed from adoption forms the question about an applicant's sexual orientation. Jovi, an event planner and Haseman, a restaurant manager, said Monday they plan to attend an orientation class as the first step to become approved for adoption. ""I think it's going to be a really, really, great thing to just be able to help a child that needs a place, a home and needs love,"" Haseman said. With the department's decision not to appeal, Gill has become the first openly gay person to adopt a child in Florida in more than 30 years, according to the Orlando Sentinel.","Couple files to adopt in Florida, hours after a state announcement on the issue .

"Harare, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- South African President Jacob Zuma has sent a delegation to neighboring Zimbabwe to rescue what appears to be a cracking power-sharing government formed last year by President Robert Mugabe and his former political foe, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Wednesday's visit to Harare by Zuma's team was prompted by an appeal Tsvangirai made to the South African leader -- who has a regional responsibility under the Southern African Development Community to mediate in Zimbabwe's power-sharing deal -- to help solve what he called a constitutional crisis. Last week, Tsvangirai publicly accused Mugabe of making unilateral decisions in the 20-month-old coalition government. As a result, Tsvangirai wants diplomats posted by Mugabe to the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland, and New York, the European Commission, South Africa, Sweden and Italy not to be accredited. Tsvangirai threw confusion into the coalition government after he said he would not recognize the legitimacy of some 10 ministers, five judges, the attorney general, chief of police and the head of the central bank head. The prime minister charged that Mugabe appointed all of them without the consensus required by Zimbabwe's constitution. Charles Nqakula, one of the three delegates from Pretoria, played down the latest developments in Zimbabwe. ""We are back here as part of our monitoring exercises to check with political parties here what has happened since the last [SADC] summit [in August],"" Nqakula said upon arrival in Zimbabwe on Wednesday. ""Our coming here is part of the broader task to monitor what is happening here."" He said that coming out of the SADC summit, ""there was a desire to check after at least a month ... to what extent the decisions of the summit had been carried forward."" ""We will hear from the people we are going to meet what decisions have been implemented,"" he said. Nqakula said the delegation would meet with Mugabe, Tsvangirai and Zimbabwe's deputy prime minister, Arthur Mutambara.","Visit to Zimbabwe was prompted by an appeal from Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai .

"(CNN) -- Newly-crowned Dunhill Links champion Martin Kaymer could prevent Lee Westwood from replacing Tiger Woods as the world's number one golfer. The German rose to fourth in the world on Monday after winning his third successive tournament on the European Tour at St Andrews, and now has the chance to overtake Woods, Westwood and American Phil Mickelson at the top of the game. Westwood failed to achieve the second-place finish which would have seen him end Woods' 279-week reign on Sunday, but the Englishman could still top the rankings on October 31 providing the American does not change his plans and play before then. However, Kaymer's decision to enter the Andalucia Valderrama Masters in Spain at the end of this month means the 25-year-old could yet be the one to take over from the off-form Woods. Victory there would mean August's winner of the U.S. PGA Championship becomes just the 12th player to top the rankings since they were introduced in 1986. Kaymer is the first player since Woods in 2006 to win three tournaments back-to-back, and the first golfer from Europe to do so since Englishman Nick Faldo in 1998. After his latest triumph, Kaymer told reporters he had no idea why he was enjoying such a good run of form. ""I was never expecting it and I don't really have an answer for why I am playing so well at the moment,"" he said. ""I've always played solid golf and my short game has improved big-time the last two years and especially the last few months."" The win came less than a week after Kaymer was part of the victorious European Ryder Cup team who beat America at Celtic Manor in Wales, where he played with Westwood. ""The way he played with me last week was absolutely amazing. He played so solidly,"" Kaymer said. ""His putting was good, chipping -- the entire game was fantastic. I really see him as a role model."" Westwood will now take a month-long break from the sport to recover from an ongoing calf injury, which clearly hampered his progress at the home of golf over the weekend. It is expected the 37-year-old will return for the season-ending championship in Dubai which starts on November 25.

"(CNN) -- Newly promoted Hercules pulled off the biggest win in their history by beating reigning champions Barcelona 2-0 at Camp Nou on Saturday. Paraguayan forward Nelson Haedo Valdez scored twice to give Hercules - back in the top-flight after a 13-year absence - a huge win. Despite Barcelona dominating proceedings debutant Valdez, signed from Borussia Dortmund, scored the first goal on 26 minutes and then another on 58 minutes. Barcelona were unbeaten at home last season as they retained the league title. Real Madrid beat Osasuna 1-0 at Santiago Bernabeu, after being held to a 0-0 draw in the first half. After the re-start Ricardo Carvalho neatly slotted a goal home when Cristiano Ronaldo missed from ten yards out, although he maintained his composure to find Carvalho. The win maintains Real Madrid's unbeaten start to the season. In the German Bundesliga Bayer Leverkusen were held to a 2-2 draw by a 10-man Hanover on Saturday, leaving Leverkusen in mid-table and Hanover third behind leaders Hoffenheim. Leverkusen's Michael Ballack was forced to limp off the field following a heavy tackle on his left knee. The 33-year-old came off after just 30 minutes, suffering a further set-back on his return from injury. Hanover were reduced to 10 men after just 36 minutes when Austrian defender Emanuel Pogatetz was shown a second yellow card and the subsequent red when he sent Leverkusen's Arturo Vidal flying with a dangerous tackle. Hamburg drew 1-1 at home to Nuremberg which leaves them second in the table. Stuttgart lost 2-1 at Freiburg to suffer their third defeat of the season. Ex-England manager Steve McClaren is still looking for his first win of the season as his Wolfsburg side lost 2-0 at Dortmund whose Japanese midfielder Shinji Kagawa scored his first Bundesliga goal. Hoffenheim continued their dream start to the season beating Schalke 2-0 on Friday to remain top of the table with three wins out of three. In Serie A champions Inter Milan secured their first victory of the season with a 2-1 success at home to Udinese on Saturday. Samuel Eto'o scored the winner after Antonio Floro Flores had cancelled out Lucio's early opener.","Newly promoted Hercules beat Barcelona 2-0 .

"(CNN) -- Brazil warmed up for next month's clash against Argentina with a 2-0 win over Ukraine in another friendly international on Monday night. Dani Alves and Alexandre Pato scored in each half to give coach Mano Menezes his third successive victory since taking over from Dunga following a disappointing World Cup campaign in South Africa. It was the first defeat in four matches for Ukraine's temporary coach Yuriy Kalitvintsev, who took over in August when Myron Markevych resigned, and was a low-key affair attracting just 13,000 spectators. The Euro 2012 co-hosts thought they had equalized just before halftime in the match in Derby -- a city with the largest Ukrainian population in England -- but Oleksandr Aliev's effort was ruled out. It was a successful return to the country for new Brazil captain Robinho, one of two survivors from the World Cup quarterfinal defeat by the Netherlands along with Alves, following his move from Manchester City to AC Milan. Alves and Pato both scored in last Thursday's 3-0 win over Iran in Abu Dhabi, and the Barcelona rightback broke the deadlock in the 25th minute when he volleyed home Robinho's cross past goalkeeper Andriy Dykan thanks to a deflection off Oleksandr Romanchuk. AC Milan forward Pato hit the post 10 minutes later as Ukraine were not punished for losing possession, with strike partner Carlos Eduardo firing over the bar from the rebound. Ukraine were missing veteran Andriy Shevchenko up front, but almost leveled when Aliev had the ball in the net only for the goal to be disallowed due to an off-the-ball incident involving Artem Milevskiy. Ruslan Rotan hit the post from distance five minutes after the break, but Brazil doubled the lead in the 64th minute when Pato took Eduardo's low cross, turned his man and fired past Dykan. Brazil next face an Argentina team reeling from a first-ever defeat by Japan in Tokyo last week, with the match to be played in Doha, Qatar on November 17. Argentina will next year host the Copa America tournament, with Brazil seeking to defend the title. In Monday's other international, Jamaica defeated Caribbean rivals Trinidad and Tobago 1-0 in Kingston thanks to a 19th-minute penalty from New York Red Bulls striker Dane Richards. Richards scored his second international goal after Eric Vernan was fouled as Jamaica followed up the 3-1 win in Macoya in August in the home-and-away series.","Dani Alves and Alexandre Pato score in second consecutive match for Brazil .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Eight NATO troops were killed in Afghanistan Thursday, bringing the number of foreign troop deaths in the past two days to 14, the International Security Assistance Force said. An improvised explosive device attack killed three service members in the west, and two died in an insurgent attack in the south. One died after an insurgent attack in the east, one died in an insurgent attack in the south and another was killed in an IED attack in the south. It's the first time since August 30 that so many international troops have been killed in hostile incidents in Afghanistan in a single day, according to CNN records. On that day, seven Americans, a Canadian and an Estonian were killed. On Wednesday, six foreign troops were killed. ISAF has not announced the nationalities of any of the recently slain, in line with policy leaving identification up to the victims' home countries. Forty-one coalition service members have died this October in Afghanistan so far. It's the deadliest year of the nine-year-old war for foreign troops. The number of coalition service members killed so far in 2010 now stands at 587. The highest monthly coalition death toll occurred in June, with 103 foreign troop deaths, a figure that includes Americans and service members other nations. In July, 65 Americans died, the highest monthly death toll for U.S. service members. The deaths come at a time when the war has become a subject of fierce debate in the United States and other countries that have contributed troops to the war effort. Gen. David Petraeus, who took command this summer as the top military official in Afghanistan, led the 2007-2008 campaign to stabilize Iraq after years of insurgent and sectarian warfare following the U.S. invasion of 2003. Meanwhile, Afghan and ISAF forces killed several insurgents and detained many others Wednesday in the Nahr-E Saraj district of Helmand province, ISAF reported Thursday.  And in Ghazni province, troops killed a Taliban senior leader and improvised explosive device expert, ISAF said.

"New York (Cnnmoney.Com) -- Once again, the high-profile Cadillac Escalade SUV is the car that thieves love to steal, according to the Highway Loss Data Institute. Each year, 10.8 out of every 1,000 late-model Escalades get stolen, broken into, or have parts ripped off. That's the highest rate of theft claims of any vehicle in America. The Escalade has topped the list since 2002. You may have heard that a lot of Toyota Camrys get stolen. They do. But it's only 1.6 out of every thousand. The institute looked only at cars from the most recent three model years. These cars all have the latest anti-theft technologies, including engine immobilizers that prevent hot-wiring. ""That won't stop a determined thief from loading a car on a flat-bed truck,"" said Russ Rader, the institute's spokesman. According to the institute, the top-ten car-criminal favorites, along with their ""theft claim frequency"" per 1,000 vehicles, are: . 1. Cadillac Escalade 10.8 . 2. Chevrolet Silverado 8.0 . 3. Dodge Charger 7.4 . 4. Chevrolet Avalanche 7.4 . 5. Infiniti G47 coupe 7.1 . 6. GMC Sierra Crew Cab 6.7 . 7. Nissan Maxima 6.5 . 8. Hummer H2 6.2 . 9. GMC Yukon XL 6.0 . 10. Chevrolet Tahoe 5.8 . This list excludes medium-duty work trucks, such as the Ford F-250. It also excludes the Dodge Charger Hemi, which the institute counted as a separate model with a theft rate of 7.1. If included, those vehicles would have ranked 2nd and 7th, respectively.","The Highway Loss Data Institute calculates the theft rate of recent models .

"(CNN)  -- Thierry Henry could face FIFA disciplinary action over his handball which helped France to qualify for the finals of the 2010 World Cup at the expense of Ireland. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told reporters in Cape Town that the Barcelona striker's ""blatant unfair play"" could land him in hot water. ""The FIFA disciplinary committee will open an investigation ... concerning the behavior of the player Thierry Henry,"" he said. ""It was blatant unfair play and was seen all around the world. I don't know the outcome of the disciplinary committee, let them make the decision. ""Fair play must be maintained in our game."" Blatter was speaking after an extraordinary meeting of the FIFA executive committee, which was convened to consider the refereeing controversy in the France - Ireland match, incidents surrounding the Algeria - Egypt playoff tie and matchfixing in Europe. It had been widely trailed that the FIFA executive would sanction the use of two extra officials behind both goal lines in World Cup. But Blatter said that the finals in South Africa was too soon to introduce the system which has been used in the second-tier European club tournament this year. ""The experiments with the Europa League shall go on into the knockout stages next year but it has been decided, for the World Cup 2010, there is no change in the refereeing: one referee, two assistants and a fourth official."" He went on to say that there would be further investigation into both video technology and additional referees. ""We shall have a look at technology or additional persons and this shall be done by a committee but not the referees committee alone, it will be done by the football, technical and medical committees, too,"" he added. Ireland were denied a place in the finals by a goal that should have been disallowed because Henry used his hand to control the ball before setting up William Gallas to score the aggregate decider in the second leg in the Stade de France. Ireland subsequently launched two appeals, the first for the match to be replayed, the second for them to be added to the line-up for the finals as the 33rd team. Both have been rejected, but Blatter was forced to apologize to the Irish for making public their supposedly private bid to be included as an extra team. Blatter put their request into the public domain in light-hearted comments made in Johannesburg, which left Irish football officials infuriated and insulted. ""I would like to express my regrets for the wrong interpretation of what I said. I regret what I have created and I'm sorry to the Ireland football confederation for these headlines going around the world,"" he said. ""It's a pity I communicated in this way. Sorry again.""","Thierry Henry face disciplinary action over his handball in World Cup playoff match .

"(CNN)  -- Commonwealth Games women's 100m winner Oludamola Osayomi has failed a doping test, organizers said on Monday. The Nigerian sprinter tested positive for a banned stimulant, Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell told reporters in New Delhi. Tests of Osayomi's B sample are being conducted and results will not be known until Wednesday. The result is the first positive result from 950 completed tests at the Games so far, Fennell said, and showed Osayomi had methylhexaneamine in her bloodstream. It is a substance used in nasal decongestants, and was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list this year -- having been at the center of the suspension of five Jamaican runners before the 2009 world athletics championships. Osayomi, 24, was handed the gold medal in Thursday's race after Australian Sally Pearson was disqualified for a false start. If Osayomi is disqualified Natasha Mayers of St Vincent and the Grenadines would claim gold, England's Kathryn Endacott would gain silver and Bertille Atangana of Cameroon would collect the bronze medal. Mayers has already served a two-year ban for doping, having tested positive for testosterone in 2005. Meanwhile, Pearson bounced back from her disappointment by winning gold in her main event, the 100m hurdles, on Monday. The 24-year-old followed up her silver medal at the 2008 Olympics as she set a new Games record time of 12.67 seconds after comfortably heading off Canada's Angela Whyte and New Zealand's Andrea Miller, who snatched bronze with a dip at the line. In another women's event mired in controversy, Cydonie Mothersill won a historic first Commonwealth gold medal for the Cayman Islands with victory in the 200m. The 32-year-old, who was born in Jamaica, claimed her first major medal and the islands' second of any type following Kareem Streete-Thompson's long-jump bronze in 2002. The final had been scheduled to be raced on Sunday, but was postponed after Cyprus appealed following the disqualification of hot favorite Eleni Artymata, but failed to have the runner reinstated. Artymata, eighth at last year's world championships, won her semifinal but was ruled to have marginally, but illegally, run outside her lane. Hosts India also made a breakthrough at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, with Krishna Poonia heading a clean sweep in the women's discus in the absence of world champion Dani Samuels. Poonia's gold gave India a first track and field gold since 1952, and only second in Games history, while Harwant Kaur won silver and Seema Antil bronze. Kenya's Nancy Langat also profited from the absence of a world champion as she completed a middle-distance double with victory in the women's 800m. With South Africa's injured Caster Semenya ruled out of the Games, which finish on Thursday, Langat had little trouble in following up her 1,500m triumph with victory from New Zealand's Nikki Hamblin and Canada's Diane Cummins as teammate Winny Chebet missed out on a silver medal due to a late fall. Kenyans continued their winning run in the men's steeplechase, which the country has dominated since 1990, with African champion Richard Mateelong claiming a surprise gold from world champion Ezekiel Cheboi and Olympic winner Brimin Kipruto. Uganda's Moses Kipsiro sealed a long-distance double as he added 10,000m gold to his 5,000m success, with Kenya's Daniel Salel and Joseph Birech second and third. World and Olympic pole vault champion Steve Hooker retained his title as Australia stayed well clear at the top of the medals table on day nine with 64 golds and 143 overall. India were next on 30 golds and 81 overall, with England third on 27/111 from Canada 23/66. In field hockey, women's champions Australia beat England 1-0 to set up a final clash with New Zealand, who defeated South Africa by the same score. In diving, Malaysian teen Pandelela Pamg prevented Australians Melissa Wu and Alexandra Croak from adding to their 10m synchro gold. The 17-year-old, bronze medallist at last year's World Aquatics Championships, won the 10m platform title to leave the duo second and third. Canada's Alexandre Despatie won his eighth Commonwealth gold since 1998, with the 25-year-old following up Sunday's 1m springboard success with victory in the 3m event from compatriot Reuben Ross and Australia's Grant Nel. Despatie will seek another medal when he teams up with Ross in Tuesday's 3m synchro competition. In shooting, Georgios Achilleos of Cyprus retained his men's men's Skeet pairs title with new partner Andreas Chasikos from Canada's Jason Caswell and Richard McBride. Scotland's Jen McIntosh and Kay Copland won gold in the women's 50m Rifle Prone pairs event, edging out England's Michelle Smith and Sharon Lee after finishing on the same score.","Women's 100m champion Oludamola Osayomi tests for banned stimulant .

"(CNN) -- A Republican candidate running for U.S. Congress says his past donning of a Nazi outfit was part of a historical lesson -- and defended his background in military re-enactments. Rich Iott, a Tea Party favorite running for election in Ohio's 9th Congressional District, explained his position during an interview on CNN's ""AC 360"" Monday night. Iott participated in World War II re-enactments for several years in the past decade and created a German alter ego. He has said he started participating in the events as a way to bond with his son. Iott has also participated in Civil War and World War I re-enactments. ""The whole purpose of historical re-enacting is to educate people one-on-one,"" Iott said. ""And that is done by going out and participating in re-enactments."" When asked whether he thought the men being impersonated were ""valiant men,"" Iott said, ""I don't think we can sit here and judge that today. We were not there the time they made those decisions. Were there bad people? Absolutely. Were there atrocities committed? Absolutely there were. There are people that want to deny the Holocaust ever happened in this country and around the world."" The website for Iott's re-enactment group -- which impersonates members of the 5th SS Panzerdivision, Wiking -- does not mention the Holocaust directly. According to Wiking's website, it is a nonprofit group with a ""common interest in the German side of the war and want to tell the story of the average combat soldier of the German military."" ""Racism or any type of embracement of Nazi ideology of any kind is strictly prohibited by this re-enactment unit,"" the website reads. But the website does not mention what historians have said about the division -- that the group was involved in war crimes and atrocities, including the death marches and massacres of Jews in the spring of 1945. When asked if Iott knew of the atrocities associated with the SS, the candidate replied, ""What happened in Germany during the second World War is absolutely one of the low points in human history. In fact ... [the website] talks about what happened and that we don't support that. We don't support the political or the ideological motives of that time. We're talking strictly about the history. It's important for us to remember that history."" Iott's political opponents were quick to condemn him as a ""Nazi enthusiast."" ""It's an unbelievably disturbing story here about this Nazi enthusiast,"" Ryan Rudominer, national press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has said.

"(CNN) -- Despite being allowed to tell her husband he won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, the wife of Liu Xiaobo was detained in her apartment in Beijing, China, according to a human rights group and her attorney. Liu Xia has not been charged with a crime, but ""appears to be under a de facto house arrest,"" said Beth Schwanke, legislative counsel for the U.S.-based group Freedom Now. She was taken to see Liu Xiaobo in a prison several hundred miles northeast of Beijing, Schwanke said, and tell him of the honor. Upon hearing he had received the peace prize, Schwanke said, Liu Xiaobo began to cry, and said, ""This is for the martyrs of Tiananmen Square."" But upon return to Beijing, Liu Xia was not allowed to leave her apartment, Schwanke said. No one is allowed in, and her telephone is believed to be ""destroyed,"" Schwanke said. Liu Xia has been able to post to some Twitter accounts, said Schwanke, who called the action ""absolutely outrageous."" ""Brothers, I have come back,"" said a Twitter post purportedly from Liu Xia. ""I have been under house arrest since the 8th and don't know when I'll get to see everyone again. They broke my mobile phone so I can no longer make or receive calls."" ""I saw Xiaobo, who learned about his winning the prize in prison on the evening of the 9th,"" she wrote. ""We'll talk about the future later."" Since her husband was named as a 2010 Nobel laureate, Liu Xia has gained 1,000 new Twitter followers. ""Xia can't use her mobile phone anymore,"" tweeted Chinese dissident Wang Jinbo. ""I got in touch through some other means. She can't leave home -- they've tightened the security outside."" He said Liu Xia can tweet -- ""a little freedom."" ""Liu Xia is under enormous pressure,"" said Dr. Yang Jianli, a member of Liu Xiaobo's defense team and a human rights specialist with Freedom Now. ""We hope that world leaders will immediately condemn this shameful act by the Chinese government and urge Liu Xia's immediate and unconditional release."" See more of CNN's special coverage of China . Beijing did not comment immediately on the report of Liu Xia's detention, and the official news agency Xinhua was silent on the subject. On Friday, Liu Xia said she was packing to visit her husband under the surveillance of police officers, who promised to take her to visit Liu Xiaobo Saturday. She said she could not wait to see him to tell him he is this year's peace laureate. Liu Xiaobo won the prize Friday, but news of the win has been blacked out in China, with no mention of it on Chinese media. The same censorship applies to Chinese blogs, and authorities have blocked the Nobel Peace Prize section of the official Nobel website. At least two international television networks -- CNN and BBC -- were blacked out as the Nobel committee announced the winner on Friday, and CNN's reports on Liu remained blacked out for most of the day. Liu was sentenced in 2009 to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion of state power. He is the co-author of Charter 08, a call for political reform and human rights, and was an adviser to the student protesters at Tiananmen Square in 1989. His wife called the Nobel Prize ""an affirmation of what he has fought for."" Schwanke said Liu Xiaobo is doing well in prison -- much better physically than when he was held in solitary confinement. Mentally, he remains very strong, she said, adding that this prison sentence is his fourth and ""he knows this is necessary to secure democracy and human rights in China."" Freedom Now attorneys, as Liu's international counsel, will leverage international political and legal support while his attorneys in China will continue to work on his behalf in Beijing, she said. Liu Xiaobo's longtime friend Pu Zhiqiang said the prize may not help Liu right now, but it will have effects for the future. ""In the long run, it will leave a legacy that is sure to help bring democratic reform and freedom to China, that will far outlast Liu's life,"" Pu told CNN outside the gates of Liu's apartment complex. The Chinese government was angry at the win, calling it ""blasphemy against the peace prize"" that could harm relations between China and Norway, where the Norwegian Nobel Committee is located. ""Liu Xiaobo is a convicted criminal sentenced to jail by Chinese justice. His acts are in complete contradiction to the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said. Human rights groups like Amnesty International, world leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama, and governments around the world all praised the awarding of the prize to Liu, with many calling on the Chinese government to free him. CNN's Brian Walker and Steven Jiang contributed to this report.","NEW: Liu Xiaobo: ""This is for the martyrs of Tiananmen Square""

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Japan's main opposition party has filed a protest with search-engine giant Google, urging it to delete from its mapping service the Chinese name for a cluster of disputed islands. The islands in the East China Sea are known as the Senkaku in Japan and as the Diaoyu in China. ""It is clear that the Senkaku Islands are under the effective control of Japan in both history and the international law. Therefore, there is no territorial dispute to be resolved over the islands,"" the Liberal Democratic Party said Wednesday. ""It is clearly wrong to list the names as if a territorial dispute exists with China in this area. We strongly call you to delete it as soon as possible,"" the party said to Google. Asked about the LDP's move, Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said, ""The LDP's action was totally upright. If necessary, the Japanese government will also take action together."" His ministry ""will lodge a protest within a few days,"" he said. Google, based in the United States, was not immediately available for comment. Beijing says the Diaoyu Islands and most of the South China Sea belong to China, disputing neighboring countries' claims. The clash over territorial waters and islands -- and the natural resources that go with them -- is a flash point in the Asia-Pacific region. Last month, China and Japan clashed over Japan's arrest of a Chinese fishing captain. The battle escalated into diplomatic threats by Beijing, the suspension of diplomatic talks and canceled trips between the nations. ""If you read history documents, Chinese first discovered the island and put it in effective administration,"" Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Jiang Yu said at the time. Chinese state-run media also has repeatedly run articles claiming China's ""indisputable sovereign rights"" to the islands. Japan late last month freed the fishing captain, who returned to a hero's welcome in China. Critics blasted Japan's government for backtracking, with some saying it had put business interests first.","The islands belong to Japan, the Liberal Democratic Party says .

The effort was part of a larger plan to restructure the mining industry to  prevent deadly accidents and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, Xinhua reported,  citing the National Energy Administration (NEA). China has one of the world's deadliest records for miners, with poor safety  standards accounting for thousands of deaths each year.

"Editor's note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and website based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. London, England (VBS.TV) -- In April this year I embedded with the elite soldiers of the 2nd Battalion British Parachute Regiment at their training facility in Thetford, United Kingdom. We went there to film the British army's much-talked-about, multimillion pound ""replica Afghanistan village."" The focus of the piece was to be on the younger members of the battalion. Some of them are as young as 18 and only months away from their first visit to Helmand province in September 2010. The majority of British casualties are all recorded in that area. I'd heard about the Afghan village training facility from an ex-Para turned photographer called Stuart Griffiths. A couple of years ago, Vice Magazine published a photo essay in which he visited the homes of badly injured soldiers returned from Iraq or Afghanistan. Perhaps more shocking than the horrific injuries the soldiers had sustained was the lack of support of these men from the British government of the time -- particularly those who suffered psychological problems as a result of combat shock. Stuart served his time in the Paras on tours of Northern Ireland in the late 80s to early 90s. But after being discharged he fell on hard times. He became homeless and spent a long time wandering the streets of London. He slept in cardboard boxes in doorways, often coming across fellow army veterans who faced a similar lack of support and sympathy from society, the government or the army. Happily, Stuart managed to get himself off the streets and, inspired by the stories of his fellow homeless veterans, became a campaigner of sorts for veterans rights, using his photography. His story and those of other ex-Paras is now available to watch in a moving British documentary called ""Isolation."" A week before we set off for the embed, I asked Stuart what kind of experience we were letting ourselves in for and he said: ""Not only are the Parachute Regiment Britain's most elite soldiers, they are the most brutal of British troops. That means the rest of the British army are simply in awe of them. I would say around 90 per cent of the SAS (the British equivalent of the Special Forces) comes from the Paras. And so the troops you are going to be sleeping next to every night are some of the hardest men in the world."" ""Recently what's happened is that many former veterans have had a ""call to arms"" and returned to the forces again. Life in civvy (civilian) street has been a huge disappointment for many of these guys. Once you've fought 'in-theater' a number of times it's really hard for you to come back and fit in with the hum-drum of modern life. Especially if you're a Para. They miss the camaraderie and the discipline and the action that you get when you're in combat."" See the rest of Afghanistan in the UK at VBS.TV . ""When Afghanistan first kicked off, all three battalions of the Paras were sent straight there because of their reputation for violence and bravery. I remember it was in Helmand 2006 that Afghanistan became very hairy indeed. The Parachute Regiment were there when it became very intense and at the time a Member of Parliament called John Reid was quoted as saying, 'I'd be quite happy that a single shot is not fired in Afghanistan.' In reality the Parachute Regiment were firing off more rounds in Helmand than the entire Korean war!"" Grinning nervously, I asked him if there's anything else I should know and he looked at me and said, ""They all drink rivers of lager."" Before we set off to meet the Paras, Stuart introduced us to a young man named Richard Dare who'd been a private in the Royal Anglians. Richard had a significant part of his brain blown out of his head by a mortar attack and was slowly rehabilitating himself at his home in a small town near Leicestershire. Richard talked to us about his love for the army and for war. The severe injuries to his brain didn't seem to change his love for army life one iota. The more we spoke to him, the more we knew we had to include him in our film. But first we had to go meet the Paras. With the help of my co-producer Jason Mojica, we packed two small cameras into our bags and traveled to the middle of the British countryside to try and ingratiate ourselves with the most brutal soldiers in the whole of the British army. It all started off nice and civilized. We were met on the door by a dashing officer who arranged for a private to show us our room -- a basic little number in the middle of the barracks which, while not five star, would certainly meet our needs for the week. I remember feeling pretty pleased with ourselves that we'd been given this amazing access, thinking we'd have carte blanche to wander around and check out the comings and goings of the most elite units in the world. ""Ah,"" we thought, ""This should be an informative and relaxing few days in the countryside. I don't know what we were worried about at all."" Soon we were put in jeep, driven an hour-and-a-half away to a gloomy brick building in the middle of nowhere and told that the next time we slept in a bed would be in five days time. As we stepped out of the van about 200 Para troops stared at us with eyes that said: ""Who are these wimps?"" The dark fell fast. A cold wind started blowing and I suddenly realized we'd left all our warm clothes in the barracks miles away. Then the sergeant major introduced himself and told us to get in line with the rest of the troops. And off we marched into the night.","VBS embeds with esteemed, aggressive British army unit .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- In a blow to efforts to keep direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians from faltering, the Israeli government is planning to construct new housing units in East Jerusalem, Israeli and U.S. sources confirmed Friday. Israeli Army radio reported earlier that the Israeli Housing and Construction Ministry issued a bid for 238 houses as part of a larger tender for housing construction in the country. The report said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was aware of the process, and that the American government had been notified. Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of not being identified by name, told CNN that Israel had notified the United States of the plan, but they added there was no agreement from Washington that it should go ahead. ""This was in no way done with U.S. approval,"" one official said. ""The government of Israel informed us to the intent to announce new tenders, and at every opportunity we urged the Israelis not to proceed."" An Israeli official speaking on condition of not being identified by name also said Israel told the United States of its intention. A spokesman for Netanyahu would not comment on the report. Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat condemned the move, saying that the Israeli prime minister has chosen ""settlements over peace."" ""We hold him responsible for undermining the direct negotiations, and I call upon the U.S. and other members of the international community to condemn this act and to hold the Israeli government responsible for the derailment of the direct negotiations,"" Erakat said. The issues of housing construction in East Jerusalem and West Bank settlement building have been major sticking points in the newly revived direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians.The move would represent the first tender for East Jerusalem construction since March, when the Israeli government announced the construction of 1,600 housing units in East Jerusalem while U.S. Vice President Joseph Biden was visiting Israel. That announcement strained relations between Washington and the government of Netanyahu. The new East Jerusalem units would be built in the neighborhoods of Pisgat Ze'ev and Ramot, which are home to thousands of Jewish residents. The two neighborhoods are in the northern part of the city, but commonly considered part of East Jerusalem because they are located east of the Green Line, the armistice line that separated Israel from Jordan when Jordan controlled East Jerusalem and the West Bank prior to 1967. Israel seized East Jerusalem from Jordan during the Six Day War in 1967 and considers it part of its sovereign capital, a claim not recognized by many in the international community. Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state. Also Friday, a report on Egypt's state-run news agency MENA said Egyptian Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit raised the possibility of the Arab League calling for a Palestinian state to get a seat at the U.N. General Assembly. Such a move would bolster the Arab League's call for full international recognition of a Palestinian state. CNN's Elise Labott contributed to this story.","NEW: U.S., Israeli sources confirm Israel provided advance notice of plans .

"Vienna, Austria (CNN) -- Autumn 1960 in Baghdad. Five heads of state sign on the dotted line to alter the course of energy for decades to come. Wednesday, as the OPEC oil cartel celebrates its 50th anniversary, its 12 members sit atop just more than three quarters of the world's proven oil reserves -- more than 1 trillion barrels of crude. While there has not been any independent verification of that number, OPEC's secretary-general says it is something for which global markets can plan. ""A trillion plus -- the reserve is very, very accurate,"" Abdalla Salem El Badri told CNN, ahead of the regular Thursday meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. ""We know the numbers; we put this number in our data. We distribute the numbers and we are sure that our proven reserves are more than a trillion."" With oil recently hitting a five-month high of $83 a barrel, the Vienna meeting is less about setting a target price and more about compliance with production quotas and future planning. The former has always been a challenge, since the 12 members try to jockey for market share and fill their domestic coffers when prices are historically high. According to OPEC estimates, compliance by member states is running at about 57 percent, well below the 80-percent level in the spring of 2009. It's because as the economy recovers, there has been more demand for oil, so OPEC members produce above their assigned allocations. OPEC updated its daily global demand for crude this week ahead of the gathering, saying it will average 85.59 million barrels a day this year for a gain of just 1.3 percent on the year before. The year 2011 is not a great deal more promising, with OPEC saying demand will rise only 1.2 percent next year. These numbers are nearly in line with those from the International Energy Agency. So in this tepid recovery scenario, ministers are not eager to rock the boat. If they can keep oil prices in the range of $70-85 a barrel, where they have been for the better part of a year, their priorities for domestic infrastructure development can be met without stifling global growth. According to the Center for Global Energy Studies in London, in the current pricing scenario, the 12 OPEC member states will bring in $625 billion dollars this year, again historically high for the cartel. The challenge is not so much now, but in the medium term. Ministers here are talking about spare capacity -- basically the ability to produce more oil when demand justifies such action. That demand is not expected in the next 18 months, but certainly in the next two to three years, because of the growth of China and, less so, India. Most of the spare capacity today sits in Saudi Arabia, which led a drive to take 4.2 million barrels off the market in the autumn of 2008, when prices went from $147 down to $33. It is not clear, here at OPEC's new headquarters and within the lobbies of the hotels where the delegates are staying, that members are re-investing at a pace to respond to the potential challenge in the near term. In the medium term, there is also the serious issue of in-fighting between long-term rivals Iran and Iraq. On October 4, Iraq upgraded its reported proven reserves to 143 billion barrels -- a sudden rise of 24 percent. Long neglected under the rule of Saddam Hussein and sanctions that targeted the energy sector, oil exploration in Iraq suffered immensely over the past two decades. Iraq has aspirations to challenge Saudi Arabia over the next decade and produce 12 million barrels a day. One week after Iraq's declaration, Iran upped the stakes and said that its own proven reserves suddenly surged 9 percent, to just more than 150 billion barrels -- not by accident higher than Iraq. As one veteran oil executive said here during a conversation, this verbal jostling is ""silly and lacks credibility."" The face of OPEC for more than a quarter of a century, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's oil minister from 1962 to 1986, suggested an independent third party analysis of OPEC's reserves. ""We have to make a study by some people outside the countries you've mentioned,"" Yamani told CNN at his home near Geneva, Switzerland. ""I don't know whether they exaggerated or they did not. I want, I need a neutral (analysis)."" During Yamani's time and through the mid-1990s, the in-fighting within OPEC was legendary. Member states would convene at top hotels in all corners of the world with displays of wealth and meetings that could last a week or longer. That era has passed, and at 50, the institution is much more business-like with meetings lasting no more than a day. After its hard-fought gains over the past decade to provide some predictability, many here hope that some within the organization don't go back to their previous ways.","OPEC ministers meet Thursday in Vienna to discuss oil prices .

"(CNN)  -- It was Pakistan's birthday on August 14, and no one celebrated. The monsoon floods that engulfed most of the country and affected 20 million people have added yet another burden of misery onto the shoulders of the average Pakistani. More than 4 million people are homeless. Livestock, crops and livelihoods were  destroyed. How far this once-proud nation has fallen. In Urdu, Pakistan means the ""land of the pure."" It reflects the noble intentions of its creators to build a nation that enshrined the best of Islamic principles. Unfortunately, that nobility has given way to chaos because of bad luck, incompetent political leaders, corruption and religious extremism. Pakistan may be a world away from the United States, but instability feeds the extremism that fuels terrorism, so we ignore this crisis at our peril. To find the path forward, we must look back to the past. During the 1970s, my father packed up our family of five and moved us to Pakistan. He believed Pakistan had higher standards of early schooling and stronger social values than his adopted home of England. Soon after, Russian tanks rumbled into Afghanistan and then came wave after wave of Afghan refugees. By the mid '80s, the full impact of the war waging next door came home to Pakistan. The U.S. priority was to evict the Russians from Afghanistan at any cost. Pakistan followed along. As a result, educating the masses, dealing with a sea of refugees, nurturing democracy, developing infrastructure and eradicating Afghan heroin all took second place. The Pakistan my father brought us home to experience was disappearing before our eyes. This was a defining moment. Instead of focusing on its own problems, it chose instead to fight the war for the West, and 30 years later, Pakistan is still paying for this decision. After Russia withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, the Americans walked away. But Pakistan couldn't. Growing unrest and infighting in Afghanistan gave the Taliban an opportunity to step in. The only thing that mattered to the Taliban was how quickly and crudely the practitioners could inflict their horrifying version of Islam on the Afghan people. Then, all hell broke loose on September 11, 2001. Since 9/11, Pakistan has supported America's intervention in Afghanistan, the right decision but one fraught with controversy. It has torn Pakistan into factions and triggered suicide bombings. Even before the monsoon hit, the country was an economic, political and social disaster. Can Pakistan be saved? I believe it can, but the fortunes of this ailing nation can only be changed with America's help. America may not have intended to hurt Pakistan, but it's clear that Pakistan's support for U.S. policy contributed to its decline. The good news is that today there is real opportunity for change. Pakistan needs America's help. America needs a stable Pakistan. The United States was the first nation to offer aid after the flooding disaster, pledging $150 million. This is a positive first step in a much-needed long-term reconstruction plan for Pakistan. But as important as the money is, ensuring that it's spent on the right things is even more critical. The Pakistan government needs to focus on three things to stop the country's downward spiral: education, infrastructure and security. Educating Pakistan is not a matter of choice, but of utmost necessity. The literacy rate for men is 61 percent, and for women it's 32 percent. Ignorance breeds poverty and extremism. Education can help break that cycle. Funding must be in place to teach every child to read and write. Educating the country's Muslim leaders is just as important. These mullahs interpret the Quran for the people, and often they do so in an uninformed, uneducated way that distorts the true teachings of Islam. A national program to certify these religious leaders is needed to address this most pressing challenge. As for infrastructure, what little was there has been washed away. The roads are a mess, electricity goes out most days and not enough food is produced. The failure of the government to deliver on the basics has demoralized the population and dampened the spirits of its entrepreneurs. Pakistan has to fix the electrical grid and improve its agricultural sector. The United States could help by opening its doors to Pakistani exporters and embarking on programs to share knowledge and help Pakistani industrialists grow their companies. In terms of security, with Afghanistan at war on one side and the barely held truce with India on the other, Pakistan needs to secure its borders, ignore the problems of its neighbors and focus internally. This means militarizing its border on the Afghan side and closing it to all but legitimate trade traffic. The core source of strife with India is the 63-year-old dispute over Kashmir, where in the past two decades, more than 80,000 Kashmiris have been killed. If America were to assist both countries in solving this issue, it would go a long way to repairing the Pakistan-India relationship. Education, infrastructure and security: Pakistan must focus on these areas with laser-like intensity and exhibit courage and vision to raise its people out of despair. I believe in Pakistan, as my father did. And with America's support and investment, someday Pakistan may even be able to dream again of achieving its noble destiny as the ""land of the pure."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sharjeel Kashmir.","Sharjeel Kashmir: Even before floods, Pakistan was an economic, political, social mess .

"(CNN) -- The label on the package claimed that it contained T-shirts and baby toys. When customs officials in Sydney scanned the parcel, they found five pythons and two venomous tarantulas. But when customs officials in Sydney X-ray scanned the parcel, they found instead five pythons and two venomous tarantulas. On Tuesday, authorities raided the house in Sydney to which the parcel had been addressed. Officials seized evidence but expect to file charges later, the customs agency said. Importing live animals without a permit is illegal in Australia and can yield a 10-year prison sentence and a fine of 110,000 Australian dollars ($92,000 U.S.). The parcel was sent from the United States last week, but officials would not say specifically where it had been mailed from. The snakes were wrapped within white calico bags and the spiders were packed in clear plastic containers, the customs agency said. The creatures were later killed because they posed a quarantine risk, the agency said in a press release.

"(CNN) -- Johnnie Tuitel, a professional motivational speaker who has flown nearly half a million miles, is no stranger to airline trouble. Even the most savvy of business travelers, like Tuitel, are not spared inconveniences due to delays, cancellations and mechanical failure. But Tuitel experienced something new last month. For the first time in his 20-year career, he said, he was ordered off a plane that had been cleared for takeoff for what could be called his own mechanical failure. Tuitel is wheelchair-bound because of cerebral palsy, a condition he has managed to turn into a source of inspiration for the national audiences he addresses regularly. ""My first reaction was to worry about my family's safety,"" Tuitel said about the request for him to get off the plane. ""I've got kids, my father's 78 years old and not in good health; I thought, 'They're going to tell me something I don't want to hear'"" They did, but it was of a different sort: He was told he was removed from the plane because of his physical condition. ""Their argument was if something were to happen, I can't help myself or somebody else, which is an assumption first of all. Second of all, the people that made the decision are not medical doctors,"" said Tuitel, 47, of East Grand Rapids, Michigan. ""They basically told me I was too disabled to fly and I had to fly with a companion and I had to purchase that companion's ticket,"" he told HLN's ""Prime News."" The airline, US Airways, said he was ordered off the flight for his own safety. ""He did not appear to have the ability to assist himself in evacuating in the event of an emergency,"" said Michelle Mohr, a US Airways spokeswoman. ""He appeared to have a lot of difficulty moving."" Tuitel had been on a US Airways flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Kansas City, Missouri, where he had a late-September speaking engagement. Tuitel said he had looked into what legal courses were available to him. The Air Carrier Access Act outlines how airlines should deal with people with disabilities, but it is unclear whether US Airways' actions violated the act's provisions. But afterwards, he told ""Prime News"" that  he would not sue. Instead, he said, he would prefer to approach the matter from a civil rights standpoint. ""It's against the law to stop me from traveling for a specific reason, and if I'm already on the plane, they violated my civil rights. It's like telling Rosa Parks you can't sit on the bus,"" Tuitel said. ""I'm not angry. I was just embarrassed because I couldn't do my job."" US Airways' official policy on disabled passengers stipulates that ""for safety-related reasons, if a passenger has a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft, the airline requires that the passenger travel with a safety assistant to assist the passenger to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency evacuation,"" Mohr said. ""Safety is our number one priority and we did not feel it was safe for Mr. Tuitel to fly that day,"" she said. Tuitel said that, after he was escorted off the flight, he booked a seat on Delta Air Lines and had no problems traveling alone on that flight. The airline did not contact him until nearly three weeks later, Tuitel contends, after stories began to emerge about the incident. Its only offer at that time, he said, was to reimburse him for the flight. He declined. But Friday, as the story spread to more media outlets, Mohr said US Airways' ""customer relations team had an extremely productive discussion"" with Tuitel. ""We asked Mr. Tuitel if he might be interested in working with us as a sounding board to help us continue to work toward improving our service for our customers with disabilities,"" she said. Tuitel confirmed they had ""a very productive talk."" ""They do want to right this wrong and they do want to work with me,"" he said. ""And I am hopeful -- don't want to sound cynical but it is a big company -- I am hopeful we can come up with a solution that won't only work for the two of us but will make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone with a disability in the future."" Rich Donovan, who is on the board of trustees of United Cerebral Palsy and also has the disease, didn't see the incident as one of negligence or an intent to discriminate on the part of US Airways. He attributed Tuitel's experience to a lack of training and a lack of clarity about policies and how they're applied to disabled travelers. ""There's a general lack of understanding of disability amongst the entire travel industry, and I think that's simply because they look at it as a compliance issue, rather than a customer-service issue,"" said Donovan, who is the chief investment officer of IPS Capital. Tuitel said he wants to make sure this doesn't happen to other disabled passengers. ""I don't want a little boy with a disability not have the opportunity to go somewhere. I don't want a young girl with a disability going out for her first job interview by herself to be told she can't fly in an airplane,"" Tuitel said. Donovan said he hopes this incident will serve as a learning experience for airlines and make customer service better. ""I think some dialogue and some handwringing and some getting down into the weeds here is what needs to happen so that this stuff doesn't occur again,"" he said. CNN's Miguel Susana and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.","Johnnie Tuitel was removed from a plane because he was deemed to need too much aid .

"(CNN) -- The attorney for former Liberian President Charles Taylor accused the former agent for supermodel Naomi Campbell of lying in her testimony at an international court Tuesday. Courtenay Griffiths said Carole White's account of Campbell receiving ""blood diamonds"" from Taylor's men was ""a complete pack of lies."" White has been testifying at the war crimes trial of Taylor, who prosecutors allege funded a brutal civil war in Sierra Leone using so-called blood diamonds, or those that have been mined in conflict zones and used to fund the fighting. White was with Campbell for a dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela in South Africa in 1997, which Taylor also attended. At the end of the dinner and before the guests returned to the presidential guest lodge, White said she heard a discussion about getting diamonds to Campbell later that night. Taylor was present for ""at least part"" of the discussion, she said. Farrow: Campbell said diamond was from Taylor . Late that night, before she or Campbell had gone to bed, White said men in suits threw pebbles at her second-floor window to get her attention. They said they had a gift for Campbell. She said she went to Campbell's room and told her, but Griffiths disputed her account. ""I suggest you're a liar,"" he told White in court. ""And I suggest that this account of what happened that night is a complete fabrication."" Continuing the story, White said she and Campbell went downstairs and opened the doors of the guest lodge to let the men in. ""I think she was quite excited that, finally, these diamonds had arrived,"" White said of Campbell. Q&A: Africa's 'blood' diamond shame . The supermodel testified last week that two men knocked on her door while she was sleeping and gave her a pouch, saying it was a gift. She said she opened the pouch the next morning to find ""dirty-looking stones"" that turned out to be diamonds. White testified Tuesday, however, that that account didn't make sense, because the men needed access through the main lodge door before knocking at a guest's room, and there had been no one else downstairs to let them in. It was 1 or 2 a.m. and no staff or guards were downstairs in the guest lodge, she said. Griffiths asked White whether she told her famous client that she shouldn't have accepted a gift from two strange men in the middle of the night. White said she didn't do that until the morning. Naomi Campbell's friend turns over diamonds to police . ""When I woke up in the morning, I thought about it and decided that I definitely knew it was very illegal to take diamonds out of South Africa,"" she said. ""I don't know how I knew that, but I knew it, and so I had a conversation with Naomi -- most likely in her bedroom because I would have been getting her up -- and I told her that I didn't think that those diamonds should go out of South Africa."" White said she suggested Campbell give the diamonds to a charity. Campbell testified last week that she did not know the diamonds were from Taylor. She said she passed the stones to a friend, Jeremy Ratcliffe, a trustee of the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund. She said she asked him to use the stones in a charity auction to raise money for underprivileged children. The Nelson Mandela Children's Fund denied last week that it had ever received diamonds from Campbell. A police official testified Friday that Ratcliffe had given the diamonds to South African police hours after Campbell testified about them. Taylor, 62, was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the civil war in Sierra Leone, fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior and were often instructed to rape and plunder. Naomi Campbell testifies at Taylor war crimes trial . The trial is taking place at the U.N.-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone, at The Hague, Netherlands. Taylor is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, enslavement and sexual slavery and violence. He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors had rested their case against Taylor in February 2009 but reopened it to call Campbell to testify after learning Taylor had given the supermodel a diamond. When arguing to reopen the case, prosecutors said Campbell's testimony would prove that the former president ""used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases,"" according to papers filed with the U.N.-backed court. Taylor has testified that he never handled the precious stones. The men who dropped off the diamonds to Campbell never said they represented Taylor, White testified, but Campbell was clear about who they had come from, White said. When she met with Ratcliffe, Campbell told him she had received the diamonds from Charles Taylor, White testified. Actress Mia Farrow testified Monday that Campbell named Taylor as the person who gave her a diamond. At breakfast the next morning, Farrow said, Campbell told her the men had been sent by Charles Taylor and had given her a ""huge diamond."" It was unclear why Farrow spoke of a single diamond and Campbell testified about several smaller ones. Griffiths summed up his questioning Tuesday with an attack on White's testimony. ""Quite frankly, Mrs. White, I suggest that your account is a complete pack of lies, and you've made it up in order to assist in your lawsuit against Ms. Campbell,"" he said. ""Put bluntly, for you this is all about money, there ain't nothing funny. I have no further questions."" One of the judges then told a stunned White that she must respond, even though Griffiths had not prompted her. ""I can categorically tell your honor it's not a lie,"" White said. ""This happened. I have told people after the journey in '97 -- people that I trusted -- this story, because it was quite funny at the time, although it's not so funny now. ""It's totally the truth. It has nothing whatsoever to do with my business argument with Naomi Campbell, and I don't really see the relevance of the gentleman's argument. But this is not about money, this is about a very serious matter, and I am telling the truth."" Griffiths said in court last week that White launched a lawsuit against Campbell in October for breach of contract.","Charles Taylor's attorney accuses Naomi Campbell's former agent of lying .

"Washington (CNN) -- You've got to hand it to Chris Christie -- he knows how to play the game. Last week, citing potential cost overruns in the billions, the New Jersey governor stunned the political establishment by pulling the plug on the largest public transit project in the country. The sorely needed ARC (Access to the Region's Core) tunnel would create a second train tunnel beneath the Hudson River, thus doubling passenger capacity from the most densely populated state into Manhattan. In addition, the tunnel would create an estimated 6,000 construction-related jobs while also preparing the New York metro region for sustained growth in the 21st century. It would cut road congestion, reduce emissions, increase productivity and ease the strain on the only working train tunnel from New Jersey into New York, built more than a 100 years ago. This is the type of mass transit project that many in Western Europe, China and other places build routinely. It is also a vivid example of how we are falling behind in the world. (Side note: I cringe when writing sentences like that. Remember when America used to lead?) As President Obama noted Monday, our infrastructure is woefully outdated and inefficient, and the longer we allow it to erode, the deeper our competitive edge erodes. The country needs this project and the economic ripple effect that comes with it more than Chris Christie does. Christie knows it and so does the Obama administration, which is why Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood was in New Jersey meeting with the governor face-to-face 24 hours after Christie's announcement. During the meeting, LaHood, an immensely respected and low-key, get-it-done type of politician, was looking for an opening to salvage the deal. During the meeting, according to reporters Josh Margolin and Ted Sherman, Christie signaled that he would be willing to look at options if the numbers worked. With that, LaHood and Christie agreed to spend the next two weeks discussing proposed ways to save the project and, in Christie's view, limit risks to his state's taxpayers, currently on the hook for a third of the $9 billion project, plus any cost overruns. (The tunnel was originally slated to cost roughly $5.7 billion, but that number has soared in recent years.) Christie, reminded of Boston's Big Dig, which ended up being four times the cost of original estimates, believes the final cost of the new tunnel will be much higher than federal officials and others suggest. And that's the problem as Christie sees it. Even though the State of New York and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have committed to pay $3 billion each, New Jersey, like most states, does not have the capacity to absorb possibly hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overruns. Even though these overruns would occur when the economy has presumably rebounded, New Jersey is grappling with several other pressing budgetary needs. Among them: . -- A $46 billion unfunded pension liability for retired state employees. -- A decades-old court order to spend hundreds of millions in poor school districts. -- A nearly depleted Transportation Trust Fund, which repairs and maintains the state's roads, tunnels, and bridges and pays for the new ones. Faced with these realities, Christie seems to be betting the Obama administration won't let the project die, and he may be right. Indeed, if this is his goal, it's a shrewd, calculating political move. He will need a clear, definable win to pull this off with hard numbers that save money for New Jersey taxpayers. In Republican circles, the former U.S. attorney is currently a darling. Christie has spent the past month raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for fellow Republicans in tight races. He's visited more than a dozen states across the country, including Iowa. And as political columnist Chris Cillizza often opines, no politician ever just goes to Iowa, which has the first-in-the-nation presidential caucuses every four years. Although he has publicly denied it, Christie clearly has his eyes on a higher plain. His recent mishandling of New Jersey's Race to the Top application, in which the state narrowly lost a coveted $400 million federal grant for education investments, complicates that somewhat. Still, this gamble with the ARC tunnel may increase his standing among New Jersey's electorate. If Christie is smart, he'll work out a new deal with LaHood, a fellow moderate Republican. LaHood is well-known for brokering deals with lawmakers who have opposing views. If LaHood's record is any indication, next week he will present the governor with a reasonable plan that salvages the project and charts a responsible course forward. Christie should get what he can from LaHood and chalk up the win for New Jersey taxpayers, who according to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, get back 61 cents for every dollar they pay in federal taxes. No other state fares worse. Christie is playing hardball, no doubt about it. And while I may disagree with his approach, I'm not one to begrudge him or any governor for trying to save money for his state's taxpayers. The risk here is that Christie gets too greedy and sinks a worthy project with enormous benefits. The freshman governor is making a calculated gamble, and for the sake of thousands of unemployed construction workers, their families and others benefiting from the project, I hope he doesn't overplay his hand. As Kenny Rogers once told us, ""Every gambler knows that the secret to survivin' is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.""

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Four people in two states have been arrested as part of an investigation into the Final Exit Network, an organization that police believe helped a Georgia man end his life in June, authorities said Thursday. Claire Blehr, 76, of Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of Florida and Georgia, were two of the four arrested. John Celmer, 58, lived in Cumming, north of Atlanta. Cumming police, the Forsyth County coroner and the man's relatives all had suspicions that his death was an assisted suicide, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation  launched an investigation, the agency said in a news release. The GBI on Wednesday set up a sting operation at a residence in adjoining Dawson County, using an undercover agent who had posed as a terminally ill man seeking assistance with his suicide, the statement said. Claire Blehr, 76, of Atlanta, Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of both Punta Gorda, Florida, and Kennesaw, Georgia, were arrested, the GBI said. Meanwhile, authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, arrested Dr. Lawrence D. Egbert, 81, of Baltimore in connection with the investigation. A second person, Nicholas Alec Sheridan, 60, also of Baltimore, was arrested Wednesday night, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said Thursday. All four face charges of assisted suicide, tampering with evidence and violation of the Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the GBI said. The Final Exit Network, based in the north Atlanta suburb of Marietta, identifies itself on its Web site as ""an all-volunteer organization dedicated to serving people who are suffering from an intolerable condition. Network volunteers offer you counseling, support and even guidance to self-deliverance at a time and place of your choosing, but you always do the choosing. We will never encourage you to hasten your death."" Celmer suffered from ""very, very severe mouth and throat cancer,"" his 85-year-old mother, Betty Celmer, said from her home in the Buffalo, New York, suburb of East Amherst. ""They were rebuilding the whole mouth,"" she said. ""He was suffering terribly, that I know."" She said her son had undergone numerous surgeries and ""sounded depressed."" When he died, she said she had no idea his death might have been a suicide. In a statement released by the GBI, Celmer's widow, Susan, said that she and her family ""are gratified that the GBI and other law enforcement agencies have pursued this matter vigorously and that their investigation has led to the arrests reported today."" She said she will not comment further and requested privacy, referring future questions to her attorneys. An e-mail to Jerry Dincin, a man listed as Final Exit Network's vice president and treasurer on its Web site, was not answered Thursday. A call to Final Exit was answered by a recording. The method used in the suicide was helium inhalation, according to the GBI statement. People pay $50 to join the Final Exit Network, according to the GBI, and complete an application process. They are then visited by an ""exit guide"" assigned to the case. ""During the visitations, the member is instructed to purchase two helium tanks of a specific size and brand and a specific type of hood known as an 'exit bag,' "" according to the GBI statement. ""On the day of the event, the member is visited by the 'exit guide' and a 'senior exit guide.' The senior exit guide instructs the member through the process."" Goodwin and Blehr were told the GBI agent suffered from pancreatic cancer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. At the Dawson County residence on Wednesday, Goodwin allegedly walked the undercover agent through the steps and demonstrated how he would hold the agent's hands to stop him from removing the exit bag, Bankhead said. The GBI said that after the death occurs, ""all evidence is removed from the scene by the 'guides' and discarded, as evidence indicated happened in the Cumming case."" Goodwin's former neighbors in Kennesaw told CNN he moved to Florida a few years ago but still owns his large home there and returns to check on it occasionally. Kay Makarenko, 69, who lives behind Goodwin's home, said she was shocked to hear of his arrest. ""I said, 'It can't be the same Ted Goodwin.' "" After the arrests Wednesday, authorities in Georgia, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Colorado and Montana began executing search warrants and conducting interviews as part of the probe into the Final Exit Network, the GBI said, adding that GBI agents were in each state except Colorado to assist. In Phoenix, Arizona, police have linked the 2007 death of a 58-year-old woman to the Final Exit Network, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate KPHO-TV in Phoenix. Thomas said the woman, Jana Van Voorhis, was not terminally ill but suffered from mental illness and depression. He said a police investigation turned up records of visits from Final Exit guides to Voorhis, according to KPHO. No arrests have been made, but Thomas said he expects his office to wrap up its investigation and decide if charges are warranted within 60 days. CNN affiliate WDIV-TV in Detroit, Michigan, reported that search warrants were executed regarding two Michigan residents who sit on Final Exit's board of directors. The Final Exit Network Web site features a ""Wall of Fame"" with photos of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, among others. Kevorkian was released on parole in June 2007 after serving more than eight years of a 10- to 25-year sentence in the 1998 death of a man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ""We believe the needs of those who are suffering are paramount,"" the organization says. ""We applaud the work of organizations that seek legislative action to strengthen our right to die a peaceful and painless death at the time and place of our choosing. However, we feel that legislative change will not come soon enough for the many people who need help now and in the interim."" Betty Celmer, meanwhile, declined to share her thoughts on assisted suicide or the Final Exit Network's alleged involvement in her son's death, saying she lacks specifics. ""He's in a far better place,"" she said. ""That's the only comment I'm going to make."" CNN's Ashley Broughton and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.","NEW: Widow says she's gratified ""investigation has led to the arrests""

"(CNN) -- Seven years after the sidelining of Colonel Reb, the goateed planter who conjured images of the Old South, the University of Mississippi has a new mascot to do antics for children, visit the sick in hospitals and, yes, cheer on the Red and Blue at fall football games. Ole Miss on Thursday announced that Rebel Black Bear had outpolled other contenders to earn the honors, beginning in 2011. Nobel Prize-winning novelist William Faulkner, whose home still stands near the campus in Oxford, Mississippi, wrote a short story titled ""The Bear."" In it, Old Ben stands as a symbol of pride, strength and toughness. Extensive polling resulted in the bear defeating the Rebel Land Shark and Hotty Toddy, based on a cheer exchanged between Ole Miss fans, the mascot selection committee announced Thursday. Some Mississippi students had launched a campaign to put Admiral Ackbar from ""Star Wars"" on the ballot, but it fell short. About 13,000 people participated in each of two polls on the issue. The selection puts a symbolic end to Colonel Reb, who enjoyed lingering popularity among many Ole Miss fans. The university for years has distanced itself from association with symbols of the Confederacy. In 1997, it effectively excluded presence of Confederate flags at athletic events by not allowing any banners to be flown from a stick. ""While we might not all agree with the [student] committee's selection, I am confident that we will come together and continue to strongly support the Ole Miss Rebels,"" alumni association President Charles Clark said. ""I know that my love of Ole Miss is as strong as ever, and that I will be in Tuscaloosa on Saturday night cheering loudly for our Rebels."" The Rebels will be on the road Saturday playing the Alabama Crimson Tide. It's now up Michael Thompson to have the mascot ready to compete against the likes of South Carolina's garnet rooster, Cocky, Auburn's striped tiger, Aubie, and the Georgia's muscle-bound Harry Dawg. ""I was given the black bear and told 'make it happen',"" said Thompson, senior associate athletics director for communications and marketing. The school will work with a costume maker, recruit people who will wear the clothing and, perhaps most importantly, develop the creature's persona. ""I want it to be exactly right,"" said Thompson, who has been one the job a couple months. The cursive ""Ole Miss"" script on T-shirts and other items have been the school's main marketing tool. ""The script is the brand,"" said Thompson, who believes the mascot will reflect old traditions and, ideally, create new ones. To that end, Rebel Black Bear will wear a sports jacket, tie and hat to gatherings at the Grove, the legendary game-day tailgating area and meeting place in Oxford. ""The Grove is such an integral part of our tradition,"" Thompson said. Rebel Black Bear likely will wear a T-shirt and ""bring competitive energy to the game,"" Thompson said, adding mascots by necessity have to have a look and expression suitable for all occasions. ""You want him to be intimidating, but not scary,"" he said. ""You want him to be serious, but light-hearted."" The university has done a good job of positioning its sports brands to get away from Old South stereotypes, Thompson told CNN. He knows Rebel Black Bear, at least initially, won't be welcomed by all. ""No doubt there will be bumps in the road and there always will be critics. Some say if they can't have Colonel Reb they wouldn't want a mascot at all."" But, he says, the school has an opportunity to attract new fans. ""It's what we do with the mascot that is important,"" Thompson said. ""How it interacts with children, who are the future of the University of Mississippi."" The Colonel Reb Foundation tried in vain to get the old mascot, who was created before World War II, on the ballot. A commenter on its Facebook page Thursday lamented the new choice with the message, ""The Bad News Bears -- Beware the Curse of the Colonel!"" The university announced in March that Colonel Reb merchandise was being phased out, and licensed sales were concluded by late summer. ""Because Colonel Reb is a mark we wish to own as university property to prevent its inappropriate use by others and to avoid confusing consumers and Ole Miss supporters, we are going to reclassify the mark as ""historical"" and add it to our college 'vault,'"" it stated. Like just about everything else, Colonel Reb lives on eBay, in the form of phone covers, key chains and even a rubber duck, but the university does not profit from such sales.","Rebel Black Bear will be new athletics mascot .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- At least 43 people were killed and 72 others were injured as widespread violence broke out overnight following the killing of a provincial lawmaker in the southern Pakistani port city of Karachi Tuesday, police said. Syed Raza Haider, a leader of the MQM party, was shot Monday evening at a mosque where he was attending the funeral of a relative, according to Rafiq Gul, Karachi's deputy superintendent of police. The gunman also killed the politician's bodyguard. Gul said Haider's death triggered political and ethnic violence in the city, as mobs set fire to vehicles and gunfire erupted. Gul said 48 vehicles, eight shops and several gas stations were set ablaze in the mayhem. The MQM is part of the ruling coalition backing President Asif Ali Zardari's Pakistan People's Party.

"(CNN) -- South Korean union and civic groups are gearing up for large protests against the G-20, which plans a summit in Seoul in November. About four dozen union and civic groups have joined to oppose G-20 efforts, such as globalizing financial systems, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions has announced. Businesses have maximized profits while eroding workers' job security and labor rights, said the trade union, which aims to highlight such issues. Collectively, the Group of 20 accounts for about 85 percent of global economic output. The 1997 Asian financial crisis prompted creation of the group, which aims to stabilize the world financial market. The G-20 includes industrialized nations and developing economies, which focus on economic issues and economic policy coordination. The Group of Eight continues to focus on issues such as global security. The G-20 held its last summit in June in Toronto, Canada. Hundreds of protesters were arrested as violence and vandalism broke out. Cars were set on fire, windows were broken and graffiti was sprayed. Some protesters were tear gassed, though no serious injuries were reported.","About four dozen groups have joined to oppose G-20 efforts .

"(CNN)  -- Alberto Contador will take a 39-second lead into the final stage of the Tour de France after fighting off a determined challenge from Andy Schleck in Saturday's deciding time trial stage. Spain's Contador had an eight-second advantage going into the 52km solo test from Bordeaux to Pauillac and came under pressure from his Luxembourg rival at the early time checks. For some fleeting moments it seemed possible that Schleck could reclaim the yellow jersey, but as he tired, Contador, considered a far superior time triallist, increased his advantage. And at the finish, a relieved and tearful Contador had extended his lead by 31 seconds. ""It was a very hard day. I've worked so hard for so many years but today it really came right down to the wire. That's why I'm so emotional,"" Contador told the official race website. ""In fact, I think it's the first Tour I've won where I've been so emotional. ""I want to thank all the people who have been there for me these last years."" Both the top two were well adrift of the best time of Schleck's Saxo Bank teammate Fabian Cancellara. He powered around the course in one hour and 56 seconds to win the 19th stage by 17 seconds from Tony Martin whose HTC-Columbia teammate Bert Grabsch finished third. Russia's Denis Menchov will claim the final podium position in Paris after leapfrogging Olympic road race champion Samuel Sanchez of Spain for third overall with the best time trial performance of the leading contenders, who had to battle a rising wind over largely flat terrain. Assuming no accidents on the 20th and final stage into the French capital on Sunday, it will be the third Tour de France triumph for Astana's Contador after his 2007 and 2009 triumphs. He courted controversy by taking the overall race lead in the Pyrenees on Monday after Schleck dropped his chain near the summit of a climb. Contador flouted recent convention by not waiting for him to fix the problem and was later jeered by fans as he donned the yellow jersey. Contador had gained 39 seconds on Schleck, ironically the margin that will likely separate them at the finish in one of the closest fought Tours in recent years. Their head-to-head duel on the Col du Tourmalet in Thursday's final mountain stage will long be remembered, with Contador making a sporting concession to allow Schleck to claim the victory while maintaining his slender but decisive advantage. Schleck said he is determined to return next year to win the Tour de France. ""I've always said I've progressed (in the time trial) but to beat Alberto is not easy. I gave it my all, and I just couldn't beat him,"" he said. ""I've won two stages here, so for that I'm happy. I will come back next year to win. He is not unbeatable.""","Alberto Contador has 39-second lead going into 20th and final stage of Tour de France .

"(EW.com) -- What is Jaden Smith's crime? Last weekend, the up-and-coming young actor, who will turn 12 this July 8, starred in a remake of ""The Karate Kid"" that audiences flocked to beyond expectation and, from all available evidence, loved. Given that Smith is front and center in more or less every frame of the 2 hour and 20 minute movie (and given that his performance, as a kid who hides his sadness behind a mask of surliness, is to this critic, at least a magnetic and affecting piece of acting), I hope we can all agree that Jaden Smith's presence on screen had a little something to do with the movie's success. Yet Smith's rise has been greeted, in far too many quarters (including a number of comment boards on ew.com, like the one on my review), with bitter, gnashing resentment. This 11-year-old really has the haters foaming. Excuse me, but what the heck is going on? Let's start with the indisputable fact that Smith got to be in the position he's in because his father is the biggest movie star on the planet. So where, exactly, should that piece of information lead us? Should we hate Jaden Smith? Should we hate Will Smith? Should we hate every young actor or musician who ever got placed on the map of fame because of his or her parents? (Take that, Miley Cyrus, Michael Douglas, and Jamie Lee Curtis.) Oh, but, of course, the rap on Jaden Smith is that he's all nepotism and nothing else, that he's a kind of grouchy preteen Tori Spelling in cornrows. He's been excoriated as a bad actor (even though, just a few years ago, most viewers had nothing but praise for the appealingly feisty and precocious performance he gave right next to his dad in ""The Pursuit of Happyness""). He's been called a brat, a spoiled no-talent, an ungrateful beneficiary of his lineage of stardom. He's been ripped up and down as ""insufferable"" for his appearance last week on ""The Late Show with David Letterman."" I caught up with the Letterman spot a few days after the fact, when the anti-Jaden anger was already at full boil, and so I watched it with particular attention and fascination. Here's what I saw: Smith, seated opposite Letterman, conducted himself very differently from most child actors. Usually, kids in show business know how to present themselves as cuddly pets. Smith was having none of that. He has a very quick mind, and his responses were fast and a little brusque from the start, he was toying with Letterman, putting him on the spot by giving him a lot less fake-nice, fake-sincere boilerplate chat-show banter than he wanted. (Gee, who in his right mind would want less of that?) It's something that I've occasionally seen adults do, and yes, it was a little startling to see a kid this young with a movie to hawk go onto the Letterman show and assume that mock-confrontational, who's-really-in-charge-here? stance. But it wouldn't have worked if it wasn't, in its way, a gripping little talk-show performance. (Letterman himself played at being taken back, but also was taken aback; it's always a good thing when Dave gets jolted out of his stuffy protective pose, his robo-irony.) Bottom line, for me: Smith was cocky as hell on Letterman, but he was also interesting. For eight minutes, he displayed the confidence to be non-ingratiating and, in the process, he seized your attention. He was brash; he acted like a Hollywood kid who truly had a mind of his own. Perish the thought! Yet in the online universe of Jaden Hatred, that Letterman appearance played as one thing and one thing only: privilege. And that, on the surface, is what the whole ragging-on-Jaden-Smith phenomenon is really all about the desire to tear down a child who enjoys the perks of celebrity royalty, even though he didn't earn them. And now he's getting a movie career handed to him! You can almost taste the class resentment, the jealousy of folks who only wish, deep down, that they'd gotten such an opportunity themselves and now want to scrawl their rage on Jaden Smith's image like Perez Hilton going crazy with his Magic Marker. Still, what's most striking, and perhaps revealing, about this particular outpouring of toxic anger is that Jaden's famous father, Will Smith, isn't just another big movie star he's one of the most likable movie stars you could ever imagine. You'd think that the general feeling about him, the nearly universal good will, would extend to giving the benefit of the doubt to his son. I know that when I watched Jaden Smith in ""The Karate Kid,"" the echoes of his father in everything from his cool, appraising glare to the nimble speed of his responses is something I enjoyed like, say, hearing that raspy echo of Bob Dylan in Jakob Dylan's voice back in the ""One Headlight"" days. It's not as if this sort of situation happens every day; what would be so wrong with giving the son (or daughter) of fame a break and simply enjoying it? It's hard to shake the feeling, though, that too many people are trying to turn Jaden Smith from what he is, which is an insolently charismatic and hard-working young actor, into a focal point of ill will over issues of class, fame, money, and yes, I'm going to say it race. For let's be honest: Doesn't all the grousing about how Smith is ""arrogant,"" etc., carry a special, ugly tinge of rancor? Doesn't the complaint that he's too big for his britches come painfully close to saying that he doesn't know his place? What do you think? Has the anger at Jaden Smith gotten ugly? What do you believe it's really about? And who out there likes him as an actor as much as I do? Now that he truly does appear to be on his way to stardom, what sort of movie should he do next?

"(CNN) -- Most parents think their children share too much information online -- and that search engines and social networks aren't doing enough to protect privacy, according to poll results released Friday. More than 90 percent of the parents surveyed by Zogby International said they are ""concerned"" that their children share too much information online, and 75 percent said they would rate the job social networks are doing to protect online privacy as ""negative."" The results, released by the nonprofit advocacy organization Common Sense Media -- which commissioned the poll -- do not mention particular social networks or websites by name. Common Sense Media CEO James Steyer said the need for reform is clear. ""Parents want far more education and leadership about online privacy, and they clearly want the industry and the federal government to update privacy policies,"" Steyer said in a statement. The organization begins a campaign Monday aimed at protecting kids' personal information and reputations online. ""We need a 'Do Not Track Kids' approach' similar to the 'Do Not Call' policies that restrict telemarketers,"" Steyer said. The results also include a survey of 401 teenagers aged 15 to 18. Common Sense Media said 79 percent of the teens surveyed also think their friends share too much personal information online, and 85 percent of them want search engines and social networking sites to ask for permission before using personal information to market products. ""The poll results present a clear divide between the industry's view of privacy and the opinion of parents and kids,"" Steyer said. To conduct the online poll of parents, Zogby International used a sampling of 2,100 adults from its online panel, which the polling firm says is representative of the adult population of the United States. The sampling margin of error is 2.2 percentage points. The sampling margin of error for the online poll of teenagers was 5 percentage points.","Survey: 75 percent of parents rate social networks' privacy protections as ""negative""

"(CNN) -- Cholera has killed 200 people in the west African nation of Cameroon, the government said Thursday, and aid agencies feared the outbreak could spread to neighboring regions and nations. Another 2,500 cases of cholera, a deadly water-borne disease, have been diagnosed in Cameroon since an outbreak warning in June. About 70 percent of people living in the country's far north region, bordering Nigeria and Chad, do not have access to potable water, according to a Ministry of Water and Energy official. Sanitation is also limited in the area and recent flooding has aggravated the situation. UNICEF said it has dispatched emergency medical kits containing surgical gloves, water treatment tablets, cholera medicine, oral rehydration salts and educational materials. The United Nations children's agency said the outbreak could be devastating for children, who are especially vulnerable. The disease is caused by contaminated water, and many people with cholera suffer acute watery diarrhea, which leads to severe dehydration. If left untreated, it can kill quickly, possibly within hours, according to the World Health Organization. Up to 120,000 people die each year from cholera. Journalist Moki Kindzeka contributed to this report.","Health officials fear the outbreak might spread .

"London, England (CNN) -- Wayne Rooney ensured he hit the headlines for all the right reasons by ending his international goal drought during England's 3-1 Group G win over Switzerland in Euro 2012 qualifying. The Manchester United striker was hit by allegations about his private life in the British press at the weekend but shrugged off the controversy to register his first goal for England in 11 games. He converted Glen Johnson's cross to open the scoring before Manchester City winger Adam Johnson made it 2-0 in the second half after Switzerland's Stephan Lichtsteiner had been sent off. Though 18-year-old Xherdan Shaqiri pulled one back for the hosts with a spectacular strike, Sunderland striker Darren Bent made the game safe with a late third for England. In the group's other game Elsad Zverotic's goal was enough to hand Montenegro a surprise 1-0 in Belgium. Managerless Portugal continued their disappointing start to the campaign as they were beaten 1-0 by Norway in Group H. Coach Carlos Queiroz is serving a six-month ban following an incident involving an anti-doping team before the 2010 World Cup and in his absence Portugal are struggling. Erik Huseklepp scored the only goal of the game after 21 minutes to leave Portugal with just one point from two games as Norway went top. Morten Skoubo netted a late winner for Denmark as they beat Iceland in the group's other game. France bounced back from their shock defeat to Belarus on Friday by winning 2-0 against Bosnia-Herzegovina in Group D. Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema opened the scoring on 72 minutes before Chelsea's Florent Malouda grabbed the second. Elsewhere in Group D, Hamdi Salihi's goal gave Albania a 1-0 victory over Luxembourg while Belarus and Romania drew 0-0. Miroslav Klose scored twice as Germany maintained their 100 per cent record in Group A by thrashing Azerbaijan 6-1. Heiko Westermann, Lukas Podolski, Holger Badstuber and a Rashad Sadygov own goal completed the rout in Munich. In Istanbul, Turkey made it two wins out of two in their qualification campaign as they beat Belgium 3-2 thanks to a late goal from Arda Turan. Bayern Munich defender Daniel Van Buyten scored twice for Belgium, who had Vincent Kompany sent off. Late goals from Roland Linz and Erwin Hoffer helped Austria to a 2-0 win over Kazakhstan in Vienna. In Group C, Italy hammered the Faroe Islands 5-0. Alberto Gilardino, Daniele De Rossi, Antonio Cassano, Fabio Quagliarella and Andrea Pirlo all got on the scoresheet as the Azzurri went top of the table. In the group's other game a late goal from Nikola Zigic rescued a draw for Serbia against Slovenia. Russia were beaten 1-0 at home by Slovakia in Group F. Miroslav Stoch scored the only goal for the visitors. Elsewhere, Spurs striker Robbie Keane scored for Ireland as they beat Andorra 3-1 in Dublin, while Macedonia and Armenia drew 2-2. Schalke striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scored twice for the Netherlands as they beat Finland 2-1 in Group E. But Sweden are top of the group after they thrashed San Marino 6-0.

"(CNN) -- The 28-year-old victim of an acid attack was released Sunday from a Portland, Oregon, hospital, a nursing supervisor said, nearly a week after an unknown assailant threw a cup of the caustic liquid in her face. Bethany Storro was released from Legacy Emanuel Hospital, where she had undergone surgery for her injuries after the attack last Monday, according to the supervisor, who declined to give her name. Storro credits a new pair of sunglasses -- bought just 20 minutes before the attack -- with saving her eyesight. ""God is watching over me,"" Storro, of Vancouver, Washington, told CNN affiliate KATU in Portland, Oregon, last week. ""I believe in him. That his hands are on me and I can't live the rest of my life like that -- in fear. I can't let what she did to me wreck my life."" Vancouver police say they are looking for the assailant, described as an African-American woman with an athletic build and slicked-back hair pulled into a pony tail. A composite sketch of the suspect was released last week. Storro told KATU that she had stopped at a Starbucks about 7:15 p.m. Monday, just after she had gone back to buy a pair of sunglasses that she had seen earlier. The woman walked up to her and said, ""Hey pretty girl, do you want to drink this?"" When Storro declined, the woman threw the contents of the cup in her face and ran off. Storro said she spoke about the attack because she wants people to see what the woman did to her and to help authorities find the woman before she assaults someone else. The attack bears similarities to a 2008 case in London, England. Katie Piper, a young model and television presenter, was leaving her apartment in a London suburb when she was attacked by a stranger waiting for her with a cup of sulfuric acid. The liquid burned the skin on her face, neck, chest and hands. She was also left blinded in one eye. Her assailant was asked by Piper's former boyfriend, Danny Lynch, to throw the acid on her face because she ended their short relationship. Both the assailant, Stefan Sylvestre, and Lynch are serving time in prison for the attack. CNN's Greg Morrison contributed to this report.","28-year-old Bethany Storro was released from a Portland, Oregon, hospital Sunday .

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama on Thursday said a Florida church's plans to burn dozens of Qurans this weekend would be a ""recruitment bonanza"" for al Qaeda. ""You could have serious violence in places like Pakistan or Afghanistan,"" Obama told ABC's ""Good Morning America."" ""This could increase the recruitment of individuals who'd be willing to blow themselves up in American cities or European cities."" Obama said he hoped the pastor, Terry Jones, understands that the planned burning is a ""destructive act"" that may have a dangerous fallout. ""I just want him to understand that this stunt that he is talking about pulling could greatly endanger our young men and women in uniform who are in Iraq, who are in Afghanistan. We're already seeing protests against Americans just by the mere threat of it,"" Obama said. His comments came amid increasing international condemnation of the  planned event on September 11 with the Presidents of Indonesia and Pakistan voicing their disapproval. Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono wrote a letter to President Barack Obama urging him to stop a Florida church that said it will burn copies of the Quran. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari expressed grave concern over the threats to burn copies of the Quran. Terry Jones, the head of a small church in Gainesville, Florida, says he will go ahead with plans to burn Qurans on Saturday, to mark the anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks. In his letter to Obama, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono urged him ""to ensure that this hideous act is not carried out,"" said Teuku Faizasyah, a presidential spokesman. ""It's a very dangerous situation and we are very concerned,"" Faizasyah said. Indonesia, which has a population of 230 million and is the world's most populous Muslim state, is worried that burning the Muslim holy book would incite hardline Muslims in Indonesia and around the world, Faizasyah said. Similar concerns are being echoed in Pakistan where there has been growing anger at the planned burning. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said anyone who thought of such a despicable act must be suffering from a diseased mind and a sickly soul, said spokesman Farhatullah Babar. Zardari said it will inflame sentiments among Muslims throughout the world and cause irreparable damage to interfaith harmony and world peace. Also on Thursday Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik called on Interpol, the international police organization, to stop the church from carrying out its plan to burn the Quran. Meanwhile hardline Indonesian Muslims are threatening retaliation. The Islamic Defenders Front, told CNN it will protest the planned burning and will issue a death sentence on Terry Jones, if he carries out his plan. There is also increasing opposition to the planned event in the U.S. amid increased warnings that doing so could endanger U.S. troops and Americans worldwide. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemned the planned burning.

"(CNN) -- Sachin Tendulkar hit the fifth double century of his career to help India surpass Sri Lanka's huge first innings total as the second Test headed for a draw. The man known as the ""Little Master"" more than lived up to his billing as he made 203 in India's mammoth total of 669-9. Tendulkar was ably assisted by Suresh Raina who made 120 on his Test debut and captain MS Dhoni, who hit 76, as India finished day four 27 runs ahead in Colombo, leaving the likelihood of a result very slim. Sri Lanka won the first Test of the three-match series in Galle when the retiring Muttiah Muralitharan produced a match-winning performance to become the first bowler to reach 800 Test wickets. India began day four on 382-4 with Tendulkar on 108 not out. By the end of the day's play they had added an extra 300 runs to crush Sri Lanka's fleeting hopes of victory. Tendulkar and Raina quickly took India past the follow-on target of 442 as they put together a partnership of 256 -- the third highest fifth-wicket partnership for India in Tests. Raina was the first to go after lunch when he was caught by Kumar Sangakkara off the bowling of spinner Ajantha Mendis for 120. Tendulkar was eventually removed by Tillakaratne Dilshan, captain Mahela Jayawardene taking the catch. The 37-year-old's knock took him joint-fifth in the list of double century makers in Tests. Harbhajan Singh followed soon after Tendulkar for a duck but Abhimanyu Mithun proved a valuable companion for Dhoni as the pair put on 51. Mithun was bowled by Mendis for 41 after taking India past Sri Lanka's total before Ishant Sharma and Pragyan Ohja held firm until the close of play.","India reach 669-9 on day four of the second Test against Sri Lanka .

"(CNN) -- Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso secured an emotional victory for Ferrari at their home Italian Grand Prix at Monza on Sunday. The 29-year-old started from pole position and delighted the ""Tifosi"" -- the name given to Ferrari's legion of passionate fans -- with a superb drive to finish ahead of world champion Jenson Button, with Felipe Massa third in the second Ferrari. Button claimed the better start and led for the first 36 laps, but Alonso took the lead following a pit stop and held on for Ferrari's first ""home"" win in four years. ""That was one of the great wins of my career, so emotional and so special for me and for this team. For me it is there with my Spanish Grand Prix of 2006,"" Alonso told reporters. ""Now we must go back to work -- we need to find consistency in the last five races of the season,"" he added. Alonso's third success of the season, and 24th of his career, saw him close the gap at the top of the world driver standings. The Spaniard is now on 166 points, 21 points behind new leader Mark Webber -- who overtook McLaren's Lewis Hamilton at the top of the standings despite finishing down in sixth place. Hamilton crashed out on the first lap, meaning he now trails the Australian Red Bull driver with just five races still to go. Sebastian Vettel finished fourth despite early engine problems and a remarkable final lap 3.3-second pit-stop. Nico Rosberg finished fifth for Mercedes, ahead of Webber.

"(CNN) -- An $8.5 million stimulus spending project to rebuild a little-used Montana border station is on hold because the station could become an outpost on a one-way street. Canada has decided to shut down its side of the Whitetail, Montana, border crossing next year because fewer than five vehicles a day use the crossing. The decision comes at the same time the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is planning to spend spend the millions in stimulus funds to upgrade the border station. The upgrade is part of a highly criticized decision last year that sent tens of millions of dollars in stimulus funds to revamp or rebuild border stations across Montana's northern border with Canada. The crossing at Whitetail is the least used. Canada estimates five vehicles a day cross the border there. Vehicles crossing into the United States average as few as two a day at Whitehall, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection records. The Department of Homeland Security has stressed the need for spending tens of millions of dollars in Montana to improve security along the border. But in light of Canada's decision, Customs and Border Protection spokesman Rafael Lemaitre says the government ""is pausing construction at the Whitetail Port of Entry until September 1 in order to work with the Canada Border Services Agency to develop a joint solution that ensures the continued security interests of both countries."" The recent announcement by Canadian officials to close the station on their side of the border has brought sharp criticism about the stimulus spending plan from Montana's lone congressman. Rep. Denny Rehberg, a Republican, released a statement saying, ""Montanans aren't happy about how their tax dollars are being wasted."" Rehberg has asked Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to once again review the plan to spend $8.5 million dollars on the border crossing, adding that its his job as a congressman to ""safeguard tax dollars, and I'm making sure this boondoggle doesn't slip through the cracks."" Even Sen. Jon Tester, a Montana Democrat who last year was one of the biggest supporters of the plan to spend millions on Montana's border crossings, is now backtracking. Tester told CNN in August of 2009 that the spending would ""pay off for generations to come by creating new jobs and opportunity that would benefit all of Montana."" A spokeswoman for Tester says the senator now is asking for construction to cease until another review can be conducted. ""A year ago, unilateral plans to close the Canadian side weren't part of the equation,"" Tester spokeswoman Andrea Heller told CNN. ""The news that the Canadians are closing their side of the port changes the situation."" This is the second time plans for the Montana border stations have been put on hold. Last year after CNN aired a report showing how little the state's border stations were used, the Department of Homeland Security announced it would review its plans. The 60-day review ended with the announcement that the department was going ahead with its stimulus construction plan. It is not clear if anyone at Homeland Security discussed Canada's plans as part of that review.","Whitetail, Montana, is a rarely used border crossing .

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- A car bomb exploded Thursday in the Russian republic of North Ossetia, killing at least 17 people -- including an 18-month-old baby -- and wounding up to 123 others, local health officials said. The vehicle blew up near a market in the city of Vladikavkaz, the republic's leader, Taimuraz Mamsurov, told the Interfax news agency. ""Information that I possess indicates that the explosion in Vladikavkaz was organized by a suicide bomber, who drove a Volga 3102 car to near the entrance to the market,"" Mamsurov said. The injured included 10 people in critical condition and 90 in serious condition, health officials said. Investigators said the explosive device contained the equivalent of 40 kilograms of TNT. The bomb was placed inside a vehicle parked at the entrance to the central market in downtown Vladikavkaz, with a suicide bomber sitting inside the car, said the Investigative Committee of the Russian Prosecutor's Office, which qualified the attack as a ""terrorist act.""  The device detonated at 11:20 a.m. (3:20 a.m. ET). The committee also said the bomb was stuffed with various pieces of metal to increase the human damage. A natural gas canister, stored in the car's trunk, also detonated, the committee said. The Russian Emergency Situations Ministry is sending special medical planes to Vladikavkaz to airlift heavily injured patients to Moscow's leading trauma clinics. Friday was declared a day of national mourning in North Ossetia, according to a local government decree. Flags on all regional buildings will fly at half-staff and all entertainment programs on local TV will be cancelled as well as concerts and theater performances. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, speaking on national TV, pledged that all organizers of the deadly bombing will be identified and punished -- or killed. ""We will do all we can to catch these monsters and animals ... who have committed a terror attack, a barbaric terror attack, against ordinary people. We will do all we can to find and punish them in accordance with the laws of our country, and we will destroy them if they offer resistance or in other circumstances,"" Medvedev said. Meanwhile, the owner of the car used in the bomb attack has been identified and arrested, a local police official told the Interfax news agency. The detainee claims that he sold it to an unknown buyer on Wednesday, the policeman said. The Russian government announced each family of those killed will receive 1 million rubles in compensation (more than $32,000). Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin also condemned the bombing, saying, ""The crimes like the one that was committed in the North Caucasus today are aimed at sowing enmity between our citizens. We have no right to allow this."" North Ossetia and the rest of the Caucasus region have been plagued with violence and political instability. The market has seen other terrorist attacks in the past. In November 2008, a suicide bomber blew up a bus at a nearby bus station, killing 12 people and wounding more than 40.  An explosion killed more than 50 people and wounded 300 in March 1999.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Michael Crichton, who helped create the TV show ""ER"" and wrote the best-sellers ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Andromeda Strain,"" ""Sphere"" and ""Rising Sun,"" has died in Los Angeles, his public relations firm said in a news release. Michael Crichton, here in 2005, was a director and best-selling author. He co-created the TV series ""ER."" Crichton died unexpectedly Tuesday ""after a courageous and private battle against cancer,"" the release said. He was 66. Crichton, a medical doctor, was attracted to cautionary science tales.  Watch more about the life of Crichton Â» . ""Jurassic Park"" -- perhaps his best-known work -- concerned capturing the DNA of dinosaurs and bringing them to life on a modern island, where they soon run amok; ""The Andromeda Strain,"" his first major fiction success, involves an alien microorganism that's studied in a special military compound after causing death in a nearby community. Crichton also invited controversy with some of his scientific views. He was an avowed skeptic of global climate change, giving lectures warning against ""consensus science."" He later took on global warming and the theories surrounding it in his 2004 novel, ""State of Fear,"" which attracted attacks in its own right from scientists, including NASA climatologist James Hansen. iReport.com: Were you a fan? Share your tributes. Crichton was a distinctive figure in the entertainment business, a trained physician whose interests included writing, filmmaking and television. (He was physically distinctive as well, standing 6 feet 9 inches.) He published ""The Andromeda Strain"" while he was still a medical student at Harvard Medical School. He wrote a story about a 19th-century train robbery, called ""The Great Train Robbery,"" and then directed the 1979 film version. He also directed several other films, including ""Westworld"" (1973), ""Coma"" (1978), ""Looker"" (1981) and ""Runaway"" (1984). In 1993, while working on the film version of ""Jurassic Park"" with Steven Spielberg, he teamed with the director to create ""ER."" The NBC series set in a Chicago emergency room debuted in 1994 and became a huge hit, making a star of George Clooney. Crichton originally wrote the script for the pilot in 1974. ""Michael's talent out-scaled even his own dinosaurs of 'Jurassic Park,' "" said Spielberg, a friend of Crichton's for 40 years, according to The Associated Press. ""He was the greatest at blending science with big theatrical concepts, which is what gave credibility to dinosaurs again walking the Earth. ... Michael was a gentle soul who reserved his flamboyant side for his novels. There is no one in the wings that will ever take his place."" Crichton was ""an extraordinary man. Brilliant, funny, erudite, gracious, exceptionally inquisitive and always thoughtful,"" ""ER"" executive producer John Wells told the AP. ""No lunch with Michael lasted less than three hours and no subject was too prosaic or obscure to attract his interest. Sexual politics, medical and scientific ethics, anthropology, archaeology, economics, astronomy, astrology, quantum physics, and molecular biology were all regular topics of conversation."" Michael Crichton was born in Chicago in 1942 and grew up in New York's suburbs. His father was a journalist and Michael loved the writing profession. He went to medical school partly out of a concern he wouldn't be able to make writing a career, but the success of ""The Andromeda Strain"" in 1969 -- the book was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club and optioned by Hollywood -- made him change his mind, though he still had an M.D. Though most of Crichton's books were major best-sellers involving science, he could ruffle feathers when he took on social issues. ""Rising Sun"" (1992) came out during a time when Americans feared Japanese ascendance, particularly when it came to technology. ""Disclosure"" (1994) was about a sexual harassment case. iReport.com: How did Crichton's work affect you? Share your tributes . Crichton won an Emmy, a Peabody, a Writers Guild of America Award for ""ER,"" and won other awards as well. ""Through his books, Michael Crichton served as an inspiration to students of all ages, challenged scientists in many fields, and illuminated the mysteries of the world in a way we could all understand,"" the news release said.

"(CNN) -- Football's ruling body is investigating reports that North Korea's national team and head coach were humiliated by government officials following a disastrous showing at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. The North Koreans, playing at the tournament for the first time since 1966, suffered an embarrassing 7-0 thrashing by Portugal and also lost to five-time world champions Brazil and the Ivory Coast. The players, except for Japan-born Jong Tae-se and An Yong-hak, were summoned to a large auditorium on return to Pyongyang last month and subjected to a six-hour interrogation, according to Radio Free Asia. Coach Kim Jong Hun was expelled from the Workers' Party and forced to do hard labor as punishment, sources told the station. He was reportedly accused of betraying Young Gen. Kim Jong Un, the anointed heir of the regime's longtime leader Kim Jong-Il. FIFA president Sepp Blatter told a press conference in Singapore on Wednesday that the governing body had made contact with the North Korean Football Association. ""[We contacted them] to tell us about the election of a new president, and if it is true, the allegations made by the media that the coach and some players have been condemned or punished,"" Blatter said in quotes carried by the UK Press Association. ""The first step is the federation and we'll see what the answer will be, and then we can elaborate on that."" Blatter said FIFA, which has strict rules about no government interference in member associations' affairs, was wary of making an official statement about the reports. ""We once had a case in another country where it was said players were also condemned and under physical pressure, and we sent someone and it turned out not to be true,"" he said in quotes carried by the AFP agency. ""So let's see what we hear before we make an official statement."" Blatter, who is in Singapore for the Youth Olympic Games' football tournament, also confirmed that the International Football Association Board would be discussing the possible introduction of goal-line technology at its meeting in October. The issue came to a head again at the World Cup, where England had a goal wrongly disallowed against Germany and Argentina were awarded an offside goal against Mexico.","FIFA contacts North Korean FA to investigate reports of government interference .

"(CNN) -- Police in California have found a plastic-wrapped body that might be tied to a bizarre saga involving several homicides in the San Francisco Bay Area. The body of Frederick Sales, 35, was found bound in plastic and hidden in a closet of a home, the Hercules Police Department said in a statement Saturday. Sales' cause of death had not been determined. On August 28, Sales' father, 73-year-old Ricardo Sales, was found bludgeoned to death with multiple puncture wounds in the same home, police said.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Presidential Summit on Entrepreneurship late last month marked a turning point in U.S. foreign policy. Did you hear about this summit? Likely not, as headlines focused on the oil spill, the bomb scare in Times Square and the Supreme Court nomination. And with the U.S. unemployment rate at nearly 10 percent, promoting prosperity abroad is difficult for the White House to tout at home. Still, President Obama pledged in Cairo, Egypt, last June to build a new beginning with Muslim nations, and entrepreneurship provides an innovative new tool. Obama was keeping his promise to deepen partnerships between the United States and the Muslim world when he invited 275 entrepreneurs from Muslim-majority countries to participate in the Washington summit. Selected delegates came from more than 50 countries, including Iraq, India, Indonesia and Kazakhstan. The gathering marked an important shift in foreign policy. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who spoke at the event's conclusion, said ""the summit reflects the new approach to foreign policy that President Obama described last year at Cairo University, one that we have been putting into practice through partnerships based on shared values, mutual respect and mutual responsibility."" In the past, U.S. engagement with the Muslim world has focused primarily on defeating al Qaeda, ending the war in Iraq and deterring Iran's nuclear ambitions. The summit broadened that strategy along the lines of the 9/11 Commission Report, which stated that the first phase of our post-9/11 efforts rightly included military action, but that longer-term success depended on the use of all elements of national power, including economic policy and foreign aid. With more than 90 percent of children younger than 15 living in developing countries, engaging the next generation in the Middle East as well as in China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies is critical for the United States. The United States needs to find partners in this burgeoning population. If the goal of the summit was to get participants to collaborate, the buzz in the room provided a positive indication. ""People are happy to be with each other,"" said Jacqueline Novogratz, founder and CEO of Acumen Fund, a nonprofit venture fund aimed at eradicating global poverty. It remains to be seen if the summit will turn into more than a successful public diplomacy event. What did participants gain from attending? First and foremost, they had a chance to meet each other, build ties, exchange ideas and find others interested in partnering or funding their endeavors. Abdulsalam Haykal, a Syrian entrepreneur, pulled a stack of business cards from his pocket and said, ""This is the start of a global network. It's about connecting with people."" In their home countries many delegates received media attention for being selected; for entrepreneurs the chance to promote their organization provides a boost. ""It is about shining a spotlight on high-impact entrepreneurs,"" said Linda Rottenberg, CEO and co-founder of Endeavor, a nonprofit that supports entrepreneurs in emerging markets. Collaborating with an all-star cast of White House officials couldn't hurt either. The White House rolled out the red carpet with Obama participating as well as Clinton, Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke, National Economics Council Director Lawrence Summers and Dr. Rajiv Shah, administrator of USAID. While the administration aimed to ""galvanize"" entrepreneurs from Muslim-majority countries, these Muslim upstarts shied away from pigeon-holing into a religious or ethnic category. When asked to define ""Muslim entrepreneur"" in a panel discussion, Tunisian business woman Douja Gharbi said, ""There is no difference between a Muslim entrepreneur and any other entrepreneur. An entrepreneur is an entrepreneur. "" For the White House, the purpose of the conference was to send a political message of collaborative engagement. For summit delegates, however, the focus was on building their fledgling businesses. Noticeably absent from the summit were U.S. entrepreneurs. Of the Americans participating, most represented U.S. government, not business. And, for Muslim entrepreneurs, the absence of their U.S. counterparts was a disappointment. For many, the conference still marked a paradigm shift in public policy. ""Obama has turned his Cairo vision into a reality,"" said Eboo Patel, founder of Interfaith Youth Core and a Muslim-American from Chicago. ""At the same time, he has advanced the culture of entrepreneurship to an inflection point."" The summit spurred companion events outside of government. In the same week, more than 30 partner organizations hosted events in Washington, including IBM, Cisco, the Kauffman Foundation, the Heritage Foundation, the Brookings Institution and Young Professionals in Foreign Policy. As for next steps, Obama announced the administration's plans to launch exchange programs to bring entrepreneurs from Muslim countries to the U.S. and send their American counterparts to Muslim-majority countries. The prime minister of Turkey said he will host the next entrepreneurship summit, set to become an annual event. Commerce Secretary Locke announced an upcoming social entrepreneurship conference in Iraq. Clinton announced four initiatives: . -- The Global Entrepreneurship Program. -- Partnerships with two Silicon Valley-based incubators. -- The launch of Partners for a New Beginning. -- A new effort called e-Mentor Corps. These initiatives all aim to further catalyze ongoing collaboration through sharing of best practices. Entrepreneurship is the new global engagement. Last month, the U.S. reached out to upstarts in hopes that they will become new diplomats for change. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Amy Wilkinson.","Amy Wilkinson: Obama held summit to draw Muslim entrepreneurs to partnerships .

"(CNN)  -- A father who shot and killed his five children in their Washington state home before killing himself had argued with his wife over another man before the shootings, police said. Authorities found five children, ages 7 to 16, dead in their Pierce County, Washington, home Saturday. Authorities found the children, ages 7 to 16, dead in their Pierce County home Saturday afternoon, and the father, James Harrison, was found dead inside his SUV in adjacent King County, Detective Ed Troyer told CNN Radio Sunday. Police said Harrison committed suicide by shooting himself with a rifle. Troyer said that on Friday night, Harrison and his 16-year-old daughter found his wife with another man. The couple argued, and then Harrison and his daughter returned to the family home near Tacoma without his wife, Troyer said. At the home, Harrison and the children held a family meeting with other relatives, Troyer said. The relatives left, and later that night Harrison shot all five of his children -- four girls and one boy -- as they slept in their beds, Troyer said. The children's mother was located after the shootings and was being counseled by a chaplain, Troyer said. The family massacre comes just two months after a Los Angeles, California, father killed his wife, their five young children and himself after he and his wife were fired from their jobs. And police are still investigating another family shooting last week, in which a Santa Clara, California, man gunned down six of his family members -- killing two adults and three children and wounding his wife -- before committing suicide.","Five children shot and killed in their Washington state home by father, police say .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad arrived in Beirut for his first state visit to Lebanon Wednesday. Ahmadinejad was greeted at the airport by members of parliament, government officials and Hezbollah political leaders. The streets near the airport were packed with people in a festive mood carrying Iranian and Lebanese flags. The Iranian leader met Lebanese President Michel Suleiman at the Presidential Palace here and was scheduled to meet other leaders as well as leaders of Hezbollah's resistance movement. The United States considers Hezbollah, which has close ties to Iran and Syria, to be a terrorist organization. The Shiite group is a political party and a major provider of social services in Lebanon, but it also operates a militant wing. Hezbollah has boasted of numerous attacks against American, Israeli and other Western targets. Some Muslims see it as a heroic organization, successful in its stated objective of driving Israeli forces from Lebanon. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has expressed concern to Suleiman about Ahmadinejad's Lebanon visit, according to a State Department spokesman. But in southern Lebanon many were happy that Ahmadinejad was coming. That could be seen in places like the village of Bint Jbeil that had been reduced to rubble by Israeli bombings during the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. The village is being rebuilt now largely do to money from Iran and Qatar. ""What he's done for this country is amazing, the bridges, the roads, the financial aid. My house burnt down, they paid me an amount for my furniture, they made up for my loss,"" said Mohamad Baydoun, a Bint Jbeil resident. Iran was quick to infuse Hezbollahs coffers with cash, then handed out to residents who had lost their homes and otherwise been effected by the war. It is also Iran that paved roads and built bridges. The mayor of Bint Jbeil emphasized just how crucial Iranian aid to his country has been. ""If it weren't for that money people may have not returned to their homes until now,"" Afif Bazzi explained. ""The aid that Iran provided is considered one of the largest in helping rebuild after the July war, this money helped people a lot and that is why we saw people immediately returning."" Some experts say Ahmadinejad's visit is Iran's way of sending a clear message about its influence in the region, especially to the United States and Israel. ""Of course that usually is portrayed to mean that the Iranians are going to warn how much trouble they can cause, but the flip side of the message has always been, especially in recent years, look how much good we can do, look how much influence we have to help restrain things,"" Middle East analyst Marc Sirois said. Iran is undeniably part of Lebanese politics, a reality that has raised concerns among those who are fearful that an increased Iranian role could destabilize Lebanon and the region and embolden Hezbollah. Analysts also point to the fact that Lebanon is the first front against Israel. ""It (the visit) plays out the idea that the Iranians are a player. That in the last active front line against Israel, the Iranians are the power behind the most active and powerful political actor in Lebanon which is Hezbollah,"" Sirois said. The Israeli government has not formally responded to Ahmadinejad's visit but some say they view it as provocation. Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for the Israeli Foreign Ministry told CNN that Ahmadinejad's trip ""is taking the form of a land lord coming to inspect his domain."" ""Ahmadinejad makes no mystery of his view of Lebanon as Iran's border with Israel. It is quite clear that he comes to the region with malice toward all, with intention to destabilize an already volatile region at the service of the aggressive and extremist ideology of the ayatollahs,"" Palmor added. The Iranian president's planned visit to areas in Lebanon bordering northern Israel has led some in Israel to call for military action.

"(CNN) -- A Colombian has officially been declared the world's shortest man by Guinness World Records officials -- but his reign looks set to be short-lived. Edward Nino Hernandez, who stands just 70.21 centimeters (2 ft 3.46 in) tall, inherits a title previously held by Chinese man He Pingping who died earlier this year. But Hernandez is actually several centimeters shorter than Pingping, according to Craig Glenday, Editor-in-Chief of the Guinness World Records Book. ""Not only is he a new shortest man, he's even shorter than the previous record holder,"" said Glenday. Although Hernandez is formally recognized in the 2011 Guinness World Records book published this month, he is not expected to hold the title for long. Khagendra Thapa Magar, a teenager from Nepal who stands 65.5 centimeters (2 feet 1.8 inches) tall, turns 18 on October 14. Glenday said Pingping, who died in March aged 21, had been an iconic character. ""As a result of that there was a lot of interest from the small community. A lot of small men contacted us. When we heard about Edward's claim we sent one of our representatives over to his home in Bogota."" Hernandez, 24, was measured three times a day, both standing up and lying flat, with his official height calculated as an average measurement. The 24-year-old works alongside his parents and brothers at a family business manufacturing pajamas. He likes dancing to reggaeton and salsa music, according to the Guinness World Records website. ""I am very happy to be recognized as the shortest man in the world,"" Hernandez told the Guinness World Records website. ""Every person is different and unique. The more unusual you are the more you should fight and work harder.""","Edward Nino Hernandez stands just 70.21 centimeters (2 ft 3.46 in) tall .

"Dallas, Texas (CNN) -- At least four tornadoes spawned by Tropical Depression Hermine touched down in and around Dallas, Texas, on Wednesday evening, knocking down walls and smashing vehicles. Sirens went off in downtown Dallas as one funnel cloud was spotted in Cockrell Hill southwest of downtown, according to CNN affiliate WFAA. One tornado was reported in Ellis County and three in Dallas County, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward. Aerial footage from the area showed buildings in an industrial complex with walls knocked down and roofs blown off. The roof of a tractor-trailer truck in a parking lot was caved in by cement blocks blown from a nearby building. Are you there? Send your photos, videos to iReport . A spokesman for the Dallas Fire Department said Wednesday night that damage seemed to be isolated to a warehouse district on Mockingbird Lane in the western part of the city. There was one serious injury, Jason Evans of the fire department said. A truck driver's rig was picked up by the tornado, spun around and slammed into a warehouse. The driver was sitting in the cab of the truck when the front of the building collapsed on the truck. Further information on the driver and his injuries was not immediately available. CNN's Ed Lavandera: Eyewitness to a torndado . Operations at Dallas' Love Field airport were shut down temporarily as a tornado approached the field, according to Lynn Lunsford of the Federal Aviation Administration. Tower personnel were preparing to evacuate when the tornado turned away at the last minute, Lunsford said. ""Tornadoes are a common phenomenon on the eastern side of landfalling tropical systems due to increased turning of the winds with height or vertical wind shear,"" Ward said. Rescue workers across central and north Texas, meanwhile, plucked people stranded by fast-rising floodwater dumped by Hermine as it slogged northward. At least one motorist in Austin was missing. Texas Gov. Rick Perry directed the activation of state search-and-rescue capabilities, bringing in swift-water rescue teams, UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and other resources. ""I urge all Texans to realize the dangers of crossing flooded roadways and respect the barricades put in place by officials to protect Texans' lives,"" Perry said in a written statement. Forecasters had said most parts of central and eastern Texas and Oklahoma could receive 4 to 6 inches of rain, but the numbers for some parts of Texas were staggering. Before the bulk of the storm moved out of Texas, Georgetown had received 13.2 inches of rain Wednesday, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hydrometeorological Center. Cedar Park had received 12.9 inches; Anderson Mill, 12.7 inches; Killeen, 11.6 inches; and Austin, 11.4 inches. Fort Worth had recorded 6.8 inches of rain, San Antonio, 6.7 inches and Houston, 4.4 inches. Aerial images showed scores of flooded streets and some rescues in Dallas. Portions of Austin had endured 15 inches of rain, and a middle-age motorist was missing after her car was washed away, Emergency Management spokeswoman Reyne Telles said. The car was found. Thirty-two roads were closed, and an engineer from the watershed department said this could be a 250-year event, Telles told CNN. ""I haven't seen anything like this happen here before,"" said an employee at a County Line BBQ location near Bull Creek. ""One of the boat docks washed away, and there are boats and cars stranded in the river."" The restaurant was closed Wednesday but may reopen Thursday. The employee asked not to be identified. As of 5 p.m. ET, Hermine was about 135 miles (215 kilometers) southwest of Oklahoma City. It had maximum sustained winds of 25 mph (40 kph) and was moving at 12 mph (19 kph). By late afternoon, radar showed the rain was centered on eastern Oklahoma, with a line extending down to the Mexican border in eastern Texas. ""Additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 Inches with localized higher amounts can be expected through Thursday from eastern Texas and Oklahoma into Missouri and Arkansas,"" the National Hurricane Center said. Flash flood or flood warnings were in effect for much of those states. Meanwhile, newly formed Tropical Storm Igor was bringing ""squally"" weather to the Cape Verde Islands on Wednesday, the National Hurricane Center said. Track Tropical Storm Igor . As of 4 p.m. ET, the center of Igor was about 75 miles (120 kilometers) south-southwest of Praia in the Cape Verde Islands. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (72 kph) and was moving west at 6 mph (9 kph). The storm is expected to slowly strengthen over the next 48 hours, with a slight turn to the west-northwest and an increase in forward speed. A tropical storm watch was in effect for the southern Cape Verde Islands, including Maio, Sao Tiago, Fogo and Brava. Tropical storm conditions were possible in those locations in 12 to 24 hours, forecasters said. Tropical storm-force winds extended about 50 miles from Igor's center.

"(CNN)  -- Maria Sharapova swept past seventh seed Agnieszka Radwanska in straight sets to reach the quarterfinals of the $2 million WTA tournament in Cincinnati. The former world number one fought off a determined opponent and stifling heat in Ohio to record a 6-2 6-3 victory in their third round match. Sharapova, seeded 10th, secured two breaks of service to claim the opening set, but was pushed harder in the second by her Polish opponent, who had two break points in the third game. Sharapova saved them both and broke through in the sixth game as she took a 4-2 lead with an exquisite lob. The Russian ace held service comfortably to secure victory on her third match point after just over an hour and a half on court. Sharapova is making her first appearance at the tournament and faces a tough last eight clash against France's Marion Bartoli, who beat second seed Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark 6-4 6-1 in an earlier upset. Top seed Jelena Jankovic also departed Thursday as she was beaten 7-6 6-4 by qualifier Akgul Amanmuradova of Uzbekistan. But fellow Serbian and another former world number one, Ana Ivanovic, continued her fine play with a 6-0 6-3 rout of Elena Vesnina. Ivanovic will next play Amanmuradova, who reached the semifinals of the event in 2007. 12th-seeded Belgian Yanina Wickmayer also made the quarters by beating the eighth seed Li Na 2-6 6-2 7-6 in a thrilling three-setter.

"London, England (CNN) -- The new English Premier League season kicks off with the first round of fixtures this weekend - Fanzone details what to expect from the new campaign: . So what's new? There is no doubting the biggest Premier League news of the close season was Rafa Benitez leaving Liverpool to join European Champions League holders Inter Milan. With the increasingly cranky Spaniard gone, Liverpool plumped for Roy Hodgson who defied the odds last term by taking little old Fulham to the UEFA Cup final. Hodgson has arrived at Anfield bearing gifts: Chelsea's out-of-contract midfielder Joe Cole, who joined the Reds swapping places with the Israeli Yossi Benayoun, and Danish hard man Christian Poulsen. Frugality, however, clearly remains the order of the day in English football. That is apart from big spending Manchester City who continued to sprinkle some much needed glitz into the title race with big-name signings such as Yaya Toure, David Silva and Jerome Boateng. Such an outlay means that Roberto Mancini will now be under tremendous pressure to deliver a top-four finish. If City are going to upset the status quo they will need to stop the Chelsea juggernaut. Last season the London side boasted easily the league's strongest squad -- particularly up front where they were able to draw on the goal-scoring abilities of Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka. This term they will benefit should Brazilian international midfielder Ramires replace Michael Ballack but the move of Ricardo Carvalho to Real Madrid could prove a major loss. The red half of Manchester continues to take a cautious approach to their spending with Alex Ferguson opting for talented young prospects to boost his squad with the likes of Fulham defender Chris Smalling, Mexican forward Javier Hernandez and Portuguese striker Bebe. Arsenal spent the close season battling to hold onto their captain Cesc Fabregas while attempting to plug the gaps in an already porous defence created by the departure of William Gallas, Sol Campbell, Philippe Senderos and Mikael Silvestre. Initial signs from Arsenal's preseason suggest that Arsene Wenger may have once again pulled a couple of rabbits out of his hat with the signing of new boys Laurent Koscielny and Marouane Chamakh. Arsenal will have to be on top of their game if they are to once again keep the likes of Manchester City and Champions League debutants Tottenham Hotspur from overtaking them. If being relatively hard-up wasn't enough of a cross to bear for the Premier League's football bosses, they have also had to deal with a new 'home-grown' ruling which demands squads must contain no more than 25 players over 21 with eight of those having spent at least three years in England from under the age of 21. The aim of this new law is to encourage young talent in the British game and to prevent the stockpiling of foreign stars. Take note, Roberto Mancini. Key players: When all was said and done last season, Chelsea won the title because they could rely on the goal-scoring heroics of two world class strikers: Didier Drogba and Nicolas Anelka. When one was injured or out of sorts, the other would come into the team and do the business. No other side could boast such an embarrassment of riches especially in these financially difficult times. Ferguson will need at least one of Dimitar Berbatov, Michael Owen, Federico Macheda or Javier Martinez to help lessen the burden on Wayne Rooney if United are to wrestle the title back from Chelsea. Meanwhile, if Liverpool are to fire their way back into the Champions league, new boy Milan Jovanovic, who turned down Real Madrid to join the Anfield outfit, will need to offer the kind of goal threat that the side so often lacked in the absence of Fernando Torres. Key clubs:  Once again, all eyes will be on Manchester City to see if they can maintain an assault on the top spots. Last season, many of their new signings failed to gel and a lack of consistency saw Tottenham seize that crucial Champions League slot. City's squad looks considerably stronger this season with a number of big name signings. Their bid for European football may be made easier if Spurs struggle to cope with the increased demands of playing in Europe. Outside of Manchester United and Chelsea, the only club who could conceivably make a bid for the title are Arsenal. However, unless Arsene Wenger can fix his side's defensive frailties, a lack of steel could prove to be their undoing again. At the other end of the table, the Premier League welcomes back Newcastle United who spent last season in the Championship but returned as worthy champions. The Magpies are joined by perennial yo yo club West Bromwich Albion and Blackpool who are led by the ever entertaining Ian Holloway. The team known as ""The Tangerines"" -- due to their bright orange kits -- may not be expected to gain many points this coming season but should be entertaining. Expert view:  CNN's Alex Thomas - ""12 months ago, I correctly predicted that Chelsea would stop Manchester United's run of Premier League triumphs -- but that doesn't make it any easier to pick this season's English champions. ""Chelsea's squad is still strong, although their defense is weaker now that Ricardo Carvalho has left and Alex is injured. And I'm not convinced by Branislav Ivanovic at center half. ""However, the Blues should be stronger in attack if Florent Malouda and Salomon Kalou build on the improvement they showed last season, while Michael Essien and Jon Obi Mikel will benefit from the extra rest after injuries prevented them playing at the World Cup. ""Although plenty of experts predict an open race for the Premier League title, it's hard to see anyone but Manchester United pushing the champions by the time we get to the dying weeks of the season. ""Even Alex Ferguson admitted his team missed Cristiano Ronaldo last season but wingers Nani and Antonio Valencia will only get better and the club has bought well. If they add an attacking midfielder to their squad they are my pick to win back the title. ""The other two places in the top four will be contested by the usual suspects and I see money talking loudest, with Manchester City finishing behind United and Chelsea but above Arsenal and Tottenham. ""Liverpool will have a fight on their hands to improve one place to sixth, with Merseyside rivals Everton their closest challengers. Martin O'Neill's late exit has shot Aston Villa in the foot.""","Champions Chelsea still the team to beat thanks to Drogba/Anelka strike force .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Actress Lindsay Lohan showed little emotion as a deputy put her in handcuffs in a Beverly Hills, California, courtroom Tuesday morning to take her to jail to begin what it expected to be a two-week stay. The actress, wearing a top that exposed part of her back, was surrounded by deputies and was quickly walked to a nearby side door labeled ""secure area."" ""We love you, Lindsay,"" her father, Michael Lohan, said as she disappeared. Lohan was ""cooperative"" as she was booked into the Century Regional Detention Facility about an hour later, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. Superior Court Judge Marsha Revel had ordered Lohan to report to the courtroom to begin serving a sentence for a probation violation. Revel ordered that Lohan not be allowed to leave jail on a work-release or house-release program or with electronic monitoring during her sentence. The judge said, however, she has no control over how much of the 90-day sentence Lohan will end up serving. The sheriff, who runs the jail, has the power to release prisoners early because of jail overcrowding. Lohan should be released from jail after between 13 to 15 days ""unless something unusual happens,"" Whitmore said. He said it was routine for inmates who qualify for good behavior credits in jail to only serve 25 percent of their sentence. Lohan must enter a substance-abuse rehabilitation program within 24 hours of leaving jail, Revel said. ""I would like the transition to be sooner rather than later,"" she said. The judge placed tight restrictions on what the public would be able to see at Tuesday's hearing. While the world watched as Lohan, 24, broke down in tears at her sentencing July 6, the public was not able to see the actress handcuffed and taken into custody Tuesday. Cameras stopped rolling when the judge announced that Lohan was to be taken into custody. The judge also ordered that photos of Lohan must be restricted to those that showed her at the counsel table. The actress was ordered to serve 90 days in jail for missing alcohol counseling sessions in violation of her probation. She was also sentenced to spend 90 days in the drug and alcohol rehabilitation program after her jail term is completed. Lohan's next court date will come a week after her release from jail, although if she is in a rehab program her lawyer can appear without her, the judge said. Michael Lohan, whose estrangement from his daughter has been very public, sat two rows behind Lohan during the sentencing. His lawyer told reporters after the hearing that he was ""devastated"" that she was going to jail. The actress will be ""treated just as any other"" inmate in the jail, although she will have her own cell and remain apart from the general inmate population, the sheriff's spokesman said. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on charges of driving under the influence, and in the second incident she was charged with cocaine possession. The first arrest came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police, saying Lohan was trying to run her down with a car. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later, when she played identical twins in Disney's remake of ""The Parent Trap.""

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Sarah Shourd, one of three American hikers detained in Iran for more than a year, could be released as early as Monday once $500,000 is submitted to the Iranian judiciary. ""Everything is in place for the release,"" said lawyer Massoud Shafii, who got to see the hikers for the first time on Sunday. ""It's up to the family when to deliver the money."" The official Islamic Republic News Agency reported earlier Sunday that Shourd will be released if bail worth about $500,000 for her is submitted to the Iranian judiciary. ""We are waiting for the bail set for Sarah Shourd to be deposited by (the) Swiss embassy in Iran,"" Shafii told the semi-official Iran Students' News Agency (ISNA) Monday. ""... During my meeting with the client's family, we agreed to take measures for her release as soon as the money is provided."" Shafii said of Shourd on Sunday, ""Naturally she was happy, but her wish is for all three to be released together."" He met the Americans at Tehran's Evin prison after the prosecutor for Tehran's Revolutionary Court announced the offer to release Shourd on bail. ""I saw them and spoke to them,"" Shafii told CNN. ""They were doing well."" Shafii said he doesn't know when exactly the release would take place. Samantha Topping, a representative for the mothers of the hikers, said they are still taking in the news and are not yet making public comments. Topping had no comment on the bail money. Switzerland, which represents U.S. interests in the country, had little information to release Sunday. ""Technicalities demanded by the attorney general are currently under consideration by the embassy in Tehran,"" Swiss Ambassador Livia Leu-Agosti told CNN. Shourd had a pre-existing gynecological problem, but her family says she now also has a lump in her breast, according to Shafii. She still could be charged, and authorities would still expect her to come back to Iran for a trial. But other foreigners who have been released on bail after imprisonment in Iran have left the country and not come back. Iranian officials had announced Thursday that Shourd would be released on Saturday, at the end of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. But state media announced Friday that the release had been called off because legal procedures had not yet been resolved. On Sunday, Tehran Prosecutor General Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi announced the country's ""readiness for the conditional release of one of the three U.S. citizens arrested for illegally entering the country,"" state-run Press TV said. A judge decided to allow Shourd to be released on bail because of an ailment, Dolatabadi said, according to IRNA. Dolatabadi said Shourd would be free after bail is paid, but needs to take part in the trial when it is held, according to ISNA. Shourd, 32, Shane Bauer, 28, and Josh Fattal, 28, were detained July 31, 2009, after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border into Iran while hiking in Iraq's Kurdistan region. Tehran has accused the three hikers of spying. Iran's intelligence minister has hinted the country may consider releasing them in exchange for the release of Iranian prisoners, according to state news outlets. Dolatabadi said authorities completed investigations on espionage charges against the three Americans over the past several days and the indictments have already been issued by the judge in charge of the case, IRNA reported. He said the arrest warrants have been issued for Bauer and Fattal. The hikers' families' website, freethehikers.org, said Shourd has been in solitary confinement, able to meet for only two 30-minute periods per day with Bauer, who is her fiance, and Fattal. The two men share a cell. All three Americans are graduates of the University of California, Berkeley. They have been able to telephone their families only once, on March 9. The United States and Iran have had no diplomatic relations for three decades, and Washington is not involved in moves to free Shourd, a State Department spokesman said Sunday. ""We are in wait-and-see mode. We want all three hostages released and returned,"" State Department spokesman Fred Lash told CNN. The State Department is monitoring the situation, but all diplomacy is being handled by the Swiss Embassy, he said. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr, Reza Sayah, Tenisha Abernathy, Ross Levitt, Susan Candiotti and Nunu Japaridze contributed to this report.","""Everything is in place for the release,"" her lawyer says .

"(CNN) -- First-degree murder charges have been filed against a man who Baltimore, Maryland, police believe killed an off-duty detective by striking him in the head during a dispute over a parking space, authorities said Sunday. Sian James, 25, is suspected in the death of Brian Stevenson, an 18-year police veteran, who was out celebrating his 38th birthday with a friend late Saturday night when an argument ensued over a parking spot outside a restaurant, police said. According to witnesses, James picked up a piece of concrete and threw it at Stevenson, hitting him in the head. The attack occurred around 10 p.m. Stevenson was rushed to Johns Hopkins hospital, where he died. Police say James fled the scene and was apprehended later at a nearby night club.

"(CNN) -- Actress Eva Mendes volunteers regularly with The Art of Elysium, an organization that enables actors, artists and musicians to share their talents with children who are battling serious medical conditions. She was also a presenter at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" in 2009. Mendes recently sat down to talk to CNN producer Quinn Brown about CNN Heroes and her philanthropy. Below are excerpts from that interview. Quinn Brown: What inspired you to get involved with The Art of Elysium? Eva Mendes: I'm a sucker for kids, and I also know the importance of art and what it can do to someone's life. Coming from a low-income family, I didn't know that art was this release ... so it's really important for me to make sure that kids know: ""You have a voice. You can put this to paper. ... You can put this to canvas."" What we do is we bring the arts, in any way we can, into hospitals. Some of these children have been bedridden for years, so they obviously can't go out and play. So we sing. We read to the children. We finger-paint -- that's a really fun one -- and it's amazing what you see. You get a real direct, immediate result. These children, they're just these beautiful little souls. Some of these kids can't speak, so they really just have their eyes and their souls to communicate. And when you finger-paint with a kid or you dance and you see their little eyes light up, it's pretty incredible. And when you start visiting them on a regular basis, you see their growth. It's really quite special. Brown: Has there been a particular child who inspired you? Mendes: David is one of the most creative souls I've ever met. He ends up writing a play every year for Christmas, and we end up all acting in it. David has now written three plays for me. He's a demanding director. David's face is completely deformed, and he has a lot of internal problems and health issues due to his deformities. He's this awesome kid who's found a purpose and who's found a voice through The Art of Elysium. Brown: It sounds like you're pretty involved. Mendes: I would love to say that I give selflessly, but that's not true; what I get back is tenfold. My vocabulary doesn't even contain the words I feel once I leave the hospital. There is total sense of purpose and fulfillment that I feel that I don't get from any other area of my life. It's a two-way deal. It's just so gratifying. Brown: Do you have any heroes? What is a hero to you? Mendes: Charity and giving back begins at home, and that is really important to remember. You can be out there saving the world, but if you're not trying to save your own family and doing the work at home, it doesn't really make any sense. You asked me who my hero is -- my mom. She is a survivor in every sense of the word, and it began at home with her. She is a very compassionate woman, and she always taught me to think about other people. As bad as things were for us, there was always someone who was worse off. That always put me in a state of gratitude, and I thank her for that. But that, to me, is a hero. A woman who is a survivor and doesn't let life beat them down. Brown: Moving onto CNN Heroes, you were a presenter at ""CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute"" last year. How did that compare to other awards shows you've been to? Mendes: Can I say a bad word? It wasn't full of s---. It was real. It was inspiring. I left that night feeling like I wanted to change the world right then and there. It was beautiful because you have all of these people coming together, swapping stories and ideas. It was just amazing to have all of these ""good-doers"" in one room together. It's a lot of power. It's a lot of energy, and that's inspiring. Brown: What was it like to see all of those heroes? How did it affect you personally? Mendes: It makes me realize that, due to this celebrity thing, I do have a light that follows me around. So what I choose to do with that light is shine it on other things that are important, not just what I'm wearing. ... So it just keeps everything in perspective and makes me realize my purpose as well and the purpose of this crazy thing called celebrity.","Actress Eva Mendes is among those helping to bring the arts to seriously ill children .

"Washington (CNN) -- For most divers, a shark in the water can inspire fear, or even dread. Greg Marshall wanted to hitch a ride. More specifically, Marshall was inspired by the shark's constant companion, a remora -- a torpedo-shaped fish that commonly catches a ride by sucking onto the shark's rough skin and thriving on the shark's leftovers. Marshall thought to himself: What if you had a camera as small as a remora? What if you could stick a camera on a shark so that the shark goes about its life, unaware that its actions were being recorded away from the distractions of photographers in scuba suits? Where would it go, and what would you see? For a naturalist, being able to observe animal behavior without interfering with the world the animal inhabits by the simple act of being there is the gold standard. In scientific terms, it's similar to a control in an experiment. But that goal is usually unobtainable -- observing how an animal acts in captivity, for example, is no indication of how an animal actually behaves. Observing that behavior in the wild, Marshall says, is equally problematic. ""When we're in an animal's habitat, they know we're there,"" he says. ""And they're reacting to us."" And knowledge of an animal's actual behavior, Marshall says, is absolutely critical to reaching the correct conclusions about a creature's habitat and behavior, and how humans may be disrupting both. Of course, the best way to observe real behavior in the wild is to have omniscient powers of observation, or perhaps a camera lens as long as your arm and as expensive as a new car. Or you can see what the animal sees, courtesy of ""Crittercam."" Twenty-five years after that underwater epiphany in the waters off Belize, Marshall and his far-flung team of naturalists and engineers are getting closer to that gold standard. Technology may finally be catching up with inspiration. Marshall took his initial ideas for ride-along observation technology to the National Geographic Society in 1987. Now he's vice president of the society's Remote Imaging division -- an effort by a team of scientists and engineers working with researchers around the globe capturing footage of how animals behave in the wild, away from the interference of the observers. ""Crittercam enables us to get out of the picture entirely -- to ride along, almost completely unobtrusively, to see their world and their behavior,"" he says. Marshall is a real-deal explorer, a tall, lanky, gregarious type who seems more suited to a dive boat in the Sea of Cortez or a snowmobile in Antarctica than an impressively equipped machine shop in the basement of the fabled headquarters of the National Geographic Society. Marshall still gets more than his fair share of exploration -- a day after this interview, he was off to Antarctica, again. But more often he's back in Washington, at his desk or in an edit bay. Still, adventure is where you find it -- and sometimes, it's in the most unlikely of places. Cracking open a newly recovered Crittercam remora (or box, or sphere, or whatever device his crew of happily mad scientists invent to capture hitherto-unwitnessed moments in nature) is, for Marshall, full of the rush of exploration. When Crittercam got its start, the results of all the hard work came down to a small, fragile tape. Nowadays, the data is stored on a tough, solid-state memory card. But seeing the data of the first time, Marshall says, is always a rush. ""You start looking at the screen because you never know what you're going to see. It's completely engaging and captivating,"" he says. The results, Marshall says, run the gamut from inspiring and revelatory to downright boring -- at least, boring to a typical National Geographic Channel viewer. But to a marine biologist like Marshall, even the ""boring"" stuff can have stop-in-your-tracks potential. Case in point: Sperm whales. They are one of the deepest-diving species on the planet. Years ago, his crew successfully attached an advanced Crittercam to a diving sperm whale. ""The first 10 seconds are fascinating, because you see the whale diving down,"" Marshall says. ""And then it dives down into utter darkness. And then we're looking at a black screen for the next two hours."" But that Crittercam was also equipped to record sound, as well as video. And in that utter blackness (sperm whales can dive almost two miles down), the Crittercam whale began a conversation with another whale -- a cascade of powerful, rapid-fire clicks. That whale conversation kept Marshall and his editors transfixed. It wasn't a made-for-TV moment, but it was yet more evidence that just about every deployment of the Crittercam system can reap unexpected rewards. In the frigid waters off Alaska, a Crittercam captured an intimate view of a humpback whale calf nursing. There's dizzying footage of a tree kangaroo (yes, there's a kangaroo that climbs trees) high in the jungle canopy of New Guinea. A sea lion in Australia plays with its food -- in this case, a hapless octopus. There's even a brief glimpse of a great white shark swimming at eye-popping speed, chasing an equally quick seal. ""You just never know what you're going to get -- it's just completely engaging,"" he says with a broad grin. Crittercam footage finds its way into many of National Geographic's nature programs. And the best Crittercam moments are a rare combination of good television and good science. That's partly the goal of the whole program, Marshall says. ""I want to find a way to connect with people, I want to find a way to make them care about the conservation problem,"" Marshall says. ""Imagine a planet where there are no humpback whales, where there are no blue whales, no leopard seals, no leatherback turtles. Can we survive? Absolutely we can survive... Well, probably. ""Is it going to be the kind of place we're going to revel in, that's going to inspire us? I doubt it. As we know more, we're going to care more -- and as we care more, we're going to protect these animals and the habitats they depend on.""","For a naturalist, observing animals in the wild is key to learning about species .

"(CNN) -- The United States is no longer in the running to host soccer's 2018 World Cup after its bid committee decided to withdraw from contention and focus on hosting the 2022 tournament instead. The USA Bid Committee announced on Friday it had made the decision after ""several months of careful deliberation"" following meetings with the sport's world ruling body FIFA and Europe's controlling organization UEFA. The withdrawal leaves just four candidates for the 2018 tournament -- all of them from Europe. England and Russia face competition from dual bids comprised of Spain/Portugal and Belgium/Netherlands. The U.S. will be up against Australia, Japan, South Korea and Qatar as it seeks to host soccer's showpiece event for the second time, having staged it in 1994. Because the tournament cannot be held on the same continent twice in succession, that means none of the 2018 bids can now target 2022, and vice versa. ""For some time we have been in conversations with FIFA and UEFA about the possibility of focusing only on the 2022 bidding process, an option we have made reference to many times,"" bid chairman Sunil Gulati, also the president of U.S. Soccer, said in a statement. ""We are confident this is in the best interests of the USA Bid. We wanted to make the announcement now -- still 48 days before the final decision -- in order to make our intentions clear during the last part of our campaign."" FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke welcomed the decision, saying it made sense given the location of the four other 2018 candidates. ""We have had an open and constructive dialogue with the USA Bid for some time now, after it became apparent that there was a growing movement to stage the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Europe,"" he said. ""The announcement by the USA Bid to focus solely on the 2022 FIFA World Cup is therefore a welcome gesture which is much appreciated by FIFA."" FIFA's Switzerland-based executive committee will meet in Zurich on October 28-29 to further discuss the final voting process ahead of the December 2 decision on both tournaments.","U.S. decides to focus on its bid to win right to host the 2022 World Cup .

"(CNN) -- The experiment of extra match officials will be extended to Europe's top club competition and several other tournaments around the world. Football's governing body FIFA will allow the use of two additional assistant referees in the UEFA Champions League for the next two seasons and the Asian Football Confederation's President's Cup in September, as well as competitions in Brazil, France and Mexico. The experiment, which involves an assistant behind the goal at either end of the pitch, was first tried at youth level and then last season in UEFA's second-tier Europa League. The confirmation came after a meeting of the International Football Association Board's technical sub-committee in Wales on Wednesday, which also announced that goal-line technology will be discussed in October. FIFA has been under increasing pressure to change its current system of match officiating following controversial incidents at the 2010 World Cup that saw England wrongly denied a goal against Germany and Argentina incorrectly awarded a score against Mexico. Blatter relents over goal-line technology . The IFAB, which includes representatives from FIFA and the four British associations, ruled out employing goal-line technology at a meeting in March. FIFA said in a statement on its website on Wednesday that the extra officials will be used until 2012, when a decision will be made whether to establish them as a fulltime feature of the game. It said the relevant member associations would have to fund the extra costs involved.","The Champions League will experiment with extra match officials for next two seasons .

"Washington (CNN) -- Removing Saddam Hussein from power was the right move, but the United States made mistakes in the aftermath, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN on Friday. In an interview to be broadcast Monday on CNN International's ""Connect the World"" program, Rice acknowledged a failure to focus rebuilding efforts throughout the country and attributed the problem to a lack of understanding. ""I do believe I would take Saddam Hussein out of power again, but of course in the rebuilding of Iraq ... I would do things differently,"" Rice said. ""I think we put too much emphasis on Baghdad and not enough emphasis on the provinces. Perhaps we didn't fully understand the degree to which the society would start to come apart as a result of being held in tyranny for all those years."" At the same time, Rice said it is still too early to fully judge the success or failure of that war or other foreign policy issues in the administration of George W. Bush. ""Sometimes things that look terrific at the time look pretty bad in retrospect, and vice versa, so ultimately this is a story that will be written in history,"" said Rice, who served as secretary of state for the second of Bush's two four-year terms as president. Rice had a full day in Washington planned, including several interviews, two speeches and a White House meeting with President Barack Obama. A memoir on her childhood, as well as a version for young readers, came out this week. The invitation from a sitting president to a former Cabinet member is ""not that unusual,"" Rice said, adding that she believes they'll discuss ""a range of foreign policy issues."" ""It's whatever the president wants to talk about,"" she said. Obama has criticized the Bush administration for shifting focus from Afghanistan to Iraq, which he says stalled the effort to vanquish the Taliban insurgency and prevent Afghanistan from again becoming a haven for al Qaeda and other terrorists to launch attacks against the United States. White House spokesman Bill Burton told reporters Friday that with Rice scheduled to be in Washington, Obama wanted to ""chat"" with her. Burton said a wide range of foreign policy issues would be discussed. Rice spoke further about Iraq when answering questions after a luncheon speech at the National Press Club, saying the purpose of the U.S. invasion was to get rid of the threat posed by Hussein. ""We didn't go to war in Iraq to democratize Iraq,"" she said, adding that the United States didn't fight Adolf Hitler in World War II to democratize Germany. ""You go to war when there is a security threat, and Saddam Hussein was seen as a threat to our interests and our security,"" Rice said. While acknowledging that ""we could have done many, many things much, much better,"" she noted that removing Hussein from power changed Iraq for the better. ""What is the conversation we're having about Iraq today?"" she asked, noting it didn't involve weapons of mass destruction and other issues from the Hussein era. Instead, it's about whether Sunni and Shiite factions can form a coalition government, she said. Rice, the second African-American in history to serve as secretary of state, also said that while race relations in America have improved enormously in her lifetime, ""there is no more sensitive or more difficult issue in the United Sates than race."" ""This is not a color-blind society,"" she said. ""When somebody walks in the door, you do see color."" Asked about her possible political future, Rice made clear she has no plans to run for office any time soon. She said she keeps responding to the question by saying the time's not right, and added: ""Maybe the time isn't ever going to be right."" ""I got to be secretary of state,"" Rice said. ""That's quite enough."" In her interview with CNN International, Rice also commented on domestic issues. Asked about the conservative Tea Party movement in the United States that has roiled Republican politics, Rice said there is no reason to fear such grass-roots democratic expression, even if she differs with Tea Party supporters on some issues. ""The Tea Party is, of course, a vast collection of people and there are lots of views which I would not associate with -- I am a free trader and I believe in defending immigration -- but the best way to understand the Tea Party is that it really is a grass-roots movement, and in that sense it's healthy,"" she said. Rice attributed the rise of the Tea Party movement to ""a sense that Washington, with big government and deficit spending, has lost touch."" On her successor at the helm of the State Department, Rice said Hillary Clinton is doing a ""fine job."" ""It's a tough job,"" she said. ""You're always on an airplane. Sometimes you never quite know what country you're in, and you're always hoping you're not going to make the mistake and say you're in a country that you're not in. I did it on one occasion, but I hope no one noticed."" Rice also will be interviewed Friday on CNN's ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer."" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this story.","NEW: American society isn't color-blind, Rice says .

"(CNN) -- If a grown man likes to dress up and pretend he's a Nazi killer, is that a problem? One candidate in America's upcoming Congressional elections acknowledges the satisfaction he gets from historical re-enactments, drawing attention to both a strange subculture and a surprising twist in Republican Party politics. ""The whole purpose of re-enacting is educating people,"" Rich Iott, a Republican candidate in the state of Ohio said this week. ""This is just another way to communicate a story and keep alive the history of World War Two."" The history of World War Two is just one of several conflicts that Iott says he helped imitate as costume-drama he could enjoy with his son. In that role, he assumed the identity of ""Reinhard Pferdmann,"" a fictitious member of a real division of the Waffen SS, the armed wing of the Nazi Party. Iott's adopted unit was accused of war crimes and once included infamous sadist Joseph Mengele in its ranks. Though re-enactments are fairly common in America, this kind of Nazi playtime is an unusual way for am American parent to raise a child. Republican Eric Cantor, a Jewish lawmaker who is one of the party's most powerful members of Congress, quickly condemned it. ""I would absolutely repudiate that and not support an individual who would do something like that,"" Cantor said. Military re-enactment is, to be sure, a popular hobby that appeals to people far beyond American borders. British history buffs re-fight wars of the 17th century. Russian enthusiasts stage the 1812 Battle of Borodino every year, predictably punishing Napoleon every time. (One of them fired the blanks in his gunpowder pistol close enough to CNN correspondent Ivan Watson to damage his hearing). But re-enactment may be most popular in the U.S., where devotees gather just about every weekend with the distinctive weapons and garb of the Civil War, enjoying or ignoring the gaze of quizzical onlookers on the sidelines. A lot of Americans are watching from the sidelines now because Iott, an Ohio businessman making his first attempt at elected office, has joined a growing list of candidates with surprises swirling around them. Several of them are favorites of the Tea Party, an anti-incumbent insurgency that is growing, mostly among Republicans. It is precisely because the Tea Party supports new, untested candidates that some of them have startled the public. Senate hopeful Christine O'Donnell is a self-described religious conservative who acknowledged that she once ""dabbled in witchcraft."" She is now broadcasting advertisements with an unusual campaign pitch: ""I am not a witch."" Carl Paladino, a candidate for governor of New York state, was quickly dubbed ""Crazy Carl"" in the press for intemperate outbursts and the angry tone of his campaign. He publicly threatened to ""take out "" a troublesome reporter, using colorful slang to suggest physical assault or worse. But Democrats have nominated a strange candidate of their own: an unemployed and previously unknown figure named Alvin Greene, the party's nominee for the U.S. Senate in South Carolina, whose most remarkable attribute is that he is being prosecuted on pornography charges. They're the kind of personalities that pop up in American public life from time to time, making the U.S. seem as much an oversized circus as a super-power. You never have to wait long for the next memorable performance. But there are limits to what the audience will accept. America's Conservatives really are conservative after all, and its Liberals invented a concept called ""Political Correctness"" to set their own standards for appropriate talk and behavior. This is a testy time in American life, with all kinds of candidates emerging to express discontent with the country's political class. One of them is denying she was ever really involved in the occult. Another is trying to distance himself from some dirty pictures. Now that we've been introduced to an unapologetic Nazi imitator, you can only wonder who's next.","Rich Iott, a Republican candidate in Ohio, dresses as an Waffen SS officer for historical re-enactments .

"Washington (CNN) -- In rural southern Virginia, 14-term Democratic Rep. Rick Boucher says he's never had an election enemy quite like the ones he's facing this year. Its not his opponent, but instead it's what he calls a ""shadowy"" group that is funding television ads against him. ""Rick Boucher is trying to deceive you ... Boucher has failed to protect our jobs. Now it's time Rick Boucher loses his,"" the ad's narrator says. The 30-second commercial was paid for by Americans for Job Security, a conservative-leaning group which, according to the nonpartisan watchdog group OpenSecrets.org, has spent nearly $8 million against Democratic candidates nationwide. On its website, Americans for Jobs Security states that its members are ""businesses, business leaders and entrepreneurs from around the country,"" but blatantly states it will not disclose the names of its individual members or donors. Boucher, who says he's spent $300,000 of his campaign funds to counter the ad, rails against the secretive nature of the organization. ""We have no idea who these individuals are,"" Boucher said. ""It could be someone who has a corporate identity in the United States. It could be a very wealthy individual who has some grudge against me and is putting this advertisement on the air as a consequence."" Americans for Job Security identifies itself on its website as a 501(c)(6) business league. That's a tax status for a nonprofit operation that can be involved in politics but not as its primary purpose. This particular tax status also means it does not have to disclose its donors. Read IRS regulations on 501(c)(6) business leagues . Groups such as Americans for Job Security are outside the Democratic and Republican parties and are likely benefiting from a Supreme Court decision earlier this year. That ruling, made on free speech grounds, allows corporations and unions to spend unlimited money to help defeat or promote candidates. That means even watchdog groups that track money flowing through elections can't find out who funds the groups. ""When you're just trying to figure out who is truly behind that television message that you're seeing on TV, you don't know who's behind it, and that makes it more difficult as a voter to actually have the requisite information to go into the voting booth and make an informed choice,"" said Dave Levinthal of OpenSecrets.org. Republican sources have told CNN that Americans for Job Security has only one full-time employee, Steve DeMaura. His office is in Alexandria, Virginia, across the Potomac River from Washington. CNN left multiple phone messages for DeMaura, but he did not return the calls. Conservative-leaning outside groups have already spent $121.6 million this election season compared with $79.1 million spent by liberal-leaning outside groups, according to OpenSecrets.org. Another conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, expects to raise and spend about $35 million this election. ""We simply educate the public,"" said Tim Phillips, the group's president. Part of that money is funding a television ad running in Colorado targeting first-term Democratic Rep. Betsy Markey, which says, ""To small businesses, Betsy Markey is the same as Nancy Pelosi."" Who are Americans for Prosperity's donors? The Texas billionaire Koch brothers are the group's founders and give significant dollars. But besides them, it's unclear. Phillips also makes no apologies for not revealing donors. ""Most of it is private individuals, but we're glad to have their support and we do tell them, 'Look we're going to protect your privacy as the law allows us to do.' "" President Obama has made it a regular practice lately to call out Americans for Prosperity by name in his effort to attack outside groups for spending tens of millions against Democrats without disclosing donors. ""They are now allowed to spend as much as they want, unlimited amounts of money, and they don't have to reveal who is paying for these ads,"" Obama said at a recent Democratic fundraiser. ""Millions of dollars being spent by groups with harmless-sounding names, Americans for Prosperity, the Committee for Truth in Politics, or Moms for Motherhood."" Phillips said the president's attacks have actually helped Americans for Prosperity raise more money. ""If the president wants to use us as a punching bag, let him,"" he said. ""It does help funding, and it helps generate new grassroots support."" Despite tough talk from Obama targeting Republican-backed outside groups, it's a mutual election-year undertaking. Democrats have their own groups supporting them, such as Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund and Citizens for Strength and Security Action Fund, which are not disclosing their donors. In New Mexico, where former Rep. Steve Pearce is running for his old seat, Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund is running an ad against him. As eerie music plays in the background the narrator says, ""Congressman Steve Pearce, named one of the most corrupt members of Congress."" In Washington state, Citizens for Strength and Security Action Fund is running an ad promoting Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. And Democrats have smaller outside groups aimed at getting Democratic voters to the polls. Our Community Votes was originally started by veteran union strategist Steve Rosenthal. This year, according to an official familiar with the organization, it is running programs in Missouri, Maryland and Pennsylvania  to encourage Democratic voters to go the polls. They're targeting African-American voters and ""drop-off voters,"" those who went to the polls for Obama in 2008 but may not be likely to return for this year's midterm election. Our Community Votes is yet another Democratic group that does not disclose its donors. Democrats are also using a new weapon in the big money game of politics: the super PAC. Super PACs work independently of candidates. Unlike regular political action committees, they can raise and spend unlimited money to try to defeat or promote candidates. But super PACs must disclose their donors. Patriot Majority is one of the biggest of these new groups, and it is concentrating its efforts in Nevada, spending at least $5 million so far on ads against Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's opponent, Republican Sharron Angle. The television ad's narrator begins, ""For a victim of rape or incest, Sharron Angle would force her to have the baby."" The ad then plays audio of Angle. ""Two wrongs don't make a right."" Craig Varoga, a longtime Democratic strategist who runs Patriot Majority, told CNN his group will significantly step up spending in the final three weeks before the election. Varoga expects to raise and spend as much as $10 million on the Reid race and other key Democratic races around the country. Varoga says his group is funded mostly by labor unions, in-state individual supporters and nonunion progressive groups, but he did not provide the names of these groups. Watchdog organizations say transparency is still a problem with these groups. ""They don't have to do it [reveal donors] in real time,"" said Levinthal of OpenSecrets.org. ""If they put a television ad up, there's no disclaimer at the end of the advertisement saying that this ad was paid for by these different corporations or these different unions. ""In fact, since Patriot Majority raised most of its money in the past few months, recent Federal Election Commission filings don't reveal the majority of its donors. Patriot Majority's third quarter FEC filing is due this week -- three weeks before the election -- and will list the more recent donors."" Varoga laments that Democrats are lagging behind Republican efforts to use these new political identities to raise large sums of money. ""They are Goliath, and we are David,"" he said. ""We are fighting back, and we're going to use the slingshot that we have in order to fight this fight."" Another super PAC is American Families First Action Fund. It's an outside group organized primarily by a Democratic insider, who once headed up Democratic Party efforts to elect members to Congress. He helped start the group five weeks ago to compete with Republicans. And although American Families First Action Fund is required to disclose who funds it, CNN is told that the group itself was one of the secret donors to the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund in its ad against Pearce. It is a hard trail to follow, which underscores the point that Democrats, too, are trying to play carefully in what the president calls a shadowy world. In fact, while American Families First Action Fund may be a super PAC that must disclose its donors, it has a sister organization, Americans Families Fund Inc., which does not. Multiple Democratic sources tell CNN there is great frustration in some Democratic circles with the president's attacks on Republican groups. These sources say the president has made it harder to persuade Democratic donors to contribute to their outside groups, which for better or worse, are emerging as significant players in this year's election.","Political groups operate outside parties and do not have to reveal members or donors .
It's difficult for voters to figure out who is behind messaging, watchdog group says .

"(CNN) -- President Obama issued a presidential order on Friday authorizing emergency funds to Pakistan's flood victims, the White House announced Friday. The president said the use of the Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund was in the United States' interest. Up to $33 million can go toward the country's crisis. Pakistani disaster officials said Wednesday that recent floods have killed about 1,677 people and 17 million have been affected nationwide. The United Nations, meanwhile, warned that a crisis is building in the eastern province of Balochistan, where nearly 2 million people are affected. Mengeshe Kebede, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' representative to Pakistan, said there is a ""humanitarian tragedy"" taking place in Balochistan, with imminent threats of water-borne diseases and food shortages. ""We need to scale up our activities in the province, or else I think we are heading for a major humanitarian disaster there,"" Kebede said. ""I have worked in humanitarian situations globally, and worked in refugee camps in Africa during emergencies, but to be honest I had never seen a situation as devastating as I saw in Balochistan,"" he said.","Obama approves urgent emergency funds for Pakistan's flood victims .

"(CNN) -- Lab tests found hundreds of cases of salmonella contamination at an Iowa farm in a nearly two-year period before the outbreak that prompted a massive recall of eggs this summer, congressional investigators said Tuesday. Wright County Egg is one of two farms at the center of the massive recall. In a letter to its owner, Austin ""Jack"" DeCoster, leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said tests confirmed 426 cases of salmonella contamination between September 2008 and the past July, and 73 were ""potentially"" positive for the strain of the disease involved in this year's outbreak. The committee's Democratic leaders asked DeCoster to explain those findings when he appears at a September 21 hearing. They also called on him to explain why those test reports weren't included in material the company has provided to Congress so far, and demanded that the company produce ""all documents relating to your response to the test results"" by Wednesday. ""Despite the committee's specific request, your response on September 11, 2010, did not include the 73 potentially positive results for Salmonella enteritidis,"" Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman and investigations subcommittee chairman Bart Stupak wrote. ""It also did not show whether Wright County Egg took appropriate steps to protect the public after receiving the positive test results."" Wright County Egg and another Iowa producer, Hillandale Farms, were forced to recall about 550 million eggs in August after health officials linked them to the salmonella outbreak, which has so far been blamed for more than 1,500 illnesses across the United States. Wright County Egg and other operations owned by the DeCoster family have come under increased scrutiny since the outbreak. In a written statement responding to the letter, the company said it previously pledged to ""fully respond"" to the committee's requests for documents. ""At that time, we also indicated that our response was ongoing,"" it said. The company said it was ""terribly disappointed"" to find positive tests for salmonella in its eggs, but said it provided results of those voluntary tests ""as soon as those results were available."" ""We believe our open communication about our forthright efforts to compile testing data and provide documents as requested is consistent with our ongoing cooperation with this investigation,"" it said. ""We have provided the committee with additional testing documentation today and will continue to do so as we restore past testing records."" Salmonella occurs naturally in chickens, but Food and Drug Administration inspectors reported in August that neither Wright County nor Hillandale fully followed their plans to prevent Salmonella enteritidis. Federal investigators reported finding salmonella bacteria in chicken feed and in barn and walkway areas at the farms, as well as rodents, piles of manure, uncaged birds and flies too numerous to count, the FDA said.","Congressmen demand answers from Iowa farm's owner .
Reports find 426 cases of salmonella contamination in 2 years .

"(CNN) -- Viva Chile. Late last winter, Chile was shaken first by a 8.8-magnitude earthquake and, later, looting and military police hitting the streets. In August, the San Jose mine collapsed, threatening the lives of 33 men trapped a half-mile underground and further testing the upstart South American country's psyche weeks ahead of its bicentennial commemoration. But this week, Chile came alive -- in the eyes of its citizens, as well as the world. Copiapo, which could have been the site of mass mourning had the miners' rescue effort gone awry, instead became home to a patriotic festival. The strong national pride was omnipresent: from the red, white and blue Chilean flags that permeated the rescue site to the chants that rang out as the miners rose to the surface. It was clear, too, many miles away -- whether it was the hugs and tears of joy among the throngs watching the scene on a flickering big-screen TV set up in a Santiago city square, the champagne corks popping at the Chilean embassy in Washington, or countless bite-sized conversations in the vast reaches of cyberspace where the Chilean miners were a top trending discussion on Twitter. ""What emotion! What happiness! What pride to be Chilean!"" wrote Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, on his own Twitter page. Like many emerging countries, Chile has not been without its challenges. It continues to emerge from the shadows of dictator Augusto Pinochet's rule from 1974 to 1990, when up to 30,000 people vanished or were killed because of their political beliefs. Economic disparities and political divisions still exist, with the global recession having a real impact in this Andean nation. Yet, its past and recent challenges notwithstanding, Chile has also emerged as a model in Latin America and the world, given its solid economic base and fervent democracy. ""Chile is ... a country with really strong institutions,"" said Peter DeShazo, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""And it's economy has done really well."" While it could have been a calamity, the San Jose mine rescue effort instead turned into a celebration, not just of the miners' survival but also the nation's collective ability (with help from international friends) to safely extricate them. Thus, this week's rescue effort gave Chileans a good reason and made-for-TV stage to show off their longstanding patriot fervor to the world. ""Chileans, in general, have a strong sense of national identity,"" said Susan Purcell, director of the University of Miami's Center for Hemispheric Policy. ""And with this episode, it's like they did everything right."" Since Pinochet, Chile has experienced significant economic growth and steady inroads combating corruption and poverty.  But until now, Chile rarely had been front-and-center in most everyday discussions of Latin America, which are more likely to be dominated by Brazil's booming development, communist Cuba, Colombia's civil war and Venezuela under leftist leader Hugo Chavez. Thus, while international policymakers and business leaders have seen (and, in some cases, been party to) its development, the mine collapse and rescue effort were many people's first sustained exposure to Chile, its people and its potential. ""Chile should be held up as a model, but it often isn't,"" said Purcell. ""I don't know if (the rescue) changes the image of Chile, or it creates an image of Chile."" Led by President Pinera, the rescue effort and Chile were very much intertwined. Government officials frequently appeared before TV cameras, Chilean flags abounded and patriotic chants rang out regularly. The loudest and emotional could be heard when the miners emerged: ""Chi! Chi! Chi! Le! Le! Le! Los mineros de Chile!"" That was no accident, said Nara Milanich, a professor at New York's Barnard College specializing in Chile. Pinera, who had seen his popularity drop since taking office last March, took control of the situation and played to the cameras, she said. Camp Hope sprung up, as a temporary home to miners' families as well as the scores of global media who descended on the scene. ""They are so conscious that the world is watching,"" said Milanich. ""This is as genuinely Chilean as Baywatch is genuinely American. This is a TV show."" Still, for all the production set-ups and political posturing, Milanich said that Chileans' joy was true and widely felt. While the release came at a critical time for Chileans, who wrestled with ""soul-searching"" after the quake and during the bicentennial commemoration, it reflected citizens' deep-rooted sense that Chile is worth celebrating. And in Latin America -- especially given Chile's rivalry with Andean neighbors Bolivia and Peru dating back to the 19th century War of the Pacific -- such self-congratulation among Chileans is almost expected and sometimes resented. ""I don't think Chileans suffer from an inferiority complex,"" said Kristen Sorensen, a professor at Bentley University in Massachusetts. ""In some sense, they have a superiority complex.""","Experts say that Chileans have long boasted a strong sense of national identity .
The miners' rescue effort is described as a made-for-TV production showcasing Chilean excellence and pride .

"(CNN) -- Glamorous tennis star Ana Ivanovic has reached the quarterfinals of the Generali Ladies Linz tournament -- despite being penalized a game for taking too long in the toilet. The former world No. 1, who was given a wildcard entry into the Austrian event after the late withdrawal of the injured Serena Williams, had been leading 1-0 in the second set on Thursday when she needed to leave the court. When she finally returned, the 22-year-old Serbian -- whose last tournament win came in Liz in 2008 -- discovered that her opponent Barbora Zahlavova Strycova had been awarded the next game of the second-round match. ""I'm really embarrassed because I had yogurt right before I walked on. Don't ever have yogurt before you have to play!"" Ivanovic, among the sport's top earners despite her recent lack of form, explained at her later press conference. ""When I left the court I was really feeling sick. I said I really have to go to the bathroom and he [the umpire] said I couldn't go now before her serve, but I said I have to. Then he said I could go on my own time. ""When I came back he said for every 20 seconds I got a point penalty. He said I was gone a long time and it added up to a game. I was not sure about the rules and just had to keep on playing. ""I could not argue because he said that's how it is. It turned out to be good. I think I was so consumed with trying to feel a little bit better, but I think in normal circumstances it would make me really mad."" Ivanovic went on to triumph 6-3 6-2, and the seventh seed will next face Julia Gorges for a place in the semifinals. The unseeded German upset fifth seed Petra Kvitova 6-2 6-1 as the 20-year-old Czech left-hander joined compatriot Strycova in exiting the tournament. Second seed Daniela Hantuchova came back from 3-1 down in the first set to beat Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro and set up a quarterfinal with Patty Schnyder. The Swiss left-hander shocked eighth-seeded Czech Klara Zakopalova 6-2 6-0. Greek qualifier Eleni Daniilidou also made it through after defeating Austrian wildcard Sybille Bammer 6-1 7-6 (7-2), and she will next play German sixth seed Andrea Petkovic. Meanwhile, third seed Shahar Peer reached the quarterfinals of the HP Japan Women's Open with a hard-fought 3-6 6-1 6-3 win over local player Ryoko Fuda in Osaka on Thursday. The Israeli will next play Czech seventh seed Iveta Benesova, who defeated Italy's Alberta Brianti 6-1 7-5. Japanese veteran Kimiko Date Krumm earned a clash with top seed Samantha Stosur as the 40-year-old beat compatriot Aiko Nakamura 6-2 6-0. American Jill Craybas thrashed Ukraine's Olga Savchuk 6-1 6-1, and the 36-year-old will next play French second seed Marion Bartoli.","Ana Ivanovic penalized a game after needing an emergency toilet break in Austria .

"(CNN) -- Baseball's League Championship Series' start Friday with the New York Yankees taking on the Texas Rangers for the American League title. The winner will go to the World Series against the victor in the National League Championship series between the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants. The Phillies-Giants series starts Saturday and will be televised on Fox. TBS analyst Ron Darling spoke to CNN about compelling people and stories that will interest even the most casual fans and about how the baseball we'll be watching is radically different than the game we saw just a few years ago. This is an edited transcript: . CNN: Has this been an extraordinary post-season for pitching, or does it always improve in the playoffs? Ron Darling: I think what has been extraordinary is that all the pitchers, whether they came through trades (Phillies with Roy Halladay and Roy Oswalt; Texas with Cliff Lee) or up through the farm system like the San Francisco Giants, or a free agent like CC Sabathia in New York, the great thing about it is they all deliver. Sometimes the great Braves pitchers would falter during the '90s, but none of these guys has faltered. In fact they're having some of the greatest games in the history of post-season play. Whether it's Tim Lincecum's 14 strikeouts, Cliff Lee and his ability to throw complete games and strike out hitters without walking anybody, and of course Roy Halladay's no-hitter. CNN: What were your thoughts on the Texas Rangers celebrating their division series win over Tampa Bay with ginger ale instead of champagne because their star, Josh Hamilton, is recovering from drug and alcohol abuse? Darling: I thought it was one of the special moments of the post-season. There are a lot of people affected by alcoholism and drug addiction in this country, and a lot of people feel alone in their battle against those two addictions. And to see an entire ball club get behind their player's problem and have empathy and sympathy for his problems was just one of the special things. Remember their manager (Ron Washington) tested positive last season (for cocaine). They could have abandoned the manager; instead, it brought them closer together. They've been one of the great stories and to know that they wanted one of their best players to celebrate in the clubhouse because they knew he could only do it with ginger ale to me is a just a beautiful gesture. CNN: You played with Dwight Gooden and Daryl Strawberry, who both struggled with addiction. How hard has it been for Josh Hamilton to overcome his addiction to play so well? Darling: I think trying to battle addictions is hard enough if you're working 9-5 and you've got a family and you're trying to stay out of harm's way. When you're a young athlete on the road with a lot of free time on your hands, I think it ups it exponentially. I know Hamilton has a caretaker who helps him out on the road, but I think it's taken a lot of stick-to-itiveness by Josh. You know he's had a second chance, had a couple of hiccups, but he's made the most of it. Addiction is a sickness; we should look at it like that. I think we should welcome what he's done. He's not only a great player, but he's also become a leader on that team and that's the most interesting part of that to me. CNN: Besides Hamilton, who are some other players people will enjoy watching if they flip on the game? Darling: In the National League, you have to look at the little guys, Shane Victorino and Placido Polanco, for the Phillies. Sometimes these games allow them to shine when most of the publicity goes to the home-run hitters. On San Francisco, Andres Torres, their centerfielder, had a remarkable season. He's a player who floundered and later in his career found his role and had a great season. The Giants closer Brian Wilson had a remarkable year. I know he has the funny hair and funny beard, but there's nothing funny about how he gets saves. The New York Yankees' Brett Gardner and Curtis Granderson, batting at the bottom of the order, will have a big series. For Texas, the casual fan may not know about Nelson Cruz, but he has about as much pop in his bat as anyone in the game and he's a good fielder and throws well. (The playoffs) could be a good forum for the country to learn what a good player he is. CNN: Why have there been so many errors in this post-season? Darling: There have been 31 errors so far, and what we should read into it is that the game has changed. You can overlook an error when a lot of home runs are being hit and a lot of runs scored. That's not happening as much anymore. Every play is critical, and if you're talking about this being the season of the post-season pitcher, every time an error is made, it's going to be crucial in determining the game. There have been errors before, but over the last 10 seasons, you could overcome it with offensive output. But when the games are 3-1 every night, you can't afford those errors. And those players that in the past you put in the lineup because of their offensive abilities and you hoped they would catch the ball but figured they'd make up for it with their offense, those days are gone and those players are gone. If you are in the minor leagues and not working on your fielding, you're going to have a hard time getting to the major leagues. CNN: Because of steroid testing, do you think these lower-scoring, well-pitched games are going to be the norm going forward? Darling: Watch these series. There's going to be lots of steals, bunting and infield hits, all of those things that we saw a lot in the '70s and early '80s that went away. You're still going to have guys hit the ball out of the ballpark. But how many home runs are guys going to hit off Halladay, Lee, Lincecum and Sabathia? It's not gonna happen.","Ron Darling says it's amazing how well so many pitchers have performed in playoffs .

"(CNN) -- During her darkest hours in captivity, former Colombian hostage Ingrid Betancourt considered death preferable to her ordeal, she said in an interview with CNN's ""Connect the World."" Betancourt, who was kidnapped in 2002 during her campaign for the presidency and rescued in 2008, wrote about her experience in a new book, ""Even Silence Has an End."" She recalled that late in her captivity at the hands of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, she became very ill. FARC declined to give her medication, and had her lie in a hammock for months, she said. Betancourt had seen other hostages die in similar circumstances in the jungle. ""And because I was in so much in pain in my body and I was kind of unplugging mentally, in the sense that I couldn't just concentrate on anything, I thought that perhaps it was a good moment to just, you know,"" Betancourt said, referring to dying. In that moment, she said, she preferred death because it would reunite her with her father. ""And, also, I thought that it could be a liberation thing for my children, because they had to stop their lives,"" Betancourt said. That feeling was just one episode in her 6 1/2 years in captivity. Writing the book, she said, brought her to ""very deep memories, to places I thought I had forgotten and to situations that were very painful."" The writing process would leave her physically exhausted at the end of the day. Betancourt was freed in a high-profile helicopter rescue mission in July 2008. Colombian commandos posed as humanitarian aid workers to free the group, which included three U.S. military contractors and 11 Colombian police and military members. Her book is not the first to touch on her time as a hostage. In a memoir published last year, the U.S. military contractors rescued along with Betancourt painted an unflattering portrait of the dual citizen of France and Colombia, describing her as someone who hoarded belongings and let her temper flare during their time in the rebel camp. For her part, Betancourt admits that she was not the most popular. ""We hear the news and they talk about the hostages and the only name that comes up on and on and on is mine,"" she said. ""By not having their names, it was just another humiliation. It was just another torture for them, not knowing if people knew they were there, what was happening with their families."" The guerrillas who held them were also keen on keeping the hostages divided. This, she suspects, was so that they would not unite and attempt an escape together. Much of the guerrillas' treatment of their hostages was meant to be cruel and designed to strip away their identities, Betancourt said. ""So, for me, it was important to preserve my dignity in the sense of preserving my soul, preserving the things that I thought were important for me to give. And that was a struggle,"" she said. One way she did this was by showing defiance. When her captors ordered the hostages to identify themselves by numbers, she refused. Although her fellow hostages started counting off, when it came to be her turn, she just answered, ""Ingrid Betancourt."" ""I didn't want to be a number. I didn't want to be an object,"" she said. ""They were referring to us like cargo. And I thought that was horrible. And I didn't want them to get away with that. So I think I was a little like a troublemaker, in some aspects."" That streak also partly led to divisions between her and the other hostages, she said. After such lows, how did Betancourt survive the long years? ""To put it in just one word, I think it was love,"" she said. ""The love of my children and the love of my mother."" Reflecting on the current political situation in Colombia, the former candidate said that the country is in better shape than when she was abducted. There remains, however, what she called a crucial problem: a disconnect between those who live in the cities very comfortably, and those in the countryside who are affected by the violence of the FARC and other rebel groups. ""We have 4 million misplaced people in Colombia. And that's because of the war,"" she said.","Ingrid Betancourt says she favored death over captivity at one point .

"(CNN) -- The wife of an American reportedly shot dead by gunmen believed linked to a Mexican drug gang gave an eight-hour interview and provided a detailed statement to federal and state authorities in Mexico, she said Monday. Tiffany Hartley told CNN's ""American Morning"" she gave a detailed account of what happened on September 30, from the time she and her husband David left their McAllen, Texas, home until she left a sheriff's office that night. She said she is scheduled to meet with authorities again Monday to finish up the statement. Hartley recounted the incident Monday, saying she and her husband headed to Falcon Lake, which straddles the U.S.-Mexico border, that day to ""enjoy a day on the lake."" The two decided to ride their personal watercraft to the Mexican side of the lake to see a historical church there, she said. But she said the couple was confronted by three boats, and gunmen aboard began firing shots at them when they tried to flee the area. She said she saw her husband shot, and attempted to pull him on board her watercraft. ""After they shot David I turned my Jet Ski around so I could go and help him,"" she said. But a boat approached her and the person on board pointed a gun toward her, then left. She attempted to get her husband on board, but fled when she saw the boats returning. She said she had to pass the three boats while attempting to get back to the U.S. side of the lake. By the time she got there, she could not see what was taking place back at the scene, she said Monday. ""The boats chased me pretty much all the way to the U.S. border or past it,"" she said. David Hartley's body has not been found, despite extensive searches by both U.S. and Mexican authorities. Brian Quigley, spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Matamoros, Mexico, said Saturday that Tiffany Hartley is ""fully cooperating in assisting Mexican prosecutors with their investigation."" Her Friday interview with officials from the federal attorney general's office and prosecutors from Mexico's Tamaulipas state was held in the FBI field office in McAllen. It took place the day after Mexican authorities said they were suspending the search for David Hartley. ""Mexican authorities told the U.S. Consulate that the suspension of the search was only temporary and would continue at a later date,"" Quigley said. ""We are going to hold them to that."" Tiffany Hartley's mother, Cynthia Young, said earlier that she, Tiffany Hartley and the woman's father met with Mexican and American officials Friday, and the family was told that the Mexican government was ""restrategizing"" how it was handling the search for Hartley's body. Tiffany Hartley met with Rolando Armando Flores Villegas, the lead Mexican investigator in the death of her husband, days before Flores was killed. His severed head was delivered to authorities in a suitcase last week. However, authorities vowed to continue to search. On Friday, Tamaulipas state attorney general spokesman Ruben Dario Rios said the suspension was a ""temporary recess so that we can better assess the strategies we are using to find the body."" Responding to local reports that threats of imminent gun battles by the Los Zetas drug cartel might have led officials to suspend the search, Dario Rios said, ""Negative."" Zapata County, Texas, Sheriff Sigifredo Gonzalez Jr. has said Mexican authorities may have been trying to intimidate Tiffany Hartley during the in-depth interview Friday and scare her into not pushing them to continue the investigation. But Tiffany Hartley denied that Monday, saying authorities just wanted detailed information about the day -- ""where we had stopped and who we talked to, that kind of thing. I didn't feel like it was an interrogation, and I really hope they do continue the search and continue their investigation."" She said she did not get a sense that authorities were questioning her account. ""We just want David back,"" Tiffany Hartley said. ""... I think they do want to find whoever, but ultimately I don't really care if they find the person because I know in time, they'll have their day [of judgment]."" A report issued by a Texas-based think tank last week suggested that Hartley's death may have stemmed from a case of mistaken identity in the ongoing war between two Mexican drug cartels. The Stratfor report, which cites anonymous sources, noted that David Hartley worked for an oil and gas company with operations in Reynosa, Mexico. The couple had lived there for two years and had only moved to McAllen within the past few months, the report said. The truck they drove to Falcon Lake on September 30 still had a license plate from Tamaulipas state. The couple drove their personal watercraft to the Old Guerrero area of the lake, which the report said is a ""known battleground in the ongoing war in the Los Zetas and Gulf cartels."" The sources told Stratfor both cartels have been known to conduct surveillance and countersurveillance operations on personal watercraft, so Zetas scouts identified them as possible Gulf spies, because of their license plate and their method and direction of travel on Falcon Lake. They were then apparently confronted by ""Zetas enforcers,"" Stratfor said. The sources told Stratfor the attack was unauthorized by senior Los Zetas members and ""a damage control campaign is currently under way ... to identify and eliminate those who engaged the Hartleys without proper authorization."" Protocol involves prompt disposition of a body to ensure no evidence can be brought against the group, the report said. Falcon Lake is about 70 miles west of the Hartleys' home in McAllen. CNN's Eric Fiegel contributed to this report.","NEW: Tiffany Hartley is set to finish her statement Monday .

"(CNN)  -- Former captain Imran Khan says Pakistan should not abandon their tour of England despite allegations that members of their national team were involved in a betting scam. Cricket legend Khan told CNN that he was ""shocked and embarrassed"" by the scandal which has left preparations for the team's upcoming one-day international series with England in disarray. ""The tour should definitely continue but if some players have indulged in wrongdoing or committed a crime they should be punished and sent back (home) and replaced. Can cricket survive in Pakistan ? ""But a tour should never be abandoned because this reflects as if the whole team is involved or the whole cricket structure,"" added the former all-rounder who led Pakistan to World Cup triumph in 1992. Khan appeared to have been greeted his wish when International Cricket Council (ICC) president Sharad Pawar appeared to rule out any immediate action against Pakistani players. ""We have discussed it within the ICC and have decided to wait for the police investigation report,"" Pawar, an Indian cabinet minister, told AFP Monday. ""After that we have to take a viewpoint of the two boards, in this case the Pakistan Cricket Board and the England and Wales Cricket Board. ""If anything is established, it will be viewed very seriously by the two boards and the ICC."" Khan, who is at home in Pakistan helping with flood relief efforts, said the reports which surfaced Sunday in the British tabloid newspaper The News of the World had left people around him ""upset and demoralized."" The paper claimed it paid agent Mazhar Majeed $230,000 for advance information about three no-balls by bowlers Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif in the fourth and final Test between Pakistan and England at Lord's. It went on to further claim that the players colluded in the alleged betting coup. Khan added: ""There was a feeling of shock and embarrassment especially for Pakistanis living in Britain. ""I guess I went through all those sentiments, but I have to say these are still allegations which I hope turn out not to be true."" Khan, who has forged a political career since retiring from cricket, said he had never been approached by betting syndicates during his 21-year career, 10 of them as Pakistan captain. ""It seemed so impossible a team would throw a match,"" he said. Meanwhile, betting expert Mark Davies told CNN that illegal bookmakers in Asia were behind such scandals and that calls to limit legal betting on cricket were wide of the mark. ""This is about transparency in betting of which there is none on the sub-continent,"" he said. ""Ultimately, it's about fraud and corruption and these people have no place in sport,"" he added.","Imran Khan urges Pakistan to complete their England tour despite betting scam allegations .

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A man convicted of killing a mother and her two daughters during a brutal 2007 Connecticut home invasion can be ""quite likable,"" but has struggled with drug addiction for years, a defense attorney told jurors Monday. The same jurors who convicted Steven Hayes of capital murder and other charges convened Monday for Hayes' penalty phase. They will decide whether he should be sentenced to death for the slayings of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. Attorney Patrick Culligan told jurors in his opening statement they will hear testimony from ""people who know Steve Hayes, whose lives have crossed paths with Steven Hayes ... to try to give you some insight, some understanding of who Steven Hayes was prior to the crimes of July 23, 2007."" Some of the testimony, he warned, will not be flattering to Hayes, but he said that despite his long history of criminal convictions and drug abuse, Hayes could be ""quite likable."" ""There is no presumption at this point that the death penalty is the appropriate punishment,"" Culligan said. ""... You must keep an open mind."" Culligan said testimony would also focus on Hayes' behavior in prison in the past, noting that he has been incarcerated for ""most of his adult life"" because of his addiction. ""At the conclusion [of testimony], you'll come to know much more of the 'who' about Steven Hayes,"" Culligan told jurors. ""... Hopefully, you'll also have a fuller understanding of his role in these crimes ... these most horrible and tragic crimes."" Hayes, 47, was convicted earlier this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him, including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping. Jurors acquitted him of an arson charge. During the penalty phase, jurors will determine whether the mitigating evidence the defense is expected to present outweighs the aggravating factors in favor of the death penalty. Jurors are allowed to consider evidence they heard during the guilt phase of the trial. They can also consider new testimony or evidence that attorneys introduce during the sentencing phase -- which might include the defendant's long history of prior convictions and anything that casts Hayes in a positive light. Hayes himself could testify. ""All of the evidence presented in the guilt phase may be considered in this phase ... and the state is relying on that evidence,"" prosecutor Michael Dearington told jurors in his opening statement. The only new testimony presented in the penalty phase by the prosecution concerned Hayes' prior convictions -- two in 1981 and others in 1993, 1996 and 2003, all for third-degree burglary. The prosecution rested just before the court took a lunch break Monday. The killings took place in the New Haven suburb of Cheshire, a brutal attack that shocked the well-to-do community and drew nationwide attention. The home of Dr. William Petit was invaded in the middle of the night by Hayes and another man, Joshua Komisarjevsky, prosecutors say. Komisarjevsky will be tried separately. Connecticut State Police Detective Anthony Buglione, who interviewed Hayes after the crime, has testified that the duo beat Petit bloody and left him in the basement. According to testimony, the two men then went upstairs and found Hawke-Petit and Michaela asleep in the master bedroom. After tying Hawke-Petit to her bed, they led the girl to her room, tied her to her bed and put a pillowcase over her head, Hayes told Buglione. They then found Hayley Petit in her room and did the same, he said. After finding evidence of a bank account containing $20,000 to $30,000, they decided to have the mother go to the bank in the morning and withdraw money from her account, Buglione testified. Hayes is accused of taking Hawke-Petit to the bank while Komisarjevsky allegedly stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, the two men allegedly set the home on fire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. William Petit has said he will not offer a victim impact statement during Hayes' penalty phase, saying in a statement he ""regretfully"" decided against doing so because Connecticut's law on victim impact statements is unclear and could provide convicts with grounds to appeal their sentences. Culligan noted in his remarks to jurors Monday that ""There was another person involved in this crime: Joshua Komisarjevsky."" He said jurors will hear about Komisarjevsky in the suspect's own words, much of it from his writings to author Brian McDonald. Judge Jon Blue has suggested the penalty proceeding could last as long as four weeks, though the relatively quick pace of the guilt phase of Hayes' trial has led some to speculate the penalty phase could also be quick. Hayes' attorneys had sought to introduce testimony regarding the comparative cost of life imprisonment versus execution, but Blue barred the subject.","NEW: Defense attorney tells jurors to keep an open mind .

"(CNN) -- A judge issued bench warrants for the arrest of actor Randy Quaid and his wife, Evi, after the couple failed to appear for a court hearing in Santa Barbara, California, Monday morning, a court spokesman said. The Quaids were ordered to appear for a hearing on burglary charges filed last month after police were called to a Montecito, California, residence to investigate a report of squatters. According to a press release from the Santa Barbara Sheriff's department, a representative for the owner of the property came by the house to check the security alarm because it had gone off earlier that day, and then discovered that someone had been resting their head in the property's guest house. The Quaids weren't around at the time, but upon their return later that evening the couple told police that they have ""owned the property since the 1990s."" According to the statement, the owners had documentation that another buyer had purchased the property from the Quaids several years earlier. A contractor who worked on the residence told police he believes the couple caused more than $5,000 in damages in the guest house, and the Quaids were charged with residential burglary. The judge revoked their $50,000 bond when they failed to show up for Monday's hearing, the court spokesman said. Another hearing was set for next Tuesday.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The archbishops of Canterbury and York are recommending that churches stop sharing the chalice at communion over swine flu fears, the Church of England said Thursday. The Church of England's leaders are recommending parishoners don't share the chalice. The archbishops wrote a letter to all Church of England bishops with the recommendation. It follows government advice not to share ""common vessels"" for food or drink so as not to spread the virus. In the Anglican Church, worshippers commonly drink from the same chalice during communion. The chalice is wiped before the next person drinks from it. For churches that still wish to offer both bread and wine, the archbishops recommend the priest dip communion wafers in the chalice before handing them out to those taking communion. ""The Department of Health have recently advised us that 'in a pandemic it makes good sense to take precautions to limit the spread of disease by not sharing common vessels for food and drink,'"" the archbishops write in the letter. ""In the light of this advice, we recommend those presiding at Holy Communion suspend the administration of the chalice during this wave of pandemic flu. For those who still wish to offer in both kinds, we recommend the practice whereby the presiding minister, whose hands should have been washed with the appropriate alcohol-based rub before handling the elements and the vessels, personally intincts all wafers before placing them in the hands of communicants.""  Watch more on Australian vaccine trial Â» . The archbishops note that this practice is widely observed in Anglican churches throughout Africa. ""Communicants receiving in this way need to be confident that the clergy and all assistant ministers follow the relevant guidance on hygiene,"" they write. The Archbishop of Canterbury is the spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Church, the second-largest Christian denomination after the Roman Catholic Church.","Archbishops of Canterbury and York recommend churches stop sharing chalice .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The security situation in war-ravaged Darfur shows no sign of improvement as fighting has intensified between rebel groups and the Sudanese government, the United Nations Security Council was told Tuesday. ""We are alarmed,"" U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice said after hearing the report. ""This deteriorating security situation is unacceptable and it needs to be effectively addressed."" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pointed out in his latest report that incidents of violence over recent months have surpassed bloodshed in the same time period last year by far. ""May was in fact the deadliest month in Darfur since UNAMID [joint United Nations-African Union mission] has deployed,"" Rice said. About 400 people lost their lives in May and another estimated 160 died by the government's aerial bombardment in June, officials said. Envoy Ibrahim Gambari said U.N. staffers and aid agencies are frequently denied access by the government in Khartoum to the areas where fighting is taken place. Ban criticized the Sudanese government for failing to investigate and prosecute cases where peacekeepers are attacked. ""The Darfur process is at a critical juncture,"" Gambari said. ""At precisely the same time as as the security situation has deteriorated, prospects for a negotiated settlement appear to have improved slightly."" The Liberation and Justice Movement (LJM) is currently meeting with the Sudanese government in Doha. ""This has provided an important boost to the process,"" Gambari said. The rebel Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), however, has walked out on the Doha talks and started attacking the government again, Gambari told the council. The faction of the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) under Abdul Wahid has tried to take advantage of this renewed fighting and attacked the Sudanese forces as well. The rebels have said the government favors Arabs over black Africans. The two big movements, JEM and SLM are not participating in the talks, sabotaging the peace process. Gambari asked the Security Council to appeal again to the movements to join the negotiations so that an arrangement can be hashed out before the end of this year. The Security Council has to decide later this week if the mandate of UNAMID will be extended for another year. Ban recommended that the mission continues to ""expand the work that it has painstakingly begun.""","Fighting is intensifying in the Darfur region of Sudan .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho has continued reshaping his squad ahead of the new season by allowing midfielder Guti to leave the Spanish giants, while legendary forward Raul is also set to go. Guti, who did not feature in Spain's 2010 World Cup squad, will depart the Bernabeu 15 years after making his first-team debut. The 33-year-old, who joined the club at the age of nine and has won 14 international caps, has been linked with a move to Turkish side Besiktas. ""I always wished to play for Real Madrid and I did my best to stay, refusing very tempting offers to play elsewhere,"" he told the club's official website on Sunday. ""I am about to begin a new and exciting stage in my career and I wish to enjoy being in a new country to the fullest. ""This has been a beautiful and glorious experience, but these things happen in football all the time. Younger players need to be given way and I feel proud and happy for having played here."" Former Real coach Berndt Schuster is now in charge of Besiktas, and Guti confirmed that he may be reunited with the German. ""I have an offer from Besiktas, but I haven't decided yet,"" he said. ""What is for sure is that wherever I go, I will give everything."" Guti won three Champions League titles and five Spanish La Liga crowns with Real, playing 542 matches in the white shirt of ""Los Merengues."" ""I leave knowing Real Madrid will always be my home. Part of my heart stays here today. I would like to return after retiring as a player,"" he said. Guti's departure will be followed by that of the club's all-time leading scorer Raul, who is expected to join Schalke according to recent quotes from the German side's manager Felix Magath. The UK Press Association reported that the 33-year-old will hold a farewell press conference on Monday. British media claimed on Sunday that Mourinho is still trying to sign Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard and his England teammate, Chelsea defender Ashley Cole. Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho has also expressed his interest in rejoining his former Chelsea and Porto boss in Madrid. ""I would go there right now, swimming or running,"" he told Spanish newspaper AS. Mourinho has already brought in Argentina winger Angel Di Maria from Benfica and young midfielder Sergio Canales from Racing Santander.","Midfielder Guti to leave Real Madrid after 24 years at the Spanish club .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- DJ and pop star Boy George has been denied a visa to enter the United States, his Web site said Tuesday. In 2007, George spent five days cleaning the streets of New York to fulfill a community service sentence. U.S. immigration authorities denied the visa because George, 48, faces trial in November in London on charges of false imprisonment relating to an April 2007 incident, according to a statement from Boy George's management, posted on his site. ""George is astounded at the decision and is having his lawyers here in the States look at it in the hope that someone will change their mind,"" the statement read. Boy George, whose real name is George O'Dowd, was charged in London last November with false imprisonment following a complaint from a 28-year-old man, police said. The incident happened in East London the previous April, police said. George is free on unconditional bail and is not barred from traveling as he awaits trial, his management said. His upcoming schedule includes a series of U.S. club dates in July and August. George is best known as the singer of '80s pop group Culture Club, with hits including ""Karma Chameleon"" and ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?"" He quit the band in 1987 and embarked on a short solo career before reinventing himself as a club DJ and launching a fashion label, B-Rude. In August 2007, George spent five days cleaning the streets of Manhattan to fulfill a community service sentence for falsely reporting a break-in at his New York home. George's management said the denial of his U.S. visa had nothing to do with that case.","48-year-old Boy George on trial in London in November .

"(CNN) -- The United Nations humanitarian chief urged Sudan to allow aid workers into a Darfur refugee camp that has been closed for nearly two weeks, limiting access to 80,000 displaced people. Sudanese authorities prevented aid agencies from entering Kalma camp and its surrounding areas after violence broke out earlier this month. The closure came despite reassurances that restrictions had not been imposed. ""I am extremely concerned about the welfare of the IDPs at Kalma camp, to whom we have not been able to deliver relief for 13 days,"" John Holmes, U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said Friday. ""Deliveries of food and fuel for water pumps have for example not been possible. Sanitation is also a major concern as it is the middle of the rainy season. Many thousands of IDPs from Kalma remain unaccounted for."" Darfuris who live at the camp rely on aid groups for food, water, health, nutritional support and shelter. Tensions escalated at the camp last week after thousands of displaced Darfuris took to the streets to protest what they called unrepresentation in the latest round of peace talks in Doha, Qatar. Officials demanded that the joint U.N.-African Union peacekeeping force, UNAMID, hand over six local leaders who sought protection with the peacekeepers. The peacekeeping force said it will not do so unless the government pledges to give them a fair trial . The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs says constraints on aid agencies in the region have been steadily increasing since March 2009, when 11 international aid groups were expelled from Darfur. Two staff members from the International Organization for Migration were also expelled last month. ""The United Nations has been in close contact with the relevant Sudanese authorities to restore access to both Kalma and Eastern Jebel Marra, but until today progress has not been forthcoming,"" Holmes said. ""If access is not urgently restored, the situation risks deteriorating rapidly."" Darfur, a province of Sudan, has suffered the worst humanitarian crisis in the world, according to aid groups. United Nations officials estimate that 300,000 people have died in the past seven years and more than 3 million displaced amid fighting between rebels and government forces. The Darfur conflict started when two rebel groups -- the Sudan Liberation Army and Justice and Equality Movement -- started attacking the government in 2003. The groups accused Khartoum of favoring Arabs and oppressing black Africans. Government forces have been backed by the Janjaweed, a militia accused of murdering, raping, and burning homes in Darfur .","Sudan prevents aid agencies from entering camp after violence breaks out .

"(CNN) -- A personal phone conversation by an air traffic controller likely contributed to the cause of a deadly midair collision over the Hudson River last year, the The National Transportation Safety Board said. A single-engine plane and a sightseeing helicopter collided on August 8, 2009 near Hoboken, New Jersey. All nine people aboard the two aircraft were killed, including several Italian tourists visiting New York from Bologna. In a statement released Tuesday, the NTSB said the air traffic controller's personal phone call ""distracted him from his air traffic control duties, including the timely transfer of communications for the accident airplane to the Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) tower and correcting the airplane pilot's incorrect read-back of the EWR tower frequency."" The on-duty personal phone conversation might not have been the first for the air traffic controller. An NTSB report says the controller's personal call might not have taken place ""if the front line manager had corrected the controller's performance deficiency involving an earlier nonpertinent telephone conversation."" In addition, the board said, the ""front line manager, who was not present in the air traffic control tower at the time of the accident, exercised poor judgment by not letting staff know how he could be reached while he was away from the tower and by not using an available staffing asset to provide an additional layer of oversight at the tower during his absence."" The NTSB said another probable cause was the limitations of the ""see-and-avoid"" concept. ""The see-and-avoid technique of averting mid-air collisions was not effective because of the difficulty the airplane pilot had in seeing the helicopter until the final seconds before the collision,"" the NTSB said. The safety board said contributing factors included both pilots ineffective use of their aircrafts' electronic advisory system to maintain awareness of other air traffic; inadequate procedures of the Federal Aviation Administration for transferring communication among air traffic facilities near the Hudson River; and FAA regulations that did not provide for adequate vertical separation of aircraft operating over the Hudson River. ""The helicopter's climb above 1,000 feet was not consistent with company procedures and decreased the vertical separation between the aircraft,"" the statement said. NTSB Chairman Deborah A.P. Hersman said the collision could have been prevented. ""While traffic alerts go a long way in helping pilots ""see and avoid"" other aircraft, these technologies are not, in and of themselves, enough to keep us safe,"" Hersman said in the statement. ""Strong operating procedures, professionalism, and commitment to the task at hand -- these are all essential to safety."" The NTSB said it made recommendations to the FAA about changes in a ""special flight rules area"" surrounding the Hudson River corridor near New Jersey and New York. Suggestions include revising federal regulations to specify altitudes for aircraft conducting local operations.","9 people died from a two-aircraft collision over the Hudson River last year .

"(CNN) -- The Bolivian government on Wednesday defended itself from accusations that it has not invested enough in a southwestern province that has found itself under siege by protesters for two weeks. About 6,000 of the 160,000 residents of Potosi, the capital of the province of the same name, have mounted a blockade that has cut off all roads, train and air traffic with the rest of the country. The protesters are demanding several projects, including construction of a modern airport, new roads and a cement factory. They are also in a boundary dispute with a neighboring province, Oruro. Some protesters also launched a hunger strike, which has been joined by Felix Gonzalez, Potosi Province governor, and other officials as well as union leaders. On Wednesday, the civic organizations in charge of the blockade said the only mediator they will accept is Bolivian President Evo Morales. The government did not immediately respond to that demand. But the country's interior minister reiterated that the government will not use force to end the siege. ""In the government's strategy, the only solution to this problem is dialogue,"" Minister Sacha Llorenti said. ""Under no circumstances are we going to fall into any type of provocation. We are not going to use force precisely because some radical sectors want this to have a disastrous ending."" Presidential spokesman Ivan Canelas made the strongest defense yet against the protesters claims. The federal government has budgeted $577 million for new roads in Potosi province, a sum higher than for many other provinces, Canelas said, according to the state-run ABI news agency. The government has also built schools, stadiums and parks in the province under a federal program, he said. The country's minister of mines also made a plea, saying that the region's mining projects, and the royalties that it gains from them, are suffering from the blockade. According to reports from the city of Potosi, the town suffers more each day from shortages of food and hundreds of people are stranded inside, ABI reported. Canelas accused some opposition political leaders of trying to ""provoke situations of confrontation without thinking in the interests of the people of Potosi."" He mentioned that the United Nations has weighed in on the matter, denouncing publicly the violation of the human rights of the people of Potosi who are trapped in the city. ""The human rights of free movement and access to education, health and the rights of children are violated with attitudes of violence emerging from the pressure tactics,"" Canelas said. For their part, the protesters say that Morales has abandoned them after they supported his presidential bid four years ago. The leftist Morales, who is indigenous, relied on a broad base of support among indigenous people and the poor -- nearly always one and the same in Bolivia -- for his election victory. Whites in Bolivia account for only 15 percent of the population, according to the CIA World Factbook. About 30 percent of the population is Quechua and another 25 percent are Aymara, both indigenous groups. Mestizos, who are of mixed white and indigenous ancestry, account for 30 percent of the population.","Protesters in Potosi have blocked the city off for two weeks .

"(CNN) -- A Salvation Army major was shot dead in front of his three children on Christmas Eve in North Little Rock, Arkansas, authorities said. Maj. Philip Wise, 40, was gunned down Thursday. He was found lying by the back entrance of a Salvation Army facility, said police spokesman Sgt. Terry Kuykendall. Wise apparently dropped two bell ringers off at home and returned to the Salvation Army building with his three children, ages 4, 6 and 8. Two men carrying handguns approached them and demanded money before shooting Wise, Kuykendall said. The suspects fled on foot. Police received a 911 call at 4:17 p.m. Pulaski County Coroner Garland Camper said Wise's wife, Cindy, made the call from inside the building. ""My heart goes out for the family, losing their dad, and I guess having to witness it during this time of year,"" Camper told CNN affiliate KARK. ""It's definitely going to be hard on the kids."" Wise had been active in the Salvation Army for 16 years and was assigned to the Baring Cross neighborhood of North Little Rock for the past three years. Area Commander Maj. Harvey Johnson said the Salvation Army will hold a news conference on Christmas Day. ""We would hope that whoever the perpetrators are would step forward,"" he said. The Salvation Army, an international movement, is an evangelical part of the universal Christian Church. It is perhaps best known for its donation centers and bell ringers who collect money for the needy during the holiday season.","Maj. Philip Wise, 40, is gunned down in front of his three children .

"(CNN) -- Barbara Billingsley, who wore a classy pearl necklace and dispensed pearls of wisdom as America's quintessential mom on ""Leave it to Beaver,"" has died at age 94, a family spokeswoman said Saturday. The actress passed away at 2 a.m. (5 a.m. ET) Saturday at her home in Santa Monica, California, after a long illness, spokeswoman Judy Twersky said. A private memorial is being planned. Actor Jerry Mathers, who played Theodore ""Beaver"" Cleaver, called Billingsley a lifetime mentor. ""Barbara was a patient advisor and teacher. She helped me along this challenging journey through life by showing me the importance of manners, and respect for others,"" Mathers said in a statement. ""She will be missed by all of her family, friends, fans and most especially by me."" Tony Dow, who played Beaver's brother, Wally Cleaver, also reflected on Billingsley's legacy. ""She was as happy as a lark being recognized as America's mom,"" Dow told CNN's Don Lemon. ""She had a terrific life and had a wonderful impact on everybody she knew, and even people she didn't know."" The actress won a new legion of fans in a brief, but memorable, scene in the 1980 send-up movie ""Airplane."" ""Oh, stewardess. I speak jive,"" Billingsley said in her role -- much different from her June Cleaver persona -- as an elderly passenger comforting an ill man on the flight. She, the sick man and his seat companion engaged in street-slang banter. From the moment its catchy theme song sounded in black-and-white TV sets of the 1950s, ""Leave it to Beaver"" enthralled Americans during a time of relative prosperity and world peace. Its characters represented middle-class white America. June Cleaver dutifully pecked the cheek of her husband, Ward (played by the late Hugh Beaumont), when he came home to learn about the latest foibles -- nothing serious --  committed by Beaver and Wally. ""Ward, I'm very worried about the Beaver,"" was a common refrain. The parents would dispense moralistic advice to their sons. The boys' friends included Lumpy and the obsequious Eddie Haskell, who avoided trouble and often buttered up Ward and June. ""That's a lovely dress you're wearing, Mrs. Cleaver,"" Eddie would typically say to Billingsley's character. Perhaps fittingly, ""Leave it to Beaver"" was canceled in 1963 on the eve of the JFK assassination, the Vietnam War and the tumult of the 1960s. In the 1980s, Dow appeared with Billingsley in ""The New Leave it to Beaver."" She shifted from being a mom figure to a good friend who supported his directing and artistic endeavors, Dow said. ""She always had a positive thing to say,"" said Dow, 65. Mathers spoke of Billingsley's talent during a 2000 appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" ""We kind of stifled her, because her true talent didn't really come out in 'Leave it Beaver.' She was like the straight man, but she has an awful lot of talent."" Born December 22, 1915, in Los Angeles, Billingsley began her career as a model in New York City in 1936. She was under contract to MGM in 1945 before becoming a household name with the launch of ""Leave it to Beaver"" in 1957. Billingsley also voiced the role of Nanny in Nickelodeon's ""Muppet Babies"" from 1984 to 1991. Billingsley is related by marriage to actor/producer Peter Billingsley, known for his starring role as Ralphie in the seasonal TV-movie classic ""A Christmas Story,"" according to the Internet Movie Database. Peter Billingsley's mother, Gail Billingsley, is the cousin of Barbara's first husband, Glenn. Billingsley, whose second and third husbands predeceased her, is survived by her two sons, Drew Billingsley of Granada Hills, California, and Glenn Billingsley of Phillips Ranch, California. Asked once to compare real-life families to TV families, Billingsley responded, ""I just wish that we could have more families like those. Family is so important, and I just don't think we have enough people staying home with their babies and their children.""","Actress Barbara Billingsley dies at home at age 94 .

"(CNN) -- As the relief effort in flood-hit Pakistan intensified Monday, officials were bracing themselves for an outbreak of disease among the millions affected by the country's worst deluge in 80 years. Rushing floodwaters and mudslides triggered by monsoon rains have engulfed large swathes of northwestern Pakistan since Thursday, killing an estimated 1,500 people said Information Minister Mian Ifthikar Hussain on Monday. Now government officials are concerned a lack of drinking water is spreading conditions such as cholera and gastroenteritis in affected areas such as the Swat Valley in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa Province, Agence France-Presse reported. ""We estimate that about 100,000 people, mostly children, have been hit by cholera and gastro diseases,"" Syed Zahir Ali Shah, health minister for Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, was quoted by AFP as saying. iReport: Are you there? Send pictures, video . ""Our priority is to first evacuate them to safe areas and then provide them with medical treatment,"" he added. But the rescue and recovery efforts could become more complicated as monsoon rains continued to fall across much of Pakistan Monday. ""Anything they get will aggravate an already devastating situation,"" said Brandon Miller, a meteorologist with CNN International. The Pakistan Meteorological Department said Monday that it expects enhanced monsoon activity for the first two weeks of August. It forecast widespread rain in the next four days in Sindh, Punjab, Kashmir, Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, northeast Balochistan and Islamabad. Areas along the Indus River will be badly affected due to extremely high flood conditions, the department has said. Special: Impact Your World . Tens of thousands of people remain trapped on rooftops and in higher areas trying to escape rising floodwaters, according to the United Nations. ""We've got the government sending boats and helicopters to try to reach people and bring them to safety at the same time as trying to deliver emergency relief,"" said Nicki Bennett, a senior humanitarian affairs officer for the U.N. Damaged roads and bridges have made rescuing stranded residents difficult, she said, noting that even a U.N. warehouse where the organization stores food, blankets, soaps and bucks is partially underwater. The Pakistani military, which has deployed dozens of helicopters and boats across the region, said 25 bridges have been destroyed and some 36 miles (58 kilometers) of road washed away in Swat and Shangla districts. Despite these difficulties, senior commanders in the region told reporters that tens of thousands of people had been rescued from Shangla, Peshawar, Nowshera and Charsadda. In the hardest-hit province, Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, authorities estimate that 800 people have died and more than 100 are still missing, the World Health Organization said. ""The actual figures could be higher as communication networks in many areas are still disrupted,"" it said in a report. About 15,000 families in the province need emergency assistance, such as food, clean water, shelter and medical services, the organization said. ""As the water level recedes, measures to prevent water-borne diseases will also become a priority,"" it said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon late Sunday authorized $10 million in emergency aid. This follows an earlier pledge by the United States to send helicopters, boats, pre-fabricated bridges and water-filtration units. The European Union and China have also committed to provide humanitarian aid. A Pakistani Red Crescent official told CNN that the number of people affected by the floods has risen to nearly 2.5 million people, with infrastructure receiving major damage. Rushing water also has washed away thousands of acres of crops, government buildings, businesses, schools, bridges and homes, officials said. CNN's Reza Sayah, Nazneen Akbari and Matiullah Mati contributed to this report.","NEW: Up to 1,500 people killed in floods said Information Minister Mian Ifthikar Hussain .

"(CNN) -- African soccer star Emmanuel Adebayor has revealed that he is quitting international football in the wake of the deadly gun attack on the Togo team bus in Angola in January. Adebayor was national captain, but said on Monday that he no longer wanted to represent his country following the events which saw two people killed and several injured after rebels fired on the bus en route to the Africa Cup of Nations. ""I have made the very difficult decision to retire from international football,"" the 26-year-old striker told the Web site of his English club Manchester City. ""I have weighed up my feelings in the weeks and months since the attack, and I am still haunted by the events which I witnessed on that horrible afternoon on the Togo team bus. ""We were just footballers going to play a football match and represent our country, yet we were attacked by people who wanted to kill us all. It is a moment I will never forget and one I never want to experience again."" After deciding not to take part in the tournament, Togo were suspended from the next two stagings of the two-yearly event and fined $50,000. Adebayor returned to England later in January after taking time out to recover from the ordeal, and his 13 goals this season have helped City claim fourth place in the Premier League to be on the brink of earning a place in Europe's top club competition. ""Togo have some very talented players, and I dearly hope the players who remain will be able to put their memories of Angola behind them and go on to be a success for the nation,"" the 2008 African Footballer of the Year said. ""I have enormous belief in each and every one of them: players, coaches, staff and their families. The people who were on that coach together will forever be joined by a special bond -- we are all brothers. ""I will always have the team and the people of Togo close to my heart, and wish them every success in the challenges that they will face in the future."" Adebayor has played 38 times for his country since making his international debut in 2000, scoring 16 times. ""Despite the events in Angola, I have some very good memories of my international career,"" he said.

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said he acknowledges the persecution of gays and lesbians during the Revolution in his country, according to a newspaper interview published Tuesday. Throughout the 1960s and '70s, Cuba sent openly gay men to labor camps without charge or trial. ""They were moments of great injustice, great injustice!"" Castro told journalist Carmen Lira Saade from the Mexican daily La Jornada. ""If someone is responsible, it's me."" His comments came in the second installment of a two-part interview. The first half of the interview -- a wide-ranging, five-hour conversation at his home -- was published Monday. ""We had so many and such terrible problems, problems of life or death, that we didn't pay it enough attention,"" Castro said of the way gays and lesbians were treated. In 1979, Cuba decriminalized homosexual acts and more recently, there have been efforts to legalize same-sex unions. The former leader, whose popular Revolution seized power in 1959, ruled the island nation until ill health forced him to transfer power to his younger brother Raul Castro in 2006. In the La Jornada interview, Fidel Castro also talked about the impact of the five-decade U.S. embargo on Cuba. ""The biggest problem was always medicine and food, which is true even today,"" he said. While the embargo prevented Cuba from trading with much of the world, it also encouraged the country to be more creative, Castro said. ""The fight, the battle that we had to carry out, led us to make greater efforts than we would have made without the blockade,"" he explained. The United States imposed the embargo against Cuba in 1961 after Castro's government began seizing private land and nationalizing private companies, and Havana levied heavy taxes on American goods.","Cuba sent openly gay men to labor camps with no charges in the '60s and '70s .

"New York (CNN) -- A former JetBlue flight attendant -- who reportedly cursed a passenger over a plane's public address system, deployed the plane's emergency evacuation slide, and used it to dramatically exit a flight at JFK airport in August -- pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted criminal mischief as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. Steven Slater pleaded guilty to second-degree attempted criminal mischief, a felony, and fourth-degree attempted criminal mischief, a misdemeanor. Under terms of the plea deal, he must enter a yearlong mental health program. During the program, he must take assigned medications and not get arrested. If he does not comply, he could receive between one and three years in jail. If he successfully completes the program, Slater can apply after one year to vacate the guilty plea to the felony charge and will receive a year of probation, according to terms of the plea deal. He must also pay $10,000 in restitution to JetBlue, the cost of repairing or replacing the chute. ""I want to thank everyone for their support and kindness that got me through to this day,"" Slater said after the hearing. ""The public interest in this was surprising, unexpected and encouraging. At the end of the day, I am a grown adult and must accept responsibility for my actions. Therefore, I am looking forward to moving forward with my life and I'm very grateful to the court for making these arrangements which allow me to do so."" JetBlue suspended Slater immediately after the August 9 incident and he resigned from the airline last month. Terms of the deal were announced and Slater entered the plea Tuesday in Queens Supreme Court. Slater defense attorney Daniel Horwitz said last month he was negotiating a plea deal with Queens prosecutors. ""We look forward to resolving this matter amicably with the district attorney,"" Horwitz said. And Queens District Attorney Richard Brown had said his office is considering ""an alternative sentencing program, at the defendant's request."" Brown initially charged Slater with reckless endangerment, criminal mischief and criminal trespass, all of which could theoretically carry a seven-year sentence in prison. Slater at first pleaded not guilty. Slater's first court-appointed attorney had said a passenger hit Slater on the head with either the overhead bin or luggage, triggering his outburst. But some passengers who were on board the flight raised questions about that account. Slater's apparent ""Take this job and shove it"" action generated hundreds of thousands of fans on the internet. Hollywood public relations veteran Howard Bragman agreed to represent Slater amid speculation the former flight attendant's notoriety could lead to a television contract. ""The court is the first issue,"" Bragman told CNN. ""I want to resolve that and then we'll deal with the rest.""

"(CNN) -- Six counties in eastern North Carolina have been declared federal disaster areas after heavy rains from Tropical Storm Nicole earlier this month caused extensive flooding and subsequent damage. Gov. Bev Perdue's office said it received notice Thursday afternoon that the federal agency had issued the declaration, which makes business and homeowners affected by the floods in Beaufort, Bertie, Craven, Hertford, Onslow and Tyrrell counties eligible for low-interest loans and grants. ""In a time when the economy is down and our people are struggling, it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel after losses like these,"" Perdue, a Democrat, said in a press release. ""Now families can take some hope from the fact that they will have help replacing some of those losses."" Eight people died in early October after Tropical Storm Nicole interacted with another low-pressure weather front to dump heavy rain from the Carolinas north to Cape Cod. North Carolina was especially hard hit. In Bertie County, for instance, waters that reached as high as stop signs caused the full or partial closure of scores of roads. And many businesses and several historic homes in the town of Windsor ended up partially submerged. County, state and federal emergency officials last week surveyed the storm's impact in 21 North Carolina counties, according to Perdue's office. They found damage to 420 homes -- including 60 that were destroyed -- and 80 businesses. Homeowners who qualify for federal assistance in the six affected counties can receive up to $240,000 to repair or replace their homes and personal belongings. Emergency management officials said that, based on preliminary estimates, they do not believe the state of North Carolina will qualify for federal funding to recoup costs for emergency measures or pay for repairs to roads, bridges or other infrastructure, according to the governor's office.","FEMA has declared federal disaster areas in six North Carolina counties .

"(CNN) -- A U.S. soldier accused of killing civilians in Afghanistan will face a court-martial on murder and other charges, as recommended by an Army officer. The document approving the recommendation for the court-martial of Spc. Jeremy Morlock was signed by the officer in charge Friday. It was obtained by CNN, along with other documents, that summarize last week's hearing at an Army-Air Force installation outside Tacoma, Washington, where prosecutors presented evidence against against Morlock. Base officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document, which has not been publicly released. Morlock is one of five members of the Army's 5th Stryker Brigade who is accused of premeditated murder in a series of incidents between January and May. He has been charged with three counts of premeditated murder and several other charges, including obstruction of justice, assault and using drugs. Morlock's attorneys argued during last week's hearing that he was operating at ""diminished mental capacity"" because of the use of drugs, including hashish and pain medication. But the recommendation from the investigating officer found ""no evidence that the accused was behaving in an erratic, impaired or irrational manner"" at the time of the killings. In addition to the five men charged with murder, seven other soldiers from the same unit face charges ranging from conspiracy and interfering in a military investigation to drug use -- specifically hashish -- while in Afghanistan.","NEW: Spc.

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A court clerk at the trial of Steven Hayes, who was convicted of capital murder in a 2007 Connecticut home invasion, read Tuesday from writings of Hayes' alleged accomplice describing the incident in graphic detail. ""I swung again, and then again ... a look of stunned shock in his eyes,"" wrote Joshua Komisarjevsky about the nighttime attack with a bat on Dr. William Petit, who was sleeping on the porch when the attack began that July night, and proved to be the lone survivor. Prosecutors allege Hayes and Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home, beat Hawke-Petit's husband bloody, strangled Hawke-Petit, set the house afire and tried to flee. The crime shocked the well-to-do New Haven suburb of Cheshire and drew national attention. The writings, read aloud to the jury by a court clerk during Tuesday's penalty phase of Hayes' trial, were selected from a 40-page letter Komisarjevsky wrote to author Brian McDonald in 2008. They describe the men moving on to the bedrooms where Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit, lay sleeping. ""All were compliant,"" he wrote. ""This time I took a risk, pulled the trigger, and the chamber was loaded. ...  The Petit family passed through their fears and into terror. ... It was captivating, validating that this pain in me was real. ... I was looking right at my personal demon, reflected back in their eyes. ... Hayley is a fighter; she tried time and time again to free herself. ... Mr. Petit is a coward; he ran away when he thought his life was threatened, and ran away to leave his wife and children to madmen. ... I was cheated of my retribution, and so was Steve. ... I am what I am; I make no excuses. ... I'm a criminal with a criminal mind."" Police testified that, after finding evidence of a bank account containing $20,000 to $30,000, the two forced Hawke-Petit to go to a bank in the morning and withdraw money from the account. Prosecutors said Hayes took her to the bank while Komisarjevsky stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, the two men allegedly set the home afire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. Komisarjevsky added in his writings, ""I'm ultimately responsible for my own actions. ... Had Mr. Petit fought back in the very beginning, I would have been forced to retreat. ... You're the first line of defense for your family, not law enforcement."" Petit, who was in the courtroom, showed no visible reaction as these passages were read. Afterward, outside the courthouse, he told reporters, ""I really don't want to dignify the ravings of a sociopath who appears to be a pathological liar as well."" Referring to the 11-year-old, Komisarjevsky continued, ""I tasted her fear."" After she was dead, he wrote, he took ""blackmail pictures"" of her body that he ""intended to use against Mr. and Mrs. Petit. ... What I was not prepared for was my demons getting the better of me."" The reading continued: ""How could I have gone oh so far, far wrong? ... Michaela, angel of my nightmares, my pain to yours does not compare. ... You call me from beyond the grave. ... If only I could simply lie here and will myself to die. ... Michaela, Hayley, and Jennifer, forgive me; I am damned. ... I can't believe I lost control; I hate myself/I love myself. ... I stand condemned."" Komisarjevsky added, ""My forthcoming death sentence will be an action of mercy."" Prosecutors had objected to the defense's plan to read excerpts of Komisarjevsky's letters and journal, calling the writings ""fiction and fantasy."" ""It's kind of like 'The World According to Josh,'"" prosecutor Michael Dearington told Judge Jon Blue. But Hayes' attorney, Tom Ullmann, said the writings show that Komisarjevsky -- who is to be tried separately -- ""is the mastermind here ... and Mr. Hayes' culpability is less."" Blue denied the prosecutors' motion to bar the writings, saying, ""Mr. Hayes is fighting for his life at this stage, and he's allowed great latitude."" Hayes, 47, was convicted earlier this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him -- including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping -- in the deaths of Hawke-Petit and her two daughters. After hearing testimony in the penalty phase, the same jurors who convicted Hayes must decide if he should be executed. Earlier in the day, the writings read like a how-to manual on breaking into homes. ""My fundamental trademark is cat-type burglaries,"" Komisarjevsky wrote. ""I'm a burglar; everybody knows I'm a burglar. ... You'd be surprised what people contract me to steal."" ""As my skill progressed over the years, I've reached the point where I can get into a house without any tools, only night vision,"" Komisarjevsky wrote. When he believes a home's occupants are sleeping heavily, ""I make my way to the breaker room and start shutting down the electricity. ... I have night vision; they have darkness."" Four journals were found in Komisarjevsky's cell, testified Rafael Medina, a detective with the Connecticut State Police major crimes unit. In the journals, which were seized by authorities, Komisarjevsky discusses the Cheshire case, he said. Medina testified that what he read in the journals led him to believe Komisarjevsky was communicating with McDonald, whom Medina described as ""a book author."" Visitor logs showed that McDonald had visited Komisarjevsky once, he testified. In the penalty phase, jurors are allowed to consider evidence they heard during the guilt phase of the trial. They can also consider new testimony or evidence that attorneys introduce, which might include the defendant's long history of prior convictions and anything that casts Hayes in a positive light. Hayes himself could testify. The defense offered testimony Monday from witnesses who had interacted with Hayes through work, from his apartment complex or because of his drug addiction. That testimony continued Tuesday with Philip Theeb, a building contractor who said he knew Hayes through his girlfriend and gave him work as a painter. Theeb described Hayes as a hard worker and said he loaned Hayes his truck on the weekend the attack took place, but ""on Monday morning he failed to show up."" He told jurors he had met Komisarjevsky before, and tried to call him after Hayes did not show up. When he first heard from the police, he said, he thought Hayes ""had done something stupid."" When he heard what Hayes was accused of, Theeb said, he was ""shocked. ... I couldn't believe it."" William Petit has said he will not offer a victim impact statement during Hayes' penalty phase, saying in a statement he ""regretfully"" decided against doing so because Connecticut's law on victim impact statements is unclear and could provide convicts with grounds to appeal their sentences. After Wednesday, when just one witness is scheduled to testify, no testimony will occur as the judge and attorneys work on jury instructions. Testimony is to resume Monday.","NEW: ""I swung again, and then again""

"(CNN) -- An international court cleared the way Tuesday to try a former politician and militia leader for crimes against humanity and war crimes including murder, rape and pillaging. The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague, Netherlands, knocked down an appeal by Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, ruling that the court may admit his case to trial. Bemba's defense challenged his case's admissibility on the grounds that the Central African Republic (CAR) -- the country the alleged crimes occurred in -- investigated the case and made a ""decision not to prosecute."" The ICC decided that the CAR's action does not prohibit the case from being tried, according to a news release issued by the court Tuesday. Bemba, a former vice president in the Democratic Republic of Congo, is accused of leading his militia in attacks on civilians in the CAR for almost five months, according to the International Federation for Human Rights (IFHR). Under his leadership his Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) allegedly murdered, raped and pillaged in the neighboring country ""during the period approximately between 26 October 2002 and 15 March, 2003"", according to the ICC.","Court rejects appeal by Bemba .

"(CNN) -- The glamour shots capture them in fashion-model poses -- sprawled on a couch or lounging by the pool, smiling and sensuous. Filomena Domingos da Costa, from left, Anita Pedro and Maria Restino Manuel are competing for the unusual title. But these women aren't typical pageant contestants: Each lost a limb after stepping on a landmine in their native Angola. On Wednesday, they compete for the unusual title of Miss Landmine Angola 2008. Organizers say they want the pageant to restore the women's pride and raise awareness about the prevalence of landmines left over from Angola's three decade-long civil war. Undetonated mines still maim 300 to 400 people a year in the county, according to the United Nations. ""I'm completely enthusiastic about participating,"" said one of the contestants, 25-year-old Paulina Vadi. ""I think that it will give society a wake-up call to be more attentive to disabled people in general."" Vadi was a fourth-grader when she went to a field to gather fruit. A sudden military attack sent her running for cover. She stepped on a Russian-made mine and lost her right leg. That was 11 years ago. Now Vadi lives with her mother and three school-aged children. She works as a street vendor, selling beer and soda. She said she entered the pageant because she wants to be able to return to school. The contestants represent Angola's various provinces and range in age from 19 to 33. Their profiles list not only their ages and favorite colors but also when they were injured and what kind of mine claimed their limbs. Most were maimed while tending fields, and they are now unemployed. Vadi's photograph has her reclined atop a safe, a tiara on her head and a stack of cash in her left hand. Her sash reads, ""Huila,"" the province she is representing. All the contestants will receive governmental help to go back to school or to start a small business. The winner gets a new prosthetic limb. Angolan organizers expect to crown two winners Wednesday: one picked by a panel of a dozen officials from the Angolan government and foreign embassies, the other through an online poll. So far, organizers said, close to 9,000 viewers from about 30 countries have voted for their favorite participant on the Web site, www.miss-landmine.org. Pageants for contestants who face physical challenges are nothing new. The United States has Ms. Wheelchair America. And contestants from around the globe compete each year in Miss Deaf World. The Angolan pageant -- with its motto of ""Everyone has a right to be beautiful"" -- focuses on a problem that is particularly severe in that country. Thousands of Angolans have been maimed by mines buried during a bloody 27-year civil war. The war began shortly after the country's independence from Portugal in 1975 and ended six years ago, killing 1.5 million people. Warring sides buried millions of landmines to depopulate areas, slow the movement of opposing forces and defend towns, bridges and power lines. Despite an extensive de-mining program since the end of the war, Angola remains one of the most mined countries in Africa. The mines are so prevalent that their legacy was immediately obvious when Norwegian artist Morten Traavik first visited the southern African nation in 2003, a year after the war ended. ""The whole country was littered with landmines left over from the conflict,"" Traavik said. ""You virtually couldn't move anywhere because most of the country wasn't even surveyed for landmines, let alone cleared."" While there, Traavik judged a neighborhood beauty contest in the capital of Luanda -- and got the idea for the landmine pageant. Finding money for it proved difficult. Traavik said several nongovernmental organizations turned him down, with one labeling his idea a ""freak show."" ""That says more about your own attitudes toward the disabled people -- and how you think Africans are supposed to be and look like -- than it does our project,"" he said. Soon after, Traavik won the blessing of the Angolan government. And he eventually was able to change the minds of people who were initially reluctant, said Becky Thomson, mine action program manager for the nongovernmental group Norwegian People's Aid. ""I think one of the reasons quite a few of us changed our initial reservations and are seeing it in a different light is very much linked to the fact that when you see the photographs, you see that the women are profiled with dignity,"" Thomson said. ""That is really important."" Indeed, dignity is what spurred several of the women to participate. Contestant Ana Diogo is a 32-year-old widowed mother of three who lost her leg to an Italian-made mine in 1984. Diogo is unemployed, selling tomatoes on the streets when she can find any. She said she hopes the pageant will give her a chance at a better life. Her dream job? ""Anything,"" she said.

"(CNN) -- Police arrested another teen Thursday, the sixth suspect jailed in connection with the gang rape of a 15-year-old girl on a northern California high school campus. Jose Carlos Montano, 18, was arrested on charges of felony rape, rape in concert with force, and penetration with a foreign object, said Richmond Police Lt. Mark Gagan. Montano was arrested Thursday evening in San Pablo, California, a small town about two miles from the city of Richmond, where the crime took place. Montano, who was held in lieu of $1.3 million bail, is accused of taking part in what police said was a 2Â½-hour assault on the Richmond High School campus. Police said as many as 10 people were involved in the rape in a dimly lit back alley at the school, while another 10 people watched without calling 911. The victim was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but was released Wednesday. Four other teenage suspects were arraigned Thursday on charges connected to the rape. Cody Ray Smith, described by the court as older than 14, pleaded not guilty to charges of rape with a foreign object and rape by force. Two other juveniles, Ari Abdallah Morales and Marcelles James Peter, appeared with Smith at the Contra Costa County Superior Court, but did not enter a plea. The court described Morales as younger than 16, and did not give an age for Peter. All three juveniles, who wore bulletproof vests at the hearing, were charged as adults. A fourth person, Manuel Ortega, 19, appeared separately without an attorney and did not enter a plea. He did not wear a protective vest. Another person, Salvador Rodriguez, 21, was arrested Tuesday night, but he was not in court Thursday.","Another arrest made in gang rape outside California school .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- An anti-insurgent provincial governor who had survived Taliban assassination attempts was among 20 people who died Friday in an explosion at a northern Afghan mosque during prayers, a government official said. The blast in Afghanistan's Takhar province killed Kunduz provincial governor Mohammad Omar, who recently sounded an alarm about the threat of insurgents during an interview with CNN. The bombing also wounded 35 others, with most of those killed and injured engaged in prayer, said Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman Zamarai Bashari. ""It is a terrible incident,"" said Bashari, who said police were trying to find out more details about the strike and who is responsible. The NATO-led command condemned the attack, saying that ""it's unconscionable that anyone would attack a mosque."" ""It's clear the insurgents have no respect for the most holy of Islamic places,"" said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Greg Smith, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul deplored the act, saying ""whoever was responsible"" for striking a house of worship ""has demonstrated a clear lack of disregard for the Afghan people and for the peaceful religion they practice."" The mosque was bloodied and its roof was shattered, eyewitness Mujib Rahman said, but there were different early accounts on how the strike was carried out. Gen. Daoud Daoud, commander of the Afghan Interior Ministry's northern zone, said a suicide attacker apparently sitting next to the governor detonated a bomb. Faiz Mohammad Powhidi, a Takhar governor spokesman, told CNN that a pre-placed mine exploded. He explained that governor had been visiting his family and attending Friday prayers weekly in his native province of Takhar, which borders Kunduz. Omar, who was a Pashtun, had survived several assassination attempts by the Taliban, and his brother was slain a few months ago. He told CNN on Sunday that for the last two years, the security situation has deteriorated in Kunduz because insurgents decided to destabilize northern Afghanistan, which, until recently, had been relatively stable during the nine-year-old Afghan conflict. The Takhar blast and the Thursday killing of a German soldier in the north illustrates a growing unrest that contrasts with the first years after the Taliban's collapse in 2001. In those days, the north was much more secure than the predominantly ethnic Pashtun south and east of the country. Omar told CNN that the insurgents were trying to use Kunduz as a launchpad to destabilize northern Afghanistan and the wider Central Asian region and lamented the lack of police available to battle insurgents. ""Currently 40 percent of Kunduz province is under Taliban control,"" he said. German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle conveyed his regrets to the Afghan government in a letter. ""Yesterday we suffered the death of a Bundeswehr soldier,"" he said. ""Today the news reaches us of another attack in which the governor of Kunduz, Mohammad Omar, was killed. I wanted to express my condolences on the part of the federal government."" Other violence rippled across the country on Friday. Three coalition soldiers in southern Afghanistan were killed: one in an insurgent attack and two others in improvised explosive device attacks. NATO does not give the nationalities of service members who are killed, but the British Defence Ministry said one of its soldiers was killed in Helmand province in the south Friday. NATO-led forces killed five armed men in eastern Afghanistan's Khost province. The command is investigating allegations of civilian casualties in the latter incident, ISAF said.","NEW: NATO, U.S. Germans condemn attack .

"(CNN) -- Four Americans were killed in a small plane crash in northwestern Mexico, the president of the volunteer organization Flying Samaritans said Saturday. The plane had been headed on a medical mission in the Mexican state of Baja California and lost radio contact with the ground on Friday afternoon, said Flying Samaritans President Victor Jones. The wreckage of a Beechcraft A36 plane and the bodies of the four volunteers were discovered Saturday ""after an extensive ground, air and water search,"" Jones said in a statement Saturday. The wreckage was located in rough terrain about 30 miles south of Ensenada, Mexico -- a city on the Pacific coast -- where the plane had departed Friday afternoon en route to San Quintin, Mexico. Jones said that Mexican authorities found four bodies in the wreckage. Radio contact with the plane was lost shortly after the pilot reported to the Ensenada airport on Friday when it was about 10 miles south of the airport, Jones said. He identified the victims as: James Thornton, a plastic surgeon; Graciela Sarmiento, a doctor; Andrew Theil, a non-medical support staffer; and Roger Lyon, the pilot. Flying Samaritans transports medical and support personnel to clinics in Baja California -- which is just south of California, the American state -- where they provide free medical services and supplies to those who lack medical care.

"(CNN) -- A letter written by a Louisiana State University student leader and published Monday in a New Hampshire newspaper is taking Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal to task for his out-of-state travels. The letter in New Hampshire's Keene Sentinel tells readers: ""Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is spending more time in your state than the one he was elected to represent. I read almost daily about his trips to other states, which makes me believe that he is more interested in running for president than running the state of Louisiana."" J Hudson, the letter's author, is a 21-year-old political science and communications major as well as LSU's student body president.  The reason he wrote the letter, he said, is because he tried through traditional means of arranging a meeting to discuss education cuts with Jindal -- but to no avail. ""We tried to set up meetings with Governor Jindal.  We got an e-mail sent back to us from his executive assistant, telling us that his schedule was very tight,"" Hudson said.  ""But a few days after that, I started reading he was in Florida, New Hampshire, New York, Wisconsin.  No wonder he has no time, he's all over the United States and not in Louisiana."" Jindal was in New Hampshire on October 14 and in several other states recently to attend political fundraising events. Kyle Plotkin, Jindal's press secretary said in a statement Monday: ""The Governor has spent over  90 percent of the days since taking office in Louisiana, traveling to every parish multiple  times. It's good for Louisiana for the Governor to share with  business and other leaders across the country our success in outperforming the  national economy."" In the letter, Hudson said he wanted to ask the governor ""why he's imposing devastating budget cuts that will result in the firing of one-third of the university's faculty and reduce enrollment by 8,000."" LSU, the victim of numerous budget cuts in recent years, is bracing for as much as a $62 million reduction in the future due to the state's financial crisis. Hudson said it's that crisis facing his school that has him trying to track down the governor. ""Governor Jindal, Louisiana higher education is about to be devastated. It will take a generation for our universities to recover. On behalf of the students whose hopes for a brighter future will soon be crushed, I beg you to return to Louisiana and fix your state's serious problems. You've neglected your constituents long enough,"" Hudson said in the letter. Plotkin said the governor's chief of staff  and policy director have already met with Hudson to discuss education funding. ""It's great he and other students are getting involved in the political process and we hope they continue to be part of the conversation. We have an open dialogue with the higher education community about the state's budget challenges and we're working to mitigate reductions to classrooms,"" Plotkin said. ""The reality though is that higher education officials are not delivering the value our students deserve. That's why we've encouraged higher education administrative officials to prioritize reductions so that they come mainly from administrative overhead, not teaching and research."" Hudson said he believed legislators should change state policy to better protect higher education and perhaps find other areas to make budget cuts in. Despite taking the meeting request to the public stage, Hudson said the governor's been doing a good job and he bears no ill will towards him. ""I'm very satisfied with his role. He can really speak for the people and protect the interests of the citizens of our state, with our natural disasters and the Gulf oil spill,"" he said.  ""All I'm asking is just for a meeting, a 30-minute meeting on how to protect the flagship institution of our state."" Hudson said he would consider voting for Jindal if he should run for president, if he spends more time at home.  ""We need him in this state.  Look, I'm not saying he wouldn't be a great presidential candidate if he ever went into something like that, but take care of your home first, and then you can move on to whatever presidential aspirations you have.""","A university student leader thinks Gov.

Officials did not specify what kind of medical records they were seeking. Dental records are sometimes used to identify a body. Although authorities believe Zahra is dead, her remains have not been found. Burke County Sheriff John McDevitt has said that Zahra's disappearance is being investigated as a homicide. Zahra was reported missing October 9 and no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman reported seeing her at a furniture store, Deal said. Police have been searching for the girl in and around the city of Hickory. ""We're speaking to her on a regular basis,"" Deal said of Zahra's biological mother. ""She's very concerned, and she's very appreciative of everything being done to solve this case."" The deputy police chief said authorities are not clear on the circumstances of the split between the mother and father. Police said last week that the girl's stepmother, Elisa Baker, admitted to writing a fake ransom note that was left at the family's home. She was arrested October 10 on unrelated charges, including writing worthless checks. More recently, authorities charged her with obstruction of justice, a felony, after she admitted writing the fake note, according to Hickory Police Chief Tom Adkins. Elisa Baker remains jailed on those charges. Her bail has been set at a combined $70,000, an amount her lawyer called excessive. Police said the girl's father, Adam Baker, also faces bad-check charges, but has not been arrested. He is assisting police in their search. ""Every time we ask him to be somewhere, he's there,"" Deal said. The disappearance of Zahra --  a freckle-faced youngster who uses a prosthetic leg and hearing aids -- has made international news. The girl lost her leg to bone cancer, according to CNN affiliate WCNC. Family members and neighbors have told reporters that Zahra's stepmother had abused her. Her attorney, Scott Reilly, vehemently denied those allegations during an interview Monday. ""Whatever investigation was done, there was never anything substantiated regarding child abuse by Elisa Baker,"" he said. ""The lady saying they were keeping Zahra in the attic, and they thought it was squirrels, that lady has squirrels in her head,"" Reilly said, referring to a woman who spoke to the media. ""She had no business saying things that were untrue. Someone else says she was kept in a locked room and only allowed to come out five minutes a day to eat. Those people [reporting that information] should have their media credentials revoked."" Earlier, a relative said that the alleged abuse was reported to the state Department of Social Services but the relative did not know the outcome. The state office said such a report would have been handled by a county office but that the agency is barred from commenting because of strict confidentiality laws. Reilly said he has filed a motion to reduce Elisa Baker's bond, and a hearing has been set for Wednesday.

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities are offering a $1.2 million (15 million pesos) reward for information on 14 children who may have been taken from orphanages by child traffickers, according to a release from the attorney general of Mexico. The attorney general also is offering about $400,000 (5 million pesos) in the search for three people in the ""Casitas del Sur"" case, a statement said Friday.

"New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A man convicted of capital murder in a 2007 Connecticut home invasion has attempted suicide several times since his arrest and has said he wants to receive the death penalty, a forensic psychiatrist testified Wednesday. Steven Hayes, 47, was convicted this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him -- including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping -- in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home in Cheshire, beat Jennifer Hawke-Petit's husband bloody, strangled Hawke-Petit, set the house afire and tried to flee. On cross-examination, Dr. Paul Amble said his panel did not address the question of whether the defendant's suicide attempts were sincere. But in his opinion, Hayes was ""making decisions that were rational, given his situation"" when he said he wanted to receive the death penalty. ""I want to plead guilty to everything now, because I just want it over now,"" Hayes told an evaluation team, the assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine testified to a jury considering whether to sentence Steven Hayes to death. Hayes described a plan to ""look like a monster"" to the jury, expressing no remorse, in an attempt to move the jurors to sentence him to death, Amble wrote in his evaluation of the defendant. In March, Hayes told a psychologist that he no longer wanted to commit suicide ""but intended to let the state do it,"" Amble said. Judge Jon Blue had asked Amble to evaluate Hayes to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. Hayes ""described five overdose attempts"" that he felt Connecticut corrections staff was aware of, Amble said. The last such attempt came January 31, when Hayes ""took a fairly large amount of thorazine ... nearly twice the lethal limit,"" Amble said. The incident forced a delay in Hayes' trial, which had been set for February 1. Thorazine is an antipsychotic medication that can also be prescribed to treat anxiety, as it was in Hayes' case. Asked to describe his mood on a scale of zero to 10, Hayes ranked it at zero and described symptoms of helplessness and hopelessness since his arrest shortly after the killings, Amble testified. He said Hayes told him he had tried to strangle himself with a sock but failed because he couldn't tighten it enough to cut off circulation. Hayes told his evaluators that he had considered other ways to end his life, such as ""putting my head in the toilet and doing a back flip"" to break his neck, but opted against doing so out of fear that he might only paralyze or otherwise injure himself, according to the evaluation carried out by Amble. Hayes told the evaluation team in March that ""he wanted to essentially encourage the jury to vote in favor of the death penalty ... perhaps by taking the stand and looking like he has no remorse,"" Amble said. ""His desire was to actively seek the death penalty."" He said Hayes has lost more than 60 pounds since his arrest and complained of not sleeping well and of nightmares. His psychiatrist in prison has diagnosed him with ""adjustment disorder"" and ""major depression,"" Amble said. Prosecutor Michael Dearington asked Amble whether Hayes truly wanted to be executed. ""I don't know,"" the doctor said. ""I'm not here to say I can exactly divine his thoughts, only what he said."" Komisarjevsky is to be tried separately, but on Tuesday, a court clerk read from Komisarjevsky's writings providing graphic descriptions of the incident. ""I am what I am; I make no excuses,"" Komisarjevsky wrote. ""I'm a criminal with a criminal mind."" But he also appeared to express remorse, at one point writing, ""Michaela, Haley and Jennifer, forgive me; I am damned. ... My forthcoming death sentence will be an action of mercy."" Police testified that in the 2007 home invasion, Hayes and Komisarjevsky found evidence of a bank account containing $20,000 to $30,000 and forced Hawke-Petit to go to a bank in the morning and withdraw money from the account. Prosecutors said Hayes took her to the bank while Komisarjevsky stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, officials said, the two men set the home afire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. Amble was the only witness to testify on Wednesday, and no further testimony is scheduled until Monday, after the judge and attorneys spend the rest of this week working on jury instructions. .","NEW: Steven Hayes wanted to ""look like a monster"" to the jury .

"(CNN)  -- Tiger Woods will have a new putter in his hands as he bids to make golfing history by becoming the first player to win the British Open at the same venue three times in a row after earlier triumphs at St.Andrews in 2000 and 2005. The troubled world number one begins his challenge at the home of golf on Thursday morning as he tees off with England's in-form Justin Rose and Colombia's Camilo Villegas and will have a new addition to his golf bag. Woods told gathered reporters Tuesday that he was forsaking the club which had helped him to 13 of his 14 majors in favor of a heavier putter to tackle the greens of the Old Course. ""I've always struggled on slower greens and the one I've gone to this week comes off faster and I've had to make very little adjustment,"" he said. Woods has played three practice rounds in windy conditions on the Scottish coast, having arrived on Sunday. The American took part in a charity pro-am event in Ireland at the beginning of last week and would normally have gone straight to St.Andrews, but instead flew home to see his two children. Woods again refused to comment on reports of a divorce settlement with his Swedish wife Elin. He went into self-imposed exile from golf at the beginning of the year after revelations of marital infidelity provoked unfavorable headlines. Facing persistent questioning from reporters on his private life, Woods claimed it would have no effect on his performance this week. ""(The scandal) doesn't impact it at all. I'm here to play a championship,"" Woods said. ""This is the Open Championship at St. Andrews. This is as good as it gets. It's the home of golf. I'm just like every other player in this field."" Woods is without a win since his return to the circuit in April, but has finished shared fourth in both the U.S Masters and the recent U.S. Open. He told his personal website that despite his winless streak, he was happy with his general game as he bids for a 15th major crown. ""I have been driving it on a string. The club feels so good in my hands,"" Woods said. ""I went back to my fundamentals with my putting and my stroke feels good."" Woods won at St.Andrews in 2000 by eight shots and five in 2005 but missed the cut in last year's British Open at Turnberry. Despite being installed as favorite with bookmakers, Woods appears to have lost his aura of invincibility, but three-time major winner Padraig Harrington said that could all change quickly. ""Tiger finishing fourth in a major is considered a failure -- it is amazing what expectations can do because in those two performances he could have won both,"" he told UK's Press Association. ""But if he comes out and wins, wins, wins then players will be intimidated by him,"" he added. European Ryder Cup captain Colin Montgomerie, second to Woods on the Old Course in 2005, also believes Woods can do a 'three-peat' at St.Andrews if he can use his new putter to good effect. ""It would be the tough guy to bet against him on a course that is entirely suited to his strength, which is putting,"" he told Press Association. Woods' great rival Phil Mickelson is second favorite with most odds makers but comes into the tournament off the back of missing the cut in the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond and a mediocre record at the British Open, with a best of third place in 2004. Mickelson also has another chance to overtake Woods as world number one, but only a victory and his fifth major title will definitely secure him top spot.","Tiger Woods forsakes old putter as he bids for third straight win at St.Andrews .

"London, England (CNN) -- There are many off-field aspects to the modern-day World Cup which makes the experience complete for soccer-crazy fans; from the unveiling of a tournament mascot to themed merchandise such as computer games and event specific kits for the teams taking part. Another crucial element to this list of tournament treats is the release of the all-important official World Cup football. The 2010 edition of the event, which will kick off in South Africa on June 11, is no different, with football's world governing body FIFA commissioning German sport manufacturer Adidas to create the hallowed orb. The ball has been named ""Jabulani"" -- a Zulu phrase which means ""to celebrate"" -- and uses eleven different colors to represent the eleven players on a team, as well as the eleven official languages and tribes of South Africa. Not since 1986 has the World Cup used a leather ball -- and the ""Jabulani"" is far removed from its more simple parent with eight thermally-bonded panels used in its construction. It is thought that demand will be high for the spheres come June, and in anticipation 1,760 a day are being produced using complex processes such as high-frequency forming, vacuuming and thermal bonding, which Adidas says give the product ""ground-breaking"" performance. Chelsea and Germany captain Michael Ballack for one seems to be a fan, after he told reporters ""the ball does exactly what I want it to do"" on its release. Whether the ball will help Ballack's side go two better than their third-place finish in 2006, to pick up their fourth world title, remains to be seen.","The new 2010 World Cup ball is named ""Jabulani"", which means ""to celebrate"" in Zulu .

"(CNN) -- Somali gunmen on Wednesday released a British aid worker kidnapped last week while working for Save the Children. The aid worker, named as Zimbabwe-born Frans Barnard, was freed after tribal elders negotiated with his captors, Save the Children confirmed. Barnard was safe and well and had been moved to a more secure place in Somalia, Save the Children said in a statement. No ransom had been paid by the organization to secure Barnard's release, it said. ""Save the Children's policy is not to pay ransoms and we did not pay a ransom to secure Fran's release. The release was negotiated by the clan elders and we are extremely grateful to them,"" Save the Children said. ""We believe Frans was abducted by an independent group of criminals with no political affiliation or support from other groups in the region."" Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth earlier told BBC radio Barnard had been looked after by his kidnappers. ""He is well, he is in good spirits and he is on his way to a place of safety,"" he said. British Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed news of Barnard's release and said the government had been in close contact with Save the Children. ""Let me praise the professionalism of Save the Children and also thank the Somali clan members who were involved in his release,""  Cameron told lawmakers. ""I'm sure it will be good for him to be back with his family after what must have been a very, very frightening and difficult few days."" Barnard was kidnapped along with a Somali aid worker from a guesthouse compound in the town of Adado, near the Ethiopian border, last Thursday. The Somali national was released soon afterwards. Save the Children is an international organization based in the United Kingdom. It works to improve the lives of children worldwide. The group said it had been assessing the feasibility of starting up an humanitarian program to help malnourished and sick children and their families in the area. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between rebels and government troops has escalated the humanitarian crisis in the famine-ravaged country.","British aid worker Frans Barnard released by gunmen in Somalia .

"(CNN) -- I am a product of the ""The Black Church."" It shaped me into who I am today: a Christian pastor aware of God's amazing grace and love. When I announced I was gay, the church limited that grace and love. Although I had no doubt that God loved me, I discovered that God's love and the church's love can be two different things. To be Christian is to be inclusive of people who love one another. This is why I support same-sex marriage. As a pastor, I have counseled countless heterosexual and homosexual couples, and have observed that no matter the race, background or sexual orientation of the couple, a healthy relationship requires commitment, genuine respect and mutual love. Though my partner and I had a commitment ceremony in 2003, and obtained a marriage license this past July in Washington D.C., we learned that marriage is more than our religious convictions and our commitment, but also about laws that will protect us. Marriage equality is not about religious rights, but the right to equal benefits. At the end of 2003, the U.S. Government Accountability Office identified 1,138 federal provisions where marital status is a factor in determining or receiving benefits, rights and privileges. These include next-of-kin hospital visits and medical decisions where one partner is too ill to be competent; automatic inheritance in the absence of a will and inheritance of jointly owned real and personal property through the right of survivorship. These benefits allow all marriages access to the social and emotional supports that can produce healthy families and communities. I affirm the role of religion in our society. But no matter how powerful religion is, in the United States, the laws of the church and the laws of the government are intentionally separate. Another view from the pulpit: Same-sex marriages will hurt families . In 1968, 73 percent of Americans disapproved of marriage between blacks and whites. Then, it was argued that interracial marriage would hurt families and dismantle societal structures. In 1967, the Supreme court ended race-based restrictions on marriage in Loving vs. Virginia. Today, support of interracial marriage is stronger than it has ever been. So is support of same-sex marriage. Like interracial couples, gay couples are seeking equality under the law, asking their government for these rights, not individuals, or religious bodies. If same-sex marriage is about love and religion is about love, then in this debate, love must go both ways. We must not be hateful in our disagreements over marriage. Verbal and emotional abuse should have no place in our sacred places of worship. The pulpit should not be used as a place of abuse even if one disagrees with same-sex marriage. Jesus never mentioned homosexuality in his 33 years of life. But in Mark 12:31, he did emphasize, ""...thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these."" The apostle Paul said: ""Be kindly affectionate one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another."" I wonder what the debate over same-sex-marriage would be like if we applied this basic scripture? True equality can begin when we see others as we see ourselves. I believe there is room to disagree, but just because we don't agree on my legal rights does not mean I am not entitled to them. The gay community must also learn how to love those who disagree with them. If heterosexual couples and gay couples could see their commonality, equality would not just be the law of the land, but it could be a new law for humanity that governs our fragile future. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of O.C. Allen.","O.C. Allen says he is a product of ""The Black Church,"" which helped shape him into a pastor .

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India's home minister said Friday that security and maintenance issues have been squared away ahead of the staging of the Commonwealth Games, which are beset by a myriad of problems. P. Chidambaram told CNN that all security issues have been addressed and that every participating team has categorically said they are fully satisfied with security. The minister also said the midnight Friday deadline to clean up the venues has been met. He said 10 of the 11 village venues have been taken over by security, and another will be taken over shortly. More than 1,000 cleaners entered the athletes' village Friday, armed with brooms, mops and other cleaning supplies to get the facility into shape. Organizers are scrambling to pull together the Commonwealth Games, which are to start October 3 in New Delhi. India's ability to host the games was questioned after a bridge collapse and criticism of the athletes' village as uninhabitable and filthy. Some countries have threatened to pull out of the competition. Commonwealth Games President Mike Fennell was to meet Indian Cabinet Secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar in New Delhi late Friday afternoon to discuss the troubled preparations for the games, which take place every four years among members of the former British empire. The list of countries that will compete has been in flux, as teams awaited updates on construction and hygiene at games sites. Canada, New Zealand and Scotland had delayed their teams' departures for the event. A spokesman said Friday that Scotland's team would depart for India the next day, and the New Zealand Olympic Committee said its athletes would depart two days later than planned. ""I am certainly pleased to arrive in Delhi with the news that Australia has moved into the village to get ready for the arrival of their athletes and with the confirmation late yesterday that England and Wales will be on their way to Delhi shortly,"" Fennell said in a news release Friday afternoon. He was to tour the village on Friday for a firsthand look. Welsh athletes were reassured by the games' organizers, the Commonwealth Games Council for Wales said. ""The advance party will now be moving into our accommodation, and we look forward to welcoming our athletes in the coming days,"" the Welsh council said in a news release. Worldwide criticism and stepped-up involvement by higher-level Indian officials at the last minute appeared to help the games turn the corner. A private cleaning company also was hired to do the deep cleaning of the athletes' housing. Earlier in the week, photos showed soiled rooms that included excrement and animal footprints. Construction concerns also spread after a pedestrian bridge collapsed at a stadium Tuesday, injuring 27 people. Ceiling tiles fell off the same stadium Wednesday. Australia's Olympic Committee leader said Friday that the Commonwealth Games should not have been awarded to India, considering how preparations have gone, but the clock is ticking and it's time to move ahead. ""I don't think it is a cultural thing,"" committee President John Coates told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, ""When you agree to host an Olympic Games, you are required to provide the basics in terms of health and hygiene for the athletes. I'm very aware, having hosted a games, and I don't think you reduce yourself to the lowest common denominator."" The problem is that the Commonwealth Games' parent organization doesn't have enough resources to help organizing cities track progress, Coates said. He compared the resources of the Commonwealth Games Federation and those of the International Olympic Committee. The Commonwealth Games Federation has five staff members; the Olympic Committee has hundreds. Security questions also emerged after two visitors from Taiwan were injured by gunmen who fired on a tourist bus in New Delhi on Sunday. In Australia, a travel advisory has been issued for India, warning of a high risk of terrorism in New Delhi. Such concerns led New Zealand cyclist Greg Henderson to announce his withdrawal from the games on Friday. ""It was just mainly a decision my wife and I made involving the safety and security of the games,"" he said from Melbourne, Australia, where he was training for other events. Photos of soiled rooms at the games venues made them uneasy, he said. ""I didn't think it was a risk I would like to take,"" Henderson said, also referring to security concerns and his being the father of a 13-month-old girl. A handful of other athletes have withdrawn from the games over safety and hygiene concerns. They include Australia's Dani Samuels, the world discus champion, and Canadian archers Kevin Tataryn and Dietmar Trillus. CNN's Ben Brumfield in Atlanta, Georgia, and Mallika Kapur in New Delhi, India, contributed to this report.","NEW: Home minister says all security issues have been addressed .

"(CNN) -- Al Jazeera, the Qatar-based satellite TV network, claims its live broadcasts of the 2010 FIFA World Cup were jammed from a location inside Jordan. ""This resulted in millions of viewers throughout the Middle East and North Africa to [sic] suffer from frequent disruptions of the broadcast,"" Al Jazeera said Thursday. The global network said it based its accusation on the findings of ""teams of independent international technology experts"" who investigated the interruptions. A Jordanian government source ""categorically denied"" Al Jazeera's claim and called it ""absolutely baseless and unacceptable,"" according to a report by Jordan's official Petra News Agency. An Al Jazeera spokesperson said: ""This action targeted Al Jazeera and was intentionally designed to deprive millions of fans across the region from enjoying this global event. It is alarming that the source of the interruption is in fact from inside the Arab world, and we will be in touch with the Jordanian government to demand a full inquiry to uncover the details of this incident."" The Jordanian government source, quoted by Petra, responded: ""The government is ready to cooperate with any team of independent experts to examine the facts, and is certain that any such examination will prove these allegations false."" Shawn Powers, assistant professor at Georgia State University and associate director for The Center for International Media Education, told CNN the technology required to carry out jamming of this type and scale is highly likely to have been owned by a government -- and used with the government's knowledge. According to Powers, Jordan's motivation for possibly interrupting Al Jazeera broadcasts could stem from the troubled history between Qatar and Jordan. ""It is a bigger deal than just a spat about soccer. It is a way to stop the rise of Qatar. Jordan and Qatar are competing nation states for influence in the region. By discrediting Al Jazeera -- that's good for them [Jordan] because it takes away a potent weapon of the Qatari government,"" Dr. Powers said. Jordan fist took action against Al Jazeera in 1998 after the network accused the Jordanian government of conspiring with Israel against the Palestinian territories. Jordan reacted by shutting down Al Jazeera's bureau in Amman and recalling the Jordanian ambassador in Qatar. Similar spats have taken place with Jordan accusing Al Jazeera of excessive criticism of Jordan's King Abdullah and his government. The 2010 FIFA World Cup was staged in South Africa in June and July.","Millions suffered frequent disruptions of the broadcast, says Al Jazeera .

"BOGOTA, Colombia (CNN)  -- More than 50,000 residents of northern Colombia remained homeless Monday after the rain-swollen Magdalena River broke through dikes and flooded towns and surrounding areas. Floods hit Valle de Cauca, Colombia, last month. Floods are blamed for 67 deaths in Colombia since September. In the town of Plato, the water flooded 4,000 homes and buildings, leaving 40,000 people homeless, Mayor Jose Rosales Cortina told El Tiempo newspaper. The floodwaters washed away 50 houses, he said. No fatalities have been reported in this weekend's flooding. ""Everything is collapsing -- the economic system, the health system, public services,"" Rosales Cortina said in an interview on CNN affiliate Caracol TV. ""We need help,"" one anguished woman said on the newscast. ""Don't you see that the town is totally flooded? We don't have anything in this town. No one helps us here."" The flooding has hit several other riverside cities in Magdalena, one of Colombia's 32 state-like ""departments."" Municipalities in other departments also have been flooded. In Plato, about 560 miles north of Bogota, the Magdalena River broke through a levee Saturday. The suddenness of the flooding surprised many residents. Water reached the rooftops of many homes and power was lost in most of the city. ""The water roared. It roared,"" said resident Noris Padilla. ""The current took you away. You couldn't hold onto anything. It took away eight houses here."" Alvaro Padilla said on Caracol TV that he went underwater to look inside his house, which had water nearly to the roof. ""The furniture, the bed, the television, everything is under water,"" he said. Thousands of homeless residents have taken shelter in hospitals, schools and sports venues. Police in Plato, which has 70,000 residents, have restricted access to the city because of looting. Caracol showed a resident carrying a rifle overhead as he waded through chest-high water. ""First of all, they steal our electric wiring. They take our roofs. They take all that away. So we have to stay here,"" the man said, pointing to his weapon. At a nearby school, La Escuela Urbana Mixta San Rafael, a man was treading water near the building's front wall as he spoke with a reporter on a boat. ""The computers, the fans, all that is underwater,"" he said. Magdalena Gov. Omar Diaz Granados said officials have delivered 2,500 food baskets, 1,000 hammocks, 1,000 awnings, 5,000 sleeping bags and 10 rolls of plastic to make shelters. Plato Mayor Rosales said eight of the city's 11 districts were flooded, including several government buildings, the courthouse, a clinic and the city's main Catholic church. The priest had taken refuge on the second floor of the parish house. Even though some food has been delivered, Rosales said, some people are hungry. ""There is still no official tally, but the losses are in the multimillions,"" Rosales told El Tiempo, ""There are stores, houses and farms destroyed. In sum, people who lost it all."" In the town of Pedraza in Heredia department, 4,000 people fled to higher ground after the Magdalena ripped a 150-foot hole in a retention wall. Water reached the rooftops of more than 330 homes and flooded the town's school and church, El Tiempo said. At least 2,500 residents lost everything. In Bolivar department, 1,500 families were flooded out in the town of Regidor. Nationwide, the Colombian Civil Defense said, nearly 1 million people have been left homeless since Colombia's rainy season started in mid-September. The rainy season has lasted longer than usual. Officials say flooding has killed 67 people and injured 94 this year, Caracol Radio reported. Eighteen people remain missing in 27 departments.","Floodwaters from Magdalena River reach rooftops in northern Colombia .

Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Before you complain again about living in 2010 and not yet having a jetpack to fly you to work, consider taking a trip to Mexico. There's only one person in the world who produces a complete flying rocket belt from start to finish -- from the parts to the fuel that powers it. His name is Juan Manuel Lozano and he lives in Cuernavaca, a city two hours south of Mexico City. So VBS sister technology channel Motherboard.tv traveled to visit him at his company, TAM (TecnologÃ­a Aeroespacial Mexicana). A self-taught scientist and inventor whose technologies have traveled the world from Turkey to Switzerland, from Boeing to the U.S. Navy, Lozano considers his biggest achievement not his jetpack, but a machine that produces pure hydrogen peroxide that he uses as fuel for most of his inventions. Apart from his rocket belt, he's assembled a rocket bicycle, rocket motorcycle, rocket dragster and a personal helicopter. Then there's the hydrogen-peroxide-powered rocket belt. While at least one company has recently promised to bring personal flying machines to market, these conveyances only rely on propellers, not jets. But the real thing ain't cheap. If you can't afford the system, priced at around U.S. $125,000, you can pay him to drop by your party for only $20,000. See the rest of Backyard Rocketeer at VBS.TV . Among many other projects, Lozano's working with a group of scientists on a car that will run on seawater, converted into hydrogen peroxide by electrolytic cells powered by solar energy. It's a project, he says, that will completely transform transportation and energy in the near future. Lozano and his daughter -- the only woman to fly a jetpack -- take his creations for test-drives in their backyard. While he couldn't fly for us (he recently broke his ribs and shoulder while taking his rocket bike for a spin at 80 mph), he gave us a tour of his workshop to share with us his favorite machines and a philosophy of invention built on hard work, self-teaching, and lots of jet fuel.","Mexican scientist devises, builds, tests jetpacks in his backyard .

"(CNN) -- They may be famous, but even the world's biggest names go weak at the knees for their favorite football team. Football Fanzone talks to Alastair Campbell -- former spin doctor of ex-British prime minister Tony Blair -- about his 'manic' love for English Premier League new boys Burnley. Where does your love of Burnley come from? I was born in Keighley in Yorkshire and Burnley were the big team in that region at the time and they were the ones I fell for. My first game was in 1961 when Burnley were reigning league champions. I started going regularly when I was about five or six. How did you keep up to speed with all things Burnley when you were in office at No. 10? I still managed to get to a lot of games during that period. Saturday at three pm was the one time when the Downing Street switchboard knew there was no point bothering me. Tony [Blair] and Gordon [Brown] both follow football pretty closely so I think they understood it. I think Tony maybe sometimes thought it was a little over the top. Were there any occasions when Burnley came ahead of any high-level meetings? When we played Scunthorpe -- the game we won to get promoted to the First Division under Stan Ternant in 2000 -- up until then I'd been in Northern Ireland. Bertie Ahern [Taoiseach of Ireland at the time] was a big Manchester United fan and he had tickets for a game the next day. I said to him: ""Bertie, I've got to be at this game, these talks cannot drag on and on."" As it happened I left early and by the time I'd landed in Manchester things had wrapped up, so he got to his game as well, but I did sneak off early it has to be said. What does it mean to you to have Burnley back in the Premier League? It's fantastic. When we were relegated from the top division in 1974 I didn't think we'd come back. We had to win a game against Leyton Orient in 1987 to stay in the Football League. I honestly think if we'd lost that we'd have gone into oblivion so to be back is just incredible. It means a lot to everyone who has followed Burnley through such bad times. Just how special was that win over Manchester United in Burnley's first home game of the season? Playing Manchester United as our first game back was the best possible start to the season. Its true they had a bit of an off day, but we played well, and we've played teams who are better on paper but we've beaten them on merit. Our wage bill is the smallest in the league by a mile, we've got a small stadium, we've got the smallest squad and we're the smallest town that has ever produced a Premier League football club, so with all that it's quite an uphill battle to stay up but I think we will, and by playing good football. Who is your favorite player of all time? It has to be Leighton James, he coincided with the period when I was really fanatical. He was one of these players that when he got the ball you just leaned forward a bit and you thought something is going to happen here and quite often it did. The other player I'd pick is Martin Dobson, who is now Head of Youth development at the club. He was such an elegant player. What is your most memorable moment as a Burnley fan? There are loads. Beating Leeds 4-1 away when Don Revie was in charge of them, is right up there. It was proving impossible to beat Leeds and we absolutely hammered them. The Orient game, obviously, was the most emotional for every Burnley fan. Both play-offs at Wembley have been great, too. I've got loads of bad memories too, but I think it's the bad memories are what make the good memories even more special.","Alastair Campbell fell in love with Burnley in 1961, at the age of four .

"Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN) -- I am and always will be completely against any food that has been altered genetically for human consumption. And never, in the 30-plus years I have been a restaurant chef, has one customer requested a genetically modified organism for dinner. This is why I was alarmed to learn early this month that the Food and Drug Administration announced with ""reasonable certainty"" that a new genetically modified Atlantic salmon awaiting approval posed ""no harm"" to humans who might soon have the opportunity to buy it and eat it as though it were a fish from nature.  The announcement brings this ""Frankenfish"" one step closer to your table. But make no mistake. The creation of this fish is just another tactic for big industry to make bigger, faster profits with no consideration for the impact it will have on our personal health and the health of our environment and ecosystem. The fish, an Atlantic salmon, contains growth hormone from a Pacific species, the Chinook salmon, as well as genetic material from another species, the ocean pout, that causes the ""transgenic"" salmon to grow at twice the normal speed. The claim made by its developer, AquaBounty Technologies, is that this altered fish is as safe to consume as farmed Atlantic salmon. This argument doesn't convince much, since farmed salmon aren't really that safe to eat. They have been found to have higher concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls than wild salmon, which gets into their bodies from the concentrated fish meal used to create their feed. AquaBounty also plans to sell the eggs of its fish to fish farms. As we have learned over time, farmed Atlantic salmon is horrible for the environment. The fish are grown in overcrowded, open-net pens in the ocean, placing an unnatural stress on the surrounding ocean environment as well as on the fish themselves. In those conditions it becomes necessary to use antibiotics on an already unstable fish in order to control bacterial infections and other diseases -- and to protect the investment of carnivorous fish farming. The byproducts of all this -- a wonderful stew of feces, unconsumed fish food and dead fish called, sweetly, ""effluent"" -- create a suffocating blanket that spreads across the ocean floor, resulting in a massive dead zone surrounding the farming area. It kills clams, oysters, eel grasses -- where young fish feed and grow -- and more. If the point of genetically engineering fish is to produce more salmon faster,  introducing these fish into the fish farm scenario will only magnify an already big problem. And it will create a larger demand for smaller species of wild fish to be used for fish feed necessary to support these constantly feeding frankenfish.  Wild species don't stand a chance. It has also been proven that escapes from fish farms into the natural population are inevitable. These transgenic fish have a voracious appetite that has no regard for season or feeding cycle. What could happen? Well, estimates of farmed salmon escapes in British Columbia from 1991 to 2001 total at least 400,000 fish. The wild salmon population is already severely endangered. If escaped, the farmed -- and now free-swimming aggressive gluttons -- will compete for the food that is essential for wild stocks to survive, further threatening  this already endangered species (nearly all Atlantic salmon sold now comes from fish farms). What process has the FDA used to determine whether the genetically modified fish is safe for human health and the environment? We did not know during most of the agency's evaluation process. FDA regulations allow genetically modified animals to be evaluated under the same rules as veterinary pharmaceuticals. So the information given to the agency by the applicant is confidential; in the case of this fish, the information was not posted on the FDA website until the announcement on safety was made in early September. The FDA will hold a public meeting on February 21 to discuss how the fish should be labeled. I don't trust this fish. It is an overweight fish being introduced to an already obese society. Protecting a greedy company's ""confidential information"" should not be acceptable when you are introducing the first genetically modified animal for human consumption into the marketplace. And I'm terrified to consider that rules are being considered that would allow this fish to be created and then distributed without any kind of mandatory label stating that it is a genetically modified product. In restaurants, chefs are in a position to assure their guests that the food being served to them is not only delicious but also wholesome and safe to consume. How do we do this when there is no required labeling indicating that a fish has been manufactured by science and not a product of nature? If these genetically engineered salmon are approved, it will set a worldwide precedent.  It will open the door to other kinds of genetically modified animal foods that may pose health or environmental dangers, and the true extent of these might not reveal themselves for years to come. At the very least, given the amount of data that we have seen to date, the creation of these frankenfish for mass consumption should not be approved. It's simply against nature and is a huge step back in the worldwide movement to eat local, organic and sustainably. Bon appÃ©tit -- enjoy your dinner.

"London, England (CNN) -- In the latest edition of Fanzone's look at famous soccer fans, South Africa captain and Portsmouth midfielder Aaron Mokoena tells all about his favorite team and their bitter rivalry with the Kaizer Chiefs. Who do you support and why? In South Africa my favorite football team is Orlando Pirates. I played for professional team Jomo Cosmos but I always love Orlando Pirates because that's was the team that I grew up supporting. How did you start supporting them? My elder brother, he made me support Pirates and used to take me to watch the games. That really made me fall in love with the team. They had so many good players as well. That's why I fell in love with the club. Do you remember your first game? It was Orlando Pirates against Kaizer Chiefs, the biggest derby game in South Africa, I went to watch and it was unbelievable; really, really amazing. That was the derby of Soweto, I think it was probably 1990. That is a game that everyone wants to watch. It's like Manchester United versus Manchester City or Liverpool. It's a game that you can't miss. How are they doing at the moment? They're still doing well. Lots of youngsters... it's been generations after generations. The generation they have now are more younger players. They're adapting well and doing very well. What is the most memorable game from Orlando Pirates you've seen? They won the African Champions League in 1995. It was the first team in South Africa to win such a tournament. That tournament is the toughest tournament to play ... and they did extremely well, they won the cup. That really stands out for me. Is Kaizer Chiefs the team you love to hate? Not that I do hate Kaizer Chiefs but as they are the arch rivals to Orlando Pirates, I tend to have a soft spot for Pirates but not for Kaizer Chiefs. I would go back to South Africa and play for Kaizer Chiefs to be fair but I don't hate them, they are really professional. But between Pirates and Chiefs, I would always choose Orlando Pirates. Would you play for Orlando Pirates? Has that opportunity come up? I have been so fortunate to sit down with the owner of Orlando Pirates and he said, ""Look the moment you retire from your football in Europe make sure you come down to Orlando Pirates"" -- so it's an opportunity that is there for me. I am an ambassador for ""Education -- One goal for all"" and I spoke to him at the launch two months ago at the Emirates stadium and that's when we had a chat. He's a really respectable person in South Africa and him saying that meant a lot to me.","Mokoena grew up watching Orlando Pirates with his brother .

"(CNN) -- A team of South Korean scientists have produced the polymers used for everyday plastics through bioengineering, rather than through the use of fossil fuel-based chemicals. It is believed that the technique may now allow for the production of environmentally-friendly plastic that is biodegradable and low in toxicity. The research focused on Polylactic Acid (PLA), a bio-based polymer which holds the key to producing plastics through natural and renewable resources. Polymers are molecules found in everyday life in the form of plastics and rubbers. ""The polyesters and other polymers we use everyday are mostly derived from fossil oils made through the refinery or chemical process,"" Professor Sang Yup Lee, who lead the research, said in a press statement. ""The idea of producing polymers from renewable biomass has attracted much attention due to the increasing concerns of environmental problems and the limited nature of fossil resources. PLA is considered a good alternative to petroleum-based plastics, as it is both biodegradable and has a low toxicity to humans."" Until now PLA has been produced in a two-step fermentation and chemical process of polymerization, which is both complex and expensive. The team used a metabolically engineered strain of E. coli and developed a one-stage process. ""By developing a strategy which combines metabolic engineering and enzyme engineering, we've developed an efficient bio-based one-step production process for PLA and its copolymers,"" said Lee. ""This means that a developed E. coli strain is now capable of efficiently producing unnatural polymers, through a one-step fermentation process. ""Global warming and other environmental problems are urging us to develop sustainable processes based on renewable resources. ""This new strategy should be generally useful for developing other engineered organisms capable of producing various unnatural polymers by direct fermentation from renewable resources."" The research team from KAIST University in Seoul and the Korean chemical company LG Chem published their findings in the journal ""Biotechnology and Bioengineering"".","Korean scientists develop a plastic not derived from fossil fuel chemicals .

"(CNN) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has stopped well short of agreeing to a continued freeze on building Israeli settlements in the disputed West Bank territory, indicated Sunday he might be willing to compromise. The settlements issue is a major sticking point between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, which recently resumed direct peace talks for the first time since 2008. ""I don't know if there will be a comprehensive freeze,"" said Netanyahu, according to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz. ""But I also don't know if it is necessary to construct all of the 20,000 housing units waiting to be built. In any case, between zero and one there are a lot of possibilities,"" Haaretz reported the prime minister said at a weekly cabinet meeting. Last year, Israel instituted a 10-month moratorium on building Israeli settlements in the West Bank. Netanyahu is under pressure from the Palestinians and the from the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama to extend the freeze, which is currently set to expire toward the end of September. Netanyahu's conservative coalition government wants the prime minister to end the moratorium. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and Netanyahu met in Washington for direct talks earlier this month. The two pledged in front of the cameras to move the peace process forward, but privately were said to have gotten stuck on the question of whether the Israeli settlements should continue. Abbas and Netanyahu are scheduled for a meeting Tuesday in Egypt, where U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and George Mitchell, the U.S. special envoy for Middle East peace, are also expected to attend. Netanyahu said that if all sides are serious in their efforts, it would be possible to arrive at a framework for lasting peace within the year. ""Just as we are asked to recognize the Palestinian national state ... we also demand and expect the Palestinians to recognize a Jewish state, the State of Israel, as the national state of the Jewish People. This is the true foundation of peace,"" he said.","Netanyahu under pressure to extend 10-month moratorium on building in West Bank .

"(CNN) -- Taiwanese golfer Yani Tseng became the youngest woman to win three major trophies after claiming a tense one-shot victory at the British Open in England on Sunday. The 21-year-old broke down in tears as she overcame a jittery approach to the final green at Royal Birkdale to make history as the first player from her island to win the event. Her ambitious long drive into the first fairway bunker at the par-five 18th gave Katherine Hull -- Tseng's fellow first-round leader -- the chance to take the tournament to a playoff. But the Australian -- who matched Tseng with an eagle at 18 on Thursday -- was well short of the pin with her chip from off the back of the green, and then her birdie putt slid just past the hole. Tseng clinched her second major title this season with a solid six-foot putt for par, which Hull could only match, for a winning total of 11-under-par of 277. ""I was so tired, there was so much pressure out there and it's been an unbelievable day. Even when I holed the putt at the last I had to ask my caddie 'Did I win?,"" a relieved Tseng told reporters. ""The last four holes were very hard and Katherine pushed me all the way. She's an awesome player."" The 2010 Kraft Nabisco championship winner closed with a one-over 73 after faltering with three bogeys and two birdies, while Hull cut her four-shot overnight lead with a four-birdie 70. Neither player could beat par in the last five holes, with Tseng's last birdie of the day coming on the par-five sixth. ""I'm disappointed but there are also a lot of positives to take from this week,"" the 28-year-old Hull said after only her second top-10 finish in 24 majors. ""I never gave up but it's just a pity I couldn't make a birdie at one of the three long holes at the end."" Na Yeon Choi eagled 18 to finish in a tie for third with In-Kyung Kim on 281, carding 68 to her fellow South Korean's 71 -- which ended with a birdie. American veteran Cristie Kerr finished equal fifth after South Korean duo Amy Yang and Hee-Kyung Seo closed with birdies to join her on 282.","Yani Tseng survives a tense final round to win Women's British Open by one shot .

"(CNN)  -- The upsets continued to the last at Indian Wells as veteran Croatian Ivan Ljubicic beat home hope Andy Roddick 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/5) to win the first Masters 1000 tournament of his career. Big-serving Ljubicic celebrated his 31st birthday on Friday and becomes the oldest first-time winner of a Masters event. He had been beaten in three finals, in Paris and Madrid in 2005 and at Miami in 2006 -- the same year he reached his best-ever ranking of number three in the world. But over the last few years, Ljubicic has slipped down the rankings and the victory is his first since Lyon last October and was the 10th ATP title of his career. It was thoroughly deserved as he beat world number two Novak Djokovic and defending champion Rafael Nadal before seeing off eighth seed Roddick in two tiebreak sets. ""Looking at my career in general, I did feel like I was missing it,"" Ljubicic told the official ATP Tour Web site. ""It's really a fantastic feeling to finally have it. It gives something special to your career."" He certainly showed he has plenty of quality tennis left in him this week, with victories over world number two Novak Djokovic and number three Rafael Nadal en route to his clash with eighth-ranked Roddick. For once, it was Roddick who was outserved as Ljubicic fired 20 aces and was particularly dominant in the tiebreakers. After claiming the first set, where both men had to come back from 0-40 down on the service in a one game, Ljubicic was rock solid in the second. Ljubicic carved out a 5-1 lead in the tiebreaker and made it 6-2 to set up four match points. He wasted one with a double fault and Roddick, urged on by a home crowd, saved two more. But Ljubicic produced one more service winner for the best win of his career.. ""He served great,"" said Roddick. ""He had complete control over all four spots,"" Roddick added. ""He hit 'em.

"(CNN) -- Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor has labeled as ""outrageous"" the controversial decision to ban his side from the next two Africa Cup of Nations. Togo, who pulled out of this year's finals after a terror attack on their team bus left three dead, were hit with the shock ban and a $50,000 fine by the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) on Saturday. Why Togo ban rubs salt into open wounds . Manchester City star Adebayor reacted furiously to the news and claimed that  CAF's Cameroonian president Issa Hayatou had ""completely betrayed"" the Togo squad and called for him to quit. He told L'Equipe: ""Mr Hayatou has served Africa extensively, but now he must escape. This decision is outrageous."" Adebayor, who was not injured in the attack and has now returned to his club side, went on: . ""They do not care about the voice of the world. It was our head of state (Faure Gnassingbe) who sent us to the African Nations Cup to defend the colors of our country. ""He said the threat surrounding our squad had not gone and told us to return to our country. We are only ambassadors. We were obliged to return, and there was nothing we could do."" Togo's French coach, Hubert Velud, called on FIFA president and UEFA chief Michel Platini to intervene. ""I am curious to know if Blatter and Platini will endorse this decision,"" he said. ""If they let this go, it is the gateway to completely dysfunctional football. I officially launched an appeal to international bodies to see their reaction."" Three people were killed in the attack, which took place while Togo traveled to the team hotel two days before their opening match earlier this month. Communications chief Stanislas Ocloo and assistant coach Abalo Amnalete were shot dead and goalkeeper, Kodjovi Obilale, was among the injured. Togo wanted to continue despite the attack but quit on their national government's orders. The attack raised fears about security for the World Cup, which takes place in South Africa later this year. CAF has decided the decision to recall the team was political interference, leading to Saturday's suspension for the tournaments in 2012 and 2014. CAF said in a statement: ""The executive committee and its president renewed their sincere condolences to the families of victims involved in this tragic terrorist attack which happened January 8, 2010. ""The attack was condemned by CAF and also a total support was given to the Togolese team. ""At that time, CAF said they have understood perfectly the decision of players not to participate in the competition. ""Meanwhile, following a decision taken by players to participate in the competition, the Togolese government decided to call back their national team. ""The decision taken by the political authorities is infringing CAF and CAN (African Nations Cup) regulations. ""Therefore, a decision has been taken to suspend the Togo national team for the next two editions of Africa Cup of Nations, with a fine of U.S. dollars 50,000 handed to the Togolese national football association, in conformity with article 78 of Africa Cup of Nations Angola 2010."" Two men arrested over the attack were said to be members of the Forces for Liberation of the State of Cabinda, an armed wing of a separatist group that has claimed responsibility for the attack and has threatened to strike again. Cabinda is a disputed oil-rich enclave in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and was the site of eight matches in the African Cup of Nations tournament. The Africa Cup of Nations tournament is one of the biggest sporting events in the world this year, and Angola's first since a 2002 peace deal ended decades of civil war in the southern African country.","Togo captain Emmanuel Adebayor slams decision to ban his team from next two Africa Cup of Nations .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Fridays are acceptable! Just doesn't have the same ring, especially on the most awesome day of the week! Well, I'm Carl Azuz. I welcome you to CNN Student News; we're kicking things off right now! First Up: Health Care . AZUZ: First up, follow the bouncing health care bill: It's in the House, then the Senate, then the House again. It's hard to keep up with. But another health care reform bill -- the set of changes to the legislation that's already law -- moved move from the Senate back to the House yesterday. Now the House, as you might remember, had dealt with this legislation before. But because the Senate made adjustments to it, the House had to pass the new version. Well, it did last night, and it will become law when President Obama signs it. It'll cost more than $60 billion in addition to the $875 billion health reform law. Democratic leaders had put these changes on the fast track. Part of the reason for the quick turnaround is recess. Congress is scheduled to start its two-week Easter break today. Meanwhile, President Obama is working to convince the American people of the benefits of the health care law he's already signed. Here, you see him speaking at an event in Iowa yesterday. But there have been some strong reactions to this law and to the political debate surrounding the entire health care issue. And those reactions have raised concerns about security for some members of Congress. Threatening messages, vandalized offices, even gunshots fired at one congressman's campaign office. It's been reported by Democrats and Republicans, and leaders of both fo those parties are speaking out against it. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) MINORITY LEADER: I know many Americans are angry over this health care bill and angry at Democrats here in Washington for not listening. But as I've said before, violence and threats are unacceptable. They have no place in a political debate. REP. JAMES CLYBURN, (D) MAJORITY WHIP: We're giving aid and comfort to these people, and this stuff gets ratcheted up. We in this Congress have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down. Don't Ask . AZUZ: Okay, moving from health care to another controversial issue. Teachers, you might want to preview this next segment. It deals with the military's controversial ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy. It's a law; went into effect in 1993. It keeps gays and lesbians from openly serving in the U.S. military. The Obama administration wants to end the law, and Defense Secretary Robert Gates is already taking steps toward doing that. Now, some military officials are concerned about the impact that getting rid of the law will have on troops. Secretary Gates says there's a lot to consider. ROBERT GATES, U.S. DEFENSE SECRETARY: I do not recommend a change in the law before we have completed our study. There is a great deal we don't know about this in terms of the views of our service members, in terms of the views of their families and influencers. There is a lot we have to address in terms of what would be required in the way of changed regulations, in terms of benefits. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Willis's classes at Carmel High School in Carmel, Indiana! Where would you find the world's tallest building? You know what to do! Is it: A) Dubai, B) New York, C) Paris or D) Kuala Lumpur? You've got three seconds -- GO! Dubai is currently home to the world's tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Debt Crisis . AZUZ: You might've been able to tell from that map we had in that Shoutout: Dubai is in the United Arab Emirates, so this next story takes place in the Middle East. The company that built the Burj Khalifa is called Dubai World, and it's getting a $9.5 billion bailout from the government of Dubai. Now that's important, because Dubai world owes more than $23 billion in debt. The Burj Khalifa, it's towering; you see it here. It cost $1.5 billion. Dubai World has also spent money to build artificial islands and luxury homes. Dubai is a very wealthy part of the world. Financial experts thought it wouldn't be affected by the global financial crisis. But, like everywhere, it was. Last November, Dubai World said it was having problems paying off that multi-billion dollar debt. And now, the company says it could take 5 to 8 years to pay everything off in full. Women's History Month . AZUZ: As CNN Student News celebrates Women's History Month, we want to wish a happy birthday to Sandra Day O'Connor. She was born on March 26th -- today! -- in 1930. Her birthplace: El Paso, Texas. While serving in the Arizona state senate, O'Connor became the majority leader. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that position. That's not her only famous first. In 1981, O'Connor was nominated to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, and she became the first female, Supreme Court justice. Exploring the achievements of women in government, like Justice O'Connor, just one of the activities in our Women's History Month materials. They're completely free. You can find them in the Spotlight section. The address is everybody's favorite Web site: CNNStudentNews.com. Is this Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The limbic system is the part of the human brain that controls emotions. Legit! It includes the amygdala and hippocampus. Emotional Intelligence . AZUZ: So, the emotions that are controlled by your limbic system don't just affect how you feel. They can play a role in how you act and what kinds of decisions you make. Yesterday, we talked about creative intelligence. There's also something called emotional intelligence; it's learning about your feelings and how to manage them. But should those lessons be taught in school? That is the question that Alina Cho now considers. (BEGIN VIDEO) ALINA CHO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Along with math and science... KEVIN SCHRANZ, CLARENDON HILLS MIDDLE SCHOOL: And so, what you're going to do is put on your blindfolds. CHO: ...This is part of the curriculum at Clarendon Hills Middle School near Chicago. SCHRANZ: When everyone has their blindfolds on, I'm going to have three people take off their blindfolds. CHO: An exercise in boosting self-esteem. SCHRANZ: Tap two people who you think can make you laugh. UNIDENTIFIED MALE STUDENT #1: It's a different kind of enjoyment than a subject. It's more like a spirit lifter, and it makes you feel good inside. CHO: But what does that have to do with being smart? ASHLEY MERRYMAN, CO-AUTHOR, ""NURTURESHOCK"": I think that's a horrible idea. Do you get graded then for being angry? I mean, what does that mean in terms of real life? ROGER WEISSBERG, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, AUTHOR, ""EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE"": Emotional intelligence is a different way of being smart. CHO: Roger Weissberg, professor of psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago, is the man behind the groundbreaking research on which the best-selling book ""Emotional Intelligence"" is based. The concept: EQ is just as important as IQ. Weissberg says it turns out kids who get good social and emotional training score 11 percentage points higher on tests than kids who don't. Why? Why? WEISSBERG: Well, I think there are a variety of reasons. They can overcome obstacles when they reach them. Some of this involves academic tenacity, teaching kids self-discipline and self-control. CHO: A learning process that starts in kindergarten. These are second graders role-playing. UNIDENTIFIED MALE STUDENT #2: I feel proud because I just learned how to draw a dinosaur in computer lab. UNIDENTIFIED MALE STUDENT #3: That is great. Can you teach me? UNIDENTIFIED MALE STUDENT #2: Yes. CHO: What is the real world benefit of this? WEISSBERG: One real world benefit is kids behave better in school. Another real world benefit is they're less likely to fight. Another benefit is they're less likely to do drugs. KATHLEEN JIRASEK, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKER: I believe that this is the future. These children are our future. And so, I believe by teaching them this, they will be the leaders. CHO: Research also shows great leaders tend to be funny and the best doctors are empathetic. But can emotional intelligence be taught? Should it be? MERRYMAN: You're not telling me that you can't learn how to behave with your peers? CHO: What you're saying is, do we really need a class for this? MERRYMAN: I don't think we need a class for this. CHO: Others argue getting along is just as important as getting good grades, and that the really smart thrive at both. WEISSBERG: This is not academics versus social and emotional development. That's a false choice. This is teaching kids to be socially, emotionally and academically skilled. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Before we go, we're about to run wild! As if horses aren't supposed to hang out in a parking lot! Maybe it's some sort of ""no loitering"" rule. Or is it the first cross-species game of tag? No, that's it. It sounds a lot more interesting than ""horses run wild, humans hilariously give chase."" The problem with this whole thing was it was a stampede that worked its way into a suburban area. Goodbye . AZUZ: And as some folks who live in that area might be saying, ""Oh well, there goes the neighborhood!""  Nah, we're just horsin' around. We're sure the new residents are totally stable. You guys have a great weekend. Hope you forgive us. For CNN Student News, I'm Carl Azuz.","Hear how Democrats and Republicans are responding to threats against lawmakers .

"(CNN Student News) -- March 23, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . â¢ Haiti â¢ China . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Happy birthday, Roger Bannister -- first man to run the mile in less than four minutes. In more than twice that time, you'll be up to speed on today's headlines. I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care . AZUZ: First up, it's the biggest expansion of the United States health care system in more than forty years. And by a vote of 219-212, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a health care reform bill late Sunday night. This is the same bill that the Senate passed last December. This means that when President Obama signs it, it's law. The House also passed a set of changes to the Senate bill. We're gonna get back to that in just a second. But first, you know this health care issue has been controversial. We want you to check out some of the reaction to last night's vote. REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE SPEAKER: Thirty-two million more Americans having access to health care. $1.3 trillion saved for the taxpayer and accountability for the insurance companies so they cannot come between patients and their doctors. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Shame on us. Shame on this body. Shame on each and every one of you who substitutes your will and your desires above those of your fellow countrymen. BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: This legislation will not fix everything that ails our health care system, but it moves us decisively in the right direction. This is what change looks like. AZUZ: Okay, so the House passed the bill. Now what? Well, President Obama is expected to sign it today. Again, as soon as he does that, the Senate bill becomes law. But how about those changes passed by the House? Those still need to get through the Senate. That process can't start until  the president signs the original bill. Some analysts are saying that the package of changes could inspire a pretty heated battle in the Senate. We're going to have more on that as the debate gets going. Another thing that's going to happen when the president signs the health care bill: lawsuits. At least ten states are planning to file suits arguing that parts of the health care bill are unconstitutional. President Obama's administration says it expects to win any lawsuits filed against the bill. Promo . AZUZ: Well, this debate, dominating headlines for months. You see our home page here, CNNStudentNews.com. Now that a health care bill has been passed, some people are calling it a milestone; others are calling it a mistake. That is what our blog, which you see right here, is asking: milestone or mistake? You can vote in our Quick Poll, comment on the subject. You know where to find it; it's at CNNStudentNews.com. In fact, I have a couple comments for you right now. Brian says ""it is a good idea because it'll keep insurance companies from raising prices."" Daniel, on the other hand, he's saying ""it's not the answer to the problems our current system has."" We want you to share your thoughts -- and firstnames only -- at our blog. Word to the Wise . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... subsidize (verb) to help or assist by providing money . source: www.m-w.com . Student Loan Reform . AZUZ: Sunday night, the House of Representatives also approved a plan for the government to be the main supplier of student loans. Right now, you can get loans from the government or from private companies. But the government actually subsidizes some of those private loans; it gives the companies money to guarantee them. This new proposal would cut those subsidies out. Ali Velshi gives us a little background on how loans work right now and how this would change the process. ALI VELSHI, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Right now, the government provides about $31 billion in student loans. The private enterprise banks -- private banks, basically -- provide about $67 billion. In many cases, they're guaranteed by the government. But really, you can see the private enterprise gives about twice as many loans as the government does. Now the plan, according to the bill, is basically for the government to rub out the middleman, to stop sort of subsidizing or guaranteeing these loans and be the lender directly to people with loans. AZUZ: This proposal still needs to go through the Senate. It's not a done deal. Supporters argue that it would save the federal budget more than $60 billion over the next 10 years. One congressman said it would make college more affordable and keep jobs in America. But critics of the plan say it'll actually put jobs at stake, including thousands of employees at those private lending companies, those banks. Critics also argue that the change will cause delays in the loan process, because they say the government doesn't have enough people to handle all the loans. Shoutout . MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! Who were the 42nd and 43rd presidents of the United States? Were they: A) Ronald Reagan & George H.W. Bush, B) George H.W. Bush & Bill Clinton, C) Bill Clinton & George W. Bush or D) Jimmy Carter & Ronald Reagan? We'll give you five seconds on this one -- GO! Bill Clinton was number 42 and George W. Bush was 43. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Haiti Relief . AZUZ: Those two former presidents are working together to try and help victims of January's devastating earthquake in Haiti. The natural disaster killed more than 200,000 people -- was completely catastrophic -- left more than a million others homeless. Presidents Clinton and Bush were in the Caribbean nation yesterday, meeting with government officials and others who are involved in the relief efforts. They were there on behalf of the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund, which they started to raise money for this recovery process. According to its Web site, the organization has raised more than $37 million so far. In addition to the meetings, Mr. Bush and Mr. Clinton spent part of yesterday's visit touring some of the camps for Haiti's homeless. U.S.-Israel Relations . AZUZ: There's been some tension between the U.S. and Israel lately. You've heard about this on our show. It's especially focused over Israel's plans to build new settlements in East Jerusalem. This is an area that's disputed between Israelis and Palestinians. The U.S., which is trying to help create a Middle East peace plan, wants Israel to stop construction there. In a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that the U.S. has a responsibility ""to give credit when it is due and to tell the truth when it is needed."" But she said the relationship between the U.S. and Israel is still strong. U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON: For President Obama and for me, and for this entire administration, our commitment to Israel's security and Israel's future is rock-solid, unwavering, enduring and forever. AZUZ: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also spoke at the conference. He's scheduled to sit down with President Obama for a meeting at the White House sometime today. Google . AZUZ: A showdown could be looming between China and Google. Yesterday, the Internet company announced it has stopped censoring, or restricting, its search results in China. A company official said, ""We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision, though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services."" Back in 2006, when Google launched Google.cn, its search engine in China, it agreed to a Chinese demand for the company to censor some of its search results. At the time, Google argued that offering Chinese users some information was better than nothing. But after alleged cyber-attacks against Google last December, the company stopped the self-censorship, although that only lasted for about a day. Now, it seems China will have to decide how it plans to react to this latest announcement. Blog Report . AZUZ: A list was posted temporarily at a Wisconsin middle school. It showed the names of students who had failing grades, and about 500 of you had something to say about it! Sabrina doesn't think ""it's fair to post someone's grade where anyone can see it."" She says ""it's embarrassing and humiliating."" A lot of you agreed with that. As you can see, our quick poll showed that about two-thirds of you oppose an F-list. Rachel says she doesn't ""see this working at her school. The students would tell the parents; the parents would get angry and contact the principal."" But Diana supports the idea, saying ""the parents should help their students get off the list and not complain to the school."" And Spencer writes, ""The principal did the right thing. He motivated half the kids to get off the list. It hopefully gets the people who don't usually care to care about their grades.""

"ON PUGET SOUND, Washington (CNN) -- When commercial diver Kenny Woodside takes to the depths, he enters a world of murky low light and dangerous currents. Diver Kenny Woodside descends to the murky depths to retrieve an abandoned net. Until recently Woodside and about 100 hundred other divers searched Puget Sound for sea cucumbers and urchins to sell to buyers in Asia, where the items are considered delicacies. But demand for the fishermen's catch dried up with the worldwide economic crisis and left many of these divers without a reason to go out on the water. ""The fishing industry has slowed from a full-time job to just a couple months a year,"" said Doug Monk, the captain of the boat from which Woodside dives. ""The red sea urchin market is almost non-existent."" But thanks to a small piece of the federal stimulus recovery plan, Monk, Woodside and about 40 other fishermen will get back to work hauling in a very different catch: lost fishing nets. While many stimulus projects have come under fire as pork barrel spending, backers of the nets program say it is a model for helping those battered by the economic downturn while completing needed public works. Thousands of the large nets stretch across the floor of Puget Sound, where they create an environmental hazard. Some of the nets were lost by fishermen to the rocky coastline decades ago but continue to catch and kill. According to the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, the nets are responsible for killing tens of thousands of marine life, mammals and birds every year. The nets, some of which extend larger than a football field, can also tangle the propellers of boats and pose a danger to scuba divers. After struggling to find funding, the group received $4.6 million in stimulus funds to recover most of the nets that litter the unique Puget Sound ecosystem. The only reason the nets have remained underwater for so long, said Ginny Broadhurst, director of the Northwest Marine Conservation Initiative, is because the damage they are doing to the environment is invisible from the surface. ""If you had nets strung along the streets that are catching bunny rabbits and squirrels, we wouldn't be discussing whether we should be removing them. We would be pulling them. It would be immediate,"" said Broadhurst. ""When those threats are underwater it's so much harder to know what impacts they are having."" But pulling those nets is no easy task. Divers swim close to 100 feet down to an environment that is anything but friendly. Instead of using scuba equipment, they breathe through air hoses running from the boat above. When the divers find the fields of nets, they begin the labor of cutting them free piece by piece and all by hand. Removing one net can take days.  Watch the divers at work Â» . The nets are then pulled to the boat waiting on the surface. In just a few hours on the water, the divers can pull free about 1,000 pounds of nets. Inside are the bones of countless fish and birds, along with several species of protected sharks and crabs. Anything still alive is cut free and thrown back in the water. Then, biologist Jeff June notes what they have brought up. So far, he says, the group has identified 112 distinct species trapped in the nets. The fishing nets themselves are considered toxic after the years of catching so much sea life. The divers seal them in heavy duty plastic bags and, once on shore, take the nets to a landfill. But biologist June said the group is working on a plan that would have the nets burned, creating energy from lost fishing nets. Over the next 18 months the group expects to pull some 3,000 nets from Puget Sound. And in that time the fishing industry could bounce back from its slump, allowing Doug Monk and his crew to return to catching urchins and sea cucumbers. But, the boat captain said, recovering the fishing nets has greater meaning than just riding out a rough economy. ""We feel we are doing a good thing,"" he said. ""[With] harvest diving we are taking from the resources; here we are giving them back.""","Worldwide economic downturn has hit fishing industry hard .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's our first show of spring! And one of the rites of the new season: 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines. Here to take you through it, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care . AZUZ: First up, the question that dominated the weekend in Washington: Who has the votes on President Obama's health care reform bill? 216 was the magic number in the U.S. House of Representatives. That means Democrats who supported the bill needed to get at least 216 votes for it to pass. Republicans and Democrats who opposed the bill needed at least 216 votes against it to stop it from becoming law. That vote was expected to happen last night. But when we recorded today's show, it hadn't happened yet. You can get the latest details at CNNStudentNews.com. And, of course, we'll have a lot more on this for you tomorrow. Let's back up and talk about what was happening leading up to yesterday's scheduled vote. Democrats were rallying to try to wrap up those 216 votes. Some were guaranteeing the bill would go through, calling it a historic day. But Republicans, who have been opposed to the bill, promised to keep fighting to try and stop it from becoming law. One Republican said if the bill did pass, they would try to repeal it. Tension was high outside the Capitol building over the weekend, too. As you can see in these pictures, protesters rallied to speak out against the bill. The House of Representatives was actually voting on two things yesterday. The first was the health care reform bill that the Senate already passed. If the House approved that, it would go straight to President Obama for his signature; it would become law. The second thing the House was voting on was a set of changes to the Senate bill. And if that was approved, it would still have to get through the Senate before it could become law. Again, for the latest on all of this: CNNStudentNews.com. Tuesday's show will have details as well. Word to the Wise . AMANDA MOYER, CNN STUDENT NEWS: A Word to the Wise... crest (verb) As a verb, crest means to reach the highest point or level . source: www.dictionary.com . Midwest Flooding . AZUZ: People in North Dakota and Minnesota are keeping a close eye on the Red River. Forecasters said that it crested yesterday at around 37 feet. That's nearly 20 feet higher than flood stage. Around Fargo, North Dakota, 700,000 sandbags are guarding the city against the river's waters. In fact, more than a million sandbags were stacked between Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota. Those sandbags can be removed once the river goes back below 30 feet, but the National Weather Service says that probably won't happen until next Sunday. The governor of Minnesota, Tim Pawlenty, says that planning for a possible flood might have helped keep the Red River at bay. GOV. TIM PAWLENTY, (R) MINNESOTA: We're very confident in the flood fight. Again, there will be damage, there will be some flooding. But we believe it'll be a manageable event, in large part, because of the incredible preparation, skill and leadership of Minnesotans all across this state who rallied to fight this flood and put maximum preparations in place to have an effective flood fight this year. AZUZ: Now, Chris Welch shows us how scientists try to plan for these flood situations. Check it out. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRIS WELCH, CNN ALL-PLATFORM JOURNALIST, MINNEAPOLIS, MINNESOTA: This is Chris Laveau, and his job is critical. As a hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, he helps determine how high the river will go. CHRIS LAVEAU, USGS HYDROLOGIST: This instrument, we put it in the water and it actually sends a sound pulse down into the river, and it returns information on the speed of the particles and actually the depth. WELCH: The data they collect here actually goes straight to the National Weather Service and plays a big part in forecast development. The crest prediction was lowered a half foot Friday and again Saturday, thanks in part to the findings of the USGS. LAVEAU: The channel was moving water through a little bit more efficiently than we thought. WELCH: The technology they use is new within the last decade. What used to take half a day can now be done in an hour. They send their findings here, to the river forecast center near the Twin Cities. SCOTT DUMMER, CHIEF HYDROLOGIST, USGS: We're the technical experts and the modelers. We come up with a technical forecast. WELCH: Less ice on the river and less precipitation were factors in the lower crest outlook, plus the colder weather back in Fargo translates to less snow melt. But lower temps don't make Laveau's job any easier. LAVEAU: The equipment doesn't want to work as well. We don't want to work as well. But we get out here and we get the job done because it's important. WELCH: Chris Welch, CNN, on the Red River, near Fargo, North Dakota. (END VIDEO) Iceland Eruption . AZUZ: Heading across the Atlantic Ocean to Iceland, a country that has more land covered by glaciers than all of Europe. And underneath the country's fifth-largest glacier: this! A volcano that started erupting over the weekend. Not unusual for Iceland; it sits on a volcanic hotspot. It's had 21 eruptions in the past 47 years. But this is the first time that this particular volcano has erupted since 1821, and experts say there was not a lot of warning. Hundreds of people were evacuated; police declared a state of emergency. One scientist said there's just no way to know how long the eruption will last: could end today, could go on for a year or two. But he did add this is a small eruption. Iraq Vote . AZUZ: Well, figuring out the results of Iraq's parliamentary election won't take a year or two, but it is going to take a while longer. The votes from the election -- it was on March 7th -- are still being tallied. But Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki is calling for a recount. He says it's to ""preserve the integrity of the electoral process."" Right now, the race is too close to call. Based on partial results, al-Maliki's party is leading in some of Iraq's provinces, but it's losing the overall vote. Iraq's electoral commission has rejected the demand for a recount. A spokesman for the commission says there have to be ""compelling reasons"" for it, and they don't think there are any. The final election results are expected to be announced on Friday. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Dunston's social studies classes at Bethune Middle School in Decatur, Georgia! Gorillas belong to what scientific genus? You know what to do! Is it: A) Theropithecus, B) Suricata, C) Papio or D) Gorilla? You've got three seconds -- GO! Gorillas are classified in genus gorilla. Surprise, surprise. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Search for Gorillas . AZUZ: Gorillas are in the family of ""great apes."" And according to the World Wildlife Fund, the Cross River gorilla is the most endangered great ape in Africa. For a while, people thought the species had already gone extinct. Christian Purefoy takes us into the forests of Africa to learn about the dangers facing these gorillas and the people who are trying to help them. (BEGIN VIDEO) CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN CORRESPONDENT, LAGOS, NIGERIA: We're searching West Africa's last rainforest for its last remaining gorillas. JOSEPH NJAMA, ECO-GUARD: These are the teeth of the gorilla. Look at them biting it, you see, forcing it to break. PUREFOY: It's a rare sign that there are actually any gorillas left here. Our trackers, who are ex-poachers now turned gaurdians for the gorillas, only see them maybe twice a year. Sightings are so rare that these pictures shot last year are thought to be the only known images of the gorillas. The difficult terrain of these mountains has helped keep the gorillas out of sight and hidden from poachers. Somewhere out there in the forest is the Cross River gorilla. It's the rarest in the world and also the most endangered; they think there's maybe 300 in Nigeria and Cameroon alone and just 35 in these Mbe mountains. The local communities of the Mbe mountains have come together to try and protect the gorillas, but disagreement over exactly how is proving divisive. But as we continued our search, we found signs of life: a gorilla nest only two to three weeks old. In your research, how important are these nests? INAOYOM IMONG, WILDLIFE CONSERVATION SOCIETY: It's very important because we rarely see them, and the only way we can get information on the population is by finding nests such as this to give us an idea of the population size and to give us an idea the ranging behavior of the gorillas. PUREFOY: We didn't see any gorillas, but that is a hopeful sign; the more these gorillas fear humans and stay hidden, the better their chances of survival.

"(CNN) -- The United States will face Turkey in the finals of the world basketball championships after defeating Lithuania 89-74 Saturday. NBA star Durant set the tone for his team's semi-final win by pounding Lithuania with a 17-point scoring blitz in the first eight minutes. By the final buzzer he had also added nine rebounds to his 38 points. After defeating world number one Argentina on Thursday, the Lithuanians looked as if they had already played their final, offering little resistance for an on-song American team. Having grown accustomed to coming back from slow starts throughout this tournament Lithuania would not have been too concerned about falling behind early, trailing USA 23-12 at the end of the opening quarter. Any hopes that Lithuania had off staging another of their famous comebacks dimmed with the USA still well in control, 42-27 when the half-time buzzer sounded. The US's intensity did not let up following the break, assuring the Lithuanians would not come within nine points of them throughout the quarter to still be leading comfortably 65-53 with a quarter remaining. In the other semifinal on Saturday hosts Turkey edged Serbia 83-82 in a thrilling match.","The United States beat Lithuania 89-74 .

"(CNN) -- Australia captain Ricky Ponting insists it is ""absolutely possible"" that his side can regain the Ashes by thrashing England 5-0. Ponting's side surrendered the famous urn to their bitter rivals last year when England won the Test series 2-1 on home soil. But the last time England travelled to Australia as holders, in 2006, they were beaten in all five Test matches. And Ponting, 35, now believes his new-look side -- who have won eight of their last ten Test matches -- are capable of a repeat performance when the series gets underway in November. Asked if Australia could whitewash England Ponting told reporters: ""It's absolutely possible. There's no reason why not. We've learnt from a lot of the mistakes that we've made. ""There's no doubt we made some mistakes in the last Ashes series in England that cost us the series. But we know now that we're a more experienced and probably a better team now than we were then."" Many of Australia's so-called 'golden generation' have retired in recent years including leg spin bowler Shane Warne, seam bowler Glenn McGrath and batsmen Matthew Hayden and Justin Langer, leaving Ponting to mould a younger side. They have been in good form of late but were recently held to a 1-1 Test series draw by Pakistan when the two sides met in England. Yet England are already 2-0 up in their own four Test series with Pakistan, with two games played. When the teams last met England won a seesaw series 2-1, thanks to a dramatic victory at the Oval in the final Test when Jonathan Trott scored a century on his debut. And Trott suggested Ponting may have put unnecessary pressure on his team by talking up their chances of a resounding victory. Speaking ahead of the third Test with Pakistan, he told reporters: ""I don't know Ponting that well -- I don't know his character or what he would be meaning saying stuff like that. ""But if I were to say something like that I'd find it put pressure on me and the team more than if we just go about our business like I know we will.""","Australia captain Ricky Ponting says his side can beat England 5-0 in the Ashes .

"(CNN) -- Tea Party favorites won two primary elections over more mainstream Republicans on Tuesday, demonstrating again the clout of the conservative political movement on the political right. Now the question is whether the right-wing candidates can also defeat Democratic rivals in November's congressional elections, when the stakes are higher and the full electorate is deciding. The results in Delaware and New York highlighted the last major day of primary voting before the upcoming election in just under seven weeks. Voting in seven states and the District of Columbia included embattled veteran U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel's victory in his New York Democratic primary despite allegations of ethics violations, and D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty's bid to hold off a major primary challenger. In addition, former Gov. Robert Ehrlich won the Republican gubernatorial primary in Maryland to set up a rematch against Martin O'Malley, the Democrat who ousted him in 2006. In Delaware, conservative political commentator Christine O'Donnell easily defeated nine-time U.S. Rep. Mike Castle in the Republican U.S. Senate primary, giving the Tea Party movement another major victory over a candidate backed by the national GOP. ""We the people will have our voice heard in Washington, D.C., once again,"" a beaming O'Donnell told exuberant supporters at her victory party in Dover. O'Donnell won more than 53 percent of the vote in the bitter campaign that displayed internal Republican warfare between conservative Tea Party supporters and the more moderate party structures. Castle was backed by the national Republican Party, while O'Donnell received the endorsement of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as well as $150,000 in late funding from the Tea Party Express. O'Donnell, running as a Washington outsider, insisted the Republican establishment was trying to drive her out of the race and hand victory to Castle, whom she refers to as ""the anointed one."" In response, conservative stalwart Bill Kristol, who fears O'Donnell is incapable of winning the Senate seat in November, said: ""I know Sarah Palin. I respect Sarah Palin. And with all due respect -- Christine O'Donnell is no Sarah Palin."" In her victory speech, O'Donnell made a plea unity, saying: ""If those same people who fought against me work just as hard for me, we will win."" Later, she told CNN that she can win without the support of the national Republican Party. ""They don't have a winning track record,"" O'Donnell said of the national party. ""If they're too lazy to put in the effort that we need to win, then, so be it."" The National Republican Senatorial Committee offered its congratulations to O'Donnell immediately after the result was determined. ""We congratulate Christine O'Donnell for her nomination this evening after a hard-fought primary campaign in Delaware,"" said a statement by Rob Jesmer, the NRSC executive director. However, a top Republican official told CNN on Tuesday night that O'Donnell will have to show she can generate viable support before the national party will give her money. ""It is now incumbent on Sarah Palin, (U.S. Sen.) Jim DeMint and the Tea Party Express to help support her,"" the official said on condition of not being identified by name. ""They got her here. Now make it happen."" O'Donnell will face Democrat Christopher Coons, the New Castle County Executive, in November for the seat formerly held by Vice President Joe Biden. In New York, conservative Carl Paladino defeated Rick Lazio in the Republican gubernatorial primary to set up a November showdown with Democrat Andrew Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo. Paladino received Tea Party support in defeating Lazio, who also was supported by some conservative groups. The New York governor's post has proven hazardous in recent years. Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned amid a prostitution scandal, and his successor, David Paterson, decided against running for another term due to allegations of wrongdoing involving World Series tickets and a domestic abuse case involving an aide. In New Hampshire, conservative candidate Ovide Lamontagne saw an early lead vanish in his bid to upset former state Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, the candidate favored by establishment Republicans. The winner will run in November to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Judd Gregg. Ayotte gave up her state post to run for the Senate nomination with encouragement from national Republicans. Considered the favorite in the seven-candidate contest for months, Ayotte instead found herself with a razor-thin lead with Lamontagne, a Manchester attorney and the 1996 Republican nominee for governor, with 52 percent of the returns accounted, according to AP figures. Local Tea Party groups, the conservative New Hampshire Union Leader newspaper and DeMint, the influential conservative senator from South Carolina, all backed Lamontagne. Unlike O'Donnell in Delaware, though, Lamontagne didn't get Palin's endorsement. Instead, Palin backed Ayotte, calling her a ""Granite Grizzly"" and ""the true conservative running for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire."" However, Palin's endorsement and Ayotte's support from many national Republicans may have backfired in fiercely independent New Hampshire. Victories by O'Donnell and Paladino, and the possibility of a triumph by Lamontagne in New Hampshire, showed the strength of the Tea Party within the political right, after similar results ousted GOP incumbents or insiders in Idaho and Alaska. However, the Republican infighting also raised questions about GOP unity heading into November. Rangel, meanwhile, received help from former President Bill Clinton in defeating five challengers in the Democratic primary for the House seat he has held for 40 years. Despite allegations by the House ethics committee that Rangel committed financial wrongdoing and harmed the credibility of Congress, he raised more money than his opponents and easily won the vote in his Harlem district. The situation was reversed in Washington, where Fenty swept into office in 2006 promising to fix the District of Columbia's struggling schools. However, the AP figures showed he trailed City Council Chairman Vincent Gray with 28 percent of the votes counted, in part because of union opposition to his education reform efforts. ""We've got an uphill battle because we made tough decisions,"" Fenty said before the vote. ""We'll continue to make those tough decisions because they're right for the people. But we're not naive. We know this has cost us a little political popularity that we came into the polls with."" The race is being closely watched far beyond the District of Columbia because the outcome could carry significant implications for the national debate over education reform. Fenty brought in Michelle Rhee as chancellor of D.C. Public Schools, and she has since become famous for changes that that have become a model of education reform advocated by the Obama administration. Rhee shut down two dozen schools, fired hundred of educators -- including more than 100 teachers this summer -- for poor performance, and overhauled the teacher evaluation system to include, for the first time, student performance as a measure of success. Local and national teachers unions have fought her efforts. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Paul Steinhauser, Mark Preston, Kate Bolduan, Kevin Bohn, Mary Snow and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","Victories by O'Donnell, Paladino raise questions over Republican unity .

"(CNN) -- It is the strange ""tail"" of Graeme Swann, his cat and a brush with the law that has made the England cricket team ""paws"" for thought before trash talking each other on Twitter. Swann, the world's top ranked spin bowler, appeared in court earlier this week charged with a drink-driving offence and it is the details that emerged during the hearing that provoked such mirth in England's dressing room. Nottingham magistrates court heard how the 31-year-old told police officers he had been to buy a screwdriver so he could release his cat who was trapped under the floorboards of his home. The trial was adjourned until October, but after the England team arrived in London to begin training ahead of the third Test with Pakistan, two of Swann's teammates joked about the affair on their Twitter accounts. Kevin Pietersen, England's flamboyant batsman, who was born and raised in South Africa, posted: ""2 hours with @Swannyg66 [Swann] this am and I'm still not having this 'cat' story!! Haha."" A short time after, Swann updated his account by tweeting: ""Such a shame my teammates are so remedial in their 'banter'. Must be because they're all south African..."" Fast bowler Jimmy Anderson, who has nearly 55,000 followers on Twitter, got in on the act too. He tweeted: ""Swanny has turned up this morning with a tag round his ankle. Not sure what that's for."" The players may have enjoyed their online banter but on the pitch England toiled on the opening day of the third Test against Pakistan at the Oval. England won the toss and chose to bat, hoping to add to their 2-0 series lead, but were dismissed for just 233 as Wahab Riaz took five wickets on his Test debut. Opening batsman Alastair Cook's miserable run of form continued as he was dismissed by Mohammad Asif for just six. Captain Andrew Strauss was Riaz's first victim as he was caught behind by Kamran Akmal for just 15, before the pace bowler went on to claim the scalps of Jonathan Trott, Pietersen, Eoin Morgan and Stuart Broad. Wicketkeeper Matt Prior gave England's total some respectability with a forceful 84 not out and he was ably assisted by Broad, who made 48. Saeed Ajmal trapped England's last batsman, Steve Finn, LBW as Pakistan dismissed the hosts with more than an hour's play remaining. Imran Farhat and Yasir Hameed started Pakistan's reply strongly, adding 48, before Farhat was bowled by Anderson in the final over of the day.","England cricketers joke around on Twitter at bowler Graeme Swann's expense .

"(CNN) -- Spin-bowler Monty Panesar has earned a recall to England's Test cricket squad for the Ashes series against Australia, due to begin on November 25 in Brisbane. Panesar, who was part of England's victorious Ashes team in 2009, is named in a 16-strong party after enjoying a successful domestic campaign for Sussex, in the English county championship. Another player making his England return is Chris Tremlett, who has not played for his country since a match with India in 2007, and was last involved with the international squad on a tour of New Zealand in 2008. He gets the nod ahead of Yorkshire's Tim Bresnan, who has been an ever-present in England squads this summer. The other contentious position was the deputy wicketkeeper spot with uncapped Steven Davies preferred to Craig Kieswetter, who struggled with the bat for his county Somerset this season. Kevin Pietersen, who was left out of England's one-day international squad for the latest series to gain match practice, is also included in a party captained by Andrew Strauss. England and Wales Cricket board (ECB) national selector Geoff Miller is confident they have selected a competitive squad for the series, saying in an official statement: ""We believe we've selected an outstanding Test squad for what will be a fiercely contested Ashes series in Australia. Miller also commented on the two returning bowlers, saying they both deserved their opportunities in Australia. ""We feel that following an excellent season with Sussex Monty Panesar deserves his opportunity to assume the role as England's second spinner behind Graeme Swann,"" said Miller. ""We feel that Chris Tremlett's inclusion will add a real threat of pace and bounce to our bowling attack given the conditions in Australia."" Strauss is quietly confident that his team can retain the Ashes which they won back in a tight series last summer. ""I am excited by the Test squad we have selected for the upcoming Ashes series as I firmly believe we have a number of match winners across all areas of the squad,"" he said. ""It's exciting to have the Ashes as our sole focus from this point on and I know every member of this Ashes squad will be relishing the challenge of retaining the Ashes in Australia.

"(CNN) -- David Haye is to defend his world heavyweight title in an all-British clash with former Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison. The two former friends and sparring partners will go head-to-head on November 13 in Manchester, England, and announced the bout at an ill-tempered press conference. Haye won the World Boxing Association's heavyweight crown when he defeated Russian Nikolay Valuev in November last year. He then successfully defended his title against American veteran John Ruiz in April. Harrison shot to prominence when he won a gold medal in the super heavyweight division at the Sydney Games of 2000 but has struggled to fulfill his potential since. The 38-year-old won the European Boxing Union's heavyweight title when he beat fellow Brit Michael Sprott in April. Haye recently failed to negotiate a fight with either Vitali Klitschko, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, or his brother Wladimir, the holder of the World Boxing Organization and the International Boxing Federation heavyweight belts. Haye told the press conference: ""I don't believe Audley deserves a shot but fortunately, or unfortunately for him, there's enough people who want to see him finally destroyed. ""I get more emails to fight Audley Harrison than anyone else in the world. People want me to close the curtain on the joke that is the Audley Harrison show. ""Audley has known me for years, he knows how devastating I am in the ring. He knows it first hand from sparring sessions. I'm no joke. ""I'm the most devastating fighter on the planet. This is the time your career gets well and truly finished."" The bout is the most high-profile all-British heavyweight clash for 17 years, since Lennox Lewis stopped former champion Frank Bruno to defend his WBC crown in Cardiff. Harrison, who will get his first chance at a world title since turning professional after his Olympic success, told the press conference: ""He [Haye] is a guy I groomed. I have tasted his punches and power and he never hurt me in a training session. ""This is my destiny - on 13 November Audley Harrison will be champion of the world and of that there is no doubt. If David Haye thinks I've taken this fight strictly for a payday, he is in for a rude awakening.""","WBA heavyweight champion David Haye is to fight ex-Olympic gold medallist Audley Harrison .

"London, England (CNN) -- The International Cricket Council said Saturday it has launched an investigation into claims of a new betting scandal involving the Pakistan national team. The allegations, which emerged Saturday in the British tabloid The Sun, relate to the third One-Day International between England and Pakistan, held in London on Friday. ""A source informed The Sun newspaper that a certain scoring pattern would emerge during certain stages of the match and, broadly speaking, that information appeared to be correct,"" ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said in a statement. ""We therefore feel it is incumbent upon us to launch a full enquiry into this particular game, although it is worth pointing out at this stage that we are not stating as fact that anything untoward has occurred,"" Lorgat said. ""Only in the fullness of the investigation can that be established."" The Sun reported ""illegal bookies in India and Dubai apparently knew in advance what would happen"" during the game so they could make bets. The paper said its undercover team was able to pass details to ICC inspectors before the match began at the Oval cricket ground in south London. ""Cricket chiefs then watched as Pakistan's score mirrored the target that bookies had been told in advance by a fixer,"" The Sun reported. It is not thought the overall result was fixed -- only scoring rates in parts of Pakistan's innings, the paper said. It said the investigation centers on a person ""within the team camp"" who is believed to be the ringleader, taking money from bookies and ensuring their orders are carried out. Pakistan won the game by 23 runs. The claims follow a separate alleged scam, also involving the Pakistan team during its ongoing tour of England. The tabloid News of the World reported that Pakistan players deliberately bowled ""no balls,"" or fouls, at specific points in a game with England in late August, and that the alleged ringleader of the scam made 150,000 pounds (about $230,000). London's Metropolitan Police have questioned four players over the allegations. They passed their evidence in that case Friday to prosecutors, who will decide whether to press charges. The ICC provisionally suspended three of the players questioned by police and charged them with various offenses under the council's anti-corruption code.","The International Cricket Council has launched an investigation .

"(CNN) -- From the start of the tragedy, aid agencies warned that not enough help was flowing into flood-devastated Pakistan. Now, seven long weeks into the steamrolling crisis, the United Nations and private charitable organizations are sounding the alarm again as large chunks of the country remain submerged and about 20 million people are in need of assistance. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon announced Friday that the United Nations is seeking another $1.594 billion for flood victims, bringing the total to more than $2 billion. The world body has already received about 70 percent of $460 million it initially requested. ""In the floods' wake, we are seeing hunger, misery and desperation,"" Ban said. ""Children becoming malnourished. Skin diseases on the rise because of the lack of soap and clean water. Nowhere for families to shelter from the sweltering sun. ""Diarrhea could spread quickly in these conditions. Clean water and sanitation equipment must reach even more people. Millions of children and pregnant women are especially at risk. They need access to critical health care. Pakistan is not facing just one humanitarian crisis -- but many at once. Different responses are required."" He called the Pakistan floods ""the worst natural disaster the United Nations has responded to in its 65-year history."" The global spotlight may have shifted away, but floodwaters are still raging through the heart of Pakistan, creating new crises every day, said Valerie Amos, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs. ""An immense tragedy continues to unfold,"" Amos said. ""The human implications of what will happen if not enough is done are terrible. Many millions have already lost everything and have nothing to go back to. ... What I will be doing is asking our supporters to dig deeper and to do more."" But even the new appeal may not be enough as the U.N. food agency said Friday that it needs $600 million for emergency food supplies until next July. So far, it has only received $103 million. The World Food Programme is aiming to feed 6 million people every month while transitioning to recovery activities such as food-for-work programs that will help rehabilitate damaged agricultural lands and infrastructure and restore livelihoods, the agency said. It estimates that at least 17 million acres of farmland from north to south are under water and hundreds of bridges and roadways have been destroyed. On top of that, markets have been disrupted and food prices have skyrocketed, leaving many Pakistanis unable to feed themselves or their families, the WFP said. ""No one could have predicted the scale and enormity of this catastrophe where women and children are facing a dangerous downwards spiral of hunger and malnutrition,"" WFP Executive Director Josette Sheeran said in a written statement. ""We need to scale-up now and we need to scale-up quickly."" The scale of the devastation was visible from a helicopter this week. From the sky, the landscape below was brown with wide rivers of murky water while specks of bright blue tarpaulins and tents dotted dry land. ""The road to recovery will be long and arduous and Pakistan will need all the help it can get to build back from this disaster,"" Sheeran said. Hunger is just one of Pakistan's myriad problems. Public health experts remain concerned about disease outbreaks. As of a week ago, the United Nations reported more than 700,000 cases of acute diarrhea, at least 800,000 acute respiratory infections, nearly a million cases of skin disease and almost 183,000 suspected malaria cases. ""All of the elements conducive for this to happen are present -- poor sanitation and water supplies, and people are living in cramped conditions in open camp settings,"" said Sylvain Groulx, a project coordinator with Medecins Sans Frontieres, sometimes referred to as Doctors Without Borders, in northern Sindh province. ""Health authorities here have confirmed that there is usually an increase in the number of people who seek medical assistance following Eid, and we are expecting that the health system will be overburdened in the coming days,"" Groulx said in a news release. Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of Ramadan, was celebrated last weekend.","NEW: The United Nations seeks $1.6 billion more for flood victims .

"(CNN)  -- Identical twins Bob and Mike Bryan carved their place in tennis history as they wrapped up a record-breaking career doubles title in Los Angeles. The Bryans had been tied on 61 with legendary Australian pair Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde since winning the Madrid Open title back in May. But at the Farmers Classic they finally broke out of the tie with the 'Woodies' with a battling 6-7 6-2 10-7 victory over Eric Butorac and Jean-Julien Rojer. It was their sixth title at the hard court tournament in Los Angeles but they were made to work hard for their win, which is also their sixth title of the year. Pat Cash meets the Bryan brothers . After the opening two sets were tied, the Bryans raced to a 5-0 lead in the tiebreak set decider only to see Butorac and Rojer claw back to seven points each. But the 32-year-old Americans kept their nerve to win the final three points and close out a memorable victory, celebrating with their traditional chest-bumping ritual. Woodforde was courtside to see his record broken and paid tribute to the Bryans. ""For many, many years you've been traveling in elite company. Thanks to the victory today you're in rarefied air,"" Woodforde said. ""Our run sort of ended because I elected to retire, but I know you two will continue for years to come.

""We really looked up to the Woodies,"" Bob Bryan added. ""They didn't have the power and big serves, but they had the poaching and the technique.""

"(CNN) -- A former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says in a new book that while Bill Clinton was in the White House, a key component of the president's nuclear launch protocol went missing. ""The codes were actually missing for months. This is a big deal,"" says General Hugh Shelton. ""We dodged a silver bullet."" In his book ""Without Hesitation,"" the retired Army general writes, ""Even though movies may show the President wearing these codes around his neck, it's pretty standard that they are safeguarded by one of his aides, but that aide sticks with him like glue."" He adds that President Clinton ""assumed, I'm sure, that the aide had them like he was supposed to."" What apparently was missing was a card with code numbers on it that allows the president to access a briefcase -- called the ""football"" and kept by an aide always near the president -- containing instructions for launching a nuclear attack. Once a month, Defense Department officials conduct an in-person verification to make sure the president has the right codes. At least twice in a row, Shelton writes, a White House aide told the Pentagon checker that the president was in a meeting but gave a verbal assurance that the codes were with him. Then one month around the year 2000, according to Shelton, when the time came to replace the codes with a new set, ""the president's aide said neither he nor the president had the codes -- they had completely disappeared."" Shelton writes that all this happened very likely without Clinton's knowledge. CNN called and e-mailed a spokesman for President Clinton Thursday, but there was no immediate response. Fran Townsend, who served as homeland security advisor to President George W. Bush and who is a CNN contributor on national security issues, said Thursday, ""I can't imagine a more serious breach, if something like that were ever to be lost or be compromised. ""That's the command and control capability of the president to launch a nuclear attack."" But if an unauthorized person found or obtained the codes, she said, it is very unlikely that they could execute a launch, because they are only one part of the launch protocol. Another part of that protocol is the ""football,"" containing the actual launch instructions. Townsend said it's a multi-layered system. ""Even if you had a piece that was required, it would be very difficult for one person to execute the command and control of this thing,"" Townsend said. ""There are plenty of things to be concerned about. I just find it difficult to imagine somebody could execute this thing, if they found a piece to it."" Shelton says the president was given new codes within minutes when the previous codes could not be found, and the procedures have since been changed, so that the Pentagon aide who carries out the monthly check is required to wait at the White House until he or she can visually confirm the codes are in the possession of the president or an aide who is with him.","Former Joint Chiefs chairman says it happened during the Clinton administration .

He repeated a claim, which major media outlets have not been able to substantiate, that foreign funds may have been used in the United States. At a recent rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the president said ""American people deserve to know who is trying to sway their elections."" ""You don't know: It could be the oil industry. It could even be foreign-owned corporations. You don't know because they don't have to disclose."" In making these attacks Obama is returning to a central theme that animated his 2008 campaign: the need to change the campaign finance system. As a candidate, Obama railed against the way that money influenced politics. He reiterated a long-standing theme of reform-candidates that unless the political process changed, policies would remain the same and Americans would never gain confidence in their government. But Obama broke from these principles almost as soon as he made the argument. During the campaign, Obama disappointed many campaign reform advocates when he announced that he would not use public funds in the general election campaign so that he could raise an unlimited amount of money in his race against Sen. John McCain. In 2004, President George W. Bush and Sen. John Kerry dealt a blow to the public finance system when they didn't use public funds in their primary election campaigns. But Obama took this decision a step further, rendering one of the more successful Watergate-era reforms ineffective. Ironically, when he announced his decision he said, ""If we don't stand together, the broken system we have now, a system where special interests drown out the voices of the American people will continue to erode our politics and prevent the possibility of real change. That's why we must act. The stakes are higher than ever, and people are counting on us."" His campaign then raised an unprecedented amount of money, much of which came from large donors. After starting his presidency, Obama showed minimal interest in reform. He left the ""broken system"" alone. Obama shelved substantive campaign reform proposals as he turned his attention to the economic crisis, health care reform and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Obama's actions followed a pattern of candidates running on campaign finance reform as an issue, then putting it aside once they get into office. Who wants to anger powerful interest groups and donors right before taking on their policy agenda? The president's plate, moreover, was so full from day one that it was a lot to ask him to take on something as charged as campaign finance. Nonetheless, at the moment when the president arguably had the most political capital to move forward with an issue as difficult as campaign finance reform, Obama succumbed to these familiar and predictable fears. There have been a few exceptional moments when presidents acted differently. In 1978, for instance, President Jimmy Carter followed through on his promise to try to clean up government in the wake of Watergate. He supported legislation that created stricter ethics rules for executive branch officials and established the Office of the Independent Counsel to investigate alleged corruption. While the reforms turned out to be flawed and produced numerous unintended consequences, Carter's actual choice in 1978 marked an unusual moment when a president took reform seriously. Carter's reform built on the historic campaign finance reforms that Congress passed in 1974. Not only did Obama downplay campaign finance reform, but he subsequently embraced a legislative strategy that depended on cutting deals with powerful interest groups such as the pharmaceutical industry so that lobbyists would ""buy into"" legislation rather than oppose it. The strategy worked politically with health care reform although, according to Ryan Lizza's recent account in The New Yorker, it weakened the chances for passing climate change legislation through the Senate. The Supreme Court's Citizen United decision was certainly damaging to reform efforts. So too were many other factors, such as Federal Election Commission decisions and tax laws that have allowed donors to contribute large amounts of funds without disclosure. President Obama, however, certainly shouldn't claim to be an innocent bystander. While he has pushed for significant lobbying and transparency reforms, the major reform groups concluded in January 2010 that the ""Obama administration has not pursued public policy reforms in the campaign finance area."" Both parties have stood silent as the nation's campaign finance system erodes. At best they have supported relatively mild reforms like the McCain-Feingold legislation, that have left huge holes for money to flow into the system -- and which was weakened by another Supreme Court decision in 2006. According to Craig Holman of the nonprofit group Public Citizen, ""This is a low point for the campaign finance reform movement -- I've never seen it lower."" This a difficult challenge given that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court is clearly hostile toward reform. But the president and Congress must consider stronger regulatory mechanisms and the possibility of restoring a system of public finance for campaigns. Until presidents and congressional leaders decide to make campaign finance reform a priority issue the relationship between money and politics won't change. This is unfortunate since the way that politics works profoundly influences the type of policies that government can produce. The power of money in politics was there for all to see when interest groups were able to gut key cost control measures during the health care debate. Like most presidents before him, both Democrats and Republicans, Obama is now witnessing the consequences of accepting the status quo, and the flow of money is only likely to grow. As Jan Baran, a former general counsel for the Republican National Committee told The New York Times, ""This year is practice for 2012."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.","President Obama is criticizing influx of campaign money from undisclosed donors .

"(CNN) -- Hoffenheim have continued their dream start to the German Bundesliga season, beating Schalke 2-0 to remain top of the table with three wins out of three. The home side went into the half-time break with a one goal advantage, thanks to a header from Ghana defender Isaac Vorsah, who powered home a cross from captain Andreas Beck. It was Vorsah's second successive goal following his winning strike against St Pauli two weeks ago. And the points were sealed when German international goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was left helpless when Sejad Salihovic's free-kick struck the post, bounced off his chest, and flew into the net. The result leaves Hoffenheim with a 100 per cent record, although four other sides are also in that position going into the weekend's Bundesliga fixtures. However, big-spending Schalke, who gave a debut to Dutch international striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, are still without a point and struggling near the foot of the table, increasing the pressure on coach Felix Magath who nearly took the Blues to the Bundesliga title last season. ""I am satisfied with the game, we produced a good performance,""  Magath told AFP. ""Unfortunately, we conceded two goals, that is unfortunate, but it can happen."" Kaiserslautern, Mainz, Hamburg and Hanover can all join Hoffenheim at the top of the table on Saturday if they win their respective matches. Meanwhile, defending champions Bayern Munich take on Werder Bremen on Saturday.","Hoffenheim keep up their dream start to the German Bundesliga season .

"(CNN) -- Cindy Goodman was having dinner with a group of girlfriends one night when the conversation took a surprising turn. Summer at the beach may seem like fun, but more Americans are afraid to take time off. Goodman asked her friends where they planned to go this year for their summer vacation. Nowhere, they answered. They were afraid to take time off because they didn't want to risk losing their jobs, she says. ""It's going to be an interesting summer,"" says Goodman, a Miami Herald business columnist. ""The people who still have a job are really feeling overwhelmed and overworked. They're afraid to take vacations, but at the same time, they need them more than ever."" The bad economy isn't just depleting bank accounts. It's cutting into people's vacation time. Americans typically take time off and kick back during the summer. This year may be different. People are worried that a temporary vacation could lead to permanent time off, Goodman says. ""I don't think anyone is going to be fired for taking two weeks off, but they might think that they'll think of another way of doing my job without me,"" says Goodman, who wrote about people's vacation fears for her blog at http://worklifebalancingact.blogspot.com. How to take time off without guilt . Americans had a difficult time taking vacations even before the economy slumped. Numerous articles and studies draw the same conclusions: Americans don't know how to pry themselves away from the workplace. This year, Expedia.com, the travel reservation company, conducted a survey that compared Americans' vacation habits with their counterparts in other countries. The survey said about 34 percent of Americans don't take all the vacation time they earn each year. In contrast, 22 percent of French citizens and 24 percent of Germans don't take all the vacation allotted to them. Japanese workers are the least interested in using all of their vacation days, according to the Expedia survey. About 92 percent of Japanese workers do not take all of their vacation days. Christine Louise Hohlbaum, author of ""The Power of Slow: 101 Ways to Save Time in Our 24/7 World,"" says even when Americans manage to take vacations, they still don't completely leave their office, because of technology. ""You can take a BlackBerry on vacation and still have a conversation with clients anywhere else in the world,"" Hohlbaum says. ""It's wonderful for innovation, but not so great for leisure."" But workers who don't take vacation hurt themselves and their companies, Hohlbaum says. Overworked employees get sick more often and place themselves at risk for long-term illnesses such as heart disease. Companies suffer because their employees are too tired or ill to be productive, she said. Workplaces are full of exhausted employees who have already checked out in their cubicles, Hohlbaum says. ""If people are overworked, they're surfing the Internet,"" she says. ""They're not contributing to the bottom line."" Hohlbaum says she talked to a computer technician who found a way to take more time off but be more productive. He started a walking group for his colleagues during lunch hour. He and his colleagues were transformed. ""It was an amazing experience,"" Hohlbaum says. ""They bonded. It helped people relax and when they got back to work, they were much more productive."" She suggests that other workers follow his example. Explain the upside of the idea to the boss: The company benefits from well-rested workers because they're more productive. Set performance goals with your boss to prove taking time off will allow you to thrive and will result in greater productivity, she says. Some workers, however, find that their biggest skeptic may be internal; they don't know how to take it easy anymore, Hohlbaum says. ""If you're so used to being purposeful, make leisure time your purpose,"" Hohlbaum says. Alternative ideas . Goodman, the Miami Herald columnist, offers some of her own tips for taking time off. If you're too afraid to ask for an extended vacation, plan four-day weekends or time off around holidays. Goodman says she's going to take a four-day vacation around the Fourth of July. But there was a time when she traditionally took two-week vacations during the summer. ""I have the same kind of fear that everyone else has, '' Goodman says. ""I want to take time off, but I don't want to miss too much work time. I want to keep my column in the paper every week.""","People fear that vacationing in recession could lead to permanent time off .

"(CNN) -- When the English Premier League announced plans to play a regular-season, competitve match on foreign soil -- dubbed the ""39th game"" - there was almost unified outcry from the many factions involved in the English game. Most newspapers and commentators attacked the move as indelible proof of the division's growing greed and unbridled ambition to find consumers in every corner of the globe. The plan was ridiculed and then quietly dropped. But for Richard Scudamore -- the chief executive of the English Premier League -- it wasn't so much to do with avarice but, rather surprisingly for a league regarded as one of the most successful sporting franchises on the planet, survival. ""People think that it is inevitable that the world will throw itself at the Premier League,"" he later told The London Times. ""We are competing in a fiercely competitive cultural marketplace...they [foreign markets] have still to decide which sports they are going to be interested in."" There were no such anxieties with those heading basketball's top division. Next March will see the NBA stage its first ever regular season games in London.   Whilst soccer's ubiquity as the global game has long been taken for granted, basketball, through the NBA, has slowly begun to take over the world. This week a further bridgehead on the traditional home of football was taken as the L.A. Lakers cruised into the British capital to play a pre-season exhibition match against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The arena was a sell out, just one of a four-stop, glitzy European tour taking in Paris, Milan and Barcelona. In the front row at the London game, a host of Premier League stars like Arsenal's Cesc Fabregas watched on as Kobe Bryant -- whose $25 million a year wages dwarfs even the Spaniards pay packet -- stole the show with a brief six-minute cameo.   It was the fourth season running the NBA has staged a pre-season tour of Europe, a dress rehearsal for the regular season games due to take place in London next March. By ripping up the rule book, basketball is outmaneuvering football in key markets like China, Africa and the Middle East. Football's position as the world's most popular sport is under threat.  ""We've seen a lot of success in China in the past few years, especially with [Houston Rocket's center] Yao Ming,"" explained Sophie Goldschmidt, senior vice president for NBA Europe. ""We have seen positive growth in our regions, the Middle East and Africa. In the Middle East basketball is the fastest growing team sport. Football is still dominant but we have seen a huge surge and we are launching an Arabic language website too."" The example of China is telling. Long seen as the next great market for FIFA, football's global governing body, with its 1.3 billion potential fans, the game's organization has been mired by accusations of match-fixing and bribery. Earlier this year the former head of the Chinese Super League, Nan Yong, and his deputy Yung Yimin, were arrested on charges of match fixing and bribery. The scandal has been a huge boon for basketball, and in particular the NBA, in China. It has overtaken football as the most watched sport in the country -- the NBA estimates 450 million people now tune in -- and more than 300 million play the game. ""The NBA in China is massively successful and puts football to shame,"" explains Rowan Simons, author of Bamboo Goalposts, a book about his attempts to set up amateur football clubs in China. ""The NBA set up NBA China, selling 11 per cent [worth $253 million] to ESPN and Disney. It has several hundred employees. The head of NBA China is Tim Chen [former CEO of Microsoft China]. ""It's a big investment play for hearts and minds of Chinese sports fans. They are working with the Chinese government to get a basketball court into ever village in China,"" added Simons. ""Marketing, franchised teams, sponsorship, AEG building the stadiums; it's all coordinated in one NBA push. Then you look at football. Internationally, football has no representation in China. Manchester United has one office in Hong Kong."" The reason why the NBA has avoided some of the problems that football has faced, according to Goldschmidt, is down to the NBA's centralized structure and subsequent dominance of the global game. Whilst FIFA entrusts a single Football Association (FA) to develop the game in each country, the NBA hasn't been encumbered with the same restraints. ""Football has done an amazing job...and if sport's growing everyone is a winner,"" concedes Goldschmidt. ""But the NBA is very different. A great thing for the NBA is that it has the best players in the world; [whereas] you have lots of great leagues in football. We have a different structure. Because of that centralized control we can control and develop our brand."" But according to some, there are far bigger shifts that explain the growing popularity of basketball at the expense of football. Namely, increased global urbanization. ""The war between football and basketball is actually dozens of individual civil wars between city and country, urban and rural,"" explains Os Davis editor of the ballineurope.com website. ""Basketball programs, facilities and equipment for youth, pros and even casual play are available in metropolises from Barcelona to Moscow as outdoor playing fields slowly disappear. ""Football is, and probably always will be, the game of the people, but basketball is the sport of the modern world: internationalized, well-marketed, fast-paced and urban."" The success of this summer's football World Cup in South Africa, the single most watched sporting event on the planet, proves that football is still in the box seat when it comes to global popularity. But, equally, the success of this week's NBA tour in Europe, not to mention it's wider successes in Asia, show that it can't take its position for granted. ""[In ten years time] I think there will be associated leagues under the NBA umbrella on different continents and, likely, an NBA division in Europe,"" David Stern, the commissioner of the NBA, told CNN in London shortly before the Minnesota Timberwolves beat the LA Lakers 111-92. ""The world will be playing enormous, enormous amounts of basketball."" Even in the ""Beautiful Game's"" backyard, football should watch its back.","Next March will see the NBA stage its first ever regular season games in London .

"(CNN) -- Germany captain Michael Ballack has suffered a fractured left knee cap following a heavy challenge while playing for Bayer Leverkusen against Hanover on Saturday. The 33-year-old former Chelsea and Bayern Munich midfielder limped off after 30 minutes of the Bundesliga clash and is expected to be out of action for up to two months. The injury means Ballack has already been ruled out of the Euro 2012 qualifiers against Turkey and Kazakhstan. It is a further blow to Ballack, who missed the World Cup finals with an ankle injury and was subsequently left out of the Germany squad for this month's ties against Belgium and Azerbaijan. Germany national coach Joachim Loew released a statement saying: ""I feel sorry for Michael that he must accept a new health setback. Of course I wish him a quick and speedy recovery."" Meanwhile, Mainz joined Hoffenheim at the top of the Bundesliga table with a 2-1 home victory over Kaiserslautern on Sunday. The visitors went into the interval with the lead courtesy of a well-taken goal from Croatian striker Srdjan Lakic. But Niko Bungert levelled after 71 minutes and Mainz collected all three points with a deflected strike from teenager Andre Schuerrle. The result means Mainz have won all their three opening matches and they stand on nine points, trailing Hoffenheim at the top only on goal difference.","Germany captain Michael Ballack has suffered a fractured left knee cap .

"(CNN) -- The maker of Benadryl and Tylenol has added another popular over-the-counter drug to its growing list of recalled products. The latest recall affects Tylenol 8-hour caplets 50 count, sold in the United States and Puerto Rico. The lot number is BCM155. Complaints of a musty or moldy odor led to the recall, McNeil Consumer Healthcare said. The odor, the company believes, is caused by the presence of trace amounts of a chemical called 2,4,6-tribromoanisole. McNeil said the ""risk of adverse medical events is remote."" Adverse event reports are consumer complaints of a serious side effect associated with the use of a medical product, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Adverse events could include death, hospitalization, disability and other health complications. The Johnson and Johnson subsidiary said customers should call 1-888-222-6036 or use the website www.mcneilproductrecall.com for information on how to receive a refund or replacement product. The company has issued several recalls this year of non-prescription cold and pain drugs such as Tylenol, Benadryl and Motrin -- prompting a Congressional inquiry. In November, five lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain 100 count with the EZ-open cap were recalled for unusual odor leading to nausea, stomach pain, vomiting and diarrhea. In December, the recall was expanded to include all product lots of Tylenol Arthritis Pain caplet 100 count bottles with the red EZ-open cap. In January, the recall was widened to an undisclosed number of Tylenol, Motrin and other over-the-counter drugs after complaints of consumers feeling sick from an odor. In May, 50 children's versions of these nonprescription medicines were also recalled because of quality and safety concerns. Following the pediatric medicine recall, Johnson and Johnson suspended production at McNeil's facility in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, that manufactured the children's drugs. Last month, Johnson and Johnson CEO William Weldon delivered both a mea culpa and clear admission to lawmakers that his company let the public down through numerous recent drug recalls.","Some 50-count, 8-hour Tylenol caplets are affected .

"(CNN) -- France have slipped to 27th place in the FIFA world rankings, their lowest position since football's governing body introduced the table in 1993. The drop reflects a slump in the team's fortunes on the field, including a disastrous performance at the 2010 World Cup. Les Bleus, world champions in 1998 and finalists in 2006, were knocked out in the group stage in South Africa without winning a game after a campaign overshadowed by infighting, which led to Nicolas Anelka being sent home following a spat with coach Raymond Domenech. Anelka's team-mates then went on strike in protest at his expulsion, resulting in bans for the Chelsea striker, captain Patrice Evra, star winger Franck Ribery and midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. Things haven't gone much better under new coach Laurent Blanc, with the French losing their opening 2012 European Championship qualifier to Belarus in Paris before steadying the ship with a 2-0 win over Bosnia Herzegovina. World champions Spain remain top of the FIFA rankings, with beaten finalists the Netherlands in second. Germany are third after moving ahead of five-time World Cup winners Brazil and Argentina are fifth. England have gone up to sixth after impressive wins over Bulgaria and Switzerland in their first two Euro 2012 qualifiers. Elsewhere Montenegro, FIFA's newest national team, moved into the top 50 for the first time (40th) after winning their first two qualifiers.

"(CNN) -- Former NFL linebacker Junior Seau was arrested on a domestic violence charge in Oceanside, California, shortly after midnight Monday, just hours before he drove his car off a cliff in nearby Carlsbad, authorities said. The domestic violence incident began when Oceanside police were called to Seau's residence to investigate a report of an assault late Sunday night, police said. The alleged victim is Seau's 25-year-old live-in girlfriend, who had minor injuries that didn't require medical treatment. The girlfriend told police that Seau assaulted her during a verbal argument, authorities said. Seau wasn't at the residence when the police arrived, but he later agreed to return home after he called his girlfriend and spoke to officers on the scene, police said. Seau drove home and was arrested at 12:20 a.m. Monday on the charge of spousal assault with injury, police said. He was released on bail, police said. Some time later Monday morning, Seau drove his white Cadillac SUV off a cliff and landed on the beach at Carlsbad, police said. Seau was conscious and talking to paramedics when he was transported to nearby Scripps La Jolla Hospital for treatment, authorities said. Law officers are investigating the cause of the accident, in which Seau was the vehicle's only occupant, police said. Carlsbad is 35 miles north of San Diego, California, where Seau played most of his career. Drafted into the NFL in the first round in 1990 out of the University of Southern California, Seau debuted with the San Diego Chargers, establishing his Hall of Fame potential as a Pro Bowl staple. He left San Diego before the 2003 season to join the Miami Dolphins and spent parts of the last four seasons with the New England Patriots before retiring in January. Seau amassed 1,526 tackles, 56.5 sacks and 18 interceptions in his 20-season career.

"Fort Hood, Texas (CNN) -- The distant rumble of big guns on Fort Hood's artillery range rattles the ceiling tiles in the small military courtroom. But the sounds of war training don't interrupt the intensity inside the military hearing as dozens of witnesses here recal that day last November when 13 people were shot to death and 32 wounded on the base in central Texas. Training with Paladin howitzers is part of everyday life at Fort Hood, the country's largest Army base. Most of the shooting victims were preparing to ship out to the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. But nothing prepared them for what happened to them at home -- dodging bullets as a gunman cut down their buddies. The prosecution put up more than two dozen witnesses in the first three full days of the Article 32 hearing. Prosecutors have set aside two more weeks, and scores more witnesses are expected. The Article 32 hearing will reconvene in November for defense attorneys to make their case. Then an Army colonel, -- the Investigating officer presiding over this hearing -- will decide if there is enough evidence to push the case along toward a court martial with a possible penalty of death upon conviction. During live video testimony from Afghanistan, fighter jets roared overhead as soldiers described how their safe and secure base suddenly became a bloody battleground. Capt. Melissa Kale was speaking from Kandahar, Afghanistan, on Friday. But her thoughts were back at Fort Hood trying to get a wounded buddy out of the line of fire. ""I was unable to pull her. She didn't move. I had to leave her there,"" Kale said, crying. Many of the victims are haunted by their memories, with multiple accounts of hearing a scream of ""Allahu Akbar"" -- Arabic for ""God is great"" -- before the fast firing of a handgun, a laser-sight flickering across faces, signaling who might be next to fall. ""It was a nightmare that reoccurs every day,"" said Spc. Megan Martin, who also spoke via video-link from Afghanistan. She rejected any thought of trying to postpone her deployment just a few weeks after the shooting. ""I wanted to carry out the mission as my fellow soldiers would have wanted me to."" Martin said. During the shooting, some tried to fight back, others pretended to be dead or tried to hide. There were multiple accounts of one man trying to rush the gunman, holding a chair above his head, only to be cut down at close range. ""You can't stay here and die,"" Spc. Logan Burnett said he told people trying to hide from the bullets. He told how he tried to knock down the gunman with a folding table. ""I turned to throw it at the shooter. At that point I was hit in the hip,"" Burnett said Friday. He was shot two more times. The man accused of the attacks, Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Hasan, is wheeled into the courtroom each morning by Army police wearing blue uniforms, their holsters empty. Hasan is in a wheelchair, partially paralyzed from being shot four times by police who rushed to the shooting scene. Hasan sits impassively, wearing the same Army fatigues and high-lace-up combat boots as the judge and most of the lawyers. But Hasan is easy to spot on the far left of the defense table, wearing a fleece watch-cap pulled low in the back, over his ears, and almost down to his thick eyebrows in front. Some days he complains of the cold and the guards carry an Army blanket to drape over his shoulders. At the start of proceedings Friday he gave a quick grin to one of his defense lawyers but then sat expressionless. He writes on a legal pad, and occasionally braces his arms on the arms of the wheelchair and pushes his body up to readjust his position. The courtroom is paneled with dark wood. There are only 45 spectator seats and many were empty on Friday. There is tight security with journalists selected by lottery to be able to attend in person. Other journalists can see the proceedings in a viewing room with a problem-plagued video feed provided by the Army in in a temporary press center set up 200 yards away. The defense tried unsuccessfully to have the hearing closed to the public or postponed. Still untouched is any discussion of motive. Hasan's lawyers have been asking many of the witnesses whether they thought the firing was random or targeted. The presiding officer, Col. James Pohl, said even he found that confusing. ""I just don't know what you mean by 'random,'"" Pohl said. One Friday witness, because of his injuries, was unable to raise his right arm when he took the oath. He said the shot felt like he'd been hit by a baseball bat in the neck. Witness after witness told how they still carry bullets in their bodies, how they must face additional operations or how their physical therapy continues, how they may go to psychological counseling. The prosecution has two more weeks to present evidence. Then the court will recess as Fort Hood marks one year since the shootings. The base is planning a variety of activities that week, including a private event for families of the victims, and an awards ceremony to honor members of the military and civilians who performed with exceptional courage that day. The following week, if more testimony is waiting, the hearing will resume.","A military hearing is underway at Fort Hood for the suspect in last year's shootings on the base .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Indian authorities Tuesday slapped a curfew on Srinagar and other towns after the arrest of a major separatist leader in an attempt to stave off violence that has killed over 100 people in the last four months. Masarat Alam Bhat, the general secretary of the hard-line All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) group and a close aide of the octogenarian separatist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, was arrested Monday evening in a Srinagar suburb. Bhat has been evading arrest since June when he launched the so-called ""Quit Kashmir campaign"" which set off a sequence of shutdowns, protests, marches and curfews that have virtually brought life in Indian administered Kashmir to a standstill for over four months. The accompanying clashes between pro-independence protesters and Indian security forces have left 108 dead and hundreds others wounded, some of them crippled for life. ""We arrested him yesterday evening,"" said police officer Muzaffar Ahmad. Bhat was immediately taken to an undisclosed location in Srinagar for questioning. Authorities described Bhat's arrest as ""a major success."" The hard-line separatist leader, Syed Ali Shah Geelani, reacting to Bhat's arrest said, ""Arrests and detentions are part and parcel of the freedom movement. The arrest is painful but the struggle will continue."" Fearing trouble in the wake of his arrest, authorities imposed a curfew in Srinagar and other major north Kashmir towns and deployed police and paramilitary forces to prevent violence, according police. The mountainous Kashmir region is divided among Pakistan, China and India. In the past, India has poured thousands of security forces into its part of Kashmir to fight what India called a Pakistan-inspired insurgency. However, since the defeat of the insurgency, Indian forces have found themselves fighting Kashmiris who say they have suffered oppression and want independence from Hindu-dominated India.","Bhat launched pro-independence protests .
